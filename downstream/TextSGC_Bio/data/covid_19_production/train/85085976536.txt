Results: We have summarized the most feasible strategies for the management of diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, primary adrenal insufficiency (including congenital adrenal hyperplasia), Cushing's syndrome, pituitary tumors, osteoporosis, primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism amid the constraints laid down by the raging pandemic. In general, medical management should be encouraged and surgical interventions should be deferred whenever possible. Ongoing medications should be continued. Sick-day rules should be sincerely adhered to. Regular contact with physicians can be maintained through teleconsultations and virtual clinics. Conclusions: Considering the burden of endocrine disorders in the general population, their management needs to be prioritized amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
