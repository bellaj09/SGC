covid-19 between global human security and ramping authoritarian nationalisms covid-19 entre seguran√ßa humana global e incremento do nacionalismo autorit√°rio covid-19 entre la seguridad humana global y el aumento de los nacionalismos autoritarios. ¬© 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.Like other transnational threats such as climate change, the extinction of biological species, SARS or Ebola, the current COVID-19 confronts the modern utopia of rigid borders between nations and contemporary finance-led neoliberal economic models. Acknowledging the complexity of COVID-19's root causes, this paper builds on the contradictions between science, expertise and policy in the definition of global human security, and sketches five possible future international scenarios. I argue that in the aftermath of the pandemic any sort of future global, regional and state regulation will need to consider transnational threats not only to ensure the security of individuals, but also to guarantee the long-standing durability of the biosphere as a life-supporting system. To uphold this argument, I develop three sections: (i) the nature of the threat; (ii) the geopolitical tensions that COVID-19 heightens; and (iii) possible future scenarios.
