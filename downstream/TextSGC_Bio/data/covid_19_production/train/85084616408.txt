a survey of sars-cov-2 preparedness among hospitals in idaho. ¬© 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2, has been implicated in the largest recorded CoV outbreak to date.Initially the majority of COVID-19 cases were in China, but the virus has spread to more than 184 countries worldwide with the United States currently having more cases than any other country.OBJECTIVEWith person-to-person spread expanding in the United States, this study aims to describe hospital preparedness for managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.DESIGNCross-sectional survey focused on various elements of respiratory disease preparednessSETTINGCritical access hospital (CAHs) and acute care hospitals (ACHs) in IdahoMETHODSThe electronic survey was sent to infection preventionists (IPs) and nurse administrators in 44 hospitals in IdahoRESULTSIn all, 32 (73%) hospitals responded to the survey. Participating facilities reported their preparedness with respect to existing, formalized structures for managing infectious disease incidents-specifically COVID-19- A s well as availability of resources, such as isolation rooms and personal protective equipment, for safely managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases.CONCLUSIONSHospitals covered by the survey have varying levels of preparedness for managing COVID-19 cases, with differences across the various categories of interest in this study. While the study reveals strengths, including in application of emergency management and infection control frameworks, it also suggests that other areas, such as consistent implementation of federal guidelines and requirements for infection prevention, are potential areas for strengthening preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential.
