covid-19 pandemic and surgical oncology: preserving the academic mission. ¬© 2020, Society of Surgical Oncology.Background: The global pandemic of respiratory disease cause by the novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused untold suffering, loss of life and upheaval in society. The pandemic has lead to massive redirection of health care resources to treat the surge of COVID-19 patients, and enforcement of social distancing to reduce the rate of transmission. Methods: Editorial Board members provided observations of the implications of the pandemic on academic surgical oncology. Results: Delivery of health care to other populations including cancer patients has been significantly disrupted. The implications both short term and long term threaten preservation of the academic mission in medicine at large, and certainly in the field of surgical oncology. Conclusions: The effects on surgical oncology training, research and clinical trials are major.
