chest computed tomography in children with covid-19 respiratory infection. ¬© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Background: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective: To describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. Materials and methods: We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. Results: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. Conclusion: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.
