covid-19 pandemic and cardiac electrophysiology: guidance protocol from a uk tertiary cardiac centre. Since December 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2160000 positive cases and more than 145000 deaths until 18 April 2020. The pressure to the health services worldwide has been unprecedented.The redeployment of staff and resources to treat more efficiently COVID-19 cases along with the need to reduce disease transmission has affected the field of electrophysiology among many others.Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the people who need them while at the same time infection control and prevention are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of resources.We aim to providea guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology procedures derived fromour Tertiary Cardiac Centre duringthe current COVID-19 pandemic.
