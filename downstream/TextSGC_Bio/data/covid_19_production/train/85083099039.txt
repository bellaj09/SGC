coalition: advocacy for prospective clinical trials to test the post-exposure potential of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19. ¬© 2020Our coalition of public health experts, doctors, and scientists worldwide want to draw attention to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a post-exposure drug for exposed people. In the absence of an approved, recognized effective pre or post-exposure prophylactic drug or vaccine for COVID-19, nor of any approved and validated therapeutic drug, coupled with social and political pressure raised by publicity both regarding the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as well as potential risks from HCQ, we urge the immediate proper clinical trials. Specifically, we mean using HCQ for post-exposure of people with close contact with patients with positive COVID19 rtPCR, including home and medical caregivers. We have reviewed the mechanisms of antiviral effect of HCQ, the risk-benefit ratio taking into consideration the PK/PD of HCQ and the thresholds of efficacy. We have studied its use as an antimalarial, an antiviral, and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at doses matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous, which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight (2,3), at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/ day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people.
