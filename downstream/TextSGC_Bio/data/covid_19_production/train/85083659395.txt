cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increased disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19): a pooled analysis of published literature. ¬© 2020 World Stroke Organization.Introduction: There is an urgent need to identify patients at high risk during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether a history of stroke is associated with increased severity of disease or mortality is unknown. Method: We pooled studies from published literature to assess the association of a history of stroke with outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Results: A pooled analysis of 4 studies showed a ‚àº2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19. While a trend was observed, there was no statistically significant association of stroke with mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Discussion: Our findings are limited by a small number of studies and sample size. Conclusion: There is a ‚àº2.5-fold increase in odds of severe COVID-19 illness with a history of cerebrovascular disease.
