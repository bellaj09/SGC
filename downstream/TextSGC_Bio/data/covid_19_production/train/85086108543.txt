the covid-19 pandemic beyond health sciences: reflections on its social determination a pandemia de covid-19 para al√©m das ci√™ncias da sa√∫de: reflex√µes sobre sua determina√ß√£o social. ¬© 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva. All rights reserved.This paper aims to perform a theoretical reflection on the historical-social founda-tions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ‚Äúcapital worldization‚Äù, ‚Äúcapital-imperialism‚Äù, ‚Äúspace-time compression‚Äù, and ‚Äústructural crisis of cap-ital‚Äù categories are conjured from the historical materialistic-theoretical matrix, outlining a course that transcends the limits of Health Sciences to understand global health, of which the COVID-19 pandemic is an expression. We then return to the field of health, when the category of ‚Äúsocial determination of health‚Äù allows elu-cidating the bases of the pandemic studied. We show that, other elements typical of the current phase of contemporary capitalism have become universal besides the SARS-CoV-2 characteristics or the dynamics of the rapid movement of people and objects around the world, unifying the health social determination process.
