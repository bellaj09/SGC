doctoring in the time of covid-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.I have always known that I have exceptional residents. I have had the privilege of working with the emergency medicine (EM) residents at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit since 2015, first as their Associate Program Director and now as their Vice Chair of Education. Detroit is a tough city and of the four academic emergency departments (EDs) in Detroit, of which I have worked at three, Sinai-Grace is arguably the toughest. Underlying general health in the communities surrounding Sinai-Grace is poor, access to primary healthcare is difficult, violence is high. The average life expectancy in some of the neighborhoods surrounding Sinai-Grace is sixteen years less than the state average for Michigan.1 You don‚Äôt choose to do a residency at Sinai-Grace if you‚Äôre looking for a cakewalk. Our residents knowingly sign up for a difficult residency that will make them exceptional attending physicians.
