pediatric otolaryngology divisional and institutional preparatory response at seattle children‚Äôs hospital after covid-19 regional exposure. ¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus resulting in high mortality in the adult population but low mortality in the pediatric population. The role children and adolescents play in COVID-19 transmission is unclear, and it is possible that healthy pediatric patients serve as a reservoir for the virus. This article serves as a summary of a single pediatric institution‚Äôs response to COVID-19 with the goal of protecting both patients and health care providers while providing ongoing care to critically ill patients who require urgent interventions. A significant limitation of this commentary is that it reflects a single institution‚Äôs joint effort at a moment in time but does not take into consideration future circumstances that could change practice patterns. We still hope dissemination of our overall response at this moment, approximately 8 weeks after our region‚Äôs first adult case, may benefit other pediatric institutions preparing for COVID-19.
