how to conduct an outpatient telemedicine rehabilitation or prehabilitation visit. ¬© 2020 American Academy of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationThe novel coronavirus pandemic is resulting in an accelerated conversion of in-person physician visits to virtual visits. As barriers to adoption of telemedicine are rapidly decreasing, it is important to recognize the need for practical and immediately deployable information that can improve doctor-patient interactions, facilitate accurate documentation, and increase confidence in the transition to virtual visits. In this article we aim to outline the components of an outpatient telemedicine visit for physiatrists, with a particular focus on an adapted virtual physical examination. Uses of telemedicine may include future large scale concerns such as natural disasters or climate change. We describe a general approach to the visit, review definitions of terms commonly used in telemedicine, and offer tips for optimizing the encounter.
