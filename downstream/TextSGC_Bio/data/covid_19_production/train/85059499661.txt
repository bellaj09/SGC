automatically fixing errors in glycoprotein structures with rosetta. ¬© 2018 Elsevier LtdRecent advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have resulted in determination of an increasing number of protein structures with resolved glycans. However, existing protocols for the refinement of glycoproteins at low resolution have failed to keep up with these advances. As a result, numerous deposited structures contain glycan stereochemical errors. Here, we describe a Rosetta-based approach for both cryoEM and X-ray crystallography refinement of glycoproteins that is capable of correcting conformational and configurational errors in carbohydrates. Building upon a previous Rosetta framework, we introduced additional features and score terms enabling automatic detection, setup, and refinement of glycan-containing structures. We benchmarked this approach using 12 crystal structures and showed that glycan geometries can be automatically improved while maintaining good fit to the crystallographic data. Finally, we used this method to refine carbohydrates of the human coronavirus NL63 spike glycoprotein and of an HIV envelope glycoprotein, demonstrating its usefulness for cryoEM refinement.¬© 2018 Elsevier LtdFrenz et al. have developed a new method for refinement of glycoprotein structures against low-resolution cryoEM and X-ray crystallography data. This new method is able to make significantly larger changes to the glycan geometry compared with previous methods, including the ability to changing the glycan's anomer.
