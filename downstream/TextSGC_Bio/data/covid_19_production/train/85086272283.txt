resurgent natures? more-than-human perspectives on covid-19. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.Stories of nature‚Äôs resurgence during quarantine have been dangerously conflated with an alarming narrative contending ‚ÄòEarth is healing, we are the virus‚Äô.

Such fetishisations distract from the need for urgent environmental action and obscure what resurgence actually is: a multispecies endeavour requiring cultivation and nurture.
