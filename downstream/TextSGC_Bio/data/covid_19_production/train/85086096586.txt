hydroxychloroquine: a relatively obscure antimalarial takes centre stage in covid-19. ¬© 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an old antimalarial known for its use to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, it has been shown to be useful in COVID-19 treatment, although its efficacy is being debated and the data from large-scale clinical trials are yet to be available. Overall, it appears that HCQ-Azithromycin-Remdesevir may be a viable treatment option on a case to case basis. There is also a case to evaluate curcumin as an adjunct food supplement to prevent and treat COVID-19.
