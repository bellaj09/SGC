impact of covid-19 on mental health in a low and middle-income country impacto do covid-19 na sa√∫de mental em um pa√≠s de baixa e m√©dia renda. ¬© 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva. All rights reserved.Mental disorders (MD) are common-ly comorbid with cardiovascular, metabolic, and some infectious diseases. Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhe-sion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings. This is an overview on the expect-ed influence of the COVID-19 on mental health from a research group that has not long ago been involved in the Zika epidemic. It aims to discuss the effects of the pandemic on a Low and Mid-dle-Income country (LMIC), Brazil.
