design and screening of ppar-Œ≥ agonist based isatin derivatives and its remarkable activity as anti-cancer and anti-diabetic. ¬© RJPT All right reserved.Isatin are flexible compound, where it can be used for the preparation of a large number of substituted heterocyclic compounds, such as pyrazole, benzofuran, pyridazinone and sulphonamides. Sulphonamides is important class such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, antibacterial, antitumor, diuretic, hypo-glycemic, antidiabetic and anti-thyroid. In the past few decades, research has reached to the mark with an increased interest in capturing novel methodologies and targets that forcefully worked for the preparation isatin based sulphonamides derivatives. This review covers updated information of most of the active isatin based sulphonamides derivatives that have been shown considerable novel synthetic schemes as well as pharmacological and biological actions by targeting them on PPAR-Œ≥ agonist. From these considerations, ideas for future molecular modifications by different synthetic scheme leading to preparation of compounds with greater favorable pharmacological and biological properties may be derived.
