a blueprint for recovery for the postcoronavirus (covid-19) world. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is changing society. In the last several weeks, infections and deaths have accumulated, even as we attempt to ‚Äòshelter in place‚Äô and stay ‚Äòhealthy at home‚Äô. This unprecedented time has influenced behavior and permitted much contemplation, gratitude and prayer. Our thoughts during this time have focused on our emergence from the pandemic and what reopening may look like in the post-coronavirus world. Reopening will benefit from the acronym ‚ÄúRPM‚Äù, an acronym I (CSM) teach my students for management of dental patients who suffer from a variety of illnesses and infections. Here, the ‚ÄòR‚Äù stands for risk assessment and reduction, the first step in the sequence. The ‚ÄòP‚Äô stands for prevention, and ‚ÄòM‚Äô stands for manage the problem. If ‚ÄòR‚Äô and ‚ÄòP‚Äô are well conceived and implemented, often there is no need to apply ‚ÄòM‚Äô.
