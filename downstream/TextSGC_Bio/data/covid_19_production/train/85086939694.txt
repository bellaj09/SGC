tending the grapevine: a qualitative analysis of responses to a psychotherapist-in-training testing positive for covid-19. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Very little published research explores responses of universities to their trainees during a crisis or emergency. We used a qualitative approach to gather information regarding a university‚Äôs first counseling psychology doctoral trainee with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Six participants (two administrators, four trainees) responded to a series of critical-incident questions to identify helpful and hindering responses, as well as a wish list of items that would have been helpful to have at the time of the event. From thematic analysis emerged 34 themes, six broader categories, and many helpful, hindering, and wish-list items. The broader categories were health anxiety, emotional responses, stigma, support, rules/guidelines, and systems responses. Perhaps the most striking finding, which occurred across most participants and several categories, was participants‚Äô complex and contradictory experiences and responses, suggesting that the precipitating event of a trainee testing positive for COVID-19 activated a great deal of conflicted motivation. This research provides the benefit of experience for other university trainees and training sites regarding a little-understood crisis event. Implications for best practices are discussed.
