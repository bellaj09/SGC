consider tlr5 for new therapeutic development against covid-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.TLR5, a member of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has a significant role to recognize the flagellin or same kind of molecule. After reorganization, it can modulate innate immune responses. In this article, we urge for the development of new therapeutic molecule by targeting TLR5 modulation against SARS-CoV-2.
