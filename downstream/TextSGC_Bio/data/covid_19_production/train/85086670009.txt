psychological impact of anti-asian stigma due to the covid-19 pandemic: a call for research, practice, and policy responses. ¬© 2020 American Psychological Association.The COVID-19 pandemic is linked to a rise in stigma and discrimination against Chinese and other Asians, which is likely to have a negative impact on mental health, especially when combined with additional outbreak-related stressors. We discuss the need to consider the potential harms of these anti-Asian sentiments during both the height of the pandemic and longer-term recovery through (a) research-examining how it affects mental health and recovery; (b) practice-implementing evidencebased stigma reduction initiatives; and (c) policy-coordinating federal response to anti-Asian racism including investment in mental health services and community-based efforts.
