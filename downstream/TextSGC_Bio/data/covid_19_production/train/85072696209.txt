In contrast, the epidemiology of Œ¥-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of Œ¥- and Œ≥-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for Œ≥- and Œ¥-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were Œ≥-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for Œ¥-CoV (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, Œ≥-CoVs are more prevalent than Œ¥-CoVs in the US, suggesting that Œ¥-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. This may indicate Œ¥-CoV emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene revealed that the newly identified Œ¥-CoV strains were most closely related to the HKU20 (wigeon) strain. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird Œ¥-CoVs in the epidemiology of Œ¥-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds.
