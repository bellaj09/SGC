responding to covid-19: what‚Äôs the problem. ¬© 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.This commentary argues that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic should be considered as a transdisciplinary societal challenge that requires coordinated systemic thinking and actions in the context of uncertainty. Responses to the propagation of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the health, economic and social impacts of Covid-19 are complex, emergent and unpredictable. We describe the virtuous relations between three prerequisite conditions‚Äîmultilevel governance, knowledge and types of resources and individual and collective behaviours‚Äîthat should be combined in transdisciplinary responses.
