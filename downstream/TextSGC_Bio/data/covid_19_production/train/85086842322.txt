incarceration and pandemic-related restrictions during covid-19: an empathic understanding of two worlds. ¬© 2020 American Psychological Association.This paper explores parallels between experiences of confinement due to pandemic-related restrictions and confinement as a result of legal incarceration. We compare experiences of social isolation, lack of choice, and reduced access to resources while also acknowledging the existence of significant differences between the two situations. We describe the ways in which experiences of confinement as part of COVID-19 regulations can provide the general public with insight into difficulties associated with incarceration and the negative effect it can have on psychological health.
