identification and formation mechanism of a novel noncoding rna produced by avian infectious bronchitis virus. ¬© 2018Viral noncoding (nc) RNAs have been shown to play important roles in viral life cycle. Many viruses employ different mechanism to produce ncRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces a novel ncRNA in virus-infected cells. This ncRNA consists of 563 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail, is mainly derived from the 3‚Ä≤-untranslated region of IBV genome, and contains a 63-nt-long of terminal leader sequence derived from the 5‚Ä≤ end of the viral genome. Using mutagenesis and reverse genetics, we reveal that this ncRNA is a subgenomic RNA generated by discontinuous transcription mechanism.
