indirect virus transmission in cluster of covid-19 cases, wenzhou, china, 2020. ¬© 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All rights reserved.To determine possible modes of virus transmission, we investigated a cluster of coronavirus disease cases associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China. Data indicated that indirect transmission of the causative virus occurred, perhaps resulting from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons.
