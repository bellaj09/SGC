sars-cov-2 infection and obesity: common inflammatory and metabolic aspects. ¬© 2020 Diabetes IndiaBackround and aims: According to the World Obesity Federation, ‚Äúobesity-related conditions seem to worsen the effect of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2)‚Äù; additionally the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported that ‚Äúpeople with heart disease and diabetes are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications and that severe obesity poses a higher risk for severe illness‚Äù. Recent reports have shown elevated levels of cytokines due to increased inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease. On the other hand, obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly excreted by adipose tissue. In this concise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Pubmed search on obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: We present ‚Äúmechanistic‚Äù obesity-related problems that aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory/metabolic links between these diseases. Conclusion: Obesity and SARS-CoV-2 share common elements of the inflammatory process (and possibly also metabolic disturbances), exacerbating SARS-CoV-2 infection in the obese.
