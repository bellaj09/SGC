health information professionals: delivering core services and value in extraordinary times. ¬© 2020 Health Libraries GroupThe 2020 virtual issue of the Health Information and Libraries Journal (HILJ) is published to link to the CILIP Health Libraries Group Conference which was to take place in Scotland 22‚Äì25th July. Whilst the conference was postponed in light of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, its themes of (i) Working in Partnership; (ii) Resilience and Well-being; (iii) Public and Patient involvement; (iv) Quality Impact and Metrics; and (v) Improvement and Innovation have nevertheless provided the basis on which to compile this virtual issue. Overarching these themes is a core value of the HIL profession, to provide relevant, timely and sustainable information services, and the articles selected from HILJ (2018 through to March 2020) contribute to the aim of meeting and going beyond these goals under the conference banner of ‚Äònot your average day in the office‚Äô. The virtual issue mirrors the format of a regular issue of HILJ, a review article, four original articles and three from our regular features: ‚ÄòDissertations into Practice‚Äô, ‚ÄòInternational Perspectives and Initiatives‚Äô and ‚ÄòTeaching and Learning in Action‚Äô. The authors come from Canada, China, Croatia, Sweden and the UK. All articles included in this issue are available online.
