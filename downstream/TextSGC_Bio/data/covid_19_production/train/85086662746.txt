phylogenetic analysis of partial transmembrane protein gene of canine coronaviruses detected in turkey t√ºrkiye'de saptanan canine coronaviruslarƒ±n parsiyel transmembran protein geninin filogenetik analizi. ¬© 2020, Chartered Inst. of Building Services Engineers. All rights reserved.Canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), a member of the family Coronaviridae, are the causative agents of acute gastroenteritis and are genetically divided into two groups, CCoV type I and CCoV type II. The aim of this study was to detect and characterize CCoV strains in fecal samples from six dogs exhibited gastrointestinal system symptoms. To determine the presence of the CCoV RNA, samples were tested by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting the partial M gene and then sequenced. Among six samples tested, two were found positive for CCoV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by Maximum-Likelihood (ML) method and revealed that one of the obtained field sequences was classified into CCoV-I genotype; and the other positive sample grouped in CCoV-II genotype. Both genogroups demonstrated broad genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences shows that our CCoV field strains was closely related to Italy and Brazil strains and placed on different genogroup clades in the CCoV cluster. Sequence comparison of the partial M gene revealed nucleotide identity of 71‚Äì100% and 68‚Äì100% similarity among the 25 coronavirus strains. TR/Ccv2 (MK636864) and TR/Ccv6 (MK636865) obtained in this study demonstrated 78.5-97.5% and 71‚Äì99% nucleotide identity with other CCoV strains around the world respectively. The results of the study demonstrate, CCoV strains from different genogroups are circulating in Turkey and this is a report on the phylogenetic analysis of a CCoV in Turkey, which there is limited information.
