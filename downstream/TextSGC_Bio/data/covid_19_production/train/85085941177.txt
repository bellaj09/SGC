mitigating the impact of covid-19 on oncology: clinical and operational lessons from a prospective radiation oncology cohort tested for covid-19. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Background and purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic warrants operational initiatives to minimize transmission, particularly among cancer patients who are thought to be at high-risk. Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures, and quarantines. Materials and methods: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020‚Äì04/22/2020). Results: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (4 warranting intensive care), and 2 died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1‚Äì4) to ‚â§1-day (P < 0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75‚Äì5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1‚Äì2) [P < 0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3‚Äì6.5) through prolonged close contact. During this timeframe, 39 care-team members were quarantined for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2‚Äì11), with a peak of 17 employees simultaneously quarantined. Following implementation of a ‚Äúdual PPE policy,‚Äù newly quarantined employees decreased from 2.9 to 0.5 per day. Conclusion: The severe adverse events noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are vulnerable to COVID-19. Active tracking, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive source control can mitigate the adverse effects on treatment delays, workforce incapacitation, and ideally outcomes.
