visualizing covid-19 pandemic risk through network connectedness. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)With the domestic and international spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), much attention has been given to estimating pandemic risk. We propose the novel application of a well-established scientific approach ‚Äì the network analysis ‚Äì to provide a direct visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic risk; infographics are provided in the figures. By showing visually the degree of connectedness between different regions based on reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, we demonstrate that network analysis provides a relatively simple yet powerful way to estimate the pandemic risk.
