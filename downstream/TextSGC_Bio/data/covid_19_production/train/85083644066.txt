clinical and dynamic computed tomography features of 24 patients with coronavirus disease 2019. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.Purpose: To explore the clinical and dynamic computed tomography features of coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: We enrolled 24 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 treated at a regional center in Dezhou, China, from January 22 to February 5, 2020, and analyzed data retrospectively. Results: Nineteen cases had close contact with people with coronavirus disease 2019, and five patients denied a travel history in Wuhan City or contact with patients having coronavirus disease 2019. Symptoms were fever, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle pain. Chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities distributed along peribronchial bundles and subpleural areas, often accompanied by bronchiectasis, vascular thickening, and interlobular septal thickening after coronavirus disease 2019 progression. Conclusions: Coronavirus disease 2019 has certain clinical characteristics and typical computed tomography features.
