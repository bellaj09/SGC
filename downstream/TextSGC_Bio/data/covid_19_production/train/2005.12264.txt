the short-term seasonal analyses between atmospheric environment and covid-19 in epidemic areas of cities in australia, south korea, and italy. The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on health has been widely concerned. Disease risk assessment, prediction, and early warning have become a significant research field. Previous research suggests that there is a relationship between air quality and the disease. This paper investigated the impact of the atmospheric environment on the basic reproduction number (R0) in Australia, South Korea, and Italy by using atmospheric environment data, confirmed case data, and the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) model based on Quasi-Poisson regression. The results show that the air temperature and humidity have lag and persistence on short-term R0, and seasonal factors have an apparent decorating effect on R0. PM10 is the primary pollutant that affects the excess morbidity rate. Moreover, O3, PM2.5, and SO2 as perturbation factors have an apparent cumulative effect. These results present beneficial knowledge for correlation between environment and COVID-19, which guiding prospective analyses of disease data.
