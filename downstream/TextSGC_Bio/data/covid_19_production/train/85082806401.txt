base protocol for real time active random surveillance of coronavirus disease (covid-19) ‚Äì adapting veterinary methodology to public health. ¬© 2020 The AuthorsThe pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone.

Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively.
