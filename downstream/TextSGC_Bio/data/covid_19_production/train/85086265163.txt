response to ‚Äúcomments on "homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross-species transmission from snake to human‚Äù and ‚Äúcodon bias analysis alone is uninformative for identifying host(s) of new virus‚Äù. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.We have recently reported for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 maybe a bat-originated coronavirus with a recombination occurred within the spike (S) protein gene based on phylogenetic and simplot analyses1. These two conclusions are supported by findings recently reported by others and are well accepted in the field of SARS-CoV-2 research2-4. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
