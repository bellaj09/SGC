in the wake of covid-19, is glocalization our sustainability future. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The coronavirus pandemic provides opportunities for a new kind of a glocalization, in which people live far more local lives than in recent decades but with greater global awareness through a connective world brain. The neoliberal version of globalization has spurred environmental devastation, economic inequality, and excessive global travel. A new glocalization should advance in tandem with reduced air travel, local production, smart growth, and greatly reduced automobile trips, among other measures. Adapted locally but with a globally cooperative ethic, these measures may be the best way to simultaneously alleviate the rapidly moving pandemic crisis and the slower moving environmental crisis.
