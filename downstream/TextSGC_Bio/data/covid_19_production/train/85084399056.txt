thoracic radiation therapy during coronavirus disease 2019: provisional guidelines from a comprehensive cancer center within a pandemic epicenter. ¬© 2020 The AuthorsCoronavirus disease 2019 is an unprecedented pandemic with significant and evolving impact on the practice of radiation oncology. Radiation oncology departments must anticipate and account for coronavirus disease 2019 exposure risk for both patients and staff. The potential for severe radiation therapy resource constraints, particularly due to staff illness, must also be considered. Here we present provisional guidelines for thoracic radiation therapy adopted at our facility, a high-volume cancer center located in a United States pandemic epicenter. Generally, these guidelines reflect the principle that where evidence-supported hypofractionated schedules with comparable efficacy and toxicity exist, the shortest such schedules should be employed. In addition, we discuss potential adaptations in the prioritization and timing of radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies under these circumstances.
