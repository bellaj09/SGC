differential diagnosis of illness in patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2), italy, february 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.
