All rights reserved.An exponential growth model was fitted to critical care admissions from two surveillance databases to determine likely coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case numbers, critical care admissions and epidemic growth in the United Kingdom before the national lockdown. We estimate, on 23 March, a median of 114,000 (95% credible interval (CrI): 78,000‚Äì173,000) new cases and 258 (95% CrI: 220‚Äì319) new critical care reports, with 527,000 (95% CrI: 362,000‚Äì797,000) cumulative cases since 16 February.
