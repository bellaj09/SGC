a post-covid future: tourism community re-imagined and enabled. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The urgent demands of the present necessitate an interrogation‚Äìa re-exploration and a re-envisioning of the future of tourism‚Äìof what has to change (and remain constant). Despite the crippling effects of COVID-19, new forms of solidarity are emerging that challenge the prevailing competitiveness ethic. While a transactional economic revival has to remain a top priority, progress will advance, so long as tourism becomes more transformational and transcendent. Discoveries of new methodologies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and versions of a Green New Deal, for example, are generating interest, notably ‚Äòmass flourishing‚Äô introduced in ‚Äòanti-fragile‚Äô ways. Utilizing a ‚Äòfuture-back‚Äô paradigm that demands deep-dive assessments and articulation of purpose, the gaps between ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat could or should be‚Äô are bound to close. Such undertakings represent a ‚Äòcoming together‚Äô of all stakeholders, a role that academicians are urged to embrace, especially through action research, curriculum change and creation of ‚Äòdaring classrooms‚Äô.
