type i and type iii interferons ‚Äì induction, signaling, evasion, and application to combat covid-19. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Without approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines to this ongoing global threat, type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are currently being evaluated for their efficacy. Both the role of IFNs and the use of recombinant IFNs in two related, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been controversial in terms of their protective effects in the host. In this review, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of both type I and type III IFN-mediated innate antiviral responses against human coronaviruses and discuss the potential use of IFNs as a treatment strategy for COVID-19. Type I and type III interferons are potent antiviral cytokines with non-redundant functions. Park and Iwasaki review the protective versus pathogenic roles of type I and type III interferons in highly pathogenic coronavirus infections and discuss the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of these interferons in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
