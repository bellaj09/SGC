rent and crisis: old housing problems require a new state of exception in australia. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.The coronavirus pandemic is opening up a space for housing advocates and scholars to push for reforms to the private rental sector.

Temporary reform will not lead to a new or more socially just housing system in the long-term‚Äîa new housing normal‚Äîwithout a significant and nation-wide tenant campaign. Like others, we are working together on campaigns such as this, but we are conscious that the government is likely to revert back to their old housing habits.
