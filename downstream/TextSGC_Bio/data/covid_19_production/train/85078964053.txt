pattern of early human-to-human transmission of wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), december 2019 to january 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia. We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4 3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.
