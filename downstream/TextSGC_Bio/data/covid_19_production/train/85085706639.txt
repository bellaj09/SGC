teledermatology for covid-19 cutaneous lesions: substitute or supplement. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, teledermatology is being favored over in-person consultation in order to avoid the possibility of virus transmission1. In France, COVID-19 wasn't known to cause cutaneous manifestations before April 6th 2020, when an alert about possible associated skin symptoms was raised to the general public and the professional social network2‚Äì4. We aimed to assess the impact of alerting about COVID-associated lesions on the activity of urgent teledermatology (TD) and the activity of dermatologic emergencies unit (DEU) of two university hospitals during this pandemic.
