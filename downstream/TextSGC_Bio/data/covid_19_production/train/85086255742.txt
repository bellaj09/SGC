opening up while locking down: how an irish independent sector mental health service is responding to the covid-19 crisis. ¬© College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic poses a particular of set of challenges for health services. Some of these are common across all services (strategies to minimise infections; timely testing for patients and staff; sourcing appropriate PPE, etc.) and some are specific to mental health services (how to access general medical services quickly; how to safely deliver a service that traditionally depends on intensive face to face contact; how to isolate someone who does not wish to do so; how to source sufficient PPE in the face of competing demands for such equipment). This paper describes how St Patrick's Mental Health Services (SPMHS) chose to address this unfolding and ever-changing crisis, how it developed its strategy early based on a clear set of objectives and how it adapted (and continues to adapt) to the constantly evolving COVID-19 landscape.
