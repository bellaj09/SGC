epidemiologic characteristics of traumatic fractures in elderly patients during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in china. ¬© 2020, SICOT aisbl.Purpose: This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of fracture in the elderly during the COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients‚Äô demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. Results: A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70‚Äì74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453). Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453). Conclusion: These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrative department during the global pandemic of COVID-19.
