personalized recovery of severe covid19: rehabilitation from the perspective of patient needs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.After long term hospitalization or ICU treatment, COVID-19 patients are severe functionally impaired. They experience not only physical weakness but may also suffer from problems on the pulmonary, physical, psychosocial and cognitive domain. These domains interact and the impact on participation varies between patients. Therefore aftercare should be costumized to the patients individual needs. In this article we present a patient centered model to tailor treatment in the view of the Dutch health care system. This model can be helpful to determine the appropriate treatment for each patient at the right time in the right setting.
