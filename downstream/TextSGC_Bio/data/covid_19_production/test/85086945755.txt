interdependent citizens: the ethics of care in pandemic recovery. ¬© 2020 The Hastings CenterThe crisis of Covid-19 has forced us to notice two things: our human interdependence and American society's tolerance for what Nancy Krieger has called ‚Äúinequalities embodied in health inequities,‚Äù reflected in data on Covid-19 mortality and geographies. Care is integral to our recovery from this catastrophe and to the development of sustainable public health policies and practices that promote societal resilience and reduce the vulnerabilities of our citizens. Drawing on the insights of Joan Tronto and Eva Feder Kittay, we argue that the ethics of care offers a critical alternative to utilitarian and deontological approaches and provides a street-ready framework for integration into public health deliberations to anchor public policy and investments concerning the recovery and future well-being of America's citizens and society.
