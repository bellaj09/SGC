personal protective equipment (ppe) for both anesthesiologists and other airway managers: principles and practice during the covid-19 pandemic √©quipements de protection individuelle (epi) pour anesth√©siologistes et autre personnel en charge des voies a√©riennes: principes et pratiques pendant la pand√©mie de covid-19. ¬© 2020, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.Healthcare providers are facing a coronavirus disease pandemic. This pandemic may last for many months, stressing the Canadian healthcare system in a way that has not previously been seen. Keeping healthcare providers safe, healthy, and available to work throughout this pandemic is critical. The consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) will help assure its availability and healthcare provider safety. The purpose of this communique is to give both anesthesiologists and other front-line healthcare providers a framework from which to understand the principles and practices surrounding PPE decision-making. We propose three types of PPE including: 1) PPE for droplet and contact precautions, 2) PPE for general airborne, droplet, and contact precautions, and 3) PPE for those performing or assisting with high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures.
