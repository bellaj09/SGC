Published by BMJ.Background Facing the social panic and substantial shortage of medical resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, providing psychological first-aid to inpatients is essential for their rehabilitation and the orderly operating of medical systems. However, the closed-ward environment and extreme shortage of onsite mental health workers have limited the use of traditional face-to-face diagnosis and psychological interventions. Aim To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. Methods In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the 'first-aid' to all patients. Conclusion This integrated onsite and online approach was effective and efficient in providing psychological interventions for inpatients during the crisis. Our model provides a realistic scheme for healthcare systems in or after the COVID-19 epidemic and also could be adopted in areas of the world with insufficient mental healthcare resources.
