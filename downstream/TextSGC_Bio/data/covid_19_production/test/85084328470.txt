All rights reserved.Using data on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases inGermany from the Robert Koch Institute, we found a relative increase with time in the prevalence in 15‚Äì34 year-olds (particularly 20‚Äì24-year-olds) compared with 35‚Äì49- and 10‚Äì14-year-olds (we excluded older and younger ages because of different healthcare seeking behaviour). This suggests an elevated role for that age group in propagating the epidemic following the introduction of physical distancing measures.
