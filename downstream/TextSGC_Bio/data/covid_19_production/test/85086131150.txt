inanimate surfaces as potential source of 2019-ncov spread and their disinfection with biocidal agents. ¬© 2020, Indian Virological Society.The WHO has declared COVID-19 illness a global health concern which is caused by 2019-nCoV, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Transmissibility among individual to individual have been reported through droplets and probably also via contaminated surfaces and hands.Human coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, glass, fibers and metals up to nine days. 2019-nCoV remains infectious in air for 3 h and on inanimate surfaces such as cardboard, copper, plastic and steel up to 24, 4, 72 and 48 h respectively. Disinfectant activity of various biocidal agents against coronaviruses like ethanol (62‚Äì71%), sodium hypochlorite (0.1%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) can be regarded effective against 2019-nCoV as well. As no vaccine and antiviral therapies have been discovered for 2019-nCoV, prevention of further spread will viable option to control the ongoing and future outbreaks.
