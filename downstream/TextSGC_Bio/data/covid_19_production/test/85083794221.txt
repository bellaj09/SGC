All rights reserved.Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread in India is steeply rising. A 21-day lockdown has been imposed by the Government of India, to curtail its spread. This has impacted all walks of life, including availability of food and nutrition related services which would affect nutritional status of children throughout India. The two major schemes, i.e. Integrated Child Development Services Scheme and Mid-day Meal Scheme have been affected leading to risk of worsening of child nutrition. Some states have evolved their own strategies to mitigate the effect of lockdown. Here we discuss the challenges and way forward for ensuring availability of food for child nutrition during this health crisis. No single, optimal response to a public health emergency exists. The government and non-government partners must coordinate and scale up child nutrition services in the community through strengthening of public distribution system and home delivery of food parcels wherever feasible for beneficiaries of child nutrition programs.
