It points towards the urgent need of strengthening our public health infrastructure. This should be started with recruitment of competent epidemiologists on priority at district, state and country level. We should make use of full potential of members of IPHA and IAPSM mainly by providing data and help in policy making. This would help in developing capacity for timely action in best interest of our population for any threat of outbreak, epidemic or pandemic in current scenario and in future.
