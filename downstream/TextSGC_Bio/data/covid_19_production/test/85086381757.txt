covid-19 pandemic in japan: containment failed or successful? a pandemia da covid-19 no jap√£o: conten√ß√£o fracassada ou bemsucedida? la pandemia de covid-19 en jap√≥n: ¬øcontenci√≥n fallida o exitosa. ¬© 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.This short article examines key governmental measures against the spread of COVID-19 in Japan from a geopolitical perspective. ‚ÄúGeopolitical‚Äù in this article means to see the measures as spatial strategies. At the stage of globalized pandemic, state territoriality or border control is no longer able to effectively control the spread of the virus. Instead, this article argues, multi-scalar intergovernmental coordination is inevitable to tackle the virus moving along increasing trans-border/local human flows. Using the case of Japan, this article overviews how effective social distancing as a spatial strategy has been and illustrates how the limits to such a strategy to control human behavior can affect anti-virus measures. In conclusion, this article argues that the effective devolution of state power to local governments and the strengthening of state supplementary function to sustain local healthcare system and economy would be more desirable than the authoritative concentration of state power in the state of emergency.
