surgical decision-making and prioritization for cancer patients at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic: a multidisciplinary approach. ¬© 2020 Elsevier LtdIn the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governmental agencies, state medical boards, and healthcare organizations have called for restricting ‚Äúelective‚Äù operations to mitigate the risk of transmission of the virus amongst patients and healthcare providers and to preserve essential resources for potential regional surges of COVID patients. While the fear of delaying surgical care for many of our patients is deeply challenging for us as cancer care providers, we must balance our personal commitment to providing timely and appropriate oncologic care to our cancer patients with our societal responsibility to protect our patients (including those on whom we are operating), co-workers, trainees, families, and community, from undue risks of contracting and propagating COVID-19. Herein, we present guidelines for surgical decision-making and case prioritization developed among all adult disease specialties in the MD Anderson Cancer Center Departments of Surgical Oncology and Breast Surgical Oncology in Houston, Texas.
