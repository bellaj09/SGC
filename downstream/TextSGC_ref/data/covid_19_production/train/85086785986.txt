widespread sars-cov-2 laboratory surveillance program to minimize asymptomatic transmission in high-risk inpatient and congregate living settings. ¬© 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.We describe a widespread laboratory surveillance program for SARS-CoV-2 at an integrated medical campus that includes a tertiary care center, skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation treatment center, and temporary shelter units. We identified multiple (n=22) asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 and implemented infection control measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in congregate settings.
