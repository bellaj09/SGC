challenges in early phase clinical trials for childhood cancer during the covid-19 pandemic: a report from the new agents group of the spanish society of paediatric haematology and oncology (sehop. ¬© 2020, Federaci√≥n de Sociedades Espa√±olas de Oncolog√≠a (FESEO).Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare stakeholders towards challenging decisions. We analyse the impact of the pandemic on the conduct of phase I‚ÄìII trials for paediatric cancer during the first month of state of alarm in Spain. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to all five ITCC-accredited Spanish Paediatric Oncology Early Phase Clinical Trial Units, including questions about impact on staff activities, recruitment, patient care, supply of investigational products, and legal aspects. Results: All units suffered personnel shortages and difficulties in enrolling patients, treatment continuity, or performing trial assessments. Monitoring activity was frequently postponed (73%), and 49% of on-going trials interrupted recruitment. Only two patients could be recruited during this period (75% reduction in the expected rate). Conclusions: The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted clinical research practice and access to innovation for children with cancer. Structural and functional changes are under way to better cope with the expected future restrictions.
