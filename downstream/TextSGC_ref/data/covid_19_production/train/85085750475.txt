author correction: pathological inflammation in patients with covid-19: a key role for monocytes and macrophages (nature reviews immunology, (2020), 20, 6, (355-362), 10.1038/s41577-020-0331-4. ¬© 2020, Springer Nature Limited.In the originally published article, the imprecise wording of a sentence implied that IL-6 blockade had been approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19. This has now been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article to clarify that the FDA had, at the time of writing, only approved trials of IL-6 blockade in patients with COVID-19.
