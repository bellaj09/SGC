inactivation of three emerging viruses ‚Äì severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, crimean‚Äìcongo haemorrhagic fever virus and nipah virus ‚Äì in platelet concentrates by ultraviolet c light and in plasma by methylene blue plus visible light. ¬© 2020 International Society of Blood TransfusionBackground: Emerging viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Crimean‚ÄìCongo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Nipah virus (NiV) have been identified to pose a potential threat to transfusion safety. In this study, the ability of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation systems to inactivate these viruses in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively, was investigated. Materials and methods: Blood products were spiked with SARS-CoV, CCHFV or NiV, and then treated with increasing doses of UVC light (THERAFLEX UV-Platelets) or with methylene blue (MB) plus increasing doses of visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB-Plasma). Samples were taken before and after treatment with each illumination dose and tested for residual infectivity. Results: Treatment with half to three-fourths of the full UVC dose (0¬∑2 J/cm2) reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoV (‚â•3¬∑4 log), CCHFV (‚â•2¬∑2 log) and NiV (‚â•4¬∑3 log) to the limit of detection (LOD) in platelet concentrates, and treatment with MB and a fourth of the full light dose (120 J/cm2) decreased that of SARS-CoV (‚â•3¬∑1 log), CCHFV (‚â•3¬∑2 log) and NiV (‚â•2¬∑7 log) to the LOD in plasma. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that both THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV, CCHFV and NiV in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively.
