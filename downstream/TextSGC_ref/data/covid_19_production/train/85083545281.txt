ribavirin and interferon therapy for critically ill patients with middle east respiratory syndrome: a multicenter observational study. ¬© The Author(s) 2019.Background. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ribavirin and recombinant interferon (RBV/rIFN) therapy on the outcomes of critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), accounting for time-varying confounders. Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. Results. Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-Œ±2a, rIFN-Œ±2b, or rIFN-Œ≤1a; none received rIFN-Œ≤1b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73-1.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERSCoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30-1.44]; P = .29). Conclusions. In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-Œ±2a, rIFN-Œ±2b, or rIFN-Œ≤1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.
