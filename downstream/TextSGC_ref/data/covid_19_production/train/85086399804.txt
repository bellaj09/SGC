obesity is the comorbidity more strongly associated for covid-19 in mexico. a case-control study. ¬© 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of ObesitySome comorbidities are associated with severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) but it is unclear whether some increase susceptibility to Covid-19. In this case-control Mexican study we found that obesity represents the strongest predictor for Covid-19 followed by diabetes and hypertension in both sexes and chronic renal failure in females only. Active smoking was associated with decreased odds of Covid-19. These findings indicate that these comorbidities are not only associated with severity of disease but also predispose for getting Covid-19. Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in each comorbidity and the apparent ‚Äúprotective‚Äù effect of cigarette smoking.
