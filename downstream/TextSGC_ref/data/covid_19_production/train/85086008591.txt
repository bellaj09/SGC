covid-19 and fake news in the dominican republic. Copyright ¬© 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and HygieneThe first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Dominican Republic coincided with a period of political crisis. Distrust in governmental institutions shaped the critical phase of early response. Having a weak public health infrastructure and a lack of public trust, the Ministry of Health (MoH) began the fight against COVID-19 with a losing streak. Within 45 days of the first reported case, the political crisis and turmoil caused by ‚Äúfake news‚Äù are limiting the capacity and success of the MoH response to the pandemic.
