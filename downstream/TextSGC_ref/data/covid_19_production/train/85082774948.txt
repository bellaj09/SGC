prevalence of comorbidities and its effects in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis. ¬© 2020 The AuthorsBackground: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China; the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. Aims: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86‚Äì97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59‚Äì76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34‚Äì68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21‚Äì40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0‚Äì27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2‚Äì12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8‚Äì13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9‚Äì2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46‚Äì3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76‚Äì3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88‚Äì6.22) respectively. Conclusion: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients.
