repeated avian infectious bronchitis virus infections within a single chicken farm. ¬© 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was performed on trachea and kidney samples of six chickens obtained from a single farm in Japan. Using two primer sets targeting the spike (S) protein gene, the S1 and S2 regions of DNA fragments were amplified. Sequences of amplified S1 fragments extracted from both organs were identical among the six chickens, showing a JP-I genotype. Sequences of amplified S2 fragments differed between trachand kidney samples. The kidney profile showed a group IV genotype, whereas the trachea profilshowed an unclassified group. This result showed that two different IBVs infected the six chickenThe first IBV infection induced poor protective immunity in this farm, permitting a second IBV infection to occur.
