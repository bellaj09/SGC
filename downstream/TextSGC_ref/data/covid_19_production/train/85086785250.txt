environmental surface testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) during prolonged isolation of an asymptomatic carrier. ¬© 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.Environmental surface testing was performed to search for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier with persistently high viral loads under isolation. No evidence of environmental contamination was found. Further studies are needed to measure environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 carriers and decide on reasonable isolation periods.
