All rights reserved.The novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the outbreak of the viral pneumonia identified for the first time in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019. The outbreak has expanded rapidly, affecting 184 countries. The experience acquired in past months identified different clinical presentations with varied severity, ranging from asymptomatic infection to death due to multiple organic dysfunction. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently defined the complex process of the SARS-CoV-2 infection as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, whose notification grows fast in different countries, currently affects more than one million people worldwide according to the WHO, which has characterized the infection as a pandemic.1 As of April 29, 2020, Brazil had registered 73,235 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,083 deaths, with a case-fatality rate of 6,9%.2 Hospitalization is necessary in up to 20% of the patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 5% to 10% of them require admission to the intensive care unit because of the need for hemodynamic and/or ventilatory support.3-7 The mortality rate ranges from 0.8% to 12% depending on the country, and this difference might result from multiple factors, of which the healthcare system structure stands out.8-11 Patients with the moderate and severe forms of the disease had manifestations mainly of the respiratory system involvement, with clinical findings ranging from mild pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).7,11-13.
