serologic detection of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus functional antibodies. ¬© 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All rights reserved.We developed and validated 2 species-independent protein-based assays to detect Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus functional antibodies that can block virus receptor-binding or sialic acid-attachment. Antibody levels measured in both assays correlated strongly with virus-neutralizing antibody titers, proving their use for serologic confirmatory diagnosis of Middle East respiratory syndrome.
