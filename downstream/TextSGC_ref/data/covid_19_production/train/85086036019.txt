the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease on 95 hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china: a retrospective study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Background: Studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. However, the impact of digestive system diseases have not been issued. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Jin-yin tan hospital, Wuhan, China between January 26th, 2020 and February 21st. The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was used to assess the presence and severity of LPRD. A RSI >13 is considered to be abnormal. Results: A total of 95 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, with 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), and 6.3% (6/95) being moderately ill, severely ill, and critically ill, respectively. In this study, 38.9% (37/95) of the patient had a RSI score over 13, which was indicative of LPRD. In a univariable analysis, the age and RSI scores of severely or critically ill patients were statistically significantly higher than patients with moderate disease (p=0.026 and p=0.005, respectively). After controlling for age difference in a multivariable model, the RSI>13, compared with RSI=0, was associated with significantly higher risk of severe infection (p<0.001; OR = 11.411, 95% CI 2.95-42.09) and critical infection (p=0.028; OR = 19.61, 95% CI 1.38-277.99). Conclusions: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, RSI score greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. The prevalence of LPRD may be higher than the general population, which indicated that COVID-19 can impair the upper esophageal sphincter and aggravate reflux. This article is protected by copyright.
