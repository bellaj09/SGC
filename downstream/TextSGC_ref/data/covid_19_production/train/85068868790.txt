application of rnascope technology to studying the infection dynamics of a chinese porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant strain bj2011c in neonatal piglets. ¬© 2019The highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants cause the death of mainly neonatal piglets, but how the viruses spread within the gastro-intestinal tract in a temporal and spatial manner has remained poorly characterized but is critical to understand the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used the Chinese PEDV epidemic strain BJ2011C as a model organism and took advantage of the newly developed RNAscope in situ hybridization technology to investigate the tempo-spatial infection dynamics in neonatal piglets. We found that the PEDV strain BJ2011C could quickly colonize the small intestine, which occurred in just 6 h post infection, with virus shedding starting at 6 hpi and peaking at 24 hpi. Jejunum was the first target tissue for infection and then ileum, followed by infrequent infection of duodenum. In these tissues, the virus nucleic acids were mainly present in the villous epithelial cells but not in crypt cells. Interestingly, the viral RNAs were not detectable by RNAscope in large intestines although tissue damages could be discerned by H & E staining. Overall, our results provide useful information about spread dynamics and tissue preference of PEDV epidemic strain BJ2011C.
