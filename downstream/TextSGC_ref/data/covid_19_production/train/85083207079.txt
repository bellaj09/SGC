heart university: a new online educational forum in paediatric and adult congenital cardiac care. the future of virtual learning in a post-pandemic world. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2020.Online learning has become an increasingly expected and popular component for education of the modern-day adult learner, including the medical provider. In light of the recent coronavirus pandemic, there has never been more urgency to establish opportunities for supplemental online learning. Heart University aims to be 'the go-to online resource' for e-learning in congenital heart disease and paediatric acquired heart disease. It is a carefully-curated open access library of pedagogical material for all providers of care to children and adults with congenital heart disease or children with acquired heart disease, whether a trainee or a practicing provider. In this manuscript, we review the aims, development, current offerings and standing, and future goals of Heart University.
