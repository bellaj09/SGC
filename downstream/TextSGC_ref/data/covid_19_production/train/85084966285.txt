bedside focused cardiac ultrasound in covid-19 from the wuhan epicenter: the role of cardiac point-of-care ultrasound, limited transthoracic echocardiography, and critical care echocardiography. ¬© 2020 American Society of EchocardiographyBackground: Three cases of the application of focused cardiac ultrasound in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are presented. Methods: Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound, limited transthoracic echocardiography, and critical care echocardiography were applied in cases of heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and myocarditis with thrombus respectively. Results: The impact on patient management and the global context of each presentation are discussed. Conclusions: Focused cardiac point-of-care ultrasound played an important, front-line role in the bedside management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China.
