tests with proven value in diagnosis of covid-19. ¬© 2020, Tehran University of Medical Science. All rights reserved.COVID-19 has literally ravaged the entire world. People from all walks of life are badly affected because of compulsory lockdown around the world. Timely diagnosis is a problem as there is no single test that can achieve the highest acceptable sensitivity. Some of the tests are indeed costly and footing the bill by the governments can cause a tremendous load on the Treasury. As it stands, the current tests are beyond patient means and, thus, the patient would never have it performed. Lastly, there is no consensus as to whether everyone should be tested for COVID-19 and not based on presence of clinical features. Unfortunately, since the disease has been declared a pandemic, all should be considered to be infected unless provenother-wise by the tests that are performed.
