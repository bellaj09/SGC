neonatal management during the coronavirus disease (covid-19) outbreak: the chinese experience. ¬© 2020, American Academy of Pediatrics. All rights reserved.Novel coronavirus infection is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization on January 7, 2020. In early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. (1)(2) The disease then spread rapidly throughout China and has now become a global pandemic. As of March 23, 2020, more than 340,000 cases have been reported in more than 150 countries. Because the disease is primarily an airborne respiratory infection and is documented to have a strong human-to-human transmission, the pediatric and neonatal populations are vulnerable to this disease. However, the incidence and clinical presentations of pediatric COVID-19 infections are varied and differ from those found in adult patients. The atypical clinical presentations and 2 potential modes of transmission in neonates (ie, maternal-fetal or maternal-neonatal) have led to diagnostic and management challenges. In this perspective, we would like to share some published informa-tion from Chinese pediatric and neonatal societies about their approach to handling the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak in China.
