relational cities disrupted: reflections on the particular geographies of covid-19 for small but global urbanisation in dublin, ireland, and luxembourg city, luxembourg. ¬© 2020 Royal Dutch Geographical Society / Koninklijk Nederlands AardrijkskundigThis paper looks at the particular geographies associated with the COVID-19 outbreak through the lens of cities that are products of relational urbanisation. This includes small but highly globalised cities, such as financial centres or hot spots of politics and diplomacy, which are usually situated between different political, economic or cultural systems and their boundaries. These cities experienced strong growth due to internationalisation and a dedicated politics of extraversion. Our argument is that such places are unusually affected by the current lock-down, illustrated by two empirical cases, the cities of Dublin, Ireland, and Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. Both have experienced striking growth rates recently, but now suffer from disruption. Their development trajectories remain unclear, since a return to the ‚Äòold normal‚Äô seems unlikely, and the emergent ‚Äònew normal‚Äô calls for adaptation towards more state involvement in areas hitherto governed by the market. The paper addresses possible alternative geographies for both cases.
