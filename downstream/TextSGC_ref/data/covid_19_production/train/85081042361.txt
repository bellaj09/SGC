early transmission patterns of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in travellers from wuhan to thailand, january 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in travellers from Wuhan, China to Thailand. Both were independent introductions on separate flights, discovered with thermoscanners and confirmed with RT-PCR and genome sequencing. Both cases do not seem directly linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in Hubei but the viral genomes are identical to four other sequences from Wuhan, suggesting early spread within the city already in the first week of January.
