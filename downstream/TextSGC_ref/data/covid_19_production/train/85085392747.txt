achieving a popliteal venous access for renal replacement therapy in critically ill covid-19 patient in prone position. ¬© 2020This patient is a 67-year-old man who initially presented to our facility with acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Soon after arrival at our facility, the patient decompensated, developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation and prone positioning to maintain adequate oxygenation. During the next few days, acute kidney injury with oliguria and severe volume overload developed. The vascular surgery service was consulted to obtain central venous access for emergent continuous renal replacement therapy. On examination, the patient was sedated and paralyzed in a rotating prone-positioning bed. He could not be positioned supine without immediately becoming hypoxic and decompensating. A 50-cm Permcath (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) was inserted through the left popliteal vein. This case report outlines a possible challenging scenario that the vascular interventionist may encounter in dealing with COVID-19 patients with respiratory compromise in the prone position.
