migrating a lab-developed mers-cov real-time pcr to 3 ‚Äúsample to result‚Äù systems: experiences on optimization and validation. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.The goal of the study was to adapt our Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lab-developed test (LDT) to 3 ‚ÄúSample to Result‚Äù (S2R) systems: BD MAX (BD), ELITe InGenius (ELITechGroup), and ARIES (Luminex). The BD MAX and InGenius system allowed use of lab-developed primers and TaqMan probes, while ARIES required conversion to MultiCode primers for melting curve analysis. Each device required ‚â§1 day of training and assay optimization. No discordant results were noted after analysis of 32 External Quality Control (EQC) samples. On a 10-fold dilution series of a MERS-CoV‚Äìpositive EQC sample, InGenius obtained the highest detection rate. Laboratory technicians rated the ARIES as the user-friendliest. It also required the least hands-on time. BD MAX had the lowest turnaround time and highest throughput. While each device had distinguishing system properties with associated (dis)advantages, the 3 S2R systems were comparable in terms of assay development and validation.
