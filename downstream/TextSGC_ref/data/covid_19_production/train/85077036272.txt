a germline mutation in the c2 domain of plcŒ≥2 associated with gain-of-function expands the phenotype for plcg2-related diseases. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We report three new cases of a germline heterozygous gain-of-function missense (p.(Met1141Lys)) mutation in the C2 domain of phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) associated with symptoms consistent with previously described auto-inflammation and phospholipase CŒ≥2 (PLCŒ≥2)-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) syndrome and pediatric common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Functional evaluation showed platelet hyper-reactivity, increased B cell receptor-triggered calcium influx and ERK phosphorylation. Expression of the altered p.(Met1141Lys) variant in a PLCŒ≥2-knockout DT40 cell line showed clearly enhanced BCR-triggered influx of external calcium when compared to control-transfected cells. Our results further expand the molecular basis of pediatric CVID and phenotypic spectrum of PLCŒ≥2-related defects.
