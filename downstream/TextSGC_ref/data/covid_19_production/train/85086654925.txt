chest ct in covid-19 pneumonia: a review of current knowledge. ¬© 2020 Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de radiologieThe current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential role of chest computed tomography (CT) examination in patient triage in the emergency departments, allowing them to be referred to ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-COVID‚Äù wards. Initial chest CT examination must be performed without intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material, but contrast material administration is required when pulmonary embolism is suspected, which seems to be frequent in severe forms of the disease. Typical CT features consist of bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral, posterior and basal predominance. Lung disease extent on CT correlates with clinical severity.
