outpatient otolaryngology in the era of covid-19: a data-driven analysis of practice patterns. ¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has induced a prioritization of acute care and telehealth, affecting the quantity of patients seen and the modality of their care. Study Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Single-institution study conducted within the Division of Otolaryngology at the Yale School of Medicine. Subjects and Methods: Data on all outpatient appointments within the Division of Otolaryngology were obtained from administrative records of billing and scheduling from March 16 to April 10, 2020. For comparison, a corresponding period from 2019 was also utilized. Results: Of 5913 scheduled visits, 3665 (62.0%) were seen between March 18 and April 12, 2019, in comparison with 649 of 5044 (12.9%) during the corresponding COVID-19‚Äìaffected period. The majority of completed visits performed in weeks 1 and 2 were in person, while the majority in weeks 3 and 4 were via telehealth. Among subspecialties, a larger proportion of completed visits in 2020 were performed by pediatric and head and neck oncology otolaryngologists as compared with general/specialty otolaryngologists (P <.001). Older adults (‚â•65 years) were less likely to have telehealth visits than younger adults (18-64 years; 45.6% vs 59.6%, P =.003). Conclusions: A major decrease in the completion rates of scheduled visits was seen in the COVID-19‚Äìaffected period, though this was not proportional among subspecialties. An associated increase in telehealth visits was observed. After COVID-19‚Äìrelated hospital policy changes, approximately 2 weeks passed before telehealth visits surpassed in-person visits, though this was not true among older adults.
