covid-19 and people with intellectual disability: impacts of a pandemic. ¬© 2020 College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affect all groups in society. People with intellectual disability are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown, and increased the use of psychotropic medication. People with intellectual disability are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 has on people with intellectual disability. Collecting the evidence through a rigorous approach should help to empower people with intellectual disability and their carers to face future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
