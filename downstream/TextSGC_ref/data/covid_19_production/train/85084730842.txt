barrier device prototype for open tracheotomy during covid-19 pandemic. ¬© 2020 Elsevier LtdObjective: To present a low-cost prototype for a barrier enclosure device which can be used during open surgeries such as tracheotomy. Methods: We provide detailed description of a novel device called COVID-Box, developed by The Surgical Airway Team for COVID-19 Pandemic, a temporary task force formed by Walter Cant√≠dio University Hospital. Safety guidelines for performing tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients are also stated. Results: Our prototype device provides greater hand mobility than previous barrier devices reported, making it more suitable for airway surgical procedures, such as tracheotomy. The curved shaped format and the customizable access ports provides ergonomics, without compromising safety. Conclusion: The COVID-Box appears to be an efficient, reproduceable, low-cost barrier enclosure device that can be used for open tracheotomies in ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
