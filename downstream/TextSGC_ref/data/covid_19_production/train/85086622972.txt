the comparison of the effectiveness of lincocin¬Æ and azitro¬Æ in the treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia: a prospective study. ¬© 2020 Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology. All rights reserved.The COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly around the world and there are many patients in multiple countries. Great efforts have been made to find effective medications against the COVID-19. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of LINCOCIN¬Æ and AZITRO¬Æ in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. A total of 24 hospitalized patients aged between 30-80 years who were admitted to the Tarsus Medical Park Hospital between February to March 2020 was included in the study. The patients were divided into LINCOCIN¬Æ and AZITRO¬Æ treatment groups. Bronchoalveolar-lavage PCR results were compared after treatment. The mean age was 58.4¬±15.4 years in the LINCOCIN¬Æ group and 59.1¬±16.6 years in the AZITRO¬Æ group. In the LINCOCIN¬Æ group, the rate of males was 66.7% and it was 58.3% in the AZITRO¬Æ group. There were no statistical differences in terms of age and gender between the groups. On the 6th day after starting treatment, negative bronchoalveolar PCR result was 83.3% in the LINCOCIN¬Æ group and 33.3% in the AZITRO¬Æ group. The negative bronchoalveolar PCR proportion was significantly higher in the LINCOCIN¬Æ group than in the AZITRO¬Æ group. LINCOCIN¬Æ usage may be more appropriate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Further studies with a large sample size should clarify these results.
