severe covid-19, another piece in the puzzle of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. an immunomodulatory perspective to alleviate the storm. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2020 Ruscitti, Berardicurti, Di Benedetto, Cipriani, Iagnocco, Shoenfeld and Giacomelli.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as a worldwide public health emergency. Interestingly, severe COVID-19 is characterized by fever, hyperferritinemia, and a hyper-inflammatory process with a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may be responsible for the high rate of mortality. These findings may advocate for a similarity between severe COVID-19 and some challenging rheumatic diseases, such as adult onset Still's disease, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome, which have been included in the ‚Äúhyperferritinemic syndrome‚Äù category. Furthermore, as performed in these hyper-inflammatory states, severe COVID-19 may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies.
