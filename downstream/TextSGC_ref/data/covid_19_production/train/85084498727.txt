endoscopic skull base and transoral surgery during the covid-19 pandemic: minimizing droplet spread with a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (novid. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern of transmission of infectious organisms through aerosols formation in endonasal and transoral surgery. Methods: Retrospective review. We introduce the Negative-Pressure Otolaryngology Viral Isolation Drape (NOVID) system to reduce the risk of aerosol. NOVID consists of a plastic drape suspended above the patient's head and surgical field with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber. Results: Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo-oral surgery (1). Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field. Black light examination of fluorescein treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field. In two prolonged cases with high-speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator. Instruments and cottonoids appeared to be a greater contributor to field contamination. Conclusions: Negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier which appears to successfully keep aerosol and droplet contamination to a minimum. This article is protected by copyright.
