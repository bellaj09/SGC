intracerebral hemorrhage and sars-cov-2: association or causation. ¬© 2006 - 2020 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.Background: Recent respiratory infection including SARS-CoV-2 is an independent risk factor for acute cerebrovascular disease. Purpose: There have been reports linking haemorrhagic strokes to SARS-CoV-2 infection during this pandemic, which lead us to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 infection could be associated with increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods: A retrospective observational study evaluating all stroke cases admitted in our centre in the past one month. Results: More than half (56%) had ICH, compared to 22% last year. Two patients with ICH were SARS-CoV-2 positive and they had no or mild respiratory symptoms and had higher occurrence of renal dysfunction. Conclusion: There could be possible association between ICH and SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a prospective study with larger sample size is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis.
