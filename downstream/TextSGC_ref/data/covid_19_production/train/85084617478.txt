impact of fundamental diseases on patients with covid-19. Copyright ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.BackgroundIn December 2019, a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, China. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related to SARS-CoV-2 has brought serious attacks to China and the world. Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we included 50 confirmed death cases of SARS-CoV-2 on Chinese official media networks from 16 Jan, 2020 to 5 Feb, 2020. All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions. Their specific information has been released through official channels. According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the sex, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases and other data of the patients, and carried out analysis and discussion.ResultsIn total 50 death cases, the median age of them was 70 years old, and male was 2.33 times more likely than female. The median days from the first symptom to death were 13 days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and above than those with ages under 65 (12 days vs. 17 days, P = 0.046). There was a negative correlation between age and the days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40, P = 0.012).ConclusionIn our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progress is shorter. At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to be infected with covid-19 and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.
