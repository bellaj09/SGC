current consensus on drugs and biologics against ncovid-19 ‚Äì a systematic review. ¬© 2020, Radiance Research Academy. All rights reserved.The deadly pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus continues to jeopardize humanity. The current situation report published by the World Health Organization (on 1st May, 2020) confirms 32,49,022 nCOVID-19 cases with 2,30,804 toll of human lives. This global statistical data reflects the contagiosity of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. This newly emerged strain has presented an unequalled challenge for identifying effective drugs & biologics. Till date, no proven effective therapy exists for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The past experience of managing viral aetiological outbreaks renders background for extrapolation to nCOVID-19, yet effectivity remains uncertain. This dire scenario has been addressed with an escalation in the number of clinical trials in order to come up with specific treatment. Repurposed drugs, Antibodies and Vaccines are under various stages of clinical trials currently. In the interim, supportive care, infection prevention measures and extended psychological assistance concords the core strategy to battle against this virus.
