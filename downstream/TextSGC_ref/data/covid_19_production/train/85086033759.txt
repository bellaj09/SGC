Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Gaps in college degree completion between low‚Äê, middle‚Äê, and high‚Äêincome college students are typically attributed to differences in academic preparation and ability. However, high-achieving, low‚Äêincome students are still less likely to graduate from college than their high-achieving, high‚Äêincome counterparts. This study explores completion rates at the end of the Great Recession, using a community cultural wealth framework to examine additional pre‚Äêcollege factors and college attendance behaviors that contribute to the degree completion of high‚Äêachieving, low-income students. Longitudinal data using the Freshmen Survey and National Student Clearinghouse were collected from 2004 to 2010, comparing 9300 high‚Äêachieving students entering 455 colleges from low‚Äê, middle‚Äê, and high‚Äêincome backgrounds. Hierarchical linear modeling (HGLM) was used to identify student and institutional factors that predict college completion during this era. Findings indicate that navigational capital and college attendance patterns (attending a summer session, selective college, and/or private institution) are key factors for high-achieving, low‚Äêincome student completion. Cultural wealth anti‚Äêdeficit measures could not explain the low‚Äêincome Latinx lower likelihood of college completion nor gender differences across income groups. Implications of the results address concerns regarding the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic recession in terms of what institutions can do to support students.
