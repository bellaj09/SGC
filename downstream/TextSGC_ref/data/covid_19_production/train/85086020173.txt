the urgency of conducting serological studies for covid-19. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).Background: COVID-19 has been the most priority of the world since the early 2020s. We aimed to investigate the importance, urgency and value of serological tests for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. Study design: Rapid review. Methods: This study was conducted through a review of seroepidemiological studies to evaluate their strength and weakness in monitoring and predicting the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Results: Conducting serological studies is an important measure to determine the status of the COVID-19 in affected countries. These studies may also be used to estimate cumulative incidence of the disease, and to get an impression about the level of the epidemic. Conclusion: If an accurate serological test is available it can be used for seroepidemiological studies and epidemic investigation in special context, but given the current situation, it may not be possible to be used for screening the normal population and in care and treatment. This research highlighted the importance and urgency of conducting serological studies for monitoring the COVID-19 situation and evaluation of the interventions.
