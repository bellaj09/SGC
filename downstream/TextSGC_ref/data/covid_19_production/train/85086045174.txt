oligosymptomatic kidney transplant patients with covid-19: do they pose a risk to other recipients. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The clinical course of viral infections in patients under immunosuppression can be atypical and/or fatal if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also have an atypical presentation. Contrary to the general opinion, transplant patients may be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, which could be a risk factor for underdiagnosis and the dissemination of this viral disease. This study presents the clinical features of 2 oligosymptomatic kidney transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We suggest that new screening algorithms for COVID-19 should be reconsidered for the transplant patient population.
