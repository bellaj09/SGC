‚Äúi'm kinda stuck at home with unsupportive parents right now‚Äù: lgbtq youths' experiences with covid-19 and the importance of online support. ¬© 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and MedicinePurpose: LGBTQ youth are a population who experience unique stressors. This study investigated their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic via Q Chat Space‚Äîa national online chat-based support program. Methods: Transcript data from 31 synchronous, text-based chats collected during the onset of state-based ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù ordinances in Spring 2020 were analyzed. Results: While encountering COVID-19‚Äìrelated stressors likely to be experienced by youth generally, participants' experiences were concomitantly imbued with LGBTQ-specific intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural challenges. Difficulties included maintaining mental health, being isolated with unsupportive families, and loss of in-person identity-based socialization and support. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of synchronous, text-based online platforms to enable LGBTQ youth to feel safe to seek support while at home. Given the potential for long-term physical distancing, concerted efforts are required to provide necessary resources and support for LGBTQ youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
