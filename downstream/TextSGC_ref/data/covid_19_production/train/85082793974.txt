how to surge to face sars-cov-2 outbreak. lessons learned from lumbardy, italy.

Pressure on the hospitals is tremendous as for official data on March 14th: 8372 admitted in hospitals, 1518 in ICU, 1441 deaths (175 more than the day before). Unfortunately hospitals are not prepared: even where a plan for massive influx of patients is present, it usually focuses on sudden onset disaster trauma victims (the most probable case scenario), and it has not been tested, validated or propagated to the staff. Despite this, the All Hazards Approach (AHA) for management of major incidents and disasters is still valid and the "4S" theory for surge capacity can guide to respond to this disaster.
