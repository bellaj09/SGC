no evidence of secondary transmission of covid-19 from children attending school in ireland, 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.As many countries begin to lift some of the restrictions to contain COVID-19 spread, lack of evidence of transmission in the school setting remains. We examined Irish notifications of SARS-CoV2 in the school setting before school closures on 12 March 2020 and identified no paediatric transmission. This adds to current evidence that children do not appear to be drivers of transmission, and we argue that reopening schools should be considered safe accompanied by certain measures.
