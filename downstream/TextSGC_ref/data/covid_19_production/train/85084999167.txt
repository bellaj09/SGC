how did ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù become ‚Äúflatten the economy?‚Äù a perspective from the united states of america. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic offers many medical, economic, societal, and cultural challenges. The response by individual states in the United States of America varies, but with the common initial impetus for all being to ‚Äúflatten the curve,‚Äù which was intended to delay infections and spread the burden and impact on hospitals and medical systems. Starting with that intention, the responses by states has included many major steps not taken in prior pandemics. Those steps have significantly adversely affected hospitals rather than support them, and the overall impact has been to ‚Äúflatten the economy‚Äù rather than just to ‚Äúflatten the curve.‚Äù Many state governors have stated that their decisions are ‚Äúscience-led‚Äù and ‚Äúdata driven‚Äù but the reality is that there is not relevant experimental data. The progression of decisions during the early pandemic decisions is traced, and the basis of decisions based in science or herd mentality is discussed. Experiences are not experiments, and experiences are not founded in the scientific process. Medical and government leaders must be vigilant to recognize the limitations of available data in responding to unique circumstances.
