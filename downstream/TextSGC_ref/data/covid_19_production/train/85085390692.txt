the covirl-001 trial: a multicentre, prospective, randomised trial comparing standard of care (soc) alone, soc plus hydroxychloroquine monotherapy or soc plus a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the treatment of non- critical, sars-cov-2 pcr-positive population not requiring immediate resuscitation or ventilation but who have evidence of clinical decline: a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. ¬© 2020 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access.Hydroxychloroquine has attracted considerable interest as a potential therapy for COVID-19 infection due to its immunomodulatory effects and reported efficiency in clearing upper airways of the virus. Recent data have also suggested the treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure the associated infection. The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of standard of care (SOC) plus hydroxychloroquine monotherapy or SOC plus a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in subjects with non-critical, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive infection not requiring immediate resuscitation or ventilation but who have evidence of clinical decline compared to SOC alone.
