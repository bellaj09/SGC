optimization of the response to ncovid-19 pandemic in pregnant women ‚Äì an urgent appeal in indian scenario. ¬© 2020, Radiance Research Academy. All rights reserved.Corona virus Disease 2019 (nCOVID-19), the novel corona virus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic with an estimated global mortality rate of 3.4% respectively. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human corona virus after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The disease presentation can range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death. As of now, the experience in Indian set-up is limited. There is even less to draw from in terms of experience in pregnant women and neonates. Pregnancy is a physiological state involving changes that predispose to respiratory complications of viral infection. Limited knowledge available on corona virus infections during pregnancy is attributable to the findings in SARS and MERS epidemics. Clinical manifestations in pregnancy were found to be similar to those of non-pregnant adults with nCOVID-19 that have been reported in the literature without increased susceptibility. Recent evidences have shown the absence of vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to infant. In India, cost-effective and readily available drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are used for nCOVID-19 infection as per guidelines given by the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). All the patients with nCOVID-19 in labour universally delivered by caesarean section. Initiation of breastfeeding is controversial. The principle guidelines for isolation, quarantine, case definition, contact tracing, notification and testing are same as that of the general public.
