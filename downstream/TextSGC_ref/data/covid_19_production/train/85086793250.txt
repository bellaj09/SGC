valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a young patient with a suspected covid-19 infection: a surgical dilemma in the era of the covid-19 pandemic. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

All rights reserved.We report on a case of a 57-year-old male patient, who underwent full root replacement in 2005 and now presented with high grade aortic insufficiency. On admission, the patient underwent a computed tomography scan which demonstrated interstitial infiltration in the left lung, highly suspicious for a COVID-19 infection that could not be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. As there usually is a delay between infection and positive RT-PCR test results, the initial decision was to perform additional testing. However, the patient deteriorated quickly in spite of optimal medical therapy making urgent aortic valve replacement necessary. We decided to perform transcatheter aortic valve replacement to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass with shorter operative times, presumably shorter ventilation times and duration of intensive care unit stay, and thus a lesser risk for pulmonary complications.
