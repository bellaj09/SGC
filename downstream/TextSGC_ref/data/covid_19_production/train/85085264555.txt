coverage of health information by different sources in communities: implication for covid-19 epidemic response. ¬© 2020 by the authors.Health personnel and community workers are at the front line of the COVID-19 emergency response and need to be equipped with adequate knowledge related to epidemics for an effective response. This study aimed to identify the coverage of COVID-19 health information via different sources accessed by health workers and community workers in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study using a web-based survey was carried out from January to February 2020 in Vietnam. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used for recruiting participants. We utilized the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. A higher percentage of participants knew about ‚ÄúClinical and pathogen characteristics of COVID-19‚Äù, compared to ‚ÄúRegulations and policies related to COVID-19‚Äù. The percentage of participants accessing the information on ‚ÄúGuidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19‚Äù was the lowest, especially among medical students. ‚ÄúMass media and peer-educators‚Äù channels had a higher score of accessing COVID-19 information, compared to ‚ÄúOrganizations/ agencies/ associations‚Äù sources. Participants consumed most of their COVID-19 information via ‚ÄúInternet, online newspapers, social networks‚Äù. Our findings indicate an urgency to re-design training programs and communication activities for a more effective dissemination of information related to the COVID-19 epidemic or epidemics in general.
