covid-19 in patients with myasthenia gravis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic, but little is known about potential impact on patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: We studied the clinical course of COVID-19 in 5 hospitalized patients with autoimmune MG (4 with acetylcholine receptor antibodies, one with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies). Results: Two patients required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, while one required significant supplemental oxygen. One patient with previously stable MG had myasthenic exacerbation. One patient treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 was successfully extubated. Two patients were treated for MG with intravenous immunoglobulin without thromboembolic complications. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID-19 are highly variable. Further large studies are needed to define best practices and determinants of outcomes in this unique population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
