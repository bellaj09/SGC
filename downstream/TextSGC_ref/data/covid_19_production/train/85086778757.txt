‚Äòwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äô: commodified notions of connection, care and community in brand responses to covid-19. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.The current COVID-19 (coronavirus) global pandemic has resulted in a wave of advertising and marketing approaches that are based on commodified concepts of human connection, care and community in a time of crisis. At the core of many brands‚Äô marketing messages ‚Äì whether these be supermarket advertising campaigns or celebrity self-branding ‚Äì is the notion that ‚Äòwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äô. While it is true that the impact of COVID-19 has affected the lives of many people around the world, not everyone is experiencing this crisis the same way, due to structural inequalities and intersecting oppressions. What is the relationship between COVID-19, capitalism and consumer culture? Who is the ‚Äòwe‚Äô in the messages of ‚Äòwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äô, and how might such messages mask distinct socio-economic disparities and enable institutions to evade accountability? This article examines sub-textual meanings connected to brand responses to COVID-19 in the UK context which rely on an amorphous imagined ‚Äòwe‚Äô ‚Äì and which ultimately may aid brands‚Äô pursuit of productivity and profit, rather than symbolising support of and concern for people.
