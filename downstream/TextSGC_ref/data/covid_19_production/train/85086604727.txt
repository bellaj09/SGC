The clinical presentation is variable, but the predominant symptoms are those of the upper respiratory tract. Aim: The aim of the current study is to describe the incidence and type of the gastrointestinal injury (GI) in COVID-19, as Well as their prognostic value. Materials and Methods: We conducted a coincidental search on this topic in PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE. We also followed a group of 31 Bulgarian COVID-19 patients throughout the course of their disease and analyzed their symptoms (catarrhal and other) and outcome. Results: The publications concerning our survey followed a total of 1509 COVID-19 patients. In the Bulgarian cohort, only 14 from the 31 patients Were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Approximately 1/3 of the infected individuals presented With GI. In some patients this Was the first, or only, symptom of the disease. It Was also indicative of a more severe disease course. Conclusion: GI may be an important symptom and prognostic factor in COVID-19. Therefore, patients With acute gastrointestinal symptoms must be actively tested for SARS-CoV-2.
