identification of a novel linear b-cell epitope within the collagenase equivalent domain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike glycoprotein. ¬© 2019 The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) collagenase equivalent domain (COE, residues 499‚Äì638), a crucial antigenic region within the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, has been widely utilized for the development of subunit vaccines to prevent viral infection. In the current study, we immunized BALB/c mice with recombinant truncated PEDV COE protein and obtained 14 COE-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Based on the reactivity analysis of the mAbs with two prevalent PEDV strains in G2 type and the attenuated CV777 strain in G1 type, 6 mAbs were selected for subsequent identification of COE mAb-binding epitopes. Dot-blot hybridization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) identified the peptide 592 TSLLASACTIDLFGYP 607 as a novel linear B-cell epitope involved in binding of mAbs 4D8F10 and 6F3E3. Subsequently, alanine (A)-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that residues 606Y, 605G and 604F were core residues involved in recognition. Importantly, this novel COE epitope, including core residues, is conserved among G1 and G2 type PEDV strains. Further experiment indicates that the mAbs 4D8F10 and 6F3E3 were suitable for PEDV detection via mAb binding to the conserved epitope. The current work actually provides potential uses for the development of diagnostic methods to detect PEDV.
