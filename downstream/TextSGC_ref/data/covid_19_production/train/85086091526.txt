This cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted on 761 HCWs in Hamadan, Iran, using multi-stage random sampling. The preventive behaviours against COVID-19 among HCWs were assessed at a relatively desirable level. Based on the PMT, threat and coping appraisal were predictors of protection motivation to conduct COVID-19 preventive behaviours (P<0.001). The intention was also predictive of COVID-19 preventive behaviours (P<0.001). Consideration of personnel's self-efficacy and their knowledge regarding the effectiveness of protective behaviours in designing staff training programmes are recommended.
