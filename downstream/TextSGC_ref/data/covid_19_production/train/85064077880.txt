construction of a recombinant lactococcus lactis strain expressing a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus s1 gene and its immunogenicity analysis in mice. ¬© 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious disease in newborn piglets. The spike (S) protein is the surface glycoprotein of PEDV, which can induce specific neutralization antibodies and is a candidate antigen for vaccination attempts. In our study, the S1 region of PEDV strain CH/JLDH/2016 spike gene was inserted into the Lactococcus lactis expression vector, pNZ8149, resulting in recombinant plasmid pNZ8149-S1, and the immunogenicity of recombinant L. lactis pNZ8149-S1/NZ3900 was evaluated in mice. After immunization, significantly higher levels of anti-PEDV serum IgG antibodies and mucosal sIgA antibodies were detected in mice orally administered with pNZ8149-S1/NZ3900, compared with control groups pNZ8149/NZ3900, NZ3900, and phosphate buffered saline (p < 0.01). Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the recombinant L. lactis pNZ8149-S1/NZ3900 significantly stimulated the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes (p < 0.01). In addition, the recombinant L. lactis vaccine could induce high levels of IL-4 and IFN-Œ≥ in immunized mice (p < 0.01). The results of our study suggest that the recombinant L. lactis pNZ8149-S1/NZ3900 can provide a promising vaccine strategy against PEDV infection.
