The notion of ‚ÄúVUCA‚Äù was introduced by the United States Army way back in 1980's to describe the unpredictable environment that resulted from the end of cold war and it has been staying with us since then. The acronym has been used time and again by organisations and business leaders to describe the dynamic business landscape that may have resulted from various crisis situations such as Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009, Demonetisation, BREXIT. The most recent example of VUCA has been the spread of Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic.
