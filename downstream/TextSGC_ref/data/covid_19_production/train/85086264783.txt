All rights reserved.Any decisions about the care and support provided for older people in response to the current situation with Covid-19 require careful consideration of many factors, not just chronological age. The older population is a heterogeneous group with varying levels of vulnerability and resources. We welcome that the government has recommended people stay at home based on existing medical conditions rather than just chronological age. The self-isolation of members of the older population is likely to result in higher levels of mental distress and loneliness in this population, which requires attention alongside slowing the spread of the virus.
