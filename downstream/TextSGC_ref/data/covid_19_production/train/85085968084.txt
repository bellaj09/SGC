the smart city as time-space cartographer in covid-19 control: the south korean strategy and democratic control of surveillance technology. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.While the US, UK, France, Italy, and many other countries ended up implementing complete lockdown after tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19, South Korea kept factories and offices running, flattened the curve, and maintained a low mortality rate. Extensive media coverage has focused on South Korea‚Äôs testing capacity as the primary reason, but there has been little discussion of the vital role of the smart city. In this paper, we describe how smart city technologies form a crucial part of disease control in South Korea, explain the social conditions for the extensive use of smart city technology, and offer critical insights into contemporary discussions on the issue of smart cities and surveillance.
