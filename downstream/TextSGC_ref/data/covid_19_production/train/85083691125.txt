All rights reserved.The outbreak of the recent pneumonia that caused by a new coronavirus (COVID-19) in China is posturing an extraordinary risk to the worldwide general health. The spreading of this coronavirus that infected people is highly increase because most of them do not realize the common symptom of this virus is fever or high body temperature. Because of the spreading keep rising rapidly, nowadays, infrared thermometers are being used everywhere to check the body temperature in places with large number of people. But this action is not really effective even it might cause the spread of the coronavirus from the infectious people to the person who does the screening process. So in order to solve this, an alternative is needed. In this manner, quick and an exact identifiable proof of pathogenic infections plays an imperative part in adopting suitable treatments, maintaining people‚Äôs lives and avoiding plagues. It is necessary to set up a speedy standard symptomatic test for the recognizing of the infectious malady (COVID-19) to avoid consequent minor spread. Thus, the fast and precise identification of coronavirus is hence getting to be progressively critical. The aim of this study is to design a system that has capability to detect the coronavirus automatically from the thermal image fast with less human interactions using IoT based drone technology. Furthermore, the proposed design has capability for using Virtual Reality or VR so the live video scanning process will be monitored through the VR screen to make it realistic and less human interaction. This proposed design has a high potential in order to fulfil the demands from the healthcare.
