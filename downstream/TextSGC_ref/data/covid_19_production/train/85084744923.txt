novel coronavirus international public health emergency: guidance on radiation oncology facility operation. ¬© 2020 The AuthorsPurpose: The current situation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Radiation therapy facilities are places of concentrated patient interactions. Oncology patients with immunosuppression are at a higher risk for contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and easily developing severe postinfection events during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. This review aimed to provide some guidance and be a reference to medical professionals in radiation oncology so that they may provide oncology patients with safe and high-quality care. Methods and Materials: This paper discussed how radiation therapy departments or centers can most effectively respond to this public health emergency through summarizing the procedures and protocols implemented at hospitals in ShenZhen, China. Results: The impact of the virus in radiation therapy facilities can be mitigated and managed with appropriate and timely implementation of infection control procedures and protocols. Conclusions: In the face of acute infectious disease, it is critical to maintain strict infectious disease control procedures and to create a clear clinical workflow protocol to best protect medical staff and patients from the effect of acute infectious diseases.
