dynamics of covid-19 pandemic at constant and time-dependent contact rates. ¬© The authors. Published by EDP Sciences, 2020.We constructed a simple Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model of the spread of COVID-19. The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, œÑ, and two rate parameters: contact rate, Œ≤, and exclusion rate, Œ≥. The rates depend on nontherapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R0 = Œ≤/ Œ≥, and, together with œÑ, the daily multiplication coefficient in the early exponential phase, Œ∏. Initial R0 determines the reduction of Œ≤ required to contain the spread of the epidemic. We demonstrate that introduction of a cascade of multiple exposed states enables the model to reproduce the distributions of the incubation period and the serial interval reported by epidemiologists. Using the model, we consider a hypothetical scenario in which Œ≤ is modulated solely by anticipated changes of social behaviours: first, Œ≤ decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, pressuring people to self-isolate, and then, over longer time scale, Œ≤ increases as people gradually accept the risk. In this scenario, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression, which, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop and deploy vaccine or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.
