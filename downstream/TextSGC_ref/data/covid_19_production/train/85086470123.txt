the epidemiological plateau of corona virus in gulf countries: a descriptive statistics study. ¬© 2020 Revista Bionatura. All rights reserved.The novel SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronaviruses and causes a severe pandemic disease named as COVID-19. In late December 2019. WHO situation reports on 11 March 2020, declared that COVID-19 a pandemic due to its global spread. All Arab countries have reported COVID-19 cases. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic in Arab gulf countries were reported in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The fatality case rates in Gulf Countries are less than 1% in Oman, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, yet it hits 7.5% in Iraq. In this manuscript, we try to interpret the pandemic statistically in gulf countries, especially in Iraq. Additionally, the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases based on ABO blood groups were investigated. Epidemiological analyses revealed that a decreased risk of infection was attributed to blood group O compared to non-O blood groups, whereas people with the A and A.B. blood groups showed the highest risk for COVID-19 infection. Besides, high risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, blood clotting, and interleukin secretion was also related to blood groups in different orders. Accordingly, patients with a specific blood group that are associate with the above diseases should be under strict medical surveillance when infected with COVID-19 to reduce complications and severity. This study provides further confirmation for the previously reported correlation between the ABO blood groups and the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.
