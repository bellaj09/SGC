challenges in drug development posed by the covid-19 pandemic: an opportunity for clinical pharmacology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.The unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the urgency for applying clinical pharmacology and model-informed drug development in (i) dosage optimization for COVID-19 therapies, (ii) approaching therapeutic dilemmas in clinical trial settings, and (iii) maximizing value of information from impacted non-COVID-19 trials. More than ever, we have a responsibility for adaptive evidence synthesis with a Totality of Evidence mindset in this race against time across biomedical research, clinical practice, drug development and regulation.
