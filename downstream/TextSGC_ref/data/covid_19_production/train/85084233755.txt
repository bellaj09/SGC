antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in patients with covid-19. ¬© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.We report acute antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 285 patients with COVID-19. Within 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients tested positive for antiviral immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially. Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion. Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT‚ÄìPCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.
