the performance of the iranian red crescent by launching covid-19 testing centers: report from the field. ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.The Corona screening project has been conducted by Red Crescent Society for 17 days with the aim of identifying and treating people with Coronavirus, reducing road trips and sensitizing people to the problem. Due to the shortage of Covid-19 testing devices, passengers were screened by measuring skin temperature. In 851 screening posts, 95371 volunteers of Red Crescent monitored 21640866 people.Beside screening people, the stations have had other functions including urging people to stay at home, restricting road trips especially during the Iranian New Year holidays, reassuring the people that all relevant organizations are doing their best to respond to Corona and the like. However, future research is still needed to analyze cost-benefit of this plan and other possible options.
