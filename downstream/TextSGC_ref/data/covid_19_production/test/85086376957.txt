a protocol for acute stroke unit care during the covid-19 pandemic. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Background: Acute stroke unit (ASU) care is proven to reduce mortality and morbidity. During the COVID-19 crisis, established physical units and care practices within existing physical units are likely to be disrupted. Stroke patients with possible suspected COVID-19 infection may be isolated in other wards outside the ASU. Methods: Our hospital developed an adapted ASU protocol which includes key elements for stroke unit care, can be utilized by staff not familiar with stroke care with minimal training and can be implemented in various settings. Results: The adapted protocol has 3 categories of Acute monitoring (neurological observations, blood pressure and input-output monitoring, investigations and specific post-reperfusion issues), Stroke complications (focusing on 5 common complications) and Unified team (describing daily check-ins, patient education, communication, discharge planning and post-discharge support). Conclusions: Details are presented in the article in a format that it can be adopted by other centers facing similar issues in order to ensure ASU care is not compromised.
