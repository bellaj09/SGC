a proposed lung ultrasound and phenotypic algorithm for the care of covid-19 patients with acute respiratory failure proposition d‚Äôun algorithme bas√© sur l‚Äô√©chographie pulmonaire et le ph√©notype physiologique pour la prise en charge des patients atteints de la covid-19 souffrant d‚Äôinsuffisance respiratoire aigu√´. ¬© 2020, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.Pulmonary complications are the most common clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). From recent clinical observation, two phenotypes have emerged: a low elastance or L-type and a high elastance or H-type. Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, pulmonary mechanics, radiological and ultrasound findings of these two phenotypes are different. Consequently, the therapeutic approach also varies between the two. We propose a management algorithm that combines the respiratory rate and oxygenation index with bedside lung ultrasound examination and monitoring that could help determine earlier the requirement for intubation and other surveillance of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.
