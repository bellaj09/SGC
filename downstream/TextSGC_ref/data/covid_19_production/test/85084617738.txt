chloroquine inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines by human lung explants. ¬© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

For permissions, e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.On human lung parenchymal explants, chloroquine concentration clinically achievable in the lung (100 ŒºM) inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of TNF-Œ± (by 76%), IL-6 (by 68%), CCL2 (by 72%) and CCL3 (by 67%). Beside its antiviral activity, chloroquine might also mitigate the cytokine storm associated with severe pneumonia caused by coronaviruses.
