a phase i/ii study of poziotinib combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients with her2-positive advanced gastric cancer. ¬© 2019, The International Gastric Cancer Association and The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association.Background: Poziotinib (HM781-36B) is an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets EGFR, HER2, and HER4. This prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase I/II study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluated the safety and efficacy of poziotinib combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (GC). Methods: Patients with HER2-positive GC previously treated with one line of chemotherapy received oral poziotinib (8 mg or 12 mg) once daily for 14 days, followed by 7 days off. Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 infusion) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg infusion) were administered concomitantly with poziotinib on day 1 every 3 weeks. Results: In the phase I part, 12 patients were enrolled (7 at dose level 1, 5 at dose level 2). One patient receiving poziotinib 8 mg and 2 receiving poziotinib 12 mg had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs); all DLTs were grade 4 neutropenia, one with fever. The most common poziotinib-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, stomatitis, pruritus and loss of appetite. The MTD of poziotinib was determined to be 8 mg/day and this was used in the phase II part which enrolled 32 patients. Two patients (6.3%) had complete responses and 5 (15.6%) had partial responses (objective response rate 21.9%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 13.0 weeks (95% CI 9.8‚Äì21.9) and 29.5 weeks (95% CI 17.9‚Äì59.2), respectively. Conclusions: The MTD of poziotinib combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab was 8 mg/day. This combination yielded promising anti-tumor efficacy with manageable toxicity in previously treated patients with HER2-positive GC.
