Due to the higher population density and weak health sector, the Indian government‚Äôs approach to curb the spread of this deadly virus, has been the imposition of tougher lockdowns. Perhaps, isolating and quarantining the infected and asymptomatic people is the only strategy that seems to work right now. Local administrations in India have categorized areas in different risk zones to deal with this pandemic effectively. Here, we report a COVID -19 management strategy of Ramganj, Jaipur India, using an integrated satellite remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and local knowledge-based approach to effectively tackle the contagion of this disease. We spatially defined various risk zones and the activities that can be allowed in them, in consultation with the local authorities. The study shall serve as a replica study for managing COVID-19 in India or elsewhere.
