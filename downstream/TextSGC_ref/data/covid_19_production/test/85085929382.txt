how to reorganize the radiology departments to face covid-19 outbreak. Copyright ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.Radiology Departments have been directly involved form the beginning of the COVID-19 emergency to provide imaging lung assessment of suspected and positive patients while ensuring the execution of other routine and emergency examinations for non-COVID-19 patients.To limit the risk of the infection spread, the Radiology Department should be reconfigured. We propose the example of the reorganization of the Radiology Department of our hospital, in the center of Milan, in Northern Italy, which consisted in the creation of two completely distinct pathways and distinct radiological machines for COVID-19 positive or suspected positive and for non-COVID-19 patients.
