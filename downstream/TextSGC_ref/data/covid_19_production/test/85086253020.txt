repositioning parp inhibitors for sars-cov-2 infection (covid-19); a new multi-pronged therapy for ards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Clinically approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have a mild adverse effect profile and are well-tolerated as continuous daily oral therapy. We review the evidence that justifies the repurposing of PARPi to block the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 and combat the life-threatening sequelae of COVID-19 by several mechanisms. PARPi‚Äôs can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNFŒ± levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials. PARPi can tune macrophages towards a tolerogenic phenotype. PARPi‚Äôs may also counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced and inflammation-induced cell death and support cell survival. PARPi‚Äôs had beneficial effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma and ventilator-induced lung injury. PARPi‚Äôs may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy. In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID-19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken.
