neurologic aspects of covid-19: a concise review. ¬© 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.In addition to the conventional respiratory symptoms, patients With COVID-19 can exhibit neurological complications. In this concise Review, We aim to report the most frequent neurologic manifestations related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. SARS-CoV2 can reach the central nervous system from the bloodstream or olfactory pathway by binding ACE2 receptor and the spike protein protease TMPRSS2. Headache is reported in more than 10%; of affected patients and loss of smell and taste disturbance are reported in a slightly smaller percentage of cases. Acute cerebrovascular events are diagnosed in 3%; of COVID-19 patients, but those With more severe manifestations have cerebrovascular events in more than 6%; of the cases, as reported by two retrospective studies from Italy and China. Moreover, five cases of large-vessel stroke have been described in lowsymptomatic COVID-19 patients aging less than 50 years suggesting that SARS-CoV2 can be associated With an increase of the risk of stroke in relatively young people. Peripheral nerve diseases can be observed after an apparently uneventful SARS-CoV2. Based on a literature Review, nine patients experienced Guillain-Barr√©; syndrome (GBS) and 6 of these needed mechanical ventilation. Two more cases have been described With Miller-Fisher syndrome or polyneuritis cranialis, both had rapidly resolving symptoms. In conclusion, nervous system symptoms can be observed during SARS-CoV2 infection of Which headache and smell and taste disturbance are the main symptoms reported. Cerebrovascular complications can complicate the course of COVID-19 in apparently lowrisk patients. GBS is a life-threatening manifestation of COVID-19.
