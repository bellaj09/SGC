For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.We report early findings from COVID-19 cases in Brunei suggesting a remarkably high proportion of asymptomatic (12%) and presymptomatic (30%) cases. This proportion was even higher in imported cases. These have implications for measures to prevent onward local transmission and should prompt reconsideration of current testing protocols and safe de-escalation of social distancing measures.
