Yin and Yang two concepts adapted from classical Chinese philosophy play a diagnostic role in Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM. The Yin and Yang in harmonious balance indicate health whereas imbalances to either side indicate unhealthiness which may result in diseases. Yin-yang disharmony is considered to be the cause of pathological changes. Syndrome differentiation of yin-yang is crucial to clinical diagnosis. It lays a foundation for subsequent medical judgments including therapeutic methods and formula among many others. However because of the complexities of the mechanisms and manifestations of disease it is difficult to exactly point out which one yin or yang is disharmonious. There has been inadequate research conducted on syndrome differentiation of yin and yang from a computational perspective. In this study we present a computational method viz. an end-to-end syndrome differentiation of yin deficiency and yang deficiency. End-to-End syndrome differentiation of Yin deficiency and Yang deficiency in traditional Chinese medicine.
