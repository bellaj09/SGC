"Burn care often involves procedures that result in significant pain experiences for patients which in turn can lead to poorer physical and psychological health outcomes. Distraction and virtual reality VR are an effective adjunct to pharmacological interventions in reducing pain. Much of the research that has demonstrated efficacy for VR in burn care has involved expensive and extensive technology. Thus identifying cost-effective feasible acceptable and effective approaches to apply distraction within routine burn care is important. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate key stakeholder i.e. patients providers perceptions of feasibility acceptability and effectiveness for the use of low-cost VR technology during routine burn care with adult patients. Ten adult patients used VR during burn care dressing changes in an outpatient clinic setting after which they completed a satisfaction survey and individual qualitative interview. Providers also completed a satisfaction/perception survey after each participants care. Quantitative and qualitative results from both patient and provider perspectives consistently supported the feasibility and utility of applying low-cost VR technology in this outpatient burn clinic setting. Special considerations e.g. aspects to consider when choosing an apparatus or application stemming from stakeholder feedback are discussed."
