Corona Virus Disease-2019 COVID-19 has spread widely throughout the world since the end of 2019. Nucleic acid testing NAT has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances thermal inactivation at 56\u2009C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 before NAT. However this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR tests. Potential false-negative nucleic acid testing results for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from thermal inactivation of samples with low viral loads.
