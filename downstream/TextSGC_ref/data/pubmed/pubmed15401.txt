Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common heart arrhythmia and 12-lead electrocardiogram ECG is regarded as the gold standard for AF diagnosis. Highly accurate diagnosis of AF based on 12-lead ECG is valuable and remains challenging. In this paper we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for AF detection based on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural network DDNN to detect AF in ECG waveforms with a length of 10s. A large set of 16557 12-lead ECG recordings collected from multiple hospitals and wearable ECG devices were used to evaluate the performance of the DDNN. In the test dataset 3312 12-lead ECG recordings the DDNN obtained high performance with an accuracy of 99.35\u202f\u202f0.26% a sensitivity of 99.19\u202f\u202f0.31% and a specificity of 99.44\u202f\u202f0.17%. Its high performance and automatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of AF or future screening of AF in wearable devices.
