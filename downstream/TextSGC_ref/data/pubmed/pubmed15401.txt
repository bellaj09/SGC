"This paper presents the iterative development of an artificially intelligent system to promote home-based neurorehabilitation. Although proper structured practice of rehabilitation exercises at home is the key to successful recovery of motor functions there is no home-program out there which can monitor a patients exercise-related activities and provide corrective feedback in real time. To this end we designed a Learning from Demonstration LfD based home-rehabilitation framework that combines advanced robot learning algorithms with commercially available wearable technologies. The proposed system uses exercise-related motion information and electromyography signals EMG of a patient to train a Markov Decision Process MDP. The trained MDP model can enable an agent to serve as a coach for a patient. On a system level this is the first initiative to the best of our knowledge to employ LfD in an health-care application to enable lay users to program an intelligent system. From a rehabilitation research perspective this is a completely novel initiative to employ machine learning to provide interactive corrective feedback to a patient in home settings."
