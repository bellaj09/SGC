Surgical trainees develop surgical skills using various techniques with simulators providing a safe learning environment. Fracture fixation is the most common procedure in orthopaedic surgery and residents may benefit from simulated fracture fixation. The performance of residents on a virtual simulator that allows them to practice the surgical fixation of fractures by providing a sense of touch haptics has not yet been compared with their performance using other methods of practicing fracture fixation such as a Sawbones simulator model. The purpose of this study was to assess whether residents performed similarly on a newly developed virtual simulator compared with a Sawbones simulator fracture fixation model. A comparison of orthopaedic resident performance on surgical fixation of an ulnar fracture using virtual reality and synthetic models.
