Virtual Reality VR has a variety of applications in various fields of study including social work and human performance training. Useful information regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of social cognition SC has been obtained from the use of VR. This was mainly achieved by substituting the use of simple and static stimuli that lack many of the potentially important aspects of real-world activities and social interactions with fully interactive three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter and can simulate a real-world setting as recently pointed out by Parsons et al. Virtual Reality for Research in Social Neuroscience. Brain Sciences 2017. As a consequence the cognitive training in the field of SC and broadly social neuroscience has greatly benefited from the use of VR. However specific issues concerning the VR neurophysiological underpinnings remain to be clarified as well as the social and cultural consequences of VR technologies focusing on the processing of social information and the consequences arising from the understanding of self and others. Notwithstanding it is important to remark that VR-based social neuroscience scenarios can reliably enhance the affective experience and social interactions whether added to or coupled with traditional cognitive behavioural therapy.
