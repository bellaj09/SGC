Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging resting-state fMRI is a tool for investigating the functional networks that arise during the resting state of the brain. Recent advances of the resting-state fMRI analysis suggest its feasibility for evaluating language function. The most common clinical application is for presurgical mapping of cortex for a brain tumor or for resective epilespy surgery. In this article we review the techniques and presurgical applications of resting-state fMRI analysis for language evaluation and discuss the use in the clinical setting focusing on planning for neurosurgery. Presurgical Mapping of the Language Network Using Resting-state Functional Connectivity.
