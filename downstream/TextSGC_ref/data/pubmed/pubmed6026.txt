"Alzheimers disease AD may cause damage to the memory cells permanently which results in the form of dementia. The diagnosis of Alzheimers disease at an early stage is a problematic task for researchers. For this machine learning and deep convolutional neural network CNN based approaches are readily available to solve various problems related to brain image data analysis. In clinical research magnetic resonance imaging MRI is used to diagnose AD. For accurate classification of dementia stages we need highly discriminative features obtained from MRI images. Recently advanced deep CNN-based models successfully proved their accuracy. However due to a smaller number of image samples available in the datasets there exist problems of over-fitting hindering the performance of deep learning approaches. In this research we developed a Siamese convolutional neural network SCNN model inspired by VGG-16 also called Oxford Net to classify dementia stages. In our approach we extend the insufficient and imbalanced data by using augmentation approaches. Experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset open access series of imaging studies OASIS by using the proposed approach an excellent test accuracy of 99.05% is achieved for the classification of dementia stages. We compared our model with the state-of-the-art models and discovered that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art models in terms of performance efficiency and accuracy."
