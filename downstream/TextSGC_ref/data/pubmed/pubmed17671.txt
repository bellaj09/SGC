Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to impairment in cerebellar structure and function including eyeblink conditioning. The deep cerebellar nuclei which play a critical role in cerebellar-mediated learning receive extensive inputs from brain stem and cerebellar cortex and provide the point of origin for most of the output fibers to other regions of the brain. We used in vivo 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neurochemistry in this important cerebellar region. An in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of the deep cerebellar nuclei in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
