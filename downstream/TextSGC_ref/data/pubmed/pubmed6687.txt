Illuminating the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie persistent postconcussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury mTBI is a growing area of study. Alhourani et al.  J Neurophysiol 116: 1840-1847 2016 added to this emerging body of literature with their study examining default mode network disruption in mTBI using magnetoencephalography. The findings provided enhanced insight into the neural underpinnings of mTBI which can be applied to future clinical and experimental research in this area. Network disruption following mild traumatic brain injury: clinical and experimental research implications.
