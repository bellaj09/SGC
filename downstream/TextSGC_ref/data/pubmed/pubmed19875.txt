"Bullying is an everlasting phenomenon and the first yet difficult step towards the solution is its detection. Conventional approaches for bullying incidence identification include questionnaires conversations and psychological tests. Here unlike the conventional approaches two experiments are proposed that involve visual stimuli with cases of bullying- and non-bullying- related ones set within a 2D simple video preview and a Virtual Reality VR immersive video preview context. In both experimental settings brain activity is recorded using high density HD 256 channels electroencephalogram EEG and analyzed to identify the bullying stimuli type bullying/non-bullying and context 2D/VR. The proposed classification analysis uses a convolutional neural network CNN applying deep learning on the oscillatory modes OCMs embedded within the raw HD EEG data. The extraction of OCMs from the HD EEG data is achieved with swarm decomposition SWD which efficiently accounts for the non-stationarity and noise contamination of the raw HD EEG data. Experimental results from 17 subjects indicate that the new SWD/CNN approach achieves high discrimination accuracy AUC\u2009=\u20090.987 between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type; AUC\u2009=\u20090.975 between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type and 2D/VR context paving the way for better understanding of how brains responses could act as indicators of bullying experience within immersive environments."
