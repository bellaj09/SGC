De-afferented/efferented neural ensembles can undergo causal changes when interfaced to neuroprosthetic devices. These changes occur via recruitment or isolation of neurons alterations in functional connectivity within the ensemble and/or changes in the role of neurons i.e. excitatory/inhibitory. In this work emergence of a causal network and changes in the dynamics are demonstrated for a deafferented brain region exposed to BMI brain-machine interface learning. The BMI was controlling a robot for reach-and-grasp behavior. And the motor cortical regions used for the BMI were deafferented due to chronic amputation and ensembles of neurons were decoded for velocity control of the multi-DOF robot. A generalized linear model-framework based Granger causality GLM-GC technique was used in estimating the ensemble connectivity. Model selection was based on the AIC Akaike Information Criterion.
