The results presented in this paper indicate that future on-demand Deep Brain Stimulation DBS systems for chronic use in patients with movement disorders should continuously and adaptively "learn" in order to maintain high symptom control efficacy. In this work two machine learning algorithms-Decision Tree and LArge Memory STorage And Retrieval LAMSTAR neural network both with surface Electromyography and accelerometry as control signals-are used to predict onset of tremor after DBS has been switched off in two patients one suffering from Parkinson\s disease and the other from essential tremor. The novelty of this work is that training and testing are done by using different data recorded during sessions at least one week apart. The question is whether the applied algorithms are robust to long-term operation as patient\s control signal may change over time due to disease progression displacement of the wearable sensor etc.. Various metrics are used to compare the performance of the proposed approach to those available in the literature where training and testing are done on data from the same recording session. It is shown that a 100% sensitivity is achieved for training and testing over the same session; however the sensitivity reduces when tested over a different session. The ratio of predicted stimulation-off time to observed stimulation-off time value is also found to be lower when training and testing on data from separate sessions. These results point to the need of adaptive learning in on-demand DBS systems. On the need for adaptive learning in on-demand Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders.
