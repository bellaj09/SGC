Error-related potentials ErrPs are the neural signature of error processing. Therefore the detection of ErrPs is an intuitive approach to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. The incorporation of ErrPs in discrete BCIs is well established but the study of asynchronous detection of ErrPs is still in its early stages. Here we show the feasibility of asynchronously decoding ErrPs in an online scenario. For that we measured EEG in 15 participants while they controlled a robotic arm towards a target using their right hand. In 30% of the trials the control of the robotic arm was halted at an unexpected moment error onset in order to trigger error-related potentials. When an ErrP was detected after the error onset participants regained the control of the robot and could finish the trial. Regarding the asynchronous classification in the online scenario we obtained an average true positive rate TPR of 70% and an average true negative rate TNR of 86.8%. These results indicate that the online asynchronous decoding of ErrPs was on average reliable showing the feasibility of the asynchronous decoding of ErrPs in an online scenario.
