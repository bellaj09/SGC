Although noise has a proven beneficial role in brain functions there have not been any attempts on the dedication of stochastic resonance effect in neural engineering applications especially in researches of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. In our study a steady-state motion visual evoked potential SSMVEP-based BCI with periodic visual stimulation plus moderate spatiotemporal noise can achieve better offline and online performance due to enhancement of periodic components in brain responses which was accompanied by suppression of high harmonics. Offline results behaved with a bell-shaped resonance-like functionality and 7-36% online performance improvements can be achieved when identical visual noise was adopted for different stimulation frequencies. Using neural encoding modeling these phenomena can be explained as noise-induced input-output synchronization in human sensory systems which commonly possess a low-pass property. Our work demonstrated that noise could boost BCIs in addressing human needs. Addition of visual noise boosts evoked potential-based brain-computer interface.
