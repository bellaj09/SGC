"Women in math science and engineering MSE often face stereotype threat: they fear that their performance in MSE will confirm an existing negative stereotype-that women are bad at math-which in turn may impair their learning and performance in math. This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition the research examined if learners avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Specifically a 2 avatar gender: female vs. male\u2009\u20092 instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our findings extend previous research in physical learning settings suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine womens learning outcomes in virtual classrooms. Implications for gender achievement gaps and stereotype threat are discussed."
