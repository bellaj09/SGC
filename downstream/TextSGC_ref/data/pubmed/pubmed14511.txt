The main goal of this work is to automatically segment colorectal tumors in 3D T2-weighted T2w MRI with reasonable accuracy. For such a purpose a novel deep learning-based algorithm suited for volumetric colorectal tumor segmentation is proposed. The proposed CNN architecture based on densely connected neural network contains multiscale dense interconnectivity between layers of fine and coarse scales thus leveraging multiscale contextual information in the network to get better flow of information throughout the network. Additionally the 3D level-set algorithm was incorporated as a postprocessing task to refine contours of the network predicted segmentation. The method was assessed on T2-weighted 3D MRI of 43 patients diagnosed with locally advanced colorectal tumor cT3/T4. Cross validation was performed in 100 rounds by partitioning the dataset into 30 volumes for training and 13 for testing. Three performance metrics were computed to assess the similarity between predicted segmentation and the ground truth i.e. manual segmentation by an expert radiologist/oncologist including Dice similarity coefficient DSC recall rate RR and average surface distance ASD. The above performance metrics were computed in terms of mean and standard deviation mean\u2009\u2009standard deviation. The DSC RR and ASD were 0.8406\u2009\u20090.0191 0.8513\u2009\u20090.0201 and 2.6407\u2009\u20092.7975 before postprocessing and these performance metrics became 0.8585\u2009\u20090.0184 0.8719\u2009\u20090.0195 and 2.5401\u2009\u20092.402 after postprocessing respectively. We compared our proposed method to other existing volumetric medical image segmentation baseline methods particularly 3D U-net and DenseVoxNet in our segmentation tasks. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method has achieved better performance in colorectal tumor segmentation in volumetric MRI than the other baseline techniques.
