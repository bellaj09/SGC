Seven commercial Chinese chrysanthemum tea products were classified by computer vision combined with machine learning algorithms. Without the need of building any specific hardware the image acquisition was achieved in two computer vision approaches. In the first approach a series of multivariate classification models were built after morphological feature extraction of the image. The best prediction accuracies when classifying flowering stages and tea types were respectively 90% and 63%. In comparison the deep neural network was applied directly on the raw image yielded 96% and 89% correct identifications when classifying flowering stage and tea type respectively. The model can be applied for rapid and automatic quality determination of teas and other related foods. The result indicated that computer vision especially when combined with deep learning or other machine learning techniques can be a convenient and versatile method in the evaluation of food quality. Rapid identification of chrysanthemum teas by computer vision and deep learning.
