Electronic displays have become an integral part of life in the developed world since the revolution of mobile computing a decade ago. With the release of multiple consumer-grade virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR products in the past 2 years utilizing head-mounted displays HMDs as well as the development of low-cost smartphone-based HMDs the ability to intimately interact with electronic screens is greater than ever. VR/AR HMDs also place the display at much closer ocular proximity than traditional electronic devices while also isolating the user from the ambient environment to create a "closed" system between the user\s eyes and the display. Whether the increased interaction with these devices places the user\s retina at higher risk of damage is currently unclear. Herein the authors review the discovery of photochemical damage of the retina from visible light as well as summarize relevant clinical and preclinical data regarding the influence of modern display devices on retinal health. Multiple preclinical studies have been performed with modern light-emitting diode technology demonstrating damage to the retina at modest exposure levels particularly from blue-light wavelengths. Unfortunately high-quality in-human studies are lacking and the small clinical investigations performed to date have failed to keep pace with the rapid evolutions in display technology. Clinical investigations assessing the effect of HMDs on human retinal function are also yet to be performed. From the available data modern consumer electronic displays do not appear to pose any acute risk to vision with average use; however future studies with well-defined clinical outcomes and illuminance metrics are needed to better understand the long-term risks of cumulative exposure to electronic displays in general and with "closed" VR/AR HMDs in particular.
