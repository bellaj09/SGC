"Virtual reality VR has provoked enormous interest in the medical community. In particular VR offers therapists new approaches for improving rehabilitation effects. However most of these VR assistant tools are not very portable extensible or economical. Due to the vast amount of 3D data they are not suitable for Internet transfer. Furthermore in order to run these VR systems smoothly special hardware devices are needed. As a result existing VR assistant tools tend to be available in hospitals but not in patients homes. To overcome these disadvantages as a case study this paper proposes a Web-based Virtual Ticket Machine called WBVTM using VRML VRML Consortium The Virtual Reality Modeling Language: International Standard ISO/IEC DIS 14772-1 1997 available at  Java and EAI External Authoring Interface Silicon Graphics Inc. The External Authoring Interface EAI available at  to help people with acquired brain injury ABI to relearn basic living skills at home at a low cost. As these technologies are open standard and feature usability on the Internet WBVTM achieves the goals of portability easy accessibility and cost-effectiveness." A Web-based cost-effective training tool with possible application to brain injury rehabilitation.
