Our primary objectives were to create a reliable noninvasive method for three-dimensional morphometry of deep bony parameters within the sigmoid notch of the distal radius to identify its morphological patterns and to identify any significant variation between the left and the right wrists. Our secondary objectives were to obtain morphometric values that could represent our population and to identify any possible ethnic variations. A three-dimensional virtual morphometry study of the sigmoid notch of the distal radius.
