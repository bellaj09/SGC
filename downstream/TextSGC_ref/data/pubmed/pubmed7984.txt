Federated learning obtains a central model on the server by aggregating models trained locally on clients. As a result federated learning does not require clients to upload their data to the server thereby preserving the data privacy of the clients. One challenge in federated learning is to reduce the client-server communication since the end devices typically have very limited communication bandwidth. This article presents an enhanced federated learning technique by proposing an asynchronous learning strategy on the clients and a temporally weighted aggregation of the local models on the server. In the asynchronous learning strategy different layers of the deep neural networks DNNs are categorized into shallow and deep layers and the parameters of the deep layers are updated less frequently than those of the shallow layers. Furthermore a temporally weighted aggregation strategy is introduced on the server to make use of the previously trained local models thereby enhancing the accuracy and convergence of the central model. The proposed algorithm is empirically on two data sets with different DNNs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous federated deep learning outperforms the baseline algorithm both in terms of communication cost and model accuracy.
