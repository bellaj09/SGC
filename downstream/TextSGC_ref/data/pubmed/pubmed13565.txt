"Screen-based computer simulations are considered a method of skill teaching in health education. This study examined the effect of screen-based computer simulation on knowledge skill and the clinical decision-making process in teaching preoperative and postoperative care management to second-year students in an undergraduate school of nursing. It is a randomized controlled study. The study sample was composed of 82 students. They received education in screen-based computer simulation n = 41 and skill laboratories n = 41. Three instruments were used: a preoperative and postoperative care management cognitive level assessment test skill control lists of preoperative and postoperative care management and the Clinical Decision Making in Nursing Scale. There was not a significant difference between the students posteducation knowledge levels P = .421 practical deep breathing and coughing exercise education skills P = .867 or clinical decision-making scale total and subscale scores P = .065. However a significant difference was found between the admission of the patient in the surgical clinic after surgery skill scores of the students P = .04. Education provided in the screen-based computer simulation laboratory was equivalent to that provided in the skill laboratory."
