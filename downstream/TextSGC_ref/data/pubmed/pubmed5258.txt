Here we test the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson\s disease PD moves stereotypically along neural networks possibly reflecting the spread of toxic alpha-synuclein molecules. PD patients n\u2009=\u2009105 and matched controls n\u2009=\u200957 underwent T1-MRI at entry and 1 year later as part of the Parkinson\s Progression Markers Initiative. Over this period PD patients demonstrate significantly greater cortical thinning than controls in parts of the left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity measured functionally or structurally to a "disease reservoir" evaluated by MRI at baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one described in certain cases of Alzheimer\s disease. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex in PD follows neuronal connectivity and that disease spread to the cortex may herald the onset of cognitive impairment. "Network connectivity determines cortical thinning in early Parkinsons disease progression."
