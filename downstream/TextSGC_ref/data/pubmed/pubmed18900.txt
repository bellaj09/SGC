Recent work on brightness color and form has suggested that human visual percepts represent the probable sources of retinal images rather than stimulus features as such. Here we investigate the plausibility of this empirical concept of vision by allowing autonomous agents to evolve in virtual environments based solely on the relative success of their behavior. The responses of evolved agents to visual stimuli indicate that fitness improves as the neural network control systems gradually incorporate the statistical relationship between projected images and behavior appropriate to the sources of the inherently ambiguous images. These results: 1 demonstrate the merits of a wholly empirical strategy of animal vision as a means of contending with the inverse optics problem; 2 argue that the information incorporated into biological visual processing circuitry is the relationship between images and their probable sources; and 3 suggest why human percepts do not map neatly onto physical reality.
