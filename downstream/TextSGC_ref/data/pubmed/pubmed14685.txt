"With the growing global acceptance of cannabis and its widespread use by eyewitnesses and suspects in legal cases understanding the popular drugs ramifications for memory is a pressing need. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial we examined the acute and delayed effects of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol THC intoxication on susceptibility to false memory in 64 healthy volunteers. Memory was tested immediately encoding and retrieval under drug influence and 1 wk later retrieval sober. We used three different methods associative word lists and two misinformation tasks using virtual reality. Across all methods we found evidence for enhanced false-memory effects in intoxicated participants. Specifically intoxicated participants showed higher false recognition in the associative word-list task both at immediate and delayed test than controls. This yes bias became increasingly strong with decreasing levels of association between studied and test items. In a misinformation task intoxicated participants were more susceptible to false-memory creation using a virtual-reality eyewitness scenario and virtual-reality perpetrator scenario. False-memory effects were mostly restricted to the acute-intoxication phase. Cannabis seems to increase false-memory proneness with decreasing strength of association between an event and a test item as assessed by different false-memory paradigms. Our findings have implications for how and when the police should interview suspects and eyewitnesses." Cannabis increases susceptibility to false memory.
