N6-methyladenosine m6A is a prevalent RNA methylation modification involved in several biological processes. Hundreds or thousands of m6A sites identified from different species using high-throughput experiments provides a rich resource to construct in-silico approaches for identifying m6A sites. The existing m6A predictors are developed using conventional machine-learning ML algorithms and most are species-centric. In this paper we develop a novel cross-species deep-learning classifier based on bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit BGRU for the prediction of m6A sites. In comparison with conventional ML approaches BGRU achieves outstanding performance for the Mammalia dataset that contains over fifty thousand m6A sites but inferior for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset that covers around a thousand positives. The accuracy of BGRU is sensitive to the data size and the sensitivity is compensated by the integration of a random forest classifier with a novel encoding of enhanced nucleic acid content. The integrated approach dubbed as BGRU-based Ensemble RNA Methylation site Predictor BERMP has competitive performance in both cross-validation test and independent test. BERMP also outperforms existing m6A predictors for different species. Therefore BERMP is a novel multi-species tool for identifying m6A sites with high confidence.
