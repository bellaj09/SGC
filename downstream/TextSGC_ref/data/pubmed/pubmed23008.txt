Restoration of speech communication for locked-in patients by means of brain computer interfaces BCIs is currently an important area of active research. Among the neural signals obtained from intracranial recordings single/multi-unit activity SUA/MUA local field potential LFP and electrocorticography ECoG are good candidates for an input signal for BCIs. However the question of which signal or which combination of the three signal modalities is best suited for decoding speech production remains unverified. In order to record SUA LFP and ECoG simultaneously from a highly localized area of human ventral sensorimotor cortex vSMC we fabricated an electrode the size of which was 7 by 13 mm containing sparsely arranged microneedle and conventional macro contacts. We determined which signal modality is the most capable of decoding speech production and tested if the combination of these signals could improve the decoding accuracy of spoken phonemes. Feature vectors were constructed from spike frequency obtained from SUAs and event-related spectral perturbation derived from ECoG and LFP signals then input to the decoder. The results showed that the decoding accuracy for five spoken vowels was highest when features from multiple signals were combined and optimized for each subject and reached 59% when averaged across all six subjects. This result suggests that multi-scale signals convey complementary information for speech articulation. The current study demonstrated that simultaneous recording of multi-scale neuronal activities could raise decoding accuracy even though the recording area is limited to a small portion of cortex which is advantageous for future implementation of speech-assisting BCIs.
