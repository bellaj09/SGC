"With experience we become accustomed to the types of environments that we normally encounter as we navigate in the world. But how does this fundamental knowledge develop in the first place and what brain regions are involved? To examine de novo environmental learning we created an alien virtual reality world populated with landmarks of which participants had no prior experience. They learned about this environment by moving within it during functional MRI fMRI scanning while we tracked their evolving knowledge. Retrosplenial cortex RSC played a central and highly selective role by representing only the most stable permanent features in this world. Subsequently increased coupling was noted between RSC and hippocampus with hippocampus then expressing knowledge of permanent landmark locations and overall environmental layout. Studying how environmental representations emerge from scratch provided a new window into the information processing underpinning the brains navigation system highlighting the key influence of the RSC."
