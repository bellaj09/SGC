We appreciate the detailed review provided by Magge et al1 of our article "Deep learning for pharmacovigilance: recurrent neural network architectures for labeling adverse drug reactions in Twitter posts." 2 In their letter they present a subjective criticism that rests on concerns about our dataset composition and potential misinterpretation of comparisons to existing methods. Our article underwent two rounds of extensive peer review and has been cited 28 times1 in the nearly 2 years since it was published online February 2017. Neither the reviewers nor the citing authors raised similar concerns. There are however portions of the commentary that highlight areas of our work that would benefit from further clarification.
