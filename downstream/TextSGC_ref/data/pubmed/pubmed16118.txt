Previous reports suggest that the administration of epinephrine increases learning during deep barbiturate-chloral hydrate anesthesia in rats but not during anesthesia with 0.4% isoflurane in rabbits. We revisited this issue using fear conditioning to a tone in rats as our experimental model for learning and memory and isoflurane and desflurane as our anesthetics. Expressed as a fraction of the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration MAC preventing movement in 50% of rats the amnestic 50% effective dose ED50 for fear to tone in control rats inhaling isoflurane and injected with saline intraperitoneally i.p. was 0.32 +/- 0.03 MAC mean +/- se compared with 0.37 +/- 0.06 MAC in rats injected with 0.01 mg/kg of epinephrine i.p. and 0.38 +/- 0.03 MAC in rats injected with 0.1 mg/kg of epinephrine i.p. For desflurane the amnestic ED50 were 0.32 +/- 0.05 MAC in control rats receiving a saline injection i.p. versus 0.36 +/- 0.04 MAC in rats injected with 0.1 mg/kg of epinephrine i.p. We conclude that exogenous epinephrine does not decrease amnesia produced by inhaled isoflurane or desflurane as assessed by fear conditioning to a tone in rats. Administration of epinephrine does not increase learning of fear to tone in rats anesthetized with isoflurane or desflurane.
