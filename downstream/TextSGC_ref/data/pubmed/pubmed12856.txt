This paper investigates a rapid and accurate detection system for spoilage in meat. We use unsupervised feature learning techniques stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and auto-encoders that consider only the transient response from undoped zinc oxide manganese-doped zinc oxide and fluorine-doped zinc oxide in order to classify three categories: the type of thin film that is used the type of gas and the approximate ppm-level of the gas. These models mainly offer the advantage that features are learned from data instead of being hand-designed. We compare our results to a feature-based approach using samples with various ppm level of ethanol and trimethylamine TMA that are good markers for meat spoilage. The result is that deep networks give a better and faster classification than the feature-based approach and we thus conclude that the fine-tuning of our deep models are more efficient for this kind of multi-label classification task.
