Among the major challenges in training predictive models in wireless health is adapting them to new individuals or groups of people. This is not trivial largely due to possible differences in the distribution of data between a new individual in a real-world deployment and the training data used for building the model. In this study we aim to tackle this problem by employing recent advancements in deep Domain Adaptation which tries to transfer a model trained on a labeled dataset to a new unlabeled one that follows a different distribution as well. To show the benefits of our approach we transfer an activity recognition model trained on a popular adult dataset to children. We show that direct use of the adult model on children loses 25.2% in F1-score against a supervised baseline while our proposed transfer approach reduces this to 9%.
