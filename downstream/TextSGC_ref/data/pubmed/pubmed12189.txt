We present a deep learning architecture Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs for automatic classification and recognition of reprogramming and reprogrammed human Induced Pluripotent Stem iPS cell regions in microscopy images. The differentiated cells that possibly undergo reprogramming to iPS cells can be detected by this method for screening reagents or culture conditions in iPS induction. The learning results demonstrate that our CNNs can achieve the Top-1 and Top-2 error rates of 9.2% and 0.84% respectively to produce probability maps for the automatic analysis. The implementation results show that this automatic method can successfully detect and localize the human iPS cell formation thereby yield a potential tool for helping iPS cell culture.
