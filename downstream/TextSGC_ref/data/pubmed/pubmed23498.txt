Pharmacological agents acting at alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are widely used in physiology and neuroscience research. Mounting evidence of their potential utility in clinical and experimental psychopharmacology necessitates new models and novel model organisms for their screening. Here we characterize behavioral effects of mafedine 6-oxo-1-phenyl-2- phenylamino-16-dihydropyrimidine-4-sodium olate a novel drug with alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonistic effects in adult zebrafish Danio rerio in the novel tank test of anxiety and activity. Following an acute 20-min exposure mafedine at 60\u2009mg/L produced a mild psychostimulant action with some anxiogenic-like effects. Repeated acute 20-min/day administration of mafedine for 7 consecutive days at 1 5 and 10\u2009mg/L had a similar action on fish behavior as an acute exposure to 60\u2009mg/L. Since mafedine demonstrated robust behavioral effects in zebrafish - a sensitive vertebrate aquatic model it is likely that it may modulate rodent and human behavior as well. Thus further studies are needed to explore this possibility in detail and whether it may foster clinical application of mafedine and related alpha-2 adrenergic agents. Pharmacological screening of a new alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist mafedine in zebrafish.
