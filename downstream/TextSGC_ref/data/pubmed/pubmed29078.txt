In this paper we report the performance of 9-11-year-old children using a steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI and provide control data collected from adults for comparison. Children in our study achieved a much higher performance 79% accuracy; average age 9.64 years old than the only previous investigation of children using an SSVEP-based BCI 50% accuracy; average age 9.86 years old. The performance of 9-11-year-old children using an SSVEP-based BCI for target selection.
