Previous research has found that functional connectivity FC can accurately predict the identity of a subject performing a task and the type of task being performed. These results are replicated using a large data set collected at the Ohio State University Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Brain Imaging. This work introduces a novel perspective on task and subject identity prediction: blood-oxygen-level-dependent variability BV. Conceptually BV is a region-specific measure based on the variance within each brain region. BV is simple to compute interpret and visualize. This work shows that both FC and BV are predictive of task and subject even across scanning sessions separated by multiple years. Subject differences rather than task differences account for the majority of changes in BV and FC. Similar to results in FC BV is reduced during cognitive tasks relative to rest.
