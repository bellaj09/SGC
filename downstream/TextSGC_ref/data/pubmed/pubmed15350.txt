"The author explores the concept of reality-testing as a means of assessing the relationship with reality that prevails in dream and in virtual reality. Based on a model developed by Jean Laplanche she compares these activities in detail in order to determine their respective independence from the function of reality-testing. By carefully examining the concept of hallucination in the writings of Freud and Daniel Dennett the author seeks to pinpoint the specific modalities of interaction between perceptions ideas wishes and actions that converge in the belief and in the sense of reality. The papers main thesis consists of the distinction that it draws between immediacy-testing and reality-testing with the further argument that this distinction not only dissipates the conceptual vagueness that generally surrounds the latter of the two concepts but also that it promotes a more precise analysis of the function of reality in dream and in virtual reality."
