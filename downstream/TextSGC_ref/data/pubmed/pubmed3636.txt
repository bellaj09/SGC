Large-scale connectomics requires dense staining of neuronal tissue blocks for electron microscopy EM. Here we report a large-volume dense en-bloc EM staining protocol that overcomes the staining gradients which so far substantially limited the reconstructable volumes in three-dimensional 3D EM. Our protocol provides densely reconstructable tissue blocks from mouse neocortex sized at least 1\u2009mm in diameter. By relaxing the constraints on precise topographic sample targeting it makes the correlated functional and structural analysis of neuronal circuits realistic.
