This paper mainly focuses on the deep learning application in classifying the stage of diabetic retinopathy and detecting the laterality of the eye using funduscopic images. Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic progressive sight-threatening disease of the retinal blood vessels. Ophthalmologists diagnose diabetic retinopathy through early funduscopic screening. Normally there is a time delay in reporting and intervention apart from the financial cost and risk of blindness associated with it. Using a convolutional neural network based approach for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy we trained the prediction network on the publicly available Kaggle dataset. Approximately 35000 images were used to train the network which observed a sensitivity of 80.28% and a specificity of 92.29% on the validation dataset of ~53000 images. Using 8810 images the network was trained for detecting the laterality of the eye and observed an accuracy of 93.28% on the validation set of 8816 images.
