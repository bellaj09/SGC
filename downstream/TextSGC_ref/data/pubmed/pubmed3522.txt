"With great progress of space navigation technology it becomes possible to travel beyond Earths gravity. So far it remains unclear whether the human brain can function normally within an environment of microgravity and confinement. Particularly it is a challenge to figure out some neuroimaging-based markers for rapid screening diagnosis of disrupted brain function in microgravity environment. In this study a 7-day -6 head down tilt bed rest experiment was used to simulate the microgravity and twenty healthy male participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and after the simulated microgravity experiment. We used a multivariate pattern analysis approach to distinguish the brain states with simulated microgravity from normal gravity based on the functional connectivity within the default network resulting in an accuracy of no less than 85\xa0% via cross-validation. Moreover most discriminative functional connections were mainly located between the limbic system and cortical areas and were enhanced after simulated microgravity implying a self-adaption or compensatory enhancement to fulfill the need of complex demand in spatial navigation and motor control functions in microgravity environment. Overall the findings suggest that the brain states in microgravity are likely different from those in normal gravity and that brain connectome could act as a biomarker to indicate the brain state in microgravity." Default network connectivity decodes brain states with simulated microgravity.
