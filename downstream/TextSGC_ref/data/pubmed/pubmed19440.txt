"This chapter explores the creation and use of interactive three-dimensional 3D digital models for anatomy and medical education. Firstly it looks back over the history and development of virtual 3D anatomy resources before outlining some of the current means of their creation; including photogrammetry CT and surface scanning and digital modelling outlining advantages and disadvantages for each. Various means of distribution are explored including; virtual learning environments websites interactive PDFs virtual and augmented reality bespoke applications and 3D printing with a particular focus on the level of interactivity each method offers. Finally and perhaps most importantly the use of such models for education is discussed. Questions addressed include; How can such models best be used to enhance student learning? How can they be used in the classroom? How can they be used for self-directed study? As well as exploring if they could one\xa0day replace human specimens and how they complement the rise of online and e-learning." Interactive 3D Digital Models for Anatomy and Medical Education.
