Two opposing points of view have been presented with regard to the applicability of the dual-route reading models Spanish. Some authors maintain that given the transparency of the reading system non-lexical reading is the strategy followed predominantly by Spanish readers and for that reason these models are not appropriate to explain alexias acquired dyslexias in Spanish. Other authors consider that since several cases of phonological surface and deep alexia have been reported dual-route reading models are applicable to Spanish in the same way that to the irregular writing systems. In order to contrast these two points of view an analysis of the two main factors that influence the reading is made: characteristics of the Spanish orthography and characteristics of the Spanish readers. It is conclude that 1 Due to its transparency non-lexical reading represents -as in other transparent orthographies-- the initial reading strategy in Spanish; 2 the "reading threshold" i.e. time required to become literate is lower in Spanish because there are no irregular words to learn; 3 as reading experience increases speed increases and lexical reading becomes used more; 4 Given the characteristics of the Spanish reading system it is understandable that frequency of deep dyslexia is so low.
