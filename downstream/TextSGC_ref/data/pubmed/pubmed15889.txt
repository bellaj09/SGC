"In body ownership illusions participants feel that a mannequin or virtual body VB is their own. Earlier results suggest that body ownership over a body seen from behind in extra personal space is possible when the surrogate body is visually stroked and tapped on its back while spatially and temporal synchronous tactile stimulation is applied to the participants back. This result has been disputed with the claim that the results can be explained by self-recognition rather than somatic body ownership. We carried out an experiment with 30 participants in a between-groups design. They all saw the back of a VB 1.2 m in front that moved in real-time determined by upper body motion capture. All felt tactile stimulation on their back and for 15 of them this was spatially and temporally synchronous with stimulation that they saw on the back of the VB but asynchronous for the other 15. After 3 min a revolving fan above the VB descended and stopped at the position of the VB neck. A questionnaire assessed referral of touch to the VB body ownership the illusion of drifting forwards toward the VB and the VB drifting backwards. Heart rate deceleration HRD and the amount of head movement during the threat period were used to assess the response to the threat from the fan. Results showed that although referral of touch was significantly greater in the synchronous condition than the asynchronous there were no other differences between the conditions. However a further multivariate analysis revealed that in the visuotactile synchronous condition HRD and head movement increased with the illusion of forward drift and decreased with backwards drift. Body ownership contributed positively to these drift sensations. Our conclusion is that the setup results in a contradiction-somatic feelings associated with a distant body-that the brain attempts to resolve by generating drift illusions that would make the two bodies coincide."
