"Using landmarks and other scene features to recall locations from new viewpoints is a critical skill in spatial cognition. In an immersive virtual reality task we asked children 3.5-4.5\xa0years old to remember the location of a target using various cues. On some trials they could use information from their own self-motion. On some trials they could use a view match. In the very hardest kind of trial they were teleported to a new viewpoint and could only use an allocentric spatial representation. This approach provides a strict test for allocentric coding without either a matching viewpoint or self-motion information while avoiding additional task demands in previous studies it does not require them to deal with a small table-top environment or to manage stronger cue conflicts. Both the younger and older groups were able to point back at the target location better than chance when they could use view matching and/or self-motion but allocentric recall was only seen in the older group 4.0-4.5. In addition we only obtained evidence for a specific kind of allocentric recall in the older group: they tracked one major axis of the space significantly above chance r158\xa0=\xa0.28 but not the other r158\xa0=\xa0-.01. We conclude that there is a major qualitative change in coding for spatial recall around the fourth birthday potentially followed by further development towards fully flexible recall from new viewpoints."
