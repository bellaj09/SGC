"Rewards have various effects on human behavior and multiple representations in the human brain. Behaviorally rewards notably enhance response vigor in incentive motivation paradigms and bias subsequent choices in instrumental learning paradigms. Neurally rewards affect activity in different fronto-striatal regions attached to different motor effectors for instance in left and right hemispheres for the two hands. Here we address the question of whether manipulating reward-related brain activity has local or general effects with respect to behavioral paradigms and motor effectors. Neuronal activity was manipulated in a single hemisphere using unilateral deep brain stimulation DBS in patients with Parkinsons disease. Results suggest that DBS amplifies the representation of reward magnitude within the targeted hemisphere so as to affect the behavior of the contralateral hand specifically. These unilateral DBS effects on behavior include both boosting incentive motivation and biasing instrumental choices. Furthermore using computational modeling we show that DBS effects on incentive motivation can predict DBS effects on instrumental learning or vice versa. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of causally manipulating reward-related neuronal activity in humans in a manner that is specific to a class of motor effectors but that generalizes to different computational processes. As these findings proved independent from therapeutic effects on parkinsonian motor symptoms they might provide insight into DBS impact on non-motor disorders such as apathy or hypomania."
