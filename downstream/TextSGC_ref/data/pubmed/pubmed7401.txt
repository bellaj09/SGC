Roifman syndrome OMIM# 616651 is a complex syndrome encompassing skeletal dysplasia immunodeficiency retinal dystrophy and developmental delay and is caused by compound heterozygous mutations involving the Stem II region and one of the other domains of the RNU4ATAC gene. This small nuclear RNA gene is essential for minor intron splicing. The Canadian Centre for Primary Immunodeficiency Registry and Repository were used to derive patient information as well as tissues. Utilising RNA sequencing methodologies we analysed samples from patients with Roifman syndrome and assessed intron retention. We demonstrate that a homozygous mutation in Stem II is sufficient to cause the full spectrum of features associated with typical Roifman syndrome. Further we demonstrate the same pattern of aberration in minor intron retention as found in cases with compound heterozygous mutations. A homozygous mutation in the stem II domain of RNU4ATAC causes typical Roifman syndrome.
