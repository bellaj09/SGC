"The field of computer assisted minimally invasive surgery is rapidly expanding worldwide including in India. With more hospitals in India contemplating the acquisition of a robotic platform training of robotic surgeons is becoming essential. Virtual reality simulators can be used for surgeons to become acquainted with the robotic console prior to live surgery. Our aim was to evaluate the amount of simulator training required before a surgeon first operates on the da Vinci Surgical System. Simulations were conducted on the Intuitive Surgicals da Vinci Robot Skill Simulator using the software obtained from Mimic Technologies. Participants included attending staff surgeons experienced in robotic surgery and novices. A set of seven activities were chosen for each participant. Based on the mean exercise score from the first attempt staff surgeons outperformed the novices in all exercises. However the difference in score between the staff and the novices decreased after the participants repeated the exercises and by the sixth attempt most of the novices obtained similar scores to the staff suggesting that this might be at present the minimum set of repetitions indicated or required prior to performing life robotic surgery."
