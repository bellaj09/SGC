Canonical correlation analysis CCA has been widely used in the detection of the steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs in brain-computer interfaces BCIs. The standard CCA method which uses sinusoidal signals as reference signals was first proposed for SSVEP detection without calibration. However the detection performance can be deteriorated by the interference from the spontaneous EEG activities. Recently various extended methods have been developed to incorporate individual EEG calibration data in CCA to improve the detection performance. Although advantages of the extended CCA methods have been demonstrated in separate studies a comprehensive comparison between these methods is still missing. This study performed a comparison of the existing CCA-based SSVEP detection methods using a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects in a simulated online BCI experiment. Classification accuracy and information transfer rate ITR were used for performance evaluation. The results suggest that individual calibration data can significantly improve the detection performance. Furthermore the results showed that the combination method based on the standard CCA and the individual template based CCA IT-CCA achieved the highest performance.
