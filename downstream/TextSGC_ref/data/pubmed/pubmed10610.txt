In this paper we aim to extract the aortic knuckle AK contour in chest radiographs an anatomical structure rarely being addressed in the literature. Since the AK structure is small and thin simply adopting the deep network methods that are successful for large organ segmentation is inadequate for achieving good pixel-level accuracy and resolving local ambiguities. To address this challenge we propose a new coarse-to-fine segmentation approach which focuses on global and local information contexts respectively. Two convolutional networks are used. For the coarse segmentation we use FasterRCNN; for the fine segmentation we use U-Net. Our evaluation uses the publicly available JSRT dataset; the results are promising. Besides presenting these results we analyze issues such as the imprecision of manual contour marking and automatic generation of the coarse segmentation ground-truth mask used for deep network training. Our approach is general and can be applied to extract other curve-like objects-of-interest. Extraction of Aortic Knuckle Contour in Chest Radiographs Using Deep Learning.
