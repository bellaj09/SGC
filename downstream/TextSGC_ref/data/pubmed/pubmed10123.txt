"Vascular cognitive impairment VCI plays an important role in dementia in elderly people and refers to the contribution of vascular pathology to the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders ranging from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia as well as the pathological spectrum from pure Alzheimer disease through degrees of vascular comorbidity to pure vascular dementia. In the present study we investigated the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and systemic metabolic disorders by employing deep learning DL. We studied 202 patients 73.4\xa0\xa013.0\xa0years 94.6% of whom were undergoing treatment for lifestyle diseases and 68.8% of whom had a history of cerebrovascular disorder. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction by performing a Mini Mental State Examination MMSE. We performed general blood examination including Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel and measured cerebral blood oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex PFC using time-resolved near infrared spectroscopy TNIRS. We then used deep neural networks to assess the MMSE scores of the subjects based on the TNIRS parameters and the blood examination data independently. Next we compared predicted MMSE scores based on the TNIRS and the blood examination. There was a significant positive correlation between the TNIRS parameters and the blood examination data r\xa0=\xa00.6 p\xa0<\xa00.01. These observations suggest that cognitive dysfunction in patients with VCI may be caused by combinations of systemic metabolic disorders such as energy and oxygen metabolisms and cerebral circulatory disturbance due to arteriosclerosis resulting from lifestyle-related diseases."
