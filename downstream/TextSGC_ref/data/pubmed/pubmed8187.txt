Structural finite-element analysis FEA has been widely used to study the biomechanics of human tissues and organs as well as tissue-medical device interactions and treatment strategies. However patient-specific FEA models usually require complex procedures to set up and long computing times to obtain final simulation results preventing prompt feedback to clinicians in time-sensitive clinical applications. In this study by using machine learning techniques we developed a deep learning DL model to directly estimate the stress distributions of the aorta. The DL model was designed and trained to take the input of FEA and directly output the aortic wall stress distributions bypassing the FEA calculation process. The trained DL model is capable of predicting the stress distributions with average errors of 0.492% and 0.891% in the Von Mises stress distribution and peak Von Mises stress respectively. This study marks to our knowledge the first study that demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the DL technique as a fast and accurate surrogate of FEA for stress analysis.
