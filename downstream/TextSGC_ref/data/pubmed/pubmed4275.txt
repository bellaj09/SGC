While the right-hemispheric lateralization of the face perception network is well established recent evidence suggests that handedness affects the cerebral lateralization of face processing at the hierarchical level of the fusiform face area FFA. However the neural mechanisms underlying differential hemispheric lateralization of face perception in right- and left-handers are largely unknown. Using dynamic causal modeling DCM for fMRI we aimed to unravel the putative processes that mediate handedness-related differences by investigating the effective connectivity in the bilateral core face perception network. Our results reveal an enhanced recruitment of the left FFA in left-handers compared to right-handers as evidenced by more pronounced face-specific modulatory influences on both intra- and interhemispheric connections. As structural and physiological correlates of handedness-related differences in face processing right- and left-handers varied with regard to their gray matter volume in the left fusiform gyrus and their pupil responses to face stimuli. Overall these results describe how handedness is related to the lateralization of the core face perception network and point to different neural mechanisms underlying face processing in right- and left-handers. In a wider context this demonstrates the entanglement of structurally and functionally remote brain networks suggesting a broader underlying process regulating brain lateralization. Handedness is related to neural mechanisms underlying hemispheric lateralization of face processing.
