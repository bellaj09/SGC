Abdominal sacral hystero-cervicopexy ASC is the gold standard for the treatment of apical prolapse but requires advanced laparoscopic skills and exposes to potentially life-threatening complications. Lateral apical suspension to the abdominal wall with mesh is a feasible alternative of ASC where robotic assistance may offer specific advantages. We here describe the surgical technique and the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted lateral apical suspension R-ALS with the use of a titan-covered T-shaped mesh.
