"A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is critically reduced or blocked potentially resulting in motor paralysis. One of the most promising and effective neurorehabilitation methods for strokes is a closed-loop brain-computer interface BCI based on the motor imagery MI. For the design of MI-based BCI action observation AO during MI facilitates the detection of a users motor intention. In this paper we investigated whether or not the AOs targeted objects the hand of a participant or another person affects brain activity during MI. To investigate the differences in brain activity induced by the targeted objection we recorded electroencephalography EEG data of 15 healthy right-handed males during three different conditions: 1 MI and AO of a participants hand MI + ownAO; 2 MI and AO of a non-participants hand MI + otherAO; and 3 MI only. The results showed that the event-related desynchronization ERD responses in the alpha frequency band 8-13 Hz during MI + ownAO over the sensorimotor area at the C3 and C4 channel locations were stronger than those during the other two conditions. The results also showed that the difference between the participants and non-participants hands affected ERD responses during MI + ownAO and MI + otherAO."
