"Seeking to apply brain-machine interface technology in neuroprosthetics a number of methods for predicting trajectory of the elbow and wrist have been proposed and have shown remarkable results. Recently the prediction of hand trajectory and classification of hand gestures or grasping types have attracted considerable attention. However trajectory prediction for precise finger motion has remained a challenge. We proposed a method for the prediction of fingertip motions from electrocorticographic signals in human cortex. A patient performed extension/flexion tasks with three fingers. Average Pearsons correlation coefficients and normalized root-mean-square errors between decoded and actual trajectories were 0.83-0.90 and 0.24-0.48 respectively. To confirm generalizability to other users we applied our method to the BCI Competition IV open data sets. Our method showed that the prediction accuracy of fingertip trajectory could be equivalent to that of other results in the competition."
