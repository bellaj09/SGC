Experimental and theoretical results reveal a new underlying mechanism for fast brain learning process dendritic learning as opposed to the misdirected research in neuroscience over decades which is based solely on slow synaptic plasticity. The presented paradigm indicates that learning occurs in closer proximity to the neuron the computational unit dendritic strengths are self-oscillating and weak synapses which comprise the majority of our brain and previously were assumed to be insignificant play a key role in plasticity. The new learning sites of the brain call for a reevaluation of current treatments for disordered brain functionality and for a better understanding of proper chemical drugs and biological mechanisms to maintain control and enhance learning.
