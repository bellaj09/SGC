Accommodative depth cues a wide field of view and ever-higher resolutions all present major hardware design challenges for near-eye displays. Optimizing a design to overcome one of these challenges typically leads to a trade-off in the others. We tackle this problem by introducing an all-in-one solution - a new wide field of view gaze-tracked near-eye display for augmented reality applications. The key component of our solution is the use of a single see-through varifocal deformable membrane mirror for each eye reflecting a display. They are controlled by airtight cavities and change the effective focal power to present a virtual image at a target depth plane which is determined by the gaze tracker. The benefits of using the membranes include wide field of view 100 diagonal and fast depth switching from 20 cm to infinity within 300 ms. Our subjective experiment verifies the prototype and demonstrates its potential benefits for near-eye see-through displays.
