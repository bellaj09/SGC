A new virtual reality task was employed which uses preference for interpersonal distance to social stimuli to examine social motivation and emotion perception in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Nineteen high function children with higher functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder HFASD and 23 age gender and IQ matched children with typical development TD used a joy stick to position themselves closer or further from virtual avatars while attempting to identify six emotions expressed by the avatars happiness fear anger disgust sadness and surprise that were expressed at different levels of intensity. The results indicated that children with HFASD displayed significantly less approach behavior to the positive happy expression than did children with TD who displayed increases in approach behavior to higher intensities of happy expressions. Alternatively all groups tended to withdraw from negative emotions to the same extent and there were no diagnostic group differences in accuracy of recognition of any of the six emotions. This pattern of results is consistent with theory that suggests that some children with HFASD display atypical social-approach motivation or sensitivity to the positive reward value of positive social-emotional events. Conversely there was little evidence that a tendency to withdraw from social-emotional stimuli or a failure to process social emotional stimuli was a component of social behavior task performance in this sample of children with HFASD.
