Automated electrocardiogram ECG analysis for arrhythmia detection plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Extracting powerful features from raw ECG signals for fine-grained diseases classification is still a challenging problem today due to variable abnormal rhythms and noise distribution. For ECG analysis the previous research works depend mostly on heartbeat or single scale signal segments which ignores underlying complementary information of different scales. In this paper we formulate a novel end-to-end Deep Multi-Scale Fusion convolutional neural network DMSFNet architecture for multi-class arrhythmia detection. Our proposed approach can effectively capture abnormal patterns of diseases and suppress noise interference by multi-scale feature extraction and cross-scale information complementarity of ECG signals. The proposed method implements feature extraction for signal segments with different sizes by integrating multiple convolution kernels with different receptive fields. Meanwhile joint optimization strategy with multiple losses of different scales is designed which not only learns scale-specific features but also realizes cumulatively multi-scale complementary feature learning during the learning process. In our work we demonstrate our DMSFNet on two open datasets CPSC_2018 and PhysioNet/CinC_2017 and deliver the state-of-art performance on them. Among them CPSC_2018 is a 12-lead ECG dataset and CinC_2017 is a single-lead dataset. For these two datasets we achieve the F1 score 82.8% and 84.1% which are higher than previous state-of-art approaches respectively. The results demonstrate that our end-to-end DMSFNet has outstanding performance for feature extraction from a broad range of distinct arrhythmias and elegant generalization ability for effectively handling ECG signals with different leads.
