Higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia szPGRS has been associated with lower cognitive function and might be a predictor of decline in brain structure in apparently healthy populations. Age-related declines in structural brain connectivity-measured using white matter diffusion MRI -are evident from cross-sectional data. Yet it remains unclear how graph theoretical metrics of the structural connectome change over time and whether szPGRS is associated with differences in ageing-related changes in human brain connectivity. Here we studied a large relatively healthy same-year-of-birth older age cohort over a period of 3 years age\u202f\u202f73 years N\u202f=\u202f731; age 76 years N\u202f=\u202f488. From their brain scans we derived tract-averaged fractional anisotropy FA and mean diffusivity MD and network topology properties. We investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between these structural brain variables and szPGRS. Higher szPGRS showed significant associations with longitudinal increases in MD in the splenium \u202f=\u202f0.132 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.040 arcuate \u202f=\u202f0.291 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.040 anterior thalamic radiations \u202f=\u202f0.215 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.040 and cingulum \u202f=\u202f0.165 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.040. Significant declines over time were observed in graph theory metrics for FA-weighted networks such as mean edge weight \u202f=\u202f-0.039 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.048 and strength \u202f=\u202f-0.027 pFDR\u202f=\u202f0.048. No significant associations were found between szPGRS and graph theory metrics. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that szPGRS confers risk for ageing-related degradation of some aspects of structural connectivity.
