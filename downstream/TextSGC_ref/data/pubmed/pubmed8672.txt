\u2003The deep inferior epigastric perforator DIEP flap is the most common perforator flap for microsurgical breast reconstruction. Contrary to the conventional open approach robotic-assisted DIEP flap harvest intends to preserve ARS integrity thereby reducing the morbidity. We assessed the feasibility and compared performance outcomes of a robotic cadaveric training model for DIEP flap harvest using two approaches: transabdominal preperitoneal TAPP and totally extraperitoneal TEP.
