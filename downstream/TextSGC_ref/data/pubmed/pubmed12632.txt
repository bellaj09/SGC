"Mnires Disease MD is difficult to diagnose and evaluate objectively over the course of treatment. Recently several studies have reported MD diagnoses by MRI-based endolymphatic hydrops EH analysis. However this method is time-consuming and complicated. Therefore a fast objective and accurate evaluation tool is necessary. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm that can accurately analyze EH on intravenous IV gadolinium Gd-enhanced inner-ear MRI using artificial intelligence AI with deep learning. In this study we developed a convolutional neural network CNN-based deep-learning model named INHEARIT INner ear Hydrops Estimation via ARtificial InTelligence for the automatic segmentation of the cochlea and vestibule and calculation of the EH ratio in the segmented region. Measurement of the EH ratio was performed manually by a neuro-otologist and neuro-radiologist and by estimation with the INHEARIT model and were highly consistent intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.971. This is the first study to demonstrate that automated EH ratio measurements are possible which is important in the current clinical context where the usefulness of IV-Gd inner-ear MRI for MD diagnosis is increasing."
