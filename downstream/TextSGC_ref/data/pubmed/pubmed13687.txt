Current drug development is still costly and slow given tremendous technological advancements in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. Using machine learning ML to virtually screen compound libraries promises to fix this for generating drug leads more efficiently and accurately. Herein we explain the broad basics and integration of both virtual screening VS and ML. We then discuss artificial neural networks ANNs and their usage for VS. The ANN is emerging as the dominant classifier for ML in general and has proven its utility for both structure-based and ligand-based VS. Techniques such as dropout multitask learning and convolution improve the performance of ANNs and enable them to take on chemical meaning when learning about the drug-target-binding activity of compounds.
