The outlook of brain-computer interfacing BCI is very bright. The real-time accurate detection of a motor movement task is critical in BCI systems. The poor signal-to-noise-ratio SNR of EEG signals and the ambiguity of noise generator sources in brain renders this task quite challenging. In this paper we demonstrate a novel algorithm for precise detection of the onset of a motor movement through identification of event-related-desynchronization ERD patterns. Using an adaptive matched filter technique implemented based on an optimized continues Wavelet transform by selecting an appropriate basis we can detect single-trial ERDs. Moreover we use a maximum-likelihood ML electrooculography EOG artifact removal method to remove eye-related artifacts to significantly improve the detection performance. We have applied this technique to our locally recorded Emotiv data set of 6 healthy subjects where an average detection selectivity of 85  6% and sensitivity of 88  7.7% is achieved with a temporal precision in the range of -1250 to 367 ms in onset detections of single-trials. Accurate single-trial detection of movement intention made possible using adaptive wavelet transform.
