"The sulcal morphology of the human medial frontal cortex has received marked interest because of 1 its remarkable link with the functional organization of this region and 2 observations that deviations from normal sulcal morphological variability correlate with the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders cognitive abilities or personality traits. Unfortunately background studies on environmental or genetic factors influencing the ontogenesis of the sulcal organization in this region are critically lacking. We analysed the sulcal morphological organization in this region in twins and non-twin siblings as well as in control subjects for a total of 599 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The data first confirm significant biases in the presence of paracingulate sulci in left vs right hemispheres in the whole population twin: p\u2009<\u20092.4.10-9; non-twin: p\u2009<\u20092.10-6 demonstrating a clear general laterality in human subjects. Second measures of similarity between siblings and estimations of heritability suggest significant environmental factors in particular in-womb environment and weak additive genetic factors influencing the presence of a paracingulate sulcus. Finally we found that relationships between sulcal organization and performance in cognitive motor and affective tests depend on the twin status Twins versus Non-twins. These results provide important new insights to the issue of the significance of sulcal organization in the human medial frontal cortex." Variations of cingulate sulcal organization and link with cognitive performance.
