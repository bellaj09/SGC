"Mastery of laparoscopic skills is essential in surgical practice and requires considerable time and effort to achieve. The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer VBLaST-PC is a virtual simulator that was developed as a computerized version of the pattern cutting PC task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS system. To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC we assessed trainees learning curves using the cumulative summation CUSUM method and compared them with those on the FLS." Validation of the VBLaST pattern cutting task: a learning curve study.
