X-ray computed tomography CT is widely used in clinical practice. The involved ionizingX-ray radiation however could increase cancer risk. Hence the reduction of the radiation dosehas been an important topic in recent years. Few-view CT image reconstruction is one of the mainways to minimize radiation dose and potentially allow a stationary CT architecture. In this paperwe propose a deep encoder-decoder adversarial reconstruction DEAR network for 3D CT imagereconstruction from few-view data. Since the artifacts caused by few-view reconstruction appear in3D instead of 2D geometry a 3D deep network has a great potential for improving the image qualityin a data driven fashion. More specifically our proposed DEAR-3D network aims at reconstructing3D volume directly from clinical 3D spiral cone-beam image data. DEAR is validated on a publiclyavailable abdominal CT dataset prepared and authorized by Mayo Clinic. Compared with other2D deep learning methods the proposed DEAR-3D network can utilize 3D information to producepromising reconstruction results.
