The authors have evaluated a trauma simulator based on virtual reality techniques. Ten surgeons and 15 medical students performed distal locking of a femoral nail A. Furthermore 10 medical students performed simulated osteosynthesis of a femoral neck fracture B. Total surgery time A mean value was shorter for surgeons 108 s compared with students 157 s at the first p = 0.033 second 102 respectively 138 s p = 0.13 and third 96 respectively 160 s p = 0.15 operation. Total fluoroscopy time A mean value was shorter for surgeons compared with students at the first 45 respectively 89 s p = 0.001 second 48 respectively 83 s p = 0.02 and third 50 respectively 107 s p = 0.10 operation. The positioning of the hip nails B improved between the first and last trial. Total surgery and fluoroscopy time were reduced. All participants thought that this and similar simulators should be part of the programme and that this simulator would be helpful if they were about to learn the procedures.
