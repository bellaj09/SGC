"Cardiologists can acquire important information related to patients cardiac health using carotid artery stiffness its lumen diameter LD and its carotid intima-media thickness cIMT. The sonographers primarily concern about the location of the artery in B-mode ultrasound images. Localization using manual methods is tedious and time-consuming and also may lead to some errors. On the other hand automated approaches are more objective and can provide the localization of the artery at near real time. Above arterial parameters may be determined after localization of the artery in real time.A novel method of localization of common carotid artery CCA transverse section is presented in this work. The method is known as fast region convolutional neural network FRCNN-based localization method and is designed using a stack of three layers viz. convolutional layers fully connected layers and pooling layers. These organized layers constitute a region proposal network RPN and an object class detection network OCDN. We obtain an outcome as a bounding box along with a score of prediction around the cross-section of the CCA.B-mode ultrasound image database of CCA is split into training and testing set to accomplish this three partition methods K = 2 5 and 10 are used in our work. The training is extended for 30 200 and 2000 epochs in order to achieve fine-tuned features from the convolutional neural network. After 2000 epochs we obtain 95% validation accuracy; however mean of the accuracies up to 2000 epochs is 89.36% for K = 10 partitions protocol training 90% testing 10%. Generated CNN model is tested on a different dataset of 433 images and the acquired accuracy is 87.99%. Thus the proposed method including an advanced deep learning technique demonstrates promising localization for carotid artery transverse section. Graphical abstract."
