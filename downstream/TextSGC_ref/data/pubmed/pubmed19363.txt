Social comparison can guide adaptive behavior in fear-related situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social comparison standards on acute anxiety levels and phobic symptoms. The sample comprised 159 individuals Mage = 23.4 with self-reported fear of flying 22.6 % or fear of heights 77.4 % who were randomly assigned to an upward assimilation UA manipulation a downward assimilation DA manipulation or a control condition no manipulation of social comparison and entered a fear-related scenario in virtual reality i.e. flying in an airplane or walking in a tall building respectively. Results revealed that individuals in the UA condition reported significantly attenuated increases in anxiety levels from pre-exposure to both during- and post-exposure relative to the control condition. The DA condition did not significantly differ from either condition regarding increases in acute anxiety levels from pre-exposure to either during or post-exposure. At post-assessment participants in the UA condition also reported fewer phobic symptoms compared to both the DA and the control condition. Our results suggest that social comparison can indeed modulate coping with fearful situations. Future research needs to investigate the underlying processes of social comparison and the extent to which social comparison can facilitate treatment of anxiety disorders. Social comparison modulates coping with fear in virtual environments.
