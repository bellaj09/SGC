Within the neural engineering field next-generation implantable neuroelectronic interfaces are being developed using biologically-inspired and/or biologically-derived materials to improve upon the stability and functional lifetime of current interfaces. These technologies use biomaterials bioactive molecules living cells or some combination of these to promote host neuronal survival reduce the foreign body response and improve chronic device-tissue integration. This article provides a general overview of the different strategies milestones and evolution of bioactive neural interfaces including electrode material properties biological coatings and "decoration" with living cells. Another such biohybrid approach developed in our lab uses preformed implantable micro-tissue featuring long-projecting axonal tracts encased within carrier biomaterial micro-columns. These so-called "living electrodes" have been engineered with carefully tailored material mechanical and biological properties to enable natural synaptic based modulation of specific host circuitry while ultimately being under computer control. This article provides an overview of these living electrodes including design and fabrication performance attributes as well as findings to date characterizing in vitro and in vivo functionality.
