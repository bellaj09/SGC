The Smad7 protein is negative regulator of the TGF- signaling pathway which is upregulated in patients with breast cancer. miRNAs regulate proteins expressions by arresting or degrading the mRNAs. The purpose of this work is to identify a miRNAs profile that regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer using the data from patients with breast cancer obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Model based on GA and DNN for prediction of mRNA-Smad7 expression regulated by miRNAs in breast cancer.
