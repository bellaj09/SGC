"Both frame-based stereotaxy and frameless stereotaxy are established surgical procedures. However they each have their respective disadvantages when used in the biopsy of a deep-seated lesion. To overcome the drawbacks associated with these procedures we evaluated the feasibility of applying augmented reality AR to stereotactic biopsy. We applied our trans-visible navigator TVN to frame-based stereotactic biopsy in five cases of deep-seated lesions. This navigation system uses the AR concept allowing surgeons to view three-dimensional virtual models of anatomical structures superimposed over the surgical field on a tablet personal computer. Using TVN we could easily confirm a clear trajectory avoiding the important structures as well as the target points location in the lesion. Use of the stereotactic apparatus allowed the surgeon to easily advance the biopsy probe to the target point. Consequently a satisfactory histopathological diagnosis without complication was achieved in all cases. In conclusion applying AR to stereotactic biopsy is feasible and may improve the safety of the procedure." Application of Augmented Reality to Stereotactic Biopsy.
