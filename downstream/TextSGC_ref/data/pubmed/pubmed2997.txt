"Congenital heart disease CHD survivors are at risk for neurodevelopmental disability NDD and recent studies identify genes associated with both disorders suggesting that NDD in CHD survivors may be of genetic origin. Genes contributing to neurogenesis dendritic development and synaptogenesis organize neural elements into networks known as the connectome. We hypothesized that NDD in CHD may be attributable to genes altering both neural connectivity and cardiac patterning. To assess the contribution of de novo variants DNVs in connectome genes we annotated 229 published NDD genes for connectome status and analyzed data from 3684 CHD subjects and 1789 controls for connectome gene mutations. CHD cases had more protein truncating and deleterious missense DNVs among connectome genes compared to controls OR\u2009=\u20095.08 95%CI:2.81-9.20 Fishers exact test P\u2009=\u20096.30E-11. When removing three known syndromic CHD genes the findings remained significant OR\u2009=\u20093.69 95%CI:2.02-6.73 Fishers exact test P\u2009=\u20091.06E-06. In CHD subjects the top 12 NDD genes with damaging DNVs that met statistical significance after Bonferroni correction PTPN11 CHD7 CHD4 KMT2A NOTCH1 ADNP SMAD2 KDM5B NSD2 FOXP1 MED13L DYRK1A; one-tailed binomial test P\u2009\u20094.08E-05 contributed to the connectome. These data suggest that NDD in CHD patients may be attributable to genes that alter both cardiac patterning and the connectome." De novo damaging variants associated with congenital heart diseases contribute to the connectome.
