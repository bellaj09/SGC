Brain-to-brain interfaces BtBIs hold exciting potentials for direct communication between individual brains. However technical challenges often limit their performance in rapid information transfer. Here we demonstrate an optical brain-to-brain interface that transmits information regarding locomotor speed from one mouse to another and allows precise real-time control of locomotion across animals with high information transfer rate. We found that the activity of the genetically identified neuromedin B NMB neurons within the nucleus incertus NI precisely predicts and critically controls locomotor speed. By optically recording Ca2+ signals from the NI of a "Master" mouse and converting them to patterned optogenetic stimulations of the NI of an "Avatar" mouse the BtBI directed the Avatar mice to closely mimic the locomotion of their Masters with information transfer rate about two orders of magnitude higher than previous BtBIs. These results thus provide proof-of-concept that optical BtBIs can rapidly transmit neural information and control dynamic behaviors across individuals. An optical brain-to-brain interface supports rapid information transmission for precise locomotion control.
