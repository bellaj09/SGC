"Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging tfMRI has been widely used to study functional brain networks under task performance. Modeling tfMRI data is challenging due to at least two problems: the lack of the ground truth of underlying neural activity and the highly complex intrinsic structure of tfMRI data. To better understand brain networks based on fMRI data data-driven approaches have been proposed for instance independent component analysis ICA and sparse dictionary learning SDL. However both ICA and SDL only build shallow models and they are under the strong assumption that original fMRI signal could be linearly decomposed into time series components with their corresponding spatial maps. As growing evidence shows that human brain function is hierarchically organized new approaches that can infer and model the hierarchical structure of brain networks are widely called for. Recently deep convolutional neural network CNN has drawn much attention in that deep CNN has proven to be a powerful method for learning high-level and mid-level abstractions from low-level raw data. Inspired by the power of deep CNN in this paper we developed a new neural network structure based on CNN called deep convolutional auto-encoder DCAE in order to take the advantages of both data-driven approach and CNNs hierarchical feature abstraction ability for the purpose of learning mid-level and high-level features from complex large-scale tfMRI time series in an unsupervised manner. The DCAE has been applied and tested on the publicly available human connectome project tfMRI data sets and promising results are achieved." Modeling Task fMRI Data Via Deep Convolutional Autoencoder.
