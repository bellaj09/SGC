"Depression is a significant disabling feature in Parkinsons disease PD. However the neuropathology of this comorbidity is still unclear. In fact few studies have tried to elucidate the neural correlates of depression in PD and have mostly examined specific regions of interest. In this study we applied diffusion MRI connectometry a powerful complementary approach to investigate alterations in whole white matter pathways regarding the severity of depressive symptoms. Using a multiple regression model the correlation of severity of depressive symptoms assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS with white matter connectivity was surveyed in 27 non-demented PD patients related to 26 age sex and educational level-matched healthy subjects. Results revealed areas where white matter quantitative anisotropy QA was correlated with depression score in PD patients without any significant association in healthy controls. The analysis showed a significant negative association false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.05 between scores on depression subscale of HADS in PD patients and QA of left Cingulum Genu and Splenium of the Corpus Callosum and anterior and posterior limbs of the right internal capsule. This finding might improve our understanding of the neural basis of depression and its severity in PD."
