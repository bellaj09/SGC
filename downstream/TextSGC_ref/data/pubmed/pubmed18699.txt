Many surgical training programs utilize simulation-based strategies for instruction and assessment of laparoscopic skills. While the use of inanimate animate and virtual-reality simulation for basic or procedural skills training has been well described the use of simulation for the purpose of training surgeons in managing intraoperative laparoscopic complications has been given less attention. We describe a novel affordable inanimate surgical model for use in simulation-based training of laparoscopic renal hilar vessel injury management. Simulating laparoscopic renal hilar vessel injuries: preliminary evaluation of a novel surgical training model for residents.
