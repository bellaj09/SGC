Virtual environments provide the ability to systematically deliver test stimuli in simulated contexts relevant to real world behavior. The current study evaluated the validity of the Virtual Reality Stroop Task VRST which presents test stimuli during a virtual reality military convoy with simulated combat threats. Active duty Army personnel N\u2009=\u200949 took the VRST a customized version of the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ANAM-Fourth Edition TBI Battery 2007 that included the addition of the ANAM Stroop and Tower tests and traditional neuropsychological measures including the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System version of the Color-Word Interference Test. Preliminary convergent and discriminant validity was established and performance on the VRST was significantly associated with computerized and traditional tests of attention and executive functioning. Valid virtual reality cognitive assessments open new lines of inquiry into the impact of environmental stimuli on performance and offer promise for the future of neuropsychological assessments used with military personnel. Validity of the Virtual Reality Stroop Task VRST in active duty military.
