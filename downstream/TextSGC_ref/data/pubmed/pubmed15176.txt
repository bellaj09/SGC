"The aim of this study was to foster the better perfusion education when providing extracorporeal circulation ECC technology for future perfusionists. For this purpose we have developed an augmented reality AR program for ECC students. Currently the cost of equipment and its simulator is high. Furthermore it is desirable for ECC students to practice at any time. AR describes user experiences that add 2D plane detection or 3D elements to the live view from a devices camera in a way that makes those elements appear to inhabit the real world. We can use these technologies to create AR experiences using the back camera of a smartphone or tablet. We can also build our own instrument with custom visualization and data analysis. Although AR technology may not be new its potential in ECC student education is just beginning to be explored. Unlike other computing technologies AR interfaces offer seamless interaction between the real and virtual worlds a tangible interface metaphor and a means for transitioning between real and virtual worlds. Here we have shown our experiences of cost-effective AR technology for future perfusionists." Use of Augmented Reality to Assist Teaching for Future Perfusionists in Extracorporeal Technology.
