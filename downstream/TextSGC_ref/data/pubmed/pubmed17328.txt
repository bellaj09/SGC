We investigated the visual perception of biological movement by people post-stroke using minimal kinematic displays. A group of twenty patients and a group of twelve age-matched healthy controls were asked to judge movement fluency. The movements to judge were either displayed as an end-point dot or as a stick-figure of the arm and trunk. It was found that the perception of movement fluency was preserved post-stroke however with an increase in the variability of judgment. Moreover the end-point dot representation ameliorated what was perceived and judged presumably by directing attention to the important kinematic cues: smoothness and directness of the trajectory. We conclude that despite perception of actions is influenced by the ability of the observer to execute the observed movement hemiparesis has a mild effect on the perception of biological movement. Yet a valuable virtual learning environment for upper-limb rehabilitation should be implemented to provide the observer with neither too much nor too little information to maximize learning. People post-stroke perceive movement fluency in virtual reality.
