An augmented reality AR three-dimensional 3D display based on one-dimensional integral imaging 1DII by using a lenticular lens array holographic optical element LLA-HOE is proposed. The 3D image of the 1DII has higher vertical resolution compared with the image of conventional integral imaging whose resolution is sharply reduced for providing quasi-continuous viewpoints in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The proposed 3D display consists of a projector and an LLA-HOE and is compact. As an image combiner the LLA-HOE can diffract Bragg-matched light rays that have the same wavelength and incident angle as the original reference wave; it can also function as a lenticular lens array to reconstruct a 3D image but transmit other light rays emitted from the surroundings. In the experiment an LLA-HOE of 80\u2009\u2009mm80\u2009\u2009mm size is recorded and a combination of a high-resolution 3D virtual image and a real 3D object is presented by the proposed AR 3D display. High-resolution augmented reality 3D display with use of a lenticular lens array holographic optical element.
