Many recent studies have focused on improving the performance of event-related potential ERP based brain computer interfaces BCIs. The use of a face pattern has been shown to obtain high classification accuracies and information transfer rates ITRs by evoking discriminative ERPs N200 and N400 in addition to P300 potentials. Recently it has been proved that the performance of traditional P300-based BCIs could be improved through a modification of the mismatch pattern. In this paper a mismatch inverted face pattern MIF-pattern was presented to improve the performance of the inverted face pattern IF-pattern one of the state of the art patterns used in visual-based BCI systems. Ten subjects attended in this experiment. The result showed that the mismatch inverted face pattern could evoke significantly larger vertex positive potentials p < 0.05 and N400s p < 0.05 compared to the inverted face pattern. The classification accuracy mean accuracy is 99.58% and ITRs mean bit rate is 27.88 bit/min of the mismatch inverted face pattern was significantly higher than that of the inverted face pattern p < 0.05.
