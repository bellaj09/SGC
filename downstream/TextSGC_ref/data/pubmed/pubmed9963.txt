The recent advancements in computer vision have opened new horizons for deploying biometric recognition algorithms in mobile and handheld devices. Similarly iris recognition is now much needed in unconstraint scenarios with accuracy. These environments make the acquired iris image exhibit occlusion low resolution blur unusual glint ghost effect and off-angles. The prevailing segmentation algorithms cannot cope with these constraints. In addition owing to the unavailability of near-infrared NIR light iris recognition in visible light environment makes the iris segmentation challenging with the noise of visible light. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks CNN has brought a considerable breakthrough in various applications. To address the iris segmentation issues in challenging situations by visible light and near-infrared light camera sensors this paper proposes a densely connected fully convolutional network IrisDenseNet which can determine the true iris boundary even with inferior-quality images by using better information gradient flow between the dense blocks. In the experiments conducted five datasets of visible light and NIR environments were used. For visible light environment noisy iris challenge evaluation part-II NICE-II selected from UBIRIS.v2 database and mobile iris challenge evaluation MICHE-I datasets were used. For NIR environment the institute of automation Chinese academy of sciences CASIA v4.0 interval CASIA v4.0 distance and IIT Delhi v1.0 iris datasets were used. Experimental results showed the optimal segmentation of the proposed IrisDenseNet and its excellent performance over existing algorithms for all five datasets.
