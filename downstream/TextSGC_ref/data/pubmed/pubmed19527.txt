This paper presents a novel brain-computer interface BCI system aiming at the rehabilitation of attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder in children. It uses the P300 potential in a series of feedback games to improve the subjects\ attention. We applied a support vector machine SVM using temporal and template-based features to detect these P300 responses. In an experimental setup using five subjects an average error below 30% was achieved. To make it more challenging the BCI system has been embedded inside an immersive 3D virtual reality VR classroom with simulated distractions which was created by combining a low-cost infrared camera and an "off-axis perspective projection" algorithm. This system is intended for kids by operating with four electrodes as well as a non-intrusive VR setting. With the promising results and considering the simplicity of the scheme we hope to encourage future studies to adapt the techniques presented in this study.
