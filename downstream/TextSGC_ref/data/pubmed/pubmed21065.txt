Steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have potential to realize high-speed communication between human brain and external devices. Recently we proposed an intermodulation frequency-based stimulation approach to increase the number of visual stimuli that can be presented on a computer monitor. Although our recent studies have demonstrated that this approach can encode more visual stimuli by only one flickering frequency the performance of the intermodulation frequency-based SSVEP BCI remains poor and needs further improvement. This study aims to incorporate filter bank analysis and individual SSVEP calibration data into canonical correlation analysis CCA to improve the detection of SSVEPs with intermodulation frequencies. Results on classification accuracy and information transfer rate ITR suggest that the employment of individual calibration data can significantly improve the performance of the intermodulation frequency-based SSVEP BCI.
