In this work we investigate the problem of learning knowledge from the massive community-contributed images with rich weakly-supervised context information which can benefit multiple image understanding tasks simultaneously such as social image tag refinement and assignment content-based image retrieval tag-based image retrieval and tag expansion. Towards this end we propose a Deep Collaborative Embedding DCE model to uncover a unified latent space for images and tags. The proposed method incorporates the end-to-end learning and collaborative factor analysis in one unified framework for the optimal compatibility of representation learning and latent space discovery. A nonnegative and discrete refined tagging matrix is learned to guide the end-to-end learning. To collaboratively explore the rich context information of social images the proposed method integrates the weakly-supervised image-tag correlation image correlation and tag correlation simultaneously and seamlessly. The proposed model is also extended to embed new tags in the uncovered space. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used social image benchmarks for multiple social image understanding tasks. The encouraging performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates its superiority. Deep Collaborative Embedding for Social Image Understanding.
