"Medical dosimetry is an important component in training of radiation therapist yet it is not easy for student to understand the principle of treatment planning and to be familiar with the relationship of the clinical target volume CTV planned target volume PTV and the nearby organs at risk OARs by just imagination. This study is conducted to evaluate whether using VERT in teaching medical dosimetry can help student to improve their learning experience. Students of cohort 2015 and 2016 were taught under TPS mode and TPS + VERT mode respectively. Direct comparison was conducted through self-evaluation survey between two groups of students in terms of their understanding of the concept of medical dosimetry and their level of confidence in completing different types of plans after the course. Both groups of students were able to understand the concept of medical dosimetry and able to complete 3D conformal plans after taking the course. Though the students received TPS mode reported that they had lower level of confidence in completing the planning and required longer time for self-study and practice compared to the students who received the TPS + VERT mode. This study demonstrated that including VERT into medical dosimetry education can improve students learning experience by improving their self-confidence as well as reducing time required for their self-study and practice."
