"Making reasonable decisions related to financial and health scenarios is a crucial capacity that can be difficult for older adults to maintain as they age yet few studies examine neurocognitive factors that are generalizable to different types of everyday decision-making capacity. Here we propose an innovative approach based on individual risk-taking preference to identify neural profiles that may help predict older adults everyday decision-making capacity. Using performance and cognitive arousal information from two gambling tasks we identified three decision-making preference groups: ambiguity problem-solvers A risk-seekers R and a control group without strong risk-taking preferences C. Comparisons of the number of connections within white matter tracts between A vs. C and R vs. C groups resulted in features consistent with the theory of dual neural functional systems involved in decision-making. Unique tracts from the A vs. C contrast were primarily centered in dorsal frontal regions/reflective system; unique tracts from the R vs. C contrast were centered in the ventral frontal regions/impulsive system; and shared tracts from both contrasts were centered in the basal ganglia coordinating the switch between the two types of decision-making preference. Number of connections from the tracts differentiating A vs. C significantly predicted financial and health/safety decision-making capacity and the association remained significant after controlling for multiple socioeconomic and cognitive factors. The connectome identified may provide insight into a generic white matter mechanism related to everyday decision-making capacity in older age."
