Artificial intelligence trained via machine learning e.g. neural nets random forests or computational statistical algorithms e.g. support vector machines ridge regression holds much promise for the improvement of small-molecule drug discovery. However small-molecule structure-activity data are high dimensional with low signal-to-noise ratios and proper validation of predictive methods is difficult. It is poorly understood which if any of the currently available machine learning algorithms will best predict new candidate drugs. A decision-theoretic approach to the evaluation of machine learning algorithms in computational drug discovery.
