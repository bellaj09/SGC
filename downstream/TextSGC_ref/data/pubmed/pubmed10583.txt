Pancreas segmentation from computed tomography CT images is an important step in surgical procedures such as cancer detection and radiation treatment. While manual segmentation is time-consuming and operator-dependent current computer-assisted segmentation methods are facing challenges posed by varying shapes and sizes. To address these challenges this paper presents a multi-scale feature fusion MsFF model for accurate pancreas segmentation from CT images. Deep multi-scale feature fusion for pancreas segmentation from CT images.
