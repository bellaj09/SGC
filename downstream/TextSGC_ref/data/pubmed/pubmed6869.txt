For 3D imaging and shape measurement simultaneously achieving real-time and high-accuracy performance remains a challenging task in practice. In this paper a fringe-projection-based 3D imaging and shape measurement technique using a three-chip liquid-crystal-display 3LCD projector and a deep machine learning scheme is presented. By encoding three phase-shifted fringe patterns into the red green and blue RGB channels of a color image and controlling the 3LCD projector to project the RGB channels individually the technique can synchronize the projector and the camera to capture the required fringe images at a fast speed. In the meantime the 3D imaging and shape measurement accuracy is dramatically improved by introducing a novel phase determination approach built on a fully connected deep neural network DNN learning model. The proposed system allows performing 3D imaging and shape measurement of multiple complex objects at a real-time speed of 25.6\xa0fps with relative accuracy of 0.012%. Experiments have shown great promise for advancing scientific and engineering applications. Real-time 3D shape measurement using 3LCD projection and deep machine learning.
