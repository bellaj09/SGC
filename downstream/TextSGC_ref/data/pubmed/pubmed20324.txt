This report provides a concise overview of the rendering and utilization of three-dimensional models in the field of anatomy. Anatomical three-dimensional virtual models are widely used for educational purposes preoperative planning and surgical simulations because they simply allow for interactive three-dimensional navigation across the human organs or entire body. Virtual three-dimensional models have been recently fabricated as accurate replicas of the anatomical structures thanks to advances in rapid prototyping technology. A concise survey on 3D modeling in the science of anatomy.
