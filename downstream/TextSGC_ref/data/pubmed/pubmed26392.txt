For brain-machine interfaces BMI to be used in activities of daily living by paralyzed individuals the BMI should be as autonomous as possible. One of the challenges is how the feedback is extracted and utilized in the BMI. Our long-term goal is to create autonomous BMIs that can utilize an evaluative feedback from the brain to update the decoding algorithm and use it intelligently in order to adapt the decoder. In this study we show how to extract the necessary evaluative feedback from a biologically realistic synthetic source use both the quantity and the quality of the feedback and how that feedback information can be incorporated into a reinforcement learning RL controller architecture to maximize its performance. Feedback for reinforcement learning based brain-machine interfaces using confidence metrics.
