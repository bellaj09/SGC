"The aim of this work is to develop a realistic virtual model of the human brain that could be used in a neurosurgical simulation for both educational and preoperative planning purposes. The goal of such a system would be to enhance the practice of surgery students avoiding the use of animals cadavers and plastic phantoms. A surgeon before carrying out the real procedure will with this system be able to rehearse by using a surgical simulator based on detailed virtual reality models of the human brain reconstructed with real patients medical images. In order to obtain a realistic and useful simulation we focused our research on the physical modelling of the brain as a deformable body and on the interactions with surgical instruments. The developed prototype is based on the mass-spring-damper model and in order to obtain deformations similar to the real ones a three tiered structure has been built. In this way we have obtained local and realistic deformations using an ad-hoc point distribution in the volume where the contact between the brain surface and a surgical instrument takes place."
