Since introducing optical coherence tomography OCT technology for 2D eye imaging it has become one of the most important and widely used imaging modalities for the noninvasive assessment of retinal eye diseases. Age-related macular degeneration AMD and diabetic macular edema eye disease are the leading causes of blindness being diagnosed using OCT. Recently by developing machine learning and deep learning techniques the classification of eye retina diseases using OCT images has become quite a challenge. In this paper a novel automated convolutional neural network CNN architecture for a multiclass classification system based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT has been proposed. The system used to classify five types of retinal diseases age-related macular degeneration AMD choroidal neovascularization CNV diabetic macular edema DME and drusen in addition to normal cases. The proposed CNN architecture with a softmax classifier overall correctly identified 100% of cases with AMD 98.86% of cases with CNV 99.17% cases with DME 98.97% cases with drusen and 99.15% cases of normal with an overall accuracy of 95.30%. This architecture is a potentially impactful tool for the diagnosis of retinal diseases using SD-OCT images.
