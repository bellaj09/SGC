Poor sleep quality which is typically related to impairments in cognitive control is pervasive among the elderly. However the brain function mechanisms underlying the association between sleep and elderly behavior remain elusive. This study aims to assess the effects of poor sleep quality on low-frequency neural oscillations based on the wavelet phase coherence WPCO and wavelet amplitude WA of oxyhemoglobin concentration changes Delta HbO2 measured through near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS method. Effects of poor sleep quality on brain functional connectivity revealed by wavelet-based coherence analysis using NIRS methods in elderly subjects.
