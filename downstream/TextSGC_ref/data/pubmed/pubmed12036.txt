A critical step in adaptive radiotherapy ART workflow is deformably registering the simulation CT with the daily or weekly volumetric imaging. Quantifying the deformable image registration accuracy under these circumstances is a complex task due to the lack of known ground-truth landmark correspondences between the source data and target data. Generating landmarks manually using experts is time-consuming and limited by image quality and observer variability. While image similarity metrics ISM may be used as an alternative approach to quantify the registration error there is a need to characterize the ISM values by developing a nonlinear cost function and translate them to physical distance measures in order to enable fast quantitative comparison of registration performance. A neural network approach for fast automated quantification of DIR performance.
