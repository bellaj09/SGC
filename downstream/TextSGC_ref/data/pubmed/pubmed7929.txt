Digital Pathology is the process of converting histology glass slides to digital images using sophisticated computerized technology to facilitate acquisition evaluation storage and portability of histologic information. By its nature digitization of analog histology data renders it amenable to analysis using deep learning/artificial intelligence DL/AI techniques. The application of DL/AI to digital pathology data holds promise even if the scope of use cases and regulatory framework for deploying such applications in the clinical environment remains in the early stages. Recent studies using whole-slide images and DL/AI to detect histologic abnormalities in general and cancer in particular have shown encouraging results. In this review we focus on these emerging technologies intended for use in diagnostic hematology and the evaluation of lymphoproliferative diseases.
