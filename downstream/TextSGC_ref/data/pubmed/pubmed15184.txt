To compare different deep learning architectures for predicting the risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge from the intensive care unit ICU. The interpretability of attention-based models is leveraged to describe patients-at-risk. Several deep learning architectures making use of attention mechanisms recurrent layers neural ordinary differential equations ODEs and medical concept embeddings with time-aware attention were trained using publicly available electronic medical record data MIMIC-III associated with 45298 ICU stays for 33150 patients. Bayesian inference was used to compute the posterior over weights of an attention-based model. Odds ratios associated with an increased risk of readmission were computed for static variables. Diagnoses procedures medications and vital signs were ranked according to the associated risk of readmission. A recurrent neural network with time dynamics of code embeddings computed by neural ODEs achieved the highest average precision of 0.331 AUROC: 0.739 F1-Score: 0.372. Predictive accuracy was comparable across neural network architectures. Groups of patients at risk included those suffering from infectious complications with chronic or progressive conditions and for whom standard medical care was not suitable. Attention-based networks may be preferable to recurrent networks if an interpretable model is required at only marginal cost in predictive accuracy.
