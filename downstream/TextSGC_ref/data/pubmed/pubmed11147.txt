At present realizing high-quality automatic welding through online monitoring is a research focus in engineering applications. In this paper a CNNLSTM algorithm is proposed which combines the advantages of convolutional neural networks CNNs and long short-term memory networks LSTMs. The CNNLSTM algorithm establishes a shallow CNN to extract the primary features of the molten pool image. Then the feature tensor extracted by the CNN is transformed into the feature matrix. Finally the rows of the feature matrix are fed into the LSTM network for feature fusion. This process realizes the implicit mapping from molten pool images to welding defects. The test results on the self-made molten pool image dataset show that CNN contributes to the overall feasibility of the CNNLSTM algorithm and LSTM network is the most superior in the feature hybrid stage. The algorithm converges at 300 epochs and the accuracy of defects detection in CO welding molten pool is 94%. The processing time of a single image is 0.067 ms which fully meets the real-time monitoring requirement based on molten pool image. The experimental results on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets show that the algorithm is universal and can be used for similar image recognition and classification tasks.
