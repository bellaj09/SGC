"Non-invasive localization of certain brain functions may be mapped on a millimeter level. However the inter-electrode spacing of common clinical brain surface electrodes still remains around 10 mm and some electrodes fail to measure cortical activity due to unconformable plain electrode sheets. Here we present details on development of implantable electrodes for attaining higher quality electrocorticographic signals for use in functional brain mapping and brain-machine interfaces. We produced personalized sheet electrodes after the creation of individualized molds using a 3D-printer. We created arrays to fit the surface curvature of the brain and inside the central sulcus with inter-electrode distances of 2.5 mm. Rat experiments undertaken indicated no long term toxicity. We were also able to custom design rapidly manufacture safely implant and confirm the efficacy of personalized electrodes including the capability to attain meaningful high gamma-band information in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient. This sheet electrode may contribute to the higher performance of BMIs." Patient-specific contour-fitting sheet electrodes for electrocorticographic brain machine interfaces.
