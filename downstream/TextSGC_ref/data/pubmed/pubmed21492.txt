In the present study we aimed to determine whether game-based virtual reality VR rehabilitation combined with occupational therapy OT could improve health-related quality of life depression and upper extremity function. We recruited 35 patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke and these participants were randomized into groups that underwent VR rehabilitation plus conventional OT or the same amount of conventional OT alone for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Compared to baseline the VR rehabilitation plus OT group exhibited significantly improved role limitation due to emotional problems p=0.047. Compared to baseline both groups also exhibited significantly improved depression p=0.017 and upper extremity function p=0.001 although the inter-group differences were not significant. However a significant inter-group difference was observed for role limitation due to physical problems p=0.031. Our results indicate that game-based VR rehabilitation has specific effects on health-related quality of life depression and upper extremity function among patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke.
