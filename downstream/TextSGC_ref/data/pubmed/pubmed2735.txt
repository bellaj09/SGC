"In recent years pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has paralleled rapid advances in connectomics a field concerned with comprehensively mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI has played a central role in these efforts as it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain disease with a particular focus on Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia. Specifically we consider how research into circuit-level connectome-wide and topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological theories and biomarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of disturbances in an interconnected complex system rather than discrete pathology in isolated sub-sets of brain regions."
