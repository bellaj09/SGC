A large body of research suggests that oxytocin receptor OXTR gene polymorphisms may influence both social behaviors and psychiatric conditions related to social deficits such as autism spectrum disorders ASDs schizophrenia and mood and anxiety disorders. However the neural mechanism underlying these associations is still unclear. Relative to controls patients with these psychiatric conditions show differences in brain structure and in resting state fMRI rs-fMRI signal synchronicity among default mode network DMN regions also known as functional connectivity. We used a stepwise imaging genetics approach in 328 healthy young adults to test the hypothesis that 10 SNPs in OXTR are associated with differences in DMN synchronicity and structure of some of the associated brain regions. As OXTR effects may be sex-dependent we also tested whether our findings were modulated by sex. OXTR rs2254298 A allele carriers had significantly lower rsFC with PCC in a cluster extending from the right fronto-insular cortex to the putamen and globus pallidus and in bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dACC compared to individuals with the GG genotype; all observed effects were found only in males. Moreover compared to the male individuals with GG genotype ofrs2254298 the male A allele carriers demonstrated significantly thinner cortical gray matter in the bilateral dACC. Our findings suggest that there may be sexually dimorphic mechanisms by which a naturally occurring variation of the OXTR gene may influence brain structure and function in DMN-related regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.
