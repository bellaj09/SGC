"When encoding visual targets using various lagged versions of a pseudorandom binary sequence of luminance changes the EEG signal recorded over the viewers occipital pole exhibits so-called code-modulated visual evoked potentials cVEPs the phase lags of which can be tied to these targets. The cVEP paradigm has enjoyed interest in the brain-computer interfacing BCI community for the reported high information transfer rates ITR in bits/min. In this study we introduce a novel decoding algorithm based on spatiotemporal beamforming and show that this algorithm is able to accurately identify the gazed target. Especially for a small number of repetitions of the coding sequence our beamforming approach significantly outperforms an optimised support vector machine SVM-based classifier which is considered state-of-the-art in cVEP-based BCI. In addition to the traditional 60 Hz stimulus presentation rate for the coding sequence we also explore the 120 Hz rate and show that the latter enables faster communication with a maximal median ITR of 172.87 bits/min. Finally we also report on a transition effect in the EEG signal following the onset of the stimulus sequence and recommend to exclude the first 150 ms of the trials from decoding when relying on a single presentation of the stimulus sequence."
