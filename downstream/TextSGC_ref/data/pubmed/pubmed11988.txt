Ultrasound imaging has become a prevalent examination method in prenatal diagnosis. Accurate acquisition of fetal facial standard plane FFSP is the most important precondition for subsequent diagnosis and measurement. In the past few years considerable effort has been devoted to FFSP recognition using various hand-crafted features but the recognition performance is still unsatisfactory due to the high intraclass variation of FFSPs and the high degree of visual similarity between FFSPs and other non-FFSPs. To improve the recognition performance we propose a method to automatically recognize FFSP via a deep convolutional neural network DCNN architecture. The proposed DCNN consists of 16 convolutional layers with small 3  3 size kernels and three fully connected layers. A global average pooling is adopted in the last pooling layer to significantly reduce network parameters which alleviates the overfitting problems and improves the performance under limited training data. Both the transfer learning strategy and a data augmentation technique tailored for FFSP are implemented to further boost the recognition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method over traditional approaches and the effectiveness of DCNN to recognize FFSP for clinical diagnosis.
