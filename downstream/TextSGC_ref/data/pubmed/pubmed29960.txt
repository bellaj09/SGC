Low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation LIFUS emerges as an attracting technology for noninvasive modulation of neural circuits yet the underlying action mechanisms remain unclear. The neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation NICE model suggests that LIFUS excites neurons through a complex interplay between microsecond-scale mechanical oscillations of so-called sonophores in the plasma membrane and the development of a millisecond-scale electrical response. This model predicts cell-type-specific responses that correlate indirectly with experimental data but it is computationally expensive and difficult to interpret which hinders its potential validation. Here we introduce a multi-scale optimized neuronal intramembrane cavitation SONIC model to achieve fast accurate simulations and confer interpretability in terms of effective electrical response.
