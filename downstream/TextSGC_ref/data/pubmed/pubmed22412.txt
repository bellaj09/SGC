The concept of sparsity has proven useful to understanding elementary neural computations in sensory systems. However the role of sparsity in motor regions is poorly understood. Here we investigated the functional properties of sparse structure in neural activity collected with high-density electrocorticography ECoG from speech sensorimotor cortex vSMC in neurosurgical patients. Using independent components analysis ICA we found individual components corresponding to individual major oral articulators i.e. Coronal Tongue Dorsal Tongue Lips which were selectively activated during utterances that engaged that articulator on single trials. Some of the components corresponded to spatially sparse activations. Components with similar properties were also extracted using convolutional sparse coding CSC and required less data pre-processing. Finally individual utterances could be accurately decoded from vSMC ECoG recordings using linear classifiers trained on the high-dimensional sparse codes generated by CSC. Together these results suggest that sparse coding may be an important framework and tool for understanding sensory-motor activity generating complex behaviors and may be useful for brain-machine interfaces. Sparse coding of ECoG signals identifies interpretable components for speech control in human sensorimotor cortex.
