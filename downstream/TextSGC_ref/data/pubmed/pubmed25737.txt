The present study aims at the development of a new concept system that will contribute toward improving the quality of life for bedridden patients and the elderly. The results of a basic study showed the possibility of a virtual reality system reducing stress and pain provided VR sickness does not occur. A Bedside Wellness System which lets a person experience a virtual forest walk and provides a facility of rehabilitation was proposed based on the basic study and developed. An experiment to assess the developed system using healthy subjects was executed. The data suggested the positive effects of the system; however some points to be improved were also extracted. After a few improvements the system will be available for clinical use. Bedside wellness--development of a virtual forest rehabilitation system.
