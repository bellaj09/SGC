Previous studies on obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD showed impairments in executive domains particularly in cognitive inhibition. In this perspective the use of virtual reality showed huge potential in the assessment of executive functions; however unfortunately to date no study on the assessment of these patients took advantage of the use of virtual environments. One of the main problems faced within assessment protocols is the use of a limited number of variables and tools when tailoring a personalized program. The main aim of this study was to provide a heuristic decision tree for the future development of tailored assessment protocols. To this purpose we conducted a study that involved 58 participants 29 OCD patients and 29 controls to collect both classic neuropsychological data and precise data based on a validated protocol in virtual reality for the assessment of executive functions namely the VMET virtual multiple errands test. In order to provide clear indications for working on executive functions with these patients we carried out a cross-validation based on three learning algorithms and computationally defined two decision trees. We found that by using three neuropsychological tests and two VMET scores it was possible to discriminate OCD patients from controls opening a novel scenario for future assessment protocols based on virtual reality and computational techniques.
