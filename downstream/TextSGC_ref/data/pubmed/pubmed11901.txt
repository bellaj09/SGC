We implement 2 different multitask learning MTL techniques hard parameter sharing and cross-stitch to train a word-level convolutional neural network CNN specifically designed for automatic extraction of cancer data from unstructured text in pathology reports. We show the importance of learning related information extraction IE tasks leveraging shared representations across the tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Automatic extraction of cancer registry reportable information from free-text pathology reports using multitask convolutional neural networks.
