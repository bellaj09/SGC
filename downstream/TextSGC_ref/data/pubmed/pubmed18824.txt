Cerebral palsy is a severe condition usually caused by decreased brain oxygenation during pregnancy at birth or soon after birth. Conventional treatments for cerebral palsy are often tiresome and expensive leading patients to quit treatment. In this paper we describe a virtual environment for patients to engage in a playful therapeutic game for neuropsychomotor rehabilitation based on the experience of the occupational therapy program of the Nucleus for Integrated Medical Assistance NAMI at the University of Fortaleza Brazil. Integration between patient and virtual environment occurs through the hand motion sensor "Leap Motion" plus the electroencephalographic sensor "MindWave" responsible for measuring attention levels during task execution. To evaluate the virtual environment eight clinical experts on cerebral palsy were subjected to a questionnaire regarding the potential of the experimental virtual environment to promote cognitive and motor rehabilitation as well as the potential of the treatment to enhance risks and/or negatively influence the patient\s development. Based on the very positive appraisal of the experts we propose that the experimental virtual environment is a promising alternative tool for the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. Novel Virtual Environment for Alternative Treatment of Children with Cerebral Palsy.
