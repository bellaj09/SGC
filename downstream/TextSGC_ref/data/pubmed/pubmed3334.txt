Though researchers spent a lot of effort to develop treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders the poor translation of drug efficacy data from animals to human hampered the success of these therapeutic approaches in human. Pharmaceutical industry is challenged by low clinical success rates for new drug registration. To maximize the success in drug development biomarkers are required to act as surrogate end points and predictors of drug effects. The pathology of brain disease could be in part due to synaptic dysfunction. Electroencephalogram EEG generating from the result of the postsynaptic potential discharge between cells could be a potential measure to bridge the gaps between animal and human data. Here we discuss recent progress on using relevant EEG characteristics and brain connectomics as biomarkers to monitor drug effects and measure cognitive changes on animal models and human in real-time. It is expected that the novel approach i.e. EEG connectomics will offer a deeper understanding on the drug efficacy at a microcirculatory level which will be useful to support the development of new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. Predictors for drug effects with brain disease: Shed new light from EEG parameters to brain connectomics.
