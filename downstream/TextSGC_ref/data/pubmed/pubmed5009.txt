As an emerging brain imaging technique functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS has attracted widespread attention for advancing resting-state functional connectivity FC and graph theoretical analyses of brain networks. However it remains largely unknown how the duration of the fNIRS signal scanning is related to stable and reproducible functional brain network features. To answer this question we collected resting-state fNIRS signals 10-min duration two runs from 18 participants and then truncated the hemodynamic time series into 30-s time bins that ranged from 1 to 10 min. Measures of nodal efficiency nodal betweenness network local efficiency global efficiency and clustering coefficient were computed for each subject at each fNIRS signal acquisition duration. Analyses of the stability and between-run reproducibility were performed to identify optimal time length for each measure. We found that the FC nodal efficiency and nodal betweenness stabilized and were reproducible after 1 min of fNIRS signal acquisition whereas network clustering coefficient local and global efficiencies stabilized after 1 min and were reproducible after 5 min of fNIRS signal acquisition for only local and global efficiencies. These quantitative results provide direct evidence regarding the choice of the resting-state fNIRS scanning duration for functional brain connectivity and topological metric stability of brain network connectivity.
