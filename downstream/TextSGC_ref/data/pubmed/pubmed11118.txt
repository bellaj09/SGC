Human activity recognition HAR based on sensor data is a significant problem in pervasive computing. In recent years deep learning has become the dominating approach in this field due to its high accuracy. However it is difficult to make accurate identification for the activities of one individual using a model trained on data from other users. The decline on the accuracy of recognition restricts activity recognition in practice. At present there is little research on the transferring of deep learning model in this field. This is the first time as we known an empirical study was carried out on deep transfer learning between users with unlabeled data of target. We compared several widely-used algorithms and found that Maximum Mean Discrepancy MMD method is most suitable for HAR. We studied the distribution of features generated from sensor data. We improved the existing method from the aspect of features distribution with center loss and get better results. The observations and insights in this study have deepened the understanding of transfer learning in the activity recognition field and provided guidance for further research.
