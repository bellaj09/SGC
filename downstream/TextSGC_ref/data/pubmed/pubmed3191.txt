In epilepsy asymmetries in the organization of mesial temporal lobe MTL functions help determine the cognitive risk associated with procedures such as anterior temporal lobectomy. Past studies have investigated the change/shift in a visual episodic memory laterality index LI in mesial temporal lobe structures through functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI task activations. Here we examine whether underlying task-related functional connectivity FC is concordant with such standard fMRI laterality measures. Task activation and functional connectivity show concordant memory laterality in temporal lobe epilepsy.
