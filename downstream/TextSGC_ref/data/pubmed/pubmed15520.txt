Chronic pain conditions such as phantom limb pain and complex regional pain syndrome are difficult to treat and traditional pharmacological treatment and invasive neural block are not always effective. Plasticity in the central nervous system occurs in these conditions and may be associated with pain. Mirror visual feedback therapy aims to restore normal cortical organization and is applied in the treatment of chronic pain conditions. However not all patients benefit from this treatment. Virtual reality technology is increasingly attracting attention for medical application including as an analgesic modality. An advanced mirror visual feedback system with virtual reality technology may have increased analgesic efficacy and benefit a wider patient population. In this preliminary work we developed a virtual reality mirror visual feedback system and applied it to the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome. Nonimmersive virtual reality mirror visual feedback therapy and its application for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome: an open-label pilot study.
