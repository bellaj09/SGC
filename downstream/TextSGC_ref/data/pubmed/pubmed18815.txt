This experiment investigated the accuracy of distance judgment and perception of the frontal extent in a stereoscopic environment. Eight virtual targets were projected in a circular arrangement with two center-to-center target distances 18 cm and 36 cm and three target sizes 0.6 cm 1.5 cm and 3.7 cm. Fourteen participants judged the positions of virtual targets presented at a distance of 90 cm from them by employing two different interaction techniques: the direct selection technique and the virtual cursor technique. The results showed overall higher accuracy with the virtual cursor technique than with the direct selection technique. It was also found that the target size significantly affected the frontal extent accuracy. In addition significant interactions between technique and center-to-center target distance were observed. The direct selection technique was more accurate at the 18 cm center-to-center target distance along the horizontal x and vertical y axes while the virtual cursor technique was more accurate for the 36 cm center-to-center target distance along the y axis. During the direct selection estimations tended to converge to the center of the virtual space; however this convergence was not observed in the virtual cursor condition. The accuracy of pointing estimations suffered on the left side of participants. These findings could provide direction for virtual reality developers in selecting proper interaction techniques and appropriately positioning virtual targets in stereoscopic environments.
