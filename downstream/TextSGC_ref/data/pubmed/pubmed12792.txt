"This paper presents one of the first applications of deep learning DL techniques to predict air pollution time series. Air quality management relies extensively on time series data captured at air monitoring stations as the basis of identifying population exposure to airborne pollutants and determining compliance with local ambient air standards. In this paper 8 hr averaged surface ozone O3 concentrations were predicted using deep learning consisting of a recurrent neural network RNN with long short-term memory LSTM. Hourly air quality and meteorological data were used to train and forecast values up to 72 hours with low error rates. The LSTM was able to forecast the duration of continuous O3 exceedances as well. Prior to training the network the dataset was reviewed for missing data and outliers. Missing data were imputed using a novel technique that averaged gaps less than eight time steps with incremental steps based on first-order differences of neighboring time periods. Data were then used to train decision trees to evaluate input feature importance over different time prediction horizons. The number of features used to train the LSTM model was reduced from 25 features to 5 features resulting in improved accuracy as measured by Mean Absolute Error MAE. Parameter sensitivity analysis identified look-back nodes associated with the RNN proved to be a significant source of error if not aligned with the prediction horizon. Overall MAEs less than 2 were calculated for predictions out to 72 hours." Forecasting air quality time series using deep learning.
