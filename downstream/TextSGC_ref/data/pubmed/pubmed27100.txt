"We are developing an autonomously updating brain machine interface BMI utilizing reinforcement learning principles. One aspect of this system is a neural critic that determines reward expectations from neural activity. This critic is then used to update a BMI decoder toward an improved performance from the users perspective. Here we demonstrate the ability of a neural critic to classify trial reward value given activity from the primary motor cortex M1 using neural features from single/multi units SU/MU and local field potentials LFPs with prediction accuracies up to 97% correct. A nonhuman primate subject conducted a cued center out reaching task either manually or observationally. The cue indicated the reward value of a trial. Features such as power spectral density PSD of the LFPs and spike-field coherence SFC between SU/MU and corresponding LFPs were calculated and used as inputs to several classifiers. We conclude that hybrid features of PSD and SFC show higher classification performance than PSD or SFC alone accuracy was 92% for manual tasks and 97% for observational. In the future we will employ these hybrid features toward our autonomously updating BMI."
