"Introduction: The use of Virtual Reality VR in neurology mainly concerns motor solutions. Such an approach is cost-effective and resource-effective. The aim of this work is to review and assess the effectiveness of proposed VR systems in order to diagnose and rehabilitate neurological patients with cognitive disorders.Areas covered: The existing analog neuropsychological tests lack ecological validity. The literature review revealed that VR solutions biggest advantage is the possibility of assessing patients in everyday situations. Specific tasks e.g. spatial verbal adaptive could be focused on examining the exact types of memory disabilities in the heterogeneous group of cognitive impairments. There is a visible promise for further development in this area and a good basis for personalized and remote use. While different methodology is set in the analyzed articles the improvement in neurological functions is seen in all of them.Expert opinion: VR is still a relatively new and understudied solution but there is a visible progress in its research. This trend could lead to more specific and tailored methods for therapy and diagnostics." Virtual reality in the diagnostics and therapy of neurological diseases.
