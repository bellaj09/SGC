The aim of this article was to study the effect of virtual-reality exposure to situations that are emotionally significant for patients with eating disorders ED on the stability of body-image distortion and body-image dissatisfaction. A total of 85 ED patients and 108 non-ED students were randomly exposed to four experimental virtual environments: a kitchen with low-calorie food a kitchen with high-calorie food a restaurant with low-calorie food and a restaurant with high-calorie food. In the interval between the presentation of each situation body-image distortion and body-image dissatisfaction were assessed. Several 2\u2009x\u20092\u2009x\u20092 repeated measures analyses of variance high-calorie vs. low-calorie food\u2009x\u2009presence vs. absence of people\u2009x ED group vs. control group showed that ED participants had significantly higher levels of body-image distortion and body dissatisfaction after eating high-calorie food than after eating low-calorie food while control participants reported a similar body image in all situations. The results suggest that body-image distortion and body-image dissatisfaction show both trait and state features. On the one hand ED patients show a general predisposition to overestimate their body size and to feel more dissatisfied with their body image than controls. On the other hand these body-image disturbances fluctuate when participants are exposed to virtual situations that are emotionally relevant for them.
