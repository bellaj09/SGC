Although recent studies on self-consciousness emphasized the importance of bodily processing and multisensory integration such research has focused solely on bodily signals originating from the outside of the body i.e. exteroceptive bodily signals or internal bodily signals from visceral organs i.e. interoceptive bodily signals and how each system contributes to self-consciousness without much interaction between the two approaches. Reviewing the latest evidence on interoceptive bodily processing and the combination of exteroceptive and interoceptive bodily signals for self-consciousness we propose an integrated neural system reconciling these two largely separated views and delineate how it accounts for fundamental aspects of self-consciousness such as self-identification and self-location as well as its experienced global unity and temporal continuity. Coupling Inner and Outer Body for Self-Consciousness.
