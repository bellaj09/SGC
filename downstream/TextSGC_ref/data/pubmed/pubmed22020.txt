Despite high prevalence rates of elder abuse and neglect EA/N compliance with mandatory reporting remains low. A lack of practical training on EA/N has been identified as a barrier. This article describes the development implementation and evaluation of an innovative virtual-reality-based educational intervention intended to improve EA/N recognition and reporting among nurses and social workers providing in-home services. The educational intervention consisted of two parts including an introductory course and advanced assessment training in virtual reality. The advanced assessment training was focused on learning to use the QualCare Scale an instrument used to assess quality of family caregiving. Data was evaluated in terms of user satisfaction changes in knowledge and changes in practice. Results indicate that participants were satisfied with the content and format of the training program. Participants made gains in knowledge in identification and had 99% accuracy in their mandatory reporting decisions. Importantly professionals reported making changes in their daily practice based on knowledge and skills learnt. Evaluation data indicate that this interdisciplinary training program was a satisfactory way to learn that produced changes in knowledge and impacted clinical practice. Few implementation barriers were encountered during this project suggesting it would be replicable. EATI Island - A virtual-reality-based elder abuse and neglect educational intervention.
