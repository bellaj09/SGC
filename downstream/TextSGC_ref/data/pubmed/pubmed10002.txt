In recent years machine learning methods for human activity recognition have been found very effective. These classify discriminative features generated from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn inertial sensors. However it involves an explicit feature extraction stage from the raw data and although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time most state-of-the-art machine learning methods do not exploit the temporal correlations between input data samples. In this paper we present a Long-Short Term Memory LSTM deep recurrent neural network for the classification of six daily life activities from accelerometer and gyroscope data. Results show that our LSTM can processes featureless raw input signals and achieves 92 % average accuracy in a multi-class-scenario. Further we show that this accuracy can be achieved with almost four times fewer training epochs by using a batch normalization approach.
