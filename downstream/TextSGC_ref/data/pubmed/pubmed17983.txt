"Hepatitis C-associated osteosclerosis HCAO a very rare disorder in which an extremely rapid bone turnover occurs and results in osteosclerosis was acknowledged in 1990s as a new clinical entity with the unique bone disorder and definite link to chronic type C hepatitis although the pathogenesis still remains unknown. Affected patients suffer from excruciating deep bone pains. We report the 19th case of HCAO with diagnosis confirmed by bone biopsy and treated initially with a bisphosphonate next with corticosteroids and finally with direct acting antivirals DAA: sofosbuvir and ribavirin for HCV infection. Risedronate 17.5\u2009mg/day for 38 days did not improve the patients symptoms or extremely elevated levels of bone markers which indicated hyper-bone-formation and coexisting hyper-bone-resorption in the patient. Next intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by high-dose oral administration of prednisolone evidently improved them. DAA therapy initiated after steroid therapy successfully achieved sustained virological response but no additional therapeutic effect on them was observed. Our results strongly suggested that the underlying immunological alteration is the crucial key to clarify the pathogenesis of HCAO. Bone mineral density of lumbar vertebrae of the patient was increased by 14% in four-month period of observation. Clarification of the mechanisms that develop osteosclerosis in HCAO might lead to a new therapeutic perspective for osteoporosis."
