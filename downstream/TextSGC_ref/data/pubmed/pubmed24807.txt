In BCI applications for stroke rehabilitation BCI systems are used with the aim of providing patients with an instrument that is capable of monitoring and reinforcing EEG patterns generated by motor imagery MI. In this study we proposed an offline analysis on data acquired from stroke patients subjected to a BCI-assisted MI training in order to define an index for the evaluation of MI-BCI training session which is independent from the settings adopted for the online control and which is able to describe the properties of neuroelectrical activations across sessions. Results suggest that such index can be adopted to sort the trails within a session according to the adherence to the task. A new descriptor of neuroelectrical activity during BCI-assisted motor imagery-based training in stroke patients.
