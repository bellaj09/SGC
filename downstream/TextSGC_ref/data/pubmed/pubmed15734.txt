We present a flexible deep convolutional neural network method for the analysis of arbitrary sized graph structures representing molecules. This method which makes use of the Lipinski RDKit module an open-source cheminformatics software enables the incorporation of any global molecular such as molecular charge and molecular weight and local such as atom hybridization and bond orders information. In this paper we show that this method significantly outperforms another recently proposed method based on deep convolutional neural networks on several datasets that are studied. Several best practices for training deep convolutional neural networks on chemical datasets are also highlighted within the article such as how to select the information to be included in the model how to prevent overfitting and how unbalanced classes in the data can be handled.
