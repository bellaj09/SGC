Worldwide polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy PCV is a common vision-threatening exudative maculopathy and pigment epithelium detachment PED is an important clinical characteristic. Thus precise and efficient PED segmentation is necessary for PCV clinical diagnosis and treatment. We propose a dual-stage learning framework via deep neural networks DNN for automated PED segmentation in PCV patients to avoid issues associated with manual PED segmentation subjectivity manual segmentation errors and high time consumption.The optical coherence tomography scans of fifty patients were quantitatively evaluated with different algorithms and clinicians. Dual-stage DNN outperformed existing PED segmentation methods for all segmentation accuracy parameters including true positive volume fraction 85.74  8.69% dice similarity coefficient 85.69  8.08% positive predictive value 86.02  8.99% and false positive volume fraction 0.38  0.18%. Dual-stage DNN achieves accurate PED quantitative information works with multiple types of PEDs and agrees well with manual delineation suggesting that it is a potential automated assistant for PCV management. Dual-stage deep learning framework for pigment epithelium detachment segmentation in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.
