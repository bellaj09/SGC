Motor planning imagery or execution is associated with event-related desynchronization ERD of mu rhythm oscillations 8-13\xa0Hz recordable over sensorimotor areas using electroencephalography EEG. It was shown that motor imagery involving distal muscles e.g. finger movements results in contralateral ERD correlating with increased excitability of the contralateral corticospinal tract c-CST. Following the rationale that purposefully increasing c-CST excitability might facilitate motor recovery after stroke ERD recently became an attractive target for brain-computer interface BCI-based neurorehabilitation training. It was unclear however whether ERD would also reflect excitability of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract i-CST that mainly innervates proximal muscles involved in e.g. shoulder movements. Such knowledge would be important to optimize and extend ERD-based BCI neurorehabilitation protocols e.g. to restore shoulder movements after stroke. Here we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS targeting the ipsilateral primary motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials MEPs of the trapezius muscle. To assess whether ERD reflects excitability of the i-CST a correlation analysis between between MEP amplitudes and ipsilateral ERD was performed. Ipsilateral EEG mu rhythm reflects the excitability of uncrossed pathways projecting to shoulder muscles.
