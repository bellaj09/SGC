Phase unwrapping is an important but challenging issue in phase measurement. Even with the research efforts of a few decades unfortunately the problem remains not well solved especially when heavy noise and aliasing undersampling are present. We propose a database generation method for phase-type objects and a one-step deep learning phase unwrapping method. With a trained deep neural network the unseen phase fields of living mouse osteoblasts and dynamic candle flame are successfully unwrapped demonstrating that the complicated nonlinear phase unwrapping task can be directly fulfilled in one step by a single deep neural network. Excellent anti-noise and anti-aliasing performances outperforming classical methods are highlighted in this paper. One-step robust deep learning phase unwrapping.
