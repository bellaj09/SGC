Ultrasound imaging offers a safe inexpensive method for obtaining medical data. It is also desirable in that data can be acquired at real-time rates and the necessary hardware can be compact and portable. The work presented here documents our attempts at providing interactive 3-D visualization of ultrasound data. We have found two volume rendering visualization packages to be quite useful and have extended one to perform stereographic volume visualization. Using a relatively inexpensive pair of commercial stereo glasses we believe we have found a combination of tools that offers a viable system for enhancing 3-D ultrasound visualization.
