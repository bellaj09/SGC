Developing technical expertise in medical procedures is an integral component of emergency medicine EM practice and training. This article is the work of an expert panel composed of members from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine SAEM Interest Group the SAEM Technology in Medical Education Committee and opinions derived from the May 2008 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference "The Science of Simulation in Healthcare." The writing group reviewed the simulation literature on procedures germane to EM training virtual reality training and instructional learning theory as it pertains to skill acquisition and procedural skills decay. The authors discuss the role of simulation in teaching technical expertise identify training conditions that lead to effective learning and provide recommendations for future foci of research. Developing technical expertise in emergency medicine--the role of simulation in procedural skill acquisition.
