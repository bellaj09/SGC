As a primate animal model for neuroscience research the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain a better understanding of the human brain function and pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders thereby helping in the diagnosis and treatment of those disorders. The marmoset is particularly useful in studying the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior as their prosocial behavior and visual and vocal communication systems are well-developed. Despite recent advances in biotechnology such as the creation of genetically engineered marmosets our understanding of the marmoset brain including its dysfunction in disease at the circuit level remains limited due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the neuronal connections in the marmoset brain. Here we describe the development of genetic and viral engineering techniques for a particular type of neuron in non-transgenic animals. These approaches combined with rabies viral tracing imaging and electrophysiology will make it possible to map the connectome and relate neuronal connectivity to function in the marmoset brain. Such circuit-level studies will open a new avenue for non-human primate research that can bridge the gap between basic research and human studies. Cell-type-specific targeting strategies for elucidating neural circuits and pathophysiological mechanisms in the marmoset brain.
