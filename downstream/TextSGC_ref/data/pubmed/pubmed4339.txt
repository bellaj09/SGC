Patients with psychosis exhibit a reduced susceptibility to depth inversion illusions DII in which a physically concave surface is perceived as convex e.g. the hollow mask illusion. Here we examined the extent to which lessened susceptibility to DII characterized youth at ultra high risk UHR for psychosis. In this study 44 UHR participants and 29 healthy controls judged the apparent convexity of face-like human masks two of which were concave and the other convex. One of the concave masks was painted with realistic texture to enhance the illusion; the other was shown without such texture. Networks involved with top-down and bottom-up processing were evaluated with resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging fcMRI. We examined regions associated with the fronto-parietal network and the visual system and their relations with susceptibility to DII. Consistent with prior studies the UHR group was less susceptible to DII i.e. they were characterized by more veridical perception of the stimuli than the healthy control group. Veridical responses were related to weaker connectivity within the fronto-parietal network and this relationship was stronger in the UHR group suggesting possible abnormalities of top-down modulation of sensory signals. This could serve as a vulnerability marker and a further clue to the pathogenesis of psychosis.
