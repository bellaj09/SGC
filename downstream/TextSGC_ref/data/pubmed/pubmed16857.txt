In March 2004 the Baltimore-based nonprofit organization Advocates for Survivors of Torture and Trauma ASTT initiated a photography-based therapeutic programme for clients. Developed by a professional photographer/teacher in collaboration with a psychologist the programme has the goal of enabling clients to engage in creative self-exploration within a supportive group setting. Since its inception thirty survivors of conflict-related trauma and torture from five different countries have taken part in the programme known as "Healing Images" using digital cameras to gather individually-chosen images that are subsequently shared and discussed within the group. These images include depictions of the natural and manmade environments in which clients find themselves; people places and objects that offer comfort; and self-portraits that reflect the reality of the life of a refugee in the United States. This description of the "Healing Images" programme is based on comments gathered through discussion with participants and through interviews. Additional information was gathered from observation of early workshop sessions review of numerous client photographs and captions and pertinent organizational materials. A fundamental benefit of the programme was that it offered a mutually supportive group environment that diminished clients\ feelings of psychological and physical isolation. Participants gained deep satisfaction from learning the technical skills related to use of the cameras from the empowering experience of framing and creating specific images and from exploring the personal significance of these images. Programme activities sparked a process of self-expression that participants valued on the level of personal discovery and growth. Some clients also welcomed opportunities to share their work publicly as a means of raising awareness of the experience of survivors.
