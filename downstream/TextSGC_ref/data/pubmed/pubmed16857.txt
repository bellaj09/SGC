Increasing evidence supports the use of virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation. However movement performance and quality may be diminished by the attributes of the virtual environment VE which may be detrimental to motor relearning. Our aim was to determine whether reach-to-grasp movements made in a low-cost 2DVE were kinematically similar to those made in a comparable physical environment PE in healthy subjects and subjects with stroke. Subjects healthy = 15 stroke = 22 made unilateral and bilateral reach-to-grasp movements in a 2DVE and a similar PE. Arm and trunk kinematics were recorded with an optoelectronic measurement system 23 markers; 120 Hz. Temporal and spatial characteristics of the endpoint trajectory arm and trunk movement patterns were compared between environments and groups. In each group hand positioning at object contact time and trunk displacement were unaffected by the environment. Compared to PE in VE unilateral movements were less smooth and time to peak velocity was prolonged. In healthy subjects bilateral movements were simultaneous and symmetrical in both environments. In subjects with stroke movements were less symmetrical in VE. Aside from differences in endpoint displacement between environments movement quality variables were unaffected by the 2DVE. Thus using a low-cost 2DVE may be a valid approach for sensorimotor rehabilitation following stroke. Kinematic Validity of Reaching in a 2D Virtual Environment for Arm Rehabilitation After Stroke.
