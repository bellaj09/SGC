"Non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly being acknowledged as valuable treatment options to overcome or reduce functional problems in patients with Parkinsons disease PD. There is a wide range of such non-pharmacological treatments for which the supportive evidence is emerging. Physiotherapy is one good example in this domain. However there are also several promising non-pharmacological treatment strategies that have thus far received less research attention. Here we describe two relatively new but encouraging approaches. First we focus on a hitherto largely overseen subgroup of PD namely those with late-stage disease a population that is often excluded from clinical studies. Importantly the aims and therapeutic strategies in late-stage PD differ considerably from those in early-stage PD and an emphasis on non-pharmacological management is particularly important for this vulnerable subgroup. Second we focus on computer-based cognitive training as an example of a relatively new intervention that includes innovative elements such as personalized training artificial intelligence and virtual reality. We review the latest evidence practical considerations and future research perspectives both for non-pharmacological approaches in late-stage PD and for computer-based cognitive training."
