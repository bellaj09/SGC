Deep learning has become an extremely effective tool for image classification and image restoration problems. Here we apply deep learning to microscopy and demonstrate how neural networks can exploit the chromatic dependence of the point-spread function to classify the colors of single emitters imaged on a grayscale camera. While existing localization microscopy methods for spectral classification require additional optical elements in the emission path e.g. spectral filters prisms or phase masks our neural net correctly identifies static and mobile emitters with high efficiency using a standard unmodified single-channel configuration. Furthermore we show how deep learning can be used to design new phase-modulating elements that when implemented into the imaging path result in further improved color differentiation between species including simultaneously differentiating four species in a single image.
