Semantic reading errors are the central and defining feature of deep dyslexia. This study compared the words the deep dyslexic patient LW read correctly with those she omitted and those to which she produced semantic errors in terms of their concreteness age-of-acquisition frequency and length. Semantic errors were made to less concrete later-acquired and shorter words than were read correctly; there was no reliable effect of word frequency. More importantly the actual semantic errors produced were later-acquired than the stimulus words but they were not more concrete or reliably more frequent. These results implicate age-of-acquisition in the process that produces semantic errors. It is proposed that concreteness determines the specificity of the semantic system to activate a set of candidate responses and that age-of-acquisition biases the ease with which certain words can be selected from this set to be produced as reading responses. When does a deep dyslexic make a semantic error? The roles of age-of-acquisition concreteness and frequency.
