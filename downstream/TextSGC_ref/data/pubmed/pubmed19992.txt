Background: The popularity of virtual reality VR grew rapidly. Short guidelines with a lack of emphasis on safe use appears prior to usage. It is necessary for the user to realize how much potentially dangerous VR is. Aims/objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of VR on balance in normal people. Materials and methods: Mean equilibrium score MES of 15 adults who have normal sense of balance were obtained by using the sensory organization test SOT. Conditions 1 and 2 were performed. Multiple VR programs were classified as three levels Easy Average and Challenging by the visual analog scale. Further SOT tests were performed during watching VR programs. MES of each test was used for statistical analysis. Results: MES of condition 1 was significantly higher than condition 2. Although there was no statistical difference between Eye open and Easy program p\u2009=\u2009.097 MES of average and Challenging programs showed significantly decreased scores compared to Eye open. In addition MES of Average and Challenging programs were significantly decreased than that of Easy program. Conclusions and significance: VR can cause postural imbalance to users. It is necessary to establish quantifiable and objective methods to measure imbalance caused by VR use. Postural instability according to virtual reality program.
