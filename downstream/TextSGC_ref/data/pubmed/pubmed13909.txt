"Deep brain stimulation DBS is an established treatment for patients with Parkinsons disease PD. Sleep disorders are common complications of PD and affected by subthalamic DBS treatment. To achieve more precise neuromodulation chronicsleepmonitoringand closed-loop DBS toward sleep-wake cycles could potentially be utilized. Local field potential LFP signals that are sensed by the DBS electrode could be processed as primary feedback signals. This is the first study to systematically investigate the sleep-stage classification based on LFPs in subthalamic nucleus STN. With our newly developed recording and transmission system STN-LFPs were collected from 12 PD patients during wakefulness and nocturnal polysomnography sleep monitoring at one month after DBS implantation. Automatic sleep-stage classificationmodels were built with robust and interpretable machine learning methods support vector machine and decision tree. The accuracy sensitivity selectivity and specificity of the classification reached high values above90% at most measures at group and individual levels. Features extracted in alpha 8-13 Hz beta 13-35 Hz and gamma 35-50 Hz bandswere found to contribute the most to the classification. These results will directly guide the engineering development of implantable sleepmonitoring and closed-loopDBS and pave the way for a better understanding of the STN-LFP sleep patterns."
