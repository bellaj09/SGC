Recent advances in machine learning ML have led to enthusiasm about its use throughout the biopharmaceutical industry. The ML methods can be applied to a wide range of problems and have the potential to revolutionize aspects of drug development. The incorporation of ML in modeling and simulation M&S has been eagerly anticipated and in this perspective we highlight examples in which ML and M&S approaches can be integrated as complementary parts of a clinical pharmacology workflow. Models and Machines: How Deep Learning Will Take Clinical Pharmacology to the Next Level.
