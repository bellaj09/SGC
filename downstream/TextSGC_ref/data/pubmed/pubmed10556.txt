The spatial organization of different types of cells in tumor tissues reveals important information about the tumor microenvironment TME. To facilitate the study of cellular spatial organization and interactions we developed Histology-based Digital-Staining a deep learning-based computation model to segment the nuclei of tumor stroma lymphocyte macrophage karyorrhexis and red blood cells from standard hematoxylin and eosin-stained pathology images in lung adenocarcinoma. Using this tool we identified and classified cell nuclei and extracted 48 cell spatial organization-related features that characterize the TME. Using these features we developed a prognostic model from the National Lung Screening Trial dataset and independently validated the model in The Cancer Genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma dataset in which the predicted high-risk group showed significantly worse survival than the low-risk group P = 0.001 with a HR of 2.23 1.37-3.65 after adjusting for clinical variables. Furthermore the image-derived TME features significantly correlated with the gene expression of biological pathways. For example transcriptional activation of both the T-cell receptor and programmed cell death protein 1 pathways positively correlated with the density of detected lymphocytes in tumor tissues while expression of the extracellular matrix organization pathway positively correlated with the density of stromal cells. In summary we demonstrate that the spatial organization of different cell types is predictive of patient survival and associated with the gene expression of biological pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings present a deep learning-based analysis tool to study the TME in pathology images and demonstrate that the cell spatial organization is predictive of patient survival and is associated with gene expression.
