Advanced MRI studies have revealed regional alterations in the sensorimotor cortex of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis RRMS. However the organizational features underlying the relapsing phase and the subsequent remitting phase have not been directly shown at the functional network or the connectome level. Therefore this study aimed to characterize MS-related centrality disturbances of the sensorimotor network SMN and to assess network integrity and connectedness. Intrinsic functional plasticity of the sensorimotor network in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: evidence from a centrality analysis.
