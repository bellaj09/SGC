"Global signal regression is a controversial processing step for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging partly because the source of the global blood oxygen level-dependent BOLD signal remains unclear. On the one hand nuisance factors such as motion can readily introduce coherent BOLD changes across the whole brain. On the other hand the global signal has been linked to neural activity and vigilance levels suggesting that it contains important neurophysiological information and should not be discarded. Any widespread pattern of coordinated activity is likely to contribute appreciably to the global signal. Such patterns may include large-scale quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns known also to be tied to performance on vigilance tasks. This uncertainty surrounding the separability of the global BOLD signal from concurrent neurological processes motivated an examination of the global BOLD signals spatial distribution. The results clarify that although the global signal collects information from all tissue classes a diverse subset of the BOLD signals independent components contribute the most to the global signal. Further the timing of each networks contribution to the global signal is not consistent across volunteers confirming the independence of a constituent process that comprises the global signal."
