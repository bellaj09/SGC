The MGH-USC CONNECTOM MRI scanner housed at the Massachusetts General Hospital MGH is a major hardware innovation of the Human Connectome Project HCP. The 3T CONNECTOM scanner is capable of producing a magnetic field gradient of up to 300 mT/m strength for in vivo human brain imaging which greatly shortens the time spent on diffusion encoding and decreases the signal loss due to T2 decay. To demonstrate the capability of the novel gradient system data of healthy adult participants were acquired for this MGH-USC Adult Diffusion Dataset N=35 minimally preprocessed and shared through the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Image Data Archive LONI IDA and the WU-Minn Connectome Database ConnectomeDB. Another purpose of sharing the data is to facilitate methodological studies of diffusion MRI dMRI analyses utilizing high diffusion contrast which perhaps is not easily feasible with standard MR gradient system. In addition acquisition of the MGH-Harvard-USC Lifespan Dataset is currently underway to include 120 healthy participants ranging from 8 to 90 years old which will also be shared through LONI IDA and ConnectomeDB. Here we describe the efforts of the MGH-USC HCP consortium in acquiring and sharing the ultra-high b-value diffusion MRI data and provide a report on data preprocessing and access. We conclude with a demonstration of the example data along with results of standard diffusion analyses including q-ball Orientation Distribution Function ODF reconstruction and tractography.
