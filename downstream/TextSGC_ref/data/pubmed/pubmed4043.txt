The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus IFOF is a large white matter tract of the human cerebrum with functional connectivity associated with semantic language processing and goal-oriented behavior. However little is known regarding the overall connectivity of this tract. Recently the Human Connectome Project parcellated the human cortex into 180 distinct regions. In our other work we have shown these various regions in relation to clinically applicable anatomy and function. Utilizing Diffusion Spectrum Magnetic Resonance Imaging tractography coupled with the human cortex parcellation data presented earlier in this supplement we aim to describe the macro-connectome of the IFOF in relation to the linked parcellations present within the human cortex. The purpose of this study is to present this information in an indexed illustrated and tractographically aided series of figures and tables for anatomic and clinical reference.
