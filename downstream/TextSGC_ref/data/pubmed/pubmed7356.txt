Purpose To investigate the performance of a deep convolutional neural network DCNN model in the staging of liver fibrosis using gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase magnetic resonance MR imaging. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients for whom input data hepatobiliary phase MR images static magnetic field of the imaging unit and hepatitis B and C virus testing results available either positive or negative and reference standard data liver fibrosis stage evaluated from biopsy or surgical specimens obtained within 6 months of the MR examinations were available were assigned to the training 534 patients or the test 100 patients group. For the training group 54 53 81 113 and 233 patients with fibrosis stages F0 F1 F2 F3 and F4 respectively; mean patient age 67.4  9.7 years; 388 men and 146 women MR images with three different section levels were augmented 90-fold rotated parallel-shifted brightness-changed and contrast-changed images were generated; a total of 144 180 images. Supervised training was performed by using the DCNN model to minimize the difference between the output data fibrosis score obtained through deep learning FDL score and liver fibrosis stage. The performance of the DCNN model was evaluated in the test group 10 10 15 20 and 45 patients with fibrosis stages F0 F1 F2 F3 and F4 respectively; mean patient age 66.8 years  10.7; 71 male patients and 29 female patients with receiver operating characteristic ROC analyses. Results The FDL score was correlated significantly with fibrosis stage Spearman rank correlation coefficient: 0.63; P < .001. Fibrosis stages F4 F3 and F2 were diagnosed with areas under the ROC curve of 0.84 0.84 and 0.85 respectively. Conclusion The DCNN model exhibited a high diagnostic performance in the staging of liver fibrosis.  RSNA 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
