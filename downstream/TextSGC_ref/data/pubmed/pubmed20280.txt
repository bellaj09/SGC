Mechanical properties of biological tissue represent important diagnostic information and are of histological relevance hard lesions "nodes" in organs: tumors; calcifications in vessels: arteriosclerosis. The problem is that such information is usually obtained by digital palpation only which is limited with respect to sensitivity. It requires intuitive assessment and does not allow quantitative documentation. A suitable sensor is required for quantitative detection of mechanical tissue properties. On the other hand there is also some need for a realistic mechanical display of those tissue properties. Suitable actuator arrays with high spatial resolution and real-time capabilities are required operating in a haptic sensor actuator system with different applications. The sensor system uses real time ultrasonic elastography whereas the tactile actuator is based on electrorheological fluids. Due to their small size the actuator array elements have to be manufactured by micro-mechanical production methods. In order to supply the actuator elements with individual high voltages a sophisticated switching and control concept have been designed. This haptic system has the potential of inducing real time substantial forces using a compact lightweight mechanism which can be applied to numerous areas including intraoperative navigation telemedicine teaching space and telecommunication.
