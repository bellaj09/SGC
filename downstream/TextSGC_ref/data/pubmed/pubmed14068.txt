"Three field experiments with high school and college students tested the self-determination theory hypotheses that intrinsic vs. extrinsic goals and autonomy-supportive vs. controlling learning climates would improve students learning performance and persistence. The learning of text material or physical exercises was framed in terms of intrinsic community personal growth health versus extrinsic money image goals which were presented in an autonomy-supportive versus controlling manner. Analyses of variance confirmed that both experimentally manipulated variables yielded main effects on depth of processing test performance and persistence all ps <.001 and an interaction resulted in synergistically high deep processing and test performance but not persistence when both intrinsic goals and autonomy support were present. Effects were significantly mediated by autonomous motivation." Motivating learning performance and persistence: the synergistic effects of intrinsic goal contents and autonomy-supportive contexts.
