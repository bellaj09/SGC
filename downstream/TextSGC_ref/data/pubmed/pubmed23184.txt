Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are intended to provide independent communication for those with the most severe physical impairments. However development and testing of BCIs is typically conducted with copy-spelling of provided text which models only a small portion of a functional communication task. This study was designed to determine how BCI performance is affected by novel text generation. We used a within-subject single-session study design in which subjects used a BCI to perform copy-spelling of provided text and to generate self-composed text to describe a picture. Additional off-line analysis was performed to identify changes in the event-related potentials that the BCI detects and to examine the effects of training the BCI classifier on task-specific data. Accuracy was reduced during the picture description task; t8=2.59 p=0.0321. Creating the classifier using self-generated text data significantly improved accuracy on these data; t7=-2.68 p=0.0317 but did not bring performance up to the level achieved during copy-spelling. Thus this study shows that the task for which the BCI is used makes a difference in BCI accuracy. Task-specific BCI classifiers are a first step to counteract this effect but additional study is needed. Effects of text generation on P300 brain-computer interface performance.
