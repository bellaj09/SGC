"The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on game-based digital interventions for depression systematically and examine their effectiveness through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials RCTs. Database searching was conducted using specific search terms and inclusion criteria. A standard meta-analysis was also conducted of available RCT studies with a random effects model. The standard mean difference Cohens d was used to calculate the effect size of each study. Nineteen studies were included in the review and 10 RCTs eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Four types of game interventions-psycho-education and training virtual reality exposure therapy exercising and entertainment-were identified with various types of support delivered and populations targeted. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate effect size of the game interventions for depression therapy at posttreatment d=-0.47 95% CI -0.69 to -0.24. A subgroup analysis showed that interventions based on psycho-education and training had a smaller effect than those based on the other forms and that self-help interventions yielded better outcomes than supported interventions. A higher effect was achieved when a waiting list was used as the control. The review and meta-analysis support the effectiveness of game-based digital interventions for depression. More large-scale high-quality RCT studies with sufficient long-term data for treatment evaluation are needed."
