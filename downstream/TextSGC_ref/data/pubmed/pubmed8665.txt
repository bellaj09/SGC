Video stabilization techniques are essential for most hand-held captured videos due to high-frequency shakes. Several 2D 2.5D and 3D-based stabilization techniques have been presented previously but to our knowledge no solutions based on deep neural networks had been proposed to date. The main reason for this omission is shortage in training data as well as the challenge of modeling the problem using neural networks. In this paper we present a video stabilization technique using a convolutional neural network. Previous works usually propose an offline algorithm that smoothes a holistic camera path based on feature matching. Instead we focus on low-latency real-time camera path smoothing that does not explicitly represent the camera path and does not use future frames. Our neural network model called StabNet learns a set of mesh-grid transformations progressively for each input frame from the previous set of stabalized camera frames and creates stable corresponding latent camera paths implicitly. To train the network we collect a dataset of synchronized steady and unsteady video pairs via a specially designed hand-held hardware. Experimental results show that our proposed online method performs comparatively to traditional offline video stabilization methods without using future frames while running about 10 faster. More importantly our proposed StabNet is able to handle low-quality videos such as night-scene videos watermarked videos blurry videos and noisy videos where existing methods fail in feature extraction or matching.
