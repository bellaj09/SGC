Deep brain stimulation is explored as a new intervention for treatment-resistant substance use dependence. A candidate brain region is the nucleus accumbens due to its involvement in reward and motivation. This study aimed to explore effects of NAcore and NAshell deep brain stimulation on aspects of heroin taking and seeking in a self-administration model for rats. Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens core but not shell reduces motivational components of heroin taking and seeking in rats.
