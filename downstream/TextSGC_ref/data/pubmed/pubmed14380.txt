"Background: Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation STN-DBS is highly effective in alleviating motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD which are not optimally controlled by dopamine replacement therapy. Clinical studies and reports suggest that STN-DBS may result in increased impulsivity and de novo impulse control disorders ICD. Objective/Hypothesis: We aimed to compare performance on a decision making task the Iowa Gambling Task IGT in healthy conditions HC untreated and medically-treated PD conditions with and without STN stimulation. We hypothesized that the position of electrode and stimulation current modulate impulsivity after STN-DBS. Methods: We built a computational spiking network model of basal ganglia BG and compared the models STN output with STN activity in PD. Reinforcement learning methodology was applied to simulate IGT performance under various conditions of dopaminergic and STN stimulation where IGT total and bin scores were compared among various conditions. Results: The computational model reproduced neural activity observed in normal and PD conditions. Untreated and medically-treated PD conditions had lower total IGT scores higher impulsivity compared to HC P < 0.0001. The electrode position that happens to selectively stimulate the part of the STN corresponding to an advantageous panel on IGT resulted in de-selection of that panel and worsening of performance P < 0.0001. Supratherapeutic stimulation amplitudes also worsened IGT performance P < 0.001. Conclusions: In our computational model STN stimulation led to impulsive decision making in IGT in PD condition. Electrode position and stimulation current influenced impulsivity which may explain the variable effects of STN-DBS reported in patients."
