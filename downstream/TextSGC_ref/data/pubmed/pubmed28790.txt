The availability of sophisticated neural probes is a key prerequisite in the development of future brain-machine interfaces BMIs. In this study the authors developed and validated a neural probe design capable of simultaneous drug delivery and electrophysiology recordings in vivo. Focal drug delivery promises to extend dramatically the recording lives of neural probes a limiting factor to clinical adoption of BMI technology. In vivo performance of a microelectrode neural probe with integrated drug delivery.
