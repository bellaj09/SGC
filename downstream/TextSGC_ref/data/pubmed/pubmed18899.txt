"Virtual reality technology is an emerging technology that possibly can address the problems encountered in training elderly people to handle a mobility device. The objective of this review was to study different virtual reality training applications as well as their clinical implication for patients with mobility problems. Computerized literature searches were performed using the MEDLINE Cochrane CIRRIE and REHABDATA databases. This resulted in eight peer reviewed journal articles. The included studies could be divided into three categories on the basis of their study objective. Five studies were related to training driving skills two to physical exercise training and one to leisure activity. This review suggests that virtual reality is a potentially useful means to improve the use of a mobility device in training ones driving skills for keeping up the physical condition and also in a way of leisure time activity. Although this field of research appears to be in its early stages the included studies pointed out a promising transfer of training in a virtual environment to the real-life use of mobility devices."
