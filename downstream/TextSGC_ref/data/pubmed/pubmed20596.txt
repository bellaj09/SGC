"Falls are very common especially in adults aged 65 years and older. Within the current international European Commissions Seventh Framework Program FP7 project iStoppFalls an Information and Communication Technology ICT based system has been developed to regularly assess a persons risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program and its effectiveness to improve balance muscle strength and quality of life in older people."
