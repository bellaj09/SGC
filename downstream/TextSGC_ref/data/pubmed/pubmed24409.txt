Haptic feedback in virtual reality-based trainers for surgical bone drilling is mostly provided via impedance-controlled haptic devices with limited displayable force. In addition vibration feedback is often only of reduced fidelity. To overcome these shortcomings we have developed a hand-held actuated admittance-controlled drill mockup comprising enhanced kinesthetic and tactile feedback. This paper reports on design and characterization of the device and highlights its use for training. Kinesthetic feedback is provided through haptic augmentation employing a ball-screw mechanism acting on a retractable drill-bit. Feedback computation relies on admittance control allowing for stable display of very high resistance forces and thus material stiffness which cannot be achieved with standard impedance-control approaches. For the tactile mechanism a modified linear vibration actuator is directly attached to the mockup handle improving signal transmission. To compensate the actuator dynamic frequency-specific gains are adjusted in real-time. The performance of the device is characterized in several experiments including comparisons to drilling with a real drill into artificial bone samples. We illustrate the capability of the mockup to render bone samples with different material layer stiffness and thickness. Moreover we show that the mockup system allows for the same training effect as when rehearsing with a real drill.
