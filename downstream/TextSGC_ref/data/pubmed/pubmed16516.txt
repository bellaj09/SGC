This article contains data related to the research article entitle "Multi-modal Deep Learning for Fruit Detection Using RGB-D Cameras and their Radiometric Capabilities" 1. The development of reliable fruit detection and localization systems is essential for future sustainable agronomic management of high-value crops. RGB-D sensors have shown potential for fruit detection and localization since they provide 3D information with color data. However the lack of substantial datasets is a barrier for exploiting the use of these sensors. This article presents the KFuji RGB-DS database which is composed by 967 multi-modal images of Fuji apples on trees captured using Microsoft Kinect v2 Microsoft Redmond WA USA. Each image contains information from 3 different modalities: color RGB depth D and range corrected IR intensity S. Ground truth fruit locations were manually annotated labeling a total of 12839 apples in all the dataset. The current dataset is publicly available at http://www.grap.udl.cat/publicacions/datasets.html.
