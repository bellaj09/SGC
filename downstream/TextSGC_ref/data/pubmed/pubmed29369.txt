A high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP has been suggested for the reduction of eye fatigue for SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. However the poor performance of high-frequency SSVEP requires a novel stimulus of better performance even with low eye fatigue. As an alternative to the high-frequency SSVEP we explore the SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated stimulus AM-SSVEP to verify its availability for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. An amplitude-modulated visual stimulation for reducing eye fatigue in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces.
