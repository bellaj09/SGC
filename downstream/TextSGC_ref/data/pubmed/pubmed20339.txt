In the size-weight illusion the smaller object from two equally weighted objects is typically judged as being heavier. One explanation is that the mismatch between the weight expectation based on object size and actual sensory feedback influences heaviness perception. In most studies the size of an object is perceived before its weight. We investigated whether size changes would influence weight judgement if both would be perceived simultaneously. We used virtual reality to change the size and weight of an object after lifting and asked participants to judge whether the object became lighter or heavier. We found that simultaneous size-weight changes greatly reduced the size-weight illusion to perceptual biases below discrimination thresholds. In a control experiment in which we used a standard size-weight illusion protocol with sequential lifts of small and large objects in the same virtual reality setup we found a larger typical perceptual bias. These results show that the size-weight illusion is smaller when size and weight information is perceived simultaneously. This provides support for the prediction mismatch theory explaining the size-weight illusion. The comparison between perceived and expected weight during the lifting phase could be a critical brain mechanism for mediating the size-weight illusion. Dynamic size-weight changes after object lifting reduce the size-weight illusion.
