The use of virtual reality VR in the training of operative dentistry is a recent innovation and little research has been published on its efficacy compared to conventional training methods. Two groups of dental students with no experience in operative dentistry were trained solely by either VR or conventional training in the preparation of conventional class 1 cavities. The subjects all used the same operative armamentarium and phantom heads and were allocated the same duration of practice periods. At the completion of these training periods both groups produced two class 1 cavities on the lower left first molar which were subsequently coded and blindly scored for the traditional assessment criteria of outline form retention form smoothness cavity depth and cavity margin angulation. An ordinal score of 0-3 or 0-4 was assigned for each assessment criterion: the higher the score the worse the evaluation. After initial independent scoring the two examiners discussed any notable differences until an agreed score was reached. Once the codes were broken non-parametric analyses were performed on the data. Wilcoxon Tests for the semiquantitative scores indicated significant differences between the VR and conventional training groups for outline form depth and smoothness but not for retention or cavity margin angulation at P < 0.05 level with the VR group receiving the higher i.e. worse scores. Cavity margin angulation approached significance with a P-value of 0.0536. The results indicated that VR-based skills acquisition is unsuitable for use as the sole method of feedback and evaluation for novice students.
