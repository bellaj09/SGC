Understanding brain networks is important for many fields including neuroscience psychology medicine and artificial intelligence. To address this fundamental need there are multiple ongoing connectome projects in the United States Europe and Asia producing brain connection maps with resolutions at macro- and microscales. However still lacking is a mesoscale connectome. This viewpoint 1 explains the need for a mesoscale connectome in the primate brain the columnar connectome 2 presents a new method for acquiring such data rapidly on a large scale and 3 proposes how one might use such data to achieve a mathematics of brain function. Columnar connectome: toward a mathematics of brain function.
