"The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for procedural pain relief in adults undergoing burn wound care compared to standard care alone or an attention control. Through a comprehensive literature search in various electronic databases 21 eligible randomized controlled trials RCTs were included comprising a total of 660 patients. Random effects meta-analyses revealed significant positive treatment effects on pain outcomes Hedges g=0.58 95% CI 0.33; 0.84. Heterogeneity of study effects was substantial I2=72%. Effects were significantly larger for comparisons against treatment as usual TAU g=0.69 CI 95% 0.40; 0.98 than for comparisons against attention control groups g=0.21 -0.11; 0.54 p<0.001. Distraction interventions particularly those using virtual reality and hypnosis revealed the largest effects on pain relief. Non-pharmacological interventions further resulted in a significant small homogeneous effect on anxiety reduction g=0.36 0.20; 0.52. In summary benefits of non-pharmacological interventions on procedural pain relief and reduction of mental distress were demonstrated. Results have been proven to be free of publication bias. However further high quality trials are needed to strengthen the promising evidence."
