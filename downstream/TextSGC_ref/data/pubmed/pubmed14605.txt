A light-field camera captures both the intensity and the direction of incoming light1-5. This enables a user to refocus pictures and afterwards reconstruct information on the depth of field. Research on light-field imaging can be divided into two components: acquisition and rendering. Microlens arrays have been used for acquisition but obtaining broadband achromatic images with no spherical aberration remains challenging. Here we describe a metalens array made of gallium nitride GaN nanoantennas6 that can be used to capture light-field information and demonstrate a full-colour light-field camera devoid of chromatic aberration. The metalens array contains an array of 60\u2009\u200960 metalenses with diameters of 21.65\u2009m. The camera has a diffraction-limited resolution of 1.95\u2009m under white light illumination. The depth of every object in the scene can be reconstructed slice by slice from a series of rendered images with different depths of focus. Full-colour achromatic light-field cameras could find applications in a variety of fields such as robotic vision self-driving vehicles and virtual and augmented reality.
