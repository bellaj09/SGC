Chronic overlapping pain conditions COPCs are characterized by aberrant central nervous system processing of pain. This "centralized pain" phenotype has been described using a large and diverse set of symptom domains including the spatial distribution of pain pain intensity fatigue mood imbalances cognitive dysfunction altered somatic sensations and hypersensitivity to external stimuli. Here we used 3 cohorts including patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome a mixed pain cohort with other COPCs and healthy individuals total n = 1039 from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain MAPP Research Network to explore the factor structure of symptoms of centralized pain. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis we identified 2 general factors in all 3 cohorts one characterized by a broad increased sensitivity to internal somatic sensationsenvironmental stimuli and diffuse pain termed Generalized Sensory Sensitivity and one characterized by constitutional symptoms-Sleep Pain Affect Cognition Energy SPACE. Longitudinal analyses in the urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome cohort found the same 2-factor structure at month 6 and 1 year suggesting that the 2-factor structure is reproducible over time. In secondary analyses we found that Generalized Sensory Sensitivity particularly is associated with the presence of comorbid COPCs whereas SPACE shows modest associations with measures of disability and urinary symptoms. These factors may represent an important and distinct continuum of symptoms that are indicative of the centralized pain phenotype at high levels. Future research of COPCs should accommodate the measurement of each factor. Sensory sensitivity and symptom severity represent unique dimensions of chronic pain: a MAPP Research Network study.
