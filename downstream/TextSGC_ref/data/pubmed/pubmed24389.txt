"Haptic interface technologies for virtual reality applica have been developed to increase the reality and manipulability of a virtual object by creating a diverse tactile sensation. Most evaluation of the haptic technologies however have been limited to the haptic perception of the tactile stimuli via static virtual objects. Noting this we investigated the effect of lateral cutaneous feedback along with kinesthetic feedback on the perception of virtual object weight during manipulation. We modeled the physical interaction between a participants finger avatars and virtual objects. The haptic stimuli were rendered with custom-built haptic feedback systems that can provide kinesthetic and lateral cutaneous feedback to the participant. We conducted two virtual object manipulation experiments 1. a virtual object manipulation with one finger and 2. the pull-out and lift-up of a virtual object grasped with a precision grip. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that the participants felt the virtual object rendered with lateral cutaneous feedback significantly heavier than with only kinesthetic feedback p\u2009<\u20090.05 for mref\u2009=\u2009100 and 200\u2009g. Similarly the participants of Experiment 2 felt the virtual objects significantly heavier when lateral cutaneous feedback was available p\u2009<\u20090.05 for mref\u2009=\u2009100 200 and 300\u2009g. Therefore the additional lateral cutaneous feedback to the force feedback led the participants to feel the virtual object heavier than without the cutaneous feedback. The results also indicate that the contact force applied to a virtual object during manipulation can be a function of the perceived object weight p\u2009=\u20090.005 for Experiment 1 and p\u2009=\u20090.2 for Experiment 2."
