Resent studies suggest that brain-computer interface BCI training for chronic stroke patient is useful to improve their motor function of paretic hand. However these studies does not show the extent of the contribution of the BCI clearly because they prescribed BCI with other rehabilitation systems e.g. an orthosis itself a robotic intervention or electrical stimulation. We therefore compared neurological effects between interventions with neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES with motor imagery and BCI-driven NMES employing an ABAB experimental design. In epoch A the subject received NMES on paretic extensor digitorum communis EDC. The subject was asked to attempt finger extension simultaneously. In epoch B the subject received NMES when BCI system detected motor-related electroencephalogram change while attempting motor imagery. Both epochs were carried out for 60 min per day 5 days per week. As a result EMG activity of EDC was enhanced by BCI-driven NMES and significant cortico-muscular coherence was observed at the final evaluation. These results indicate that the training by BCI-driven NMES is effective even compared to motor imagery combined with NMES suggesting the superiority of closed-loop training with BCI-driven NMES to open-loop NMES for chronic stroke patients.
