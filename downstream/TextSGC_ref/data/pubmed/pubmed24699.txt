Among various brain activity patterns Steady State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP based Brain Computer Inter-face BCI requires the least training time while carrying the fastest information transfer rate making it highly suitable for deploying efficient self-paced BCI systems. In this study we propose a Spectrum and Phase Adaptive CCA SPACCA for subject-and device-specific SSVEP-based BCI. Cross subject heterogeneity of spectrum distribution is taken into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy. We design a library of phase shifting reference signals to accommodate subjective and device-related response time lag. With the flexible reference signal generating approach the system can be optimized for any specific flickering source include LED computer screen and mobile devices. We evaluated the performance of SPACCA using three sets of data that use LED computer screen and mobile device tablet as stimuli sources respectively. The first two data sets are publicly available whereas the third data set is collected in our BCI lab. Across different data sets SPACCA consistently performs better than the baseline i.e. standard CCA approach. Statistical test to compare the overall results across three data sets yield a p-value of 1.66e-6 implying the improvement is significant.
