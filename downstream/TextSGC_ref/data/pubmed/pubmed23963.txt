Humans and other primates possess a unique capacity to grasp and manipulate objects skillfully a facility pervasive in everyday life that has undoubtedly contributed to the success of our species. When we reach and grasp an object various cortical areas in the parietal and frontal lobes work together effortlessly to analyze object shape and position transform this visual information into useful motor commands and implement these motor representations to preshape the hand before contact with the object is made. In recent years a growing number of studies have investigated the neural circuits underlying object grasping in both the visual and motor systems of the macaque monkey. The accumulated knowledge not only helps researchers understand how object grasping is implemented in the primate brain but may also contribute to the development of novel neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics.
