Artificial intelligence capabilities have recently greatly improved. In the past few years one of the deep learning algorithms the recurrent neural network RNN has shown an outstanding ability in sequence labeling and prediction tasks for sequential data. We built a reliable visual field prediction algorithm using RNN and evaluated its performance in comparison with the conventional pointwise ordinary linear regression OLR method. A total of 1408 eyes were used as a training dataset and another dataset comprising 281 eyes was used as a test dataset. Five consecutive visual field tests were provided to the constructed RNN as input and a 6th visual field test was compared with the output of the RNN. The performance of the RNN was compared with that of OLR by predicting the 6th visual field in the test dataset. The overall prediction performance of RNN was significantly better than OLR. The pointwise prediction error of the RNN was significantly smaller than that of the OLR in most areas known to be vulnerable to glaucomatous damage. The RNN was also more robust and reliable regarding worsening in the visual field examination. In clinical practice the RNN model can therefore assist in decision-making for further treatment of glaucoma. Visual Field Prediction using Recurrent Neural Network.
