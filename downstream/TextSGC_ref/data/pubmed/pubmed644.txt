The capacity and capabilities of global producers to meet the potential demand for treating patients inflicted with COVID-19 by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 should HCQs efficacy be established by more definitive clinical trials is also assessed. Given the large existing manufacturing base and abundance of raw materials for HCQ the supply challenge can be met with considerable efforts and international cooperation. Preemptive and coordinated emergency efforts among global governments regulatory agencies chemical and pharmaceutical industries are imperative for meeting the surge in demand."
