"\xa0While an explosion in technological sophistication has revolutionized surgery within the operating theatre delivery of surgical ward-based care has seen little innovation.\xa0 Use of telepresence allowing off-site clinicians communicate with patients has been largely restricted to outpatient settings or use of complex expensive static devices.\xa0 We designed a prospective study to ascertain feasibility and face validity of a remotely controlled mobile audiovisual drone LUCY to access inpatients. \xa0This device is uniquely lightweight freely mobile and emulates human interaction by swiveling and adjusting height to patients eye-level.\xa0\xa0\xa0METHODS: Robot-assisted ward roundsRASWR were conducted over 3 months. A remotely located consultant surgeon communicated with patients/bedside teams via encrypted audiovisual telepresence robot DoubleRoboticstm California USA.\xa0 Likert-scale satisfaction questionnaires incorporating free-text sections for mixed-methods data collection were disseminated to patient and staff volunteers following RASWRs.\xa0 The same cohort completed a linked questionnaire following conventional gold-standard rounds acting as control group. Data were paired and non-parametric analysis performed.\xa0\xa0RESULTS: RASWRs are feasible >90% completed without technical difficulty. The RASWRn=52 observations demonstrated face validity with strong correlations r>0.7; Spearman p-value <0.05 between robotic and conventional ward rounds among patients and staff on core themes including dignity/confidentiality/communication/satisfaction with management plan. Patients 96.08% n=25 agreed RASWR were a satisfactory alternative when consultant physical presence was not possible. There was acceptance of nursing/NCHD cohort 100% n=11 willing to regularly partake in RASWR.\xa0\xa0CONCLUSION: RASWRs receive high levels of patient and staff acceptance and offer a valid alternative to conventional ward rounds when a consultant cannot be physically present." Robot Assisted Surgical Ward Rounds: Virtually Always There.
