Background and purpose - We aimed to evaluate the ability of artificial intelligence a deep learning algorithm to detect and classify proximal humerus fractures using plain anteroposterior shoulder radiographs. Patients and methods - 1891 images 1 image per person of normal shoulders n = 515 and 4 proximal humerus fracture types greater tuberosity 346; surgical neck 514; 3-part 269; 4-part 247 classified by 3 specialists were evaluated. We trained a deep convolutional neural network CNN after augmentation of a training dataset. The ability of the CNN as measured by top-1 accuracy area under receiver operating characteristics curve AUC sensitivity/specificity and Youden index in comparison with humans 28 general physicians 11 general orthopedists and 19 orthopedists specialized in the shoulder to detect and classify proximal humerus fractures was evaluated. Results - The CNN showed a high performance of 96% top-1 accuracy 1.00 AUC 0.99/0.97 sensitivity/specificity and 0.97 Youden index for distinguishing normal shoulders from proximal humerus fractures. In addition the CNN showed promising results with 65-86% top-1 accuracy 0.90-0.98 AUC 0.88/0.83-0.97/0.94 sensitivity/specificity and 0.71-0.90 Youden index for classifying fracture type. When compared with the human groups the CNN showed superior performance to that of general physicians and orthopedists similar performance to orthopedists specialized in the shoulder and the superior performance of the CNN was more marked in complex 3- and 4-part fractures. Interpretation - The use of artificial intelligence can accurately detect and classify proximal humerus fractures on plain shoulder AP radiographs. Further studies are necessary to determine the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence in the clinic and whether its use could improve care and outcomes compared with current orthopedic assessments. Automated detection and classification of the proximal humerus fracture by using deep learning algorithm.
