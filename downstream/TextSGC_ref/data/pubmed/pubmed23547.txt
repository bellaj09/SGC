This paper presents a new method for representing results of an information retrieval search in a three dimensional environment. Aside from the fact that users find 3-D interfaces visually appealing there are strong practical reasons for developing 3-D representations of search results. Traditional information retrieval systems present results in ordered lists which are difficult to browse and exclude useful information. The current method employs a multivariate statistical method called Local Latent Semantic Indexing LLSI to create meaningful local dimensions in which to view search results. A prototype Internet-ready system is described which utilizes Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML to display search results. Preliminary tests of this system with a small collection of MEDLINE articles are very encouraging. A method for representing search results in three dimensions.
