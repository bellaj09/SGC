"Logical properties such as negation implication and symmetry despite the fact that they are foundational and threaded through the vocabulary and syntax of known natural languages pose a special problem for language learning. Their meanings are much harder to identify and isolate in the childs everyday interaction with referents in the world than concrete things like spoons and horses and happenings and acts like running and jumping that are much more easily identified and thus more easily linked to their linguistic labels spoon horse run jump. Here we concentrate attention on the category of symmetry a relation R is symmetrical if and only if iff for all x y: if Rxy then Ryx expressed in English by such terms as similar marry cousin and near After a brief introduction to how symmetry is expressed in English and other well-studied languages we discuss the appearance and maturation of this category in Nicaraguan Sign Language NSL. NSL is an emerging language used as the primary daily means of communication among a population of deaf individuals who could not acquire the surrounding spoken language because they could not hear it and who were not exposed to a preexisting sign language because there was none available in their community. Remarkably these individuals treat symmetry in both semantic and syntactic regards much as do learners exposed to a previously established language. These findings point to deep human biases in the structures underpinning and constituting human language." The emergence of the formal category "symmetry" in a new sign language.
