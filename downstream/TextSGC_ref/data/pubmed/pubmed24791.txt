"Movement covariates such as electromyographic or kinematic activity have been proposed as candidates for the neural representation of hand control. However it remains unclear how these movement covariates are reflected in electroencephalographic EEG activity during different stages of grasping movements. In this exploratory study we simultaneously acquired EEG kinematic and electromyographic recordings of human subjects performing 33 types of grasps yielding the largest such dataset to date. We observed that EEG activity reflected different movement covariates in different stages of grasping. During the pre-shaping stage centro-parietal EEG in the lower beta frequency band reflected the objects shape and size whereas during the finalization and holding stages contralateral parietal EEG in the mu frequency band reflected muscle activity. These findings contribute to the understanding of the temporal organization of neural grasping patterns and could inform the design of noninvasive neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces with more natural control."
