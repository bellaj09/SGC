"Multisensory perception research has largely focused on exteroceptive signals but recent evidence has revealed the integration of interoceptive signals with exteroceptive information. Such research revealed that heartbeat signals affect sensory e.g. visual processing: however it is unknown how they impact the perception of body images. Here we linked our participants heartbeat to visual stimuli and investigated the spatio-temporal brain dynamics of cardio-visual stimulation on the processing of human body images. We recorded visual evoked potentials with 64-channel electroencephalography while showing a body or a scrambled-body control that appeared at the frequency of the on-line recorded participants heartbeat or not not-synchronous control. Extending earlier studies we found a body-independent effect with cardiac signals enhancing visual processing during two time periods 77-130\xa0ms and 145-246\xa0ms. Within the second later time-window we detected a second effect characterised by enhanced activity in parietal temporo-occipital inferior frontal and right basal ganglia-insula regions but only when non-scrambled body images were flashed synchronously with the heartbeat 208-224\xa0ms. In conclusion our results highlight the role of interoceptive information for the visual processing of human body pictures within a network integrating cardio-visual signals of relevance for perceptual and cognitive aspects of visual body processing."
