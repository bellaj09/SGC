The field of pulmonary medicine has experienced a rapid growth in innovative new technologies aimed at both diagnosis and treatment of airway mediastinal and parenchymal disorders. Endobronchial ultrasound EBUS has emerged as an extremely useful tool in real-time guidance of transbronchial needle aspiration TBNA of mediastinal and hilar structures. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer as well as the diagnosis of benign causes of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. This has increased the demand for EBUS among general pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons and is presenting a challenge in establishing teaching venues and training guidelines to gain competence in EBUS. Training for endobronchial ultrasound: methods for proper training in new bronchoscopic techniques.
