Leukemia is a fatal cancer and has two main types: Acute and chronic. Each type has two more subtypes: Lymphoid and myeloid. Hence in total there are four subtypes of leukemia. This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks CNN which requires a large training data set. Therefore we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes support vector machine k-nearest neighbor and decision tree. To evaluate our approach we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy in leukemia versus healthy and multiclass classification of all subtypes respectively. Finally we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other wellknown machine learning algorithms.
