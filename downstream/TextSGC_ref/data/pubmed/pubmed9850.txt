"For Parkinsons disease PD efficient and fast monitoring of fine motor function is fundamental for capturing transient phenomena induced by deep brain stimulation DBS thus enabling a fast and accurate tuning of stimulation parameters. Tuning of DBS parameters is important for obtaining a patient-specific optimal clinical effect and to regularly compensate for disease progress. We propose a fine motor function assessment framework for capturing transient DBS-induced changes. The main goals are to obtain a fast repeatable objective robust and DBS-sensitive motor-score in addition to a high-dimensional characterization of motor components by means of an interpretable data-driven model. To achieve this we combine a hand motor-task termed the copy-draw test with a linear model for analyzing features extracted from the proposed task. The approach was tested with four patients totaling eight sessions analyzed. Our approach delivers a motor-score that is sensitive to DBS-induced changes in motor function. It can be applied repeatedly within seconds. The interpretability of the underlying machine learning model provides a direct overview of the feature relevance. This analysis allows to detect and characterize single movement components that are sensitive to DBS. The proposed assessment framework is an useful tool to push forward the data-driven identification of PD-relevant neural markers. Consequent to this end the source code of the paradigm is made publicly available."
