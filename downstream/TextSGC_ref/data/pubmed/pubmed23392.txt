"The aim of this study is to develop and assess the peg transfer training module face content and construct validation use of the box virtual reality VR cognitive virtual reality CVR augmented reality AR and mixed reality MR trainer thereby to compare advantages and disadvantages of these simulators. Training system VatsSim-XR design includes customized haptic-enabled thoracoscopic instruments virtual reality helmet set endoscope kit with navigation and the patient-specific corresponding training environment. A cohort of 32 trainees comprising 24 novices and 8 experts underwent the real and virtual simulators that were conducted in the department of thoracic surgery of Yunnan First Peoples Hospital. Both subjective and objective evaluations have been developed to explore the visual and haptic potential promotions in peg transfer education. Experiments and evaluation results conducted by both professional and novice thoracic surgeons show that the surgery skills from experts are better than novices overall AR trainer is able to provide a more balanced training environments on visuohaptic fidelity and accuracy box trainer and MR trainer demonstrated the best realism 3D perception and surgical immersive performance respectively and CVR trainer shows a better clinic effect that the traditional VR trainer. Combining these in a systematic approach tuned with specific fidelity requirements medical simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment."
