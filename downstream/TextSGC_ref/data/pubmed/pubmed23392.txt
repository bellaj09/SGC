"Because of dispersion in head-related transfer functions HRTFs the interaural time difference ITD varies with frequency. This physical effect ought to have consequences for the size or shape of the auditory image of broadband noise because different frequency regions of the noise have different ITDs. However virtual reality experiments suggest that human listeners are insensitive to head-related dispersion. The experiments of this article test that suggestion by experiments that isolate dispersion from amplitude effects in the HRTF and attempt to optimize the opportunity for detecting it. Nevertheless the experiments find that the only effect of dispersion is to shift the lateralization of the auditory image. This negative result is explained in terms of the cross-correlation function for head-dispersed noise. Although the broad-band cross-correlation function differs considerably from 1.0 the cross-correlation functions within bands characteristic of auditory filters do not. A detailed study of the lateralization shifts show that the experimental shifts can be successfully calculated as an average of stimulus ITDs as weighted by Raatgevers frequency-weighting function Thesis Delft The Netherlands 1980."
