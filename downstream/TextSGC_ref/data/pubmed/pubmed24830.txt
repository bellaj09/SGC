This study investigates the informational based that supports intentional adaptation of locomotion to spatial environmental constraints. A virtual reality setup was used to present subjects with targets providing normal as well as abnormal optical expansion during locomotor pointing i.e. positioning of a foot on a visible target on the floor during walking. The manipulation dissociated two variables providing temporal information about time-to-passage TTP: TTPbeta alpha which encompasses target expansion and TTPalpha which is independent of target expansion. While a previous study showed TTPalpha to be sufficient the present results reveal that TTPbeta alpha may be used when it is available. This finding indicates that both variables play a role that varies according to the circumstances. Furthermore the present results provide evidence of the operation of a security principle for action in conflicting situations. Spatially constrained locomotion under informational conflict.
