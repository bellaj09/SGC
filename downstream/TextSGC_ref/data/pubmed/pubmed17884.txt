"Background: Cue Exposure Therapy CET has shown efficacy for treating alcohol use disorders AUDs. Exposure therapy is highly effective for treating anxiety. Both techniques involve repeated controlled exposures to alcohol or fear-related stimuli. Objectives: We considered the mechanisms of CET for AUDs by comparing it to exposure therapy for anxiety. Method: We conducted a narrative review contrasting theoretical literature examining the mechanisms of CET versus exposure therapy for anxiety. We reviewed RCTs and acute laboratory paradigms examining CET for AUDs. We considered common areas of emerging research including the use of d-Cycloserine DCS and virtual reality VR. Results: We found evidence that exposure therapy and CET at least partially achieve their effects through extinction learning. We found evidence that CET for AUDs is effective with comparable benefits to other effective psychosocial treatments. DCS and VR have shown some limited success for augmenting CET for AUDs so further research is needed to determine their value. Conclusions: There are theoretical and practical similarities between exposure to fear cues and cues of addiction especially regarding extinction learning. However these processes are also unique particularly regarding the differing motivational properties of fear versus reward-related stimuli. We propose that unlike exposure for anxiety CET takes effect by increasing self-control with each unreinforced exposure. We consider reasons for CETs limited use for AUDs including its lower acceptability to clients and clinicians. We also note the limited evidence for CET for other substance use disorders highlighting the need for continued investigation into its mechanisms and efficacy."
