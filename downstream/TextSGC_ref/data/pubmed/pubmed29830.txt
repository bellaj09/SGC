Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs are developed to translate brain waves into machine instructions for external devices control. Recently hybrid BCI systems are proposed for the multi-degree control of a real wheelchair to improve the systematical efficiency of traditional BCIs. However it is difficult for existing hybrid BCIs to implement the multi-dimensional control in one command cycle. A hybrid brain computer interface system based on the neurophysiological protocol and brain-actuated switch for wheelchair control.
