"In this article we address the problem of the classification of the health state of the colons wall of mice possibly injured by cancer with machine learning approaches. This problem is essential for translational research on cancer and is a priori challenging since the amount of data is usually limited in all preclinical studies for practical and ethical reasons. Three states considered including cancer health and inflammatory on tissues. Fully automated machine learning-based methods are proposed including deep learning transfer learning and shallow learning with SVM. These methods addressed different training strategies corresponding to clinical questions such as the automatic clinical state prediction on unseen data using a pre-trained model or in an alternative setting real-time estimation of the clinical state of individual tissue samples during the examination. Experimental results show the best performance of 99.93% correct recognition rate obtained for the second strategy as well as the performance of 98.49% which were achieved for the more difficult first case."
