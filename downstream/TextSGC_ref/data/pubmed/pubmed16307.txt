UK medical students spend 25% of their curricular time on elective "Student Selected Components" SSCs. We report one in homeopathic medicine run jointly by the University of Bristol and the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. The SSC was an intensive four week course using a variety of learning methods grounded in the Faculty of Homeopathy\s Primary Health Care Examination PHCE Certificate syllabus. Students were exposed to specialist clinics and the prescribing methods used in them. They received tuition from a veterinarian a psychiatrist a medical historian a professional homeopath and an expert in the evidence base of complementary medicine. Educational methods included interactive lectures out-patient clinics recorded video cases live cases via video link a "dream proving" and a reflective diary. At the end of the course students sat and passed the Faculty\s PHC examination. Assessment also included an in-depth case report in which most students revealed understanding of the course. Though students were uncertain about the nature of the healing stimulus many were affected by the healing responses they witnessed and the intellectual challenge of remedy selection. Some professed interest in further training and all wished to see the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital BHH develop as a centre for holistic care. For some the experience was "transformative learning". We conclude that this approach to a foundation training in homeopathy is feasible and effective. "In at the deep end": an intensive foundation training in homeopathy for medical students.
