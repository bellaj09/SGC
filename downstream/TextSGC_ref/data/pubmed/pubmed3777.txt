"Functional connectivity FC obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI brings insights into the functional organization of the brain. Recently rich and complex behaviour of brain has been revealed by the dynamic fluctuation of FC which had previously been regarded as confounding noise. While the dynamics of long-distance inter-regional FC has been extensively studied the dynamics of local FC within a few millimetres in space remains largely unexplored. In this study the local FC was depicted by regional homogeneity ReHo and the dynamics of local FC was obtained using sliding windows method. We observed a robust positive correlation between ReHo and its temporal variability which was shown to be an intrinsic feature of the brain rather than a pure stochastic effect. Furthermore fluctuation of ReHo was associated with global functional organization: i brain regions with higher centrality of inter-regional FC tended to possess higher ReHo variability; ii coherence of ReHo fluctuation was higher within brains functional modules. Finally we observed alteration of ReHo variability during a motor task compared with resting-state. Our findings associated the temporal fluctuation of ReHo with brain function opening up the possibility of dynamic local FC study in the future."
