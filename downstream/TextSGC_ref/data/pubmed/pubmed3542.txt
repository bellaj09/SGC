The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the organization of the brain connectome and cerebrovascular reactivity CVR in persons with white matter hyperintensities. Diffusion tensor and CVR mapping 3T MRI scans were acquired in 31 participants with white matter hyperintensities. In each participant the connectome was assessed by reconstructing all white matter tracts with tractography and segmenting the whole brain into multiple regions. Graph theory analysis was performed to quantify how effectively tracts connected brain regions by measuring the global and local efficiency of the connectome. CVR in white matter and gray matter was correlated with the global and local efficiency of the connectome while adjusting for age gender and gray matter volume. For comparison white matter hyperintensity volume was also correlated with global and local efficiency. White matter CVR was positively correlated with the global efficiency coefficient: 23.3 p = .005 and local efficiency coefficient: 2850 p = .004 of the connectome. Gray matter CVR was positively correlated with the global efficiency coefficient: 21.3 p\u2009<\u2009.001 and local efficiency coefficient: 2670 p\u2009<\u2009.001 of the connectome. White matter hyperintensity volume was negatively correlated with global efficiency coefficient: -0.0002 p = .003 and local efficiency coefficient: -0.024 p = .003 of the connectome. The association between CVR and the brain connectome suggests that impaired cerebrovascular function may be part of the pathophysiology of the disruption of the brain connectome in persons with white matter hyperintensities. The efficiency of the brain connectome is associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in persons with white matter hyperintensities.
