This article describes a new method of providing feedback during a brain-computer interface movement task using a non-invasive high-resolution electrotactile vision substitution system. We compared the accuracy and movement times during a center-out cursor movement task and found that the task performance with tactile feedback was comparable to visual feedback for 11 participants. These subjects were able to modulate the chosen BCI EEG features during both feedback modalities indicating that the type of feedback chosen does not matter provided that the task information is clearly conveyed through the chosen medium. In addition we tested a blind subject with the tactile feedback system and found that the training time accuracy and movement times were indistinguishable from results obtained from subjects using visual feedback. We believe that BCI systems with alternative feedback pathways should be explored allowing individuals with severe motor disabilities and accompanying reduced visual and sensory capabilities to effectively use a BCI.
