In recent years health risks concerning high-dose x-ray radiation have become a major concern in dental computed tomography CT examinations. Therefore adopting low-dose computed tomography LDCT technology has become a major focus in the CT imaging field. One of these LDCT technologies is downsampling data acquisition during low-dose x-ray imaging processes. However reducing the radiation dose can adversely affect CT image quality by introducing noise and artifacts in the resultant image that can compromise diagnostic information. In this paper we propose an artifact correction method for downsampling CT reconstruction based on deep learning. Artifact correction in low-dose dental CT imaging using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks.
