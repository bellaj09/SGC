Recent results have shown the possibility of both reconstructing connectomes of small but biologically interesting circuits and extracting from these connectomes insights into their function. However these reconstructions were heroic proof-of-concept experiments requiring person-months of effort per neuron reconstructed and will not scale to larger circuits much less the brains of entire animals. In this paper we examine what will be required to generate and use substantially larger connectomes finding five areas that need increased attention: firstly imaging better suited to automatic reconstruction with excellent z-resolution; secondly automatic detection validation and measurement of synapses; thirdly reconstruction methods that keep and use uncertainty metrics for every object from initial images through segmentation reconstruction and connectome queries; fourthly processes that are fully incremental so that the connectome may be used before it is fully complete; and finally better tools for analysis of connectomes once they are obtained. Toward large-scale connectome reconstructions.
