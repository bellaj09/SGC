Virtual reality VR has been widely studied and applied in numerous medical applications.1 In pharmacy VR can potentially be applied as follows: adjunctively or as a replacement for pharmacotherapy; in drug design and discovery; in pharmacist education; and in patient counseling and behavior modification.1-6 Research applying VR in pharmacy is currently limited; however interest in these applications is increasing. The majority of studies conducted during the past decade have found VR to be safe and effective and to promote a high degree of user satisfaction.4 VR technology has become increasingly affordable flexible and portable enabling its use for therapeutic purposes in both inpatient and outpatient environments.4 But despite the compelling features of VR a number of challenges exist such as validation of clinical efficacy cost/accessibility and usability issues technical capabilities and acceptance.1-5 This article discusses the potential for the use of VR in pharmacy for clinical research and educational applications.
