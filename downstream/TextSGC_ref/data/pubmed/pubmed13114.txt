Brain tumor is one of the dangerous and deadly cancer types seen in adults and children. Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumor is important for the treatment process. It is an important step for specialists to detect the brain tumor using computer aided systems. These systems allow specialists to perform tumor detection more easily. However mistakes made with traditional methods are also prevented. In this paper it is aimed to diagnose the brain tumor using MRI images. CNN models one of the deep learning networks are used for the diagnosis process. Resnet50 architecture one of the CNN models is used as the base. The last 5 layers of the Resnet50 model have been removed and added 8 new layers. With this model 97.2% accuracy value is obtained. Also results are obtained with Alexnet Resnet50 Densenet201 InceptionV3 and Googlenet models. Of all these models the model developed with the highest performance has classified the brain tumor images. As a result when analyzed in other studies in the literature it is concluded that the developed method is effective and can be used in computer-aided systems to detect brain tumor. Detection of tumors on brain MRI images using the hybrid convolutional neural network architecture.
