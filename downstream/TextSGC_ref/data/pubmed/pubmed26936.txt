"Robotic devices show promise in restoring motor abilities to individuals with upper limb paresis or amputations. However these systems are still limited in obtaining reliable signals from the human body to effectively control them. We propose that these robotic devices can be controlled through scalp electroencephalography EEG a neuroimaging technique that can capture motor commands through brain rhythms. In this work we studied if EEG can be used to predict an individuals grip forces produced by the hand." Regression-based reconstruction of human grip force trajectories with noninvasive scalp electroencephalography.
