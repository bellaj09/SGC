The extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated allocentric spatial recall using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage SHD a group of patients with "moderate" hippocampal damage MHD and a normal control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback participants learned the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames. During a subsequent test phase recall of all four objects was tested with only the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in both phases of this task. Across groups performance on both types of spatial recall was highly correlated with memory quotient MQ but not with intelligence quotient IQ age or sex. However both measures of spatial recall separated experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ a widely used measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes but not to volumes of the thalamus putamen pallidum nucleus accumbens or caudate nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD that both types of recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ and that recall deficits are best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes.
