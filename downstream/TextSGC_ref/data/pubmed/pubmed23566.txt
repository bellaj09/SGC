"Recent advances in neuroprosthetics have enabled those living with extremity loss to reproduce many functions native to the absent extremity and this is often accomplished through integration with the peripheral nervous system. Unfortunately methods currently employed are often associated with significant tissue damage which prevents prolonged use. Additionally these devices often lack any meaningful degree of sensory feedback as their complex construction dampens any vibrations or other sensations a user may have previously depended on when using more simple prosthetics. The composite regenerative peripheral nerve interface C-RPNI was developed as a stable biologic construct with the ability to amplify efferent motor nerve signals while providing simultaneous afferent sensory feedback. The C-RPNI consists of a segment of free dermal and muscle graft secured around a target mixed sensorimotor nerve with preferential motor nerve reinnervation of the muscle graft and sensory nerve reinnervation of the dermal graft. In rats this construct has demonstrated the generation of compound muscle action potentials CMAPs amplifying the target nerves signal from the micro- to milli-volt level with signal to noise ratios averaging approximately 30-50. Stimulation of the dermal component of the construct generates compound sensory nerve action potentials CSNAPs at the proximal nerve. As such this construct has promising future utility towards the realization of the ideal intuitive prosthetic."
