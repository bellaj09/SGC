A large number of newly sequenced proteins are generated by the next-generation sequencing technologies and the biochemical function assignment of the proteins is an important task. However biological experiments are too expensive to characterize such a large number of protein sequences thus protein function prediction is primarily done by computational modeling methods such as profile Hidden Markov Model pHMM and k-mer based methods. Nevertheless existing methods have some limitations; k-mer based methods are not accurate enough to assign protein functions and pHMM is not fast enough to handle large number of protein sequences from numerous genome projects. Therefore a more accurate and faster protein function prediction method is needed. DeepFam: deep learning based alignment-free method for protein family modeling and prediction.
