Copy number variants CNV are associated with phenotypic variation in several species. However properly detecting changes in copy numbers of sequences remains a difficult problem especially in lower quality or lower coverage next-generation sequencing data. Here inspired by recent applications of machine learning in genomics we describe a method to detect duplications and deletions in short-read sequencing data. In low coverage data machine learning appears to be more powerful in the detection of CNVs than the gold-standard methods of coverage estimation alone and of equal power in high coverage data. We also demonstrate how replicating training sets allows a more precise detection of CNVs even identifying novel CNVs in two genomes previously surveyed thoroughly for CNVs using long read data.
