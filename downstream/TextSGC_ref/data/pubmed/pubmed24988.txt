Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs have been extensively utilized to develop brain-computer interfaces BCIs due to the advantages of robustness large number of commands high classification accuracies and information transfer rates ITRs. However the use of several simultaneous flickering stimuli often causes high levels of user discomfort tiredness annoyingness and fatigue. Here we propose to design a stimuli-responsive hybrid speller by using electroencephalography EEG and video-based eye-tracking to increase user comfortability levels when presented with large numbers of simultaneously flickering stimuli. Interestingly a canonical correlation analysis CCA-based framework was useful to identify target frequency with a 1 s duration of flickering signal. Our proposed BCI-speller uses only six frequencies to classify forty-eight targets thus achieve greatly increased ITR whereas basic SSVEP BCI-spellers use an equal number of frequencies to the number of targets. Using this speller we obtained an average classification accuracy of 90.35  3.597% with an average ITR of 184.06  12.761 bits per minute in a cued-spelling task and an ITR of 190.73  17.849 bits per minute in a free-spelling task. Consequently our proposed speller is superior to the other spellers in terms of targets classified classification accuracy and ITR while producing less fatigue annoyingness tiredness and discomfort. Together our proposed hybrid eye tracking and SSVEP BCI-based system will ultimately enable a truly high-speed communication channel.
