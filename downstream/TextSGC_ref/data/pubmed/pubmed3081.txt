The posterior medial cortex PMC is particularly poorly understood. Its neural activity changes have been related to highly disparate mental processes. We therefore investigated PMC properties with a data-driven exploratory approach. First we subdivided the PMC by whole-brain coactivation profiles. Second functional connectivity of the ensuing PMC regions was compared by task-constrained meta-analytic coactivation mapping MACM and task-unconstrained resting-state correlations RSFC. Third PMC regions were functionally described by forward/reverse functional inference. A precuneal cluster was mostly connected to the intraparietal sulcus frontal eye fields and right temporo-parietal junction; associated with attention and motor tasks. A ventral posterior cingulate cortex PCC cluster was mostly connected to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and middle left inferior parietal cortex IPC; associated with facial appraisal and language tasks. A dorsal PCC cluster was mostly connected to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex anterior/posterior IPC posterior midcingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; associated with delay discounting. A cluster in the retrosplenial cortex was mostly connected to the anterior thalamus and hippocampus. Furthermore all PMC clusters were congruently coupled with the default mode network according to task-unconstrained but not task-constrained connectivity. We thus identified distinct regions in the PMC and characterized their neural networks and functional implications. Subspecialization in the human posterior medial cortex.
