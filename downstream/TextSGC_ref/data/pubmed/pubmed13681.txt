"Transilluminated powered phlebectomy TIPP is a promising alternative to traditional ambulatory phlebectomy procedures. This retrospective review of 339 patients represents the senior authors first consecutive series of 400 cases performed using TIPP for the treatment of varicose veins in a 6-year period. Patients were followed for 12 weeks postoperatively. Data analyzed included operative time intraoperative complications stab incision ranges postoperative complications and patient satisfaction. The mean operative time was 19.7 minutes and 246 61.5% cases involved 10 to 20 incisions. Postoperative complications included an episode of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis in one 0.3% patient excessive or hypertrophic scarring in two 0.6% patients discoloration of the lower extremity skin due to hemosiderin staining in eight 2.3% patients and cellulitis in one 0.3% patient. No recurrences were observed at a follow-up of 12 weeks. Three hundred thirty-eight 99.7% patients reported good outcomes and were satisfied with the procedure. This review by an individual surgeon is beneficial in analyzing the outcomes and complications associated with TIPP as a standard protocol was followed and an adequate volume was performed to advance past the learning curve associated with the technique. When concomitant saphenous vein incompetence is present staged treatment of varicosities with TIPP after endovenous laser ablation is recommended. With proper training and experience utilization of TIPP with a lower oscillation frequency and secondary tumescence results in good outcome and high patient satisfaction."
