"Redirected Walking RDW steering algorithms have traditionally relied on human-engineered logic. However recent advances in reinforcement learning RL have produced systems that surpass human performance on a variety of control tasks. This paper investigates the potential of using RL to develop a novel reactive steering algorithm for RDW. Our approach uses RL to train a deep neural network that directly prescribes the rotation translation and curvature gains to transform a virtual environment given a users position and orientation in the tracked space. We compare our learned algorithm to steer-to-center using simulated and real paths. We found that our algorithm outperforms steer-to-center on simulated paths and found no significant difference on distance traveled on real paths. We demonstrate that when modeled as a continuous control problem RDW is a suitable domain for RL and moving forward our general framework provides a promising path towards an optimal RDW steering algorithm."
