Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI constitute an alternative channel of communication between humans and environment. There are a number of different technologies which enable the recording of brain activity. One of these is electroencephalography EEG. The most common EEG methods include interfaces whose operation is based on changes in the activity of Sensorimotor Rhythms SMR during imagery movement so-called Motor Imagery BCI MIBCI.The present article is a review of 131 articles published from 1997 to 2017 discussing various procedures of data processing in MIBCI. The experiments described in these publications have been compared in terms of the methods used for data registration and analysis. Some of the studies 76 reports were subjected to meta-analysis which showed corrected average classification accuracy achieved in these studies at the level of 51.96% a high degree of heterogeneity of results Q = 1806577.61; df = 486; p < 0.001; I 2 = 99.97% as well as significant effects of number of channels number of mental images and method of spatial filtering. On the other hand the meta-regression failed to provide evidence that there was an increase in the effectiveness of the solutions proposed in the articles published in recent years. The authors have proposed a newly developed standard for presenting results acquired during MIBCI experiments which is designed to facilitate communication and comparison of essential information regarding the effects observed. Also based on the findings of descriptive analysis and meta-analysis the authors formulated recommendations regarding practices applied in research on signal processing in MIBCIs.
