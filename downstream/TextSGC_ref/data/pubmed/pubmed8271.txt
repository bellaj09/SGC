As a physiological signal EEG data cannot be subjectively changed or hidden. Compared with other physiological signals EEG signals are directly related to human cortical activities with excellent temporal resolution. After the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence the analysis and calculation of EEGs has made great progress leading to a significant boost in performances for content understanding and pattern recognition of brain activities across the areas of both neural science and computer vision. While such an enormous advance has attracted wide range of interests among relevant research communities EEG-based classification of brain activities evoked by images still demands efforts for further improvement with respect to its accuracy generalization and interpretation yet some characters of human brains have been relatively unexplored.
