Applying machine learning ML methods on electronic health records EHRs that accurately predict the occurrence of a variety of diseases or complications related to medications can contribute to improve healthcare quality. EHRs by nature contain multiple modalities of clinical data from heterogeneous sources that require proper fusion strategy. The deep neural network DNN approach which possesses the ability to learn classification and feature representation is well-suited to be employed in this context. In this study we collect a large in-hospital EHR database to develop analytics in predicting 1-year gastrointestinal GI bleeding hospitalizations for patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. A total of 815499 records 16757 unique patients are used in this study with three different available EHR modalities disease diagnoses medications usage and laboratory testing measurements. We compare the performances of 4 deep multimodal fusion models and other ML approaches. NNs result in higher prediction performances compare to random forest RF gradient boosting decision tree GBDT and logistic regression LR approaches. We further demonstrate that deep multimodal NNs with early fusion can obtain the best GI bleeding predictive power area under the receiver operator curve AUROC 0.876 which is significantly better than the HAS-BLED score AUROC 0.668.
