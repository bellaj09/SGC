Identification of virulence factors VFs is critical to the elucidation of bacterial pathogenesis and prevention of related infectious diseases. Current computational methods for VF prediction focus on binary classification or involve only several classes of VFs with sufficient samples. However thousands of VF classes are present in real-world scenarios and many of them only have a very limited number of samples available. Learning transferable deep convolutional neural networks for the classification of bacterial virulence factors.
