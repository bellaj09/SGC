An analysis of current publications on species problem reveals the radical discrepancy between the statements of species reality in nature and different number of these "realities" in light of different species concepts. It has been shown that the only realities are populations and "species" is only logical construct--the notion. A concept of species is a system of interconnected notions where the main element--ontology of species has been always given a priori to the real biodiversity. For that reason every concept of species creates its own "virtual reality". Various concepts of species are not mutually comparable and can not be criticized from each other\s views and from position of "reality". Biological and Phylogenetic Species Concepts competing in ornithology exclude each other completely and the unified concept of species is principally impossible. But as generally accepted species "standard" is needed the unified convention of species must take the place of the various concepts of species. Is a unified concept of species in ornithology possible? An opinion of a practicing taxonomist.
