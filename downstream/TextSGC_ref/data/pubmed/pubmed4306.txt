Studies that investigated neurobiological parameters subtended to impulsivity trait found their relationship with structural and functional brain alterations. No studies investigated the white matter microstructural attributes of impulsivity in a large sample of healthy subjects. In the present study 1007 subjects from Human Connectome Project public dataset were divided in two groups impulsive and not impulsive basing on Delay Discounting task score. For both groups brain morphometric and microstructural characteristics were investigated. A t-test correct for multiple comparisons was performed for each brain parcel and impulsivity measure. Magnetic resonance diffusion images were pre-processed and selected to perform a voxelwise analysis on the fractional anisotropy FA maps between impulsive and not impulsive groups. Group analysis showed significant differences in morphometric brain data mainly for temporal and frontal lobes. The impulsive group presented higher FA values in four regions: bilateral medial lemniscus and midbrain reticular formation right superior longitudinal fasciculus left forceps major right corticospinal tract. Not impulsive group showed higher FA values in two significant regions: right and left anterior thalamus radiation. Concluding macroscopic and microstructural brain alterations were assessed identifying new neuroanatomical substrates for multidimensional impulsivity construct in a large sample of healthy subjects.
