"Radical changes in medical research and education have recently led to a number of innovative developments in terms of how human anatomy is represented and understood. New ways of introducing medical students to anatomy including living anatomies and virtual simulations have provoked widespread debate with discussion of their relative merits compared to more traditional approaches that use cadaveric dissection. Outside the field of medicine in the wider public sphere the practice of anatomical study may often seem mysterious. The dissemination of news on anatomy we contend is central to the question of how medical researchers and educators engage with the public. Our analysis of news media coverage in the UK demonstrates that news-making by giving prominence to certain facts themes and images serves to mask issues about anatomy and its practices that need debate. We examine the ways in which news media through processes of selection and the framing of issues may perform an agenda-setting role. We draw attention to the use of positive awe and amazement frames including miracles of modern science medical heroes and gifts of life alongside more negative guts and gore coverage including Frankenstein Brave New World and Rape of the Body frames that concentrate on high profile scandals associated with the use and misuse of human bodies tissues and parts. We also highlight the selective use of commentaries from members of the medical profession which are more prevalent in positive awe and amazement stories than in stories with negative coverage. We conclude by arguing for greater collaboration between journalists on the one hand and medical educators and researchers on the other in the making of news in order to provide portrayals of anatomy which bear a closer relationship to the everyday reality of professional work."
