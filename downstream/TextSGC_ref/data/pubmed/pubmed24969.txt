The electroencephalogram EEG was invented almost 100 years ago and is still a method of choice for many research questions even applications-from functional brain imaging in neuroscientific investigations during movement to real-time applications like brain-computer interfacing. This chapter gives some background information on the establishment and properties of the EEG. This chapter starts with a closer look at the sources of EEG at a micro or neuronal level followed by recording techniques types of electrodes and common EEG artifacts. Then an overview on EEG phenomena namely spontaneous EEG and event-related potentials build the middle part of this chapter. The last part discusses brain signals which are used in current BCI research including short descriptions and examples of applications. Electroencephalography.
