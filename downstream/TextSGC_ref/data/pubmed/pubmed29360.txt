Feature selection plays an important role in the field of EEG signals based motor imagery pattern classification. It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods.
