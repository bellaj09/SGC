Very little medical virtual reality systems which are developed are applied in real surgical scenarios. One reason for this is that the system solutions resulting from research projects often address a single research question and are not embedded in an overall design. This paper presents a DICOM based approach on standardizing data structures i.e. surface meshes which are required for supporting surgical workflows by virtual reality applications. Steps towards open standards for medical virtual reality systems.
