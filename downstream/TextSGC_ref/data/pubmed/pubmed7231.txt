Cardiac left ventricle LV quantification is among the most clinically important tasks for identification and diagnosis of cardiac disease. However it is still a task of great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structure across subjects and the complexity of temporal dynamics of cardiac sequences. Full quantification i.e. to simultaneously quantify all LV indices including two areas cavity and myocardium six regional wall thicknesses RWT three LV dimensions and one phase Diastole or Systole is even more challenging since the ambiguous correlations existing among these indices may impinge upon the convergence and generalization of the learning procedure. In this paper we propose a deep multitask relationship learning network DMTRL for full LV quantification. The proposed DMTRL first obtains expressive and robust cardiac representations with a deep convolution neural network CNN; then models the temporal dynamics of cardiac sequences effectively with two parallel recurrent neural network RNN modules. After that it estimates the three types of LV indices under a Bayesian framework that is capable of learning multitask relationships automatically and estimates the cardiac phase with a softmax classifier. The CNN representation RNN temporal modeling Bayesian multitask relationship learning and softmax classifier establish an effective and integrated network which can be learned in an end-to-end manner. The obtained task covariance matrix captures the correlations existing among these indices therefore leads to accurate estimation of LV indices and cardiac phase. Experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects show that DMTRL achieves high accurate prediction with average mean absolute error of 180\u202fmm2 1.39\u202fmm 2.51\u202fmm for areas RWT dimensions and error rate of 8.2% for the phase classification. This endows our method a great potential in comprehensive clinical assessment of global regional and dynamic cardiac function.
