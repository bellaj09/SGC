"The sense of agency describes the ability to experience oneself as the agent of ones own actions. Previous studies of the sense of agency manipulated the predicted sensory feedback related either to movement execution or to the movements outcome for example by delaying the movement of a virtual hand or the onset of a tone that resulted from a button press. Such temporal sensorimotor discrepancies reduce the sense of agency. It remains unclear whether movement-related feedback is processed differently than outcome-related feedback in terms of agency experience especially if these types of feedback differ with respect to sensory modality. We employed a mixed-reality setup in which participants tracked their finger movements by means of a virtual hand. They performed a single tap which elicited a sound. The temporal contingency between the participants finger movements and i the movement of the virtual hand or ii the expected auditory outcome was systematically varied. In a visual control experiment the tap elicited a visual outcome. For each feedback type and participant changes in the sense of agency were quantified using a forced-choice paradigm and the Method of Constant Stimuli. Participants were more sensitive to delays of outcome than to delays of movement execution. This effect was very similar for visual or auditory outcome delays. Our results indicate different contributions of movement- versus outcome-related sensory feedback to the sense of agency irrespective of the modality of the outcome. We propose that this differential sensitivity reflects the behavioral importance of assessing authorship of the outcome of an action." The Sense of Agency Is More Sensitive to Manipulations of Outcome than Movement-Related Feedback Irrespective of Sensory Modality.
