Here we aimed to identify cortical endophenotypes for anxiety-depression. Our data-driven approach used vertex-wise genetic correlations estimated from a twin sample: 157 monozygotic and 194 dizygotic twin pairs to parcellate cortical thickness CT and surface area SA into genetically homogeneous regions Chen et al. 2013. In an overlapping twin and sibling sample n = 834; aged 15-29 66% female in those with anxiety-depression Somatic and Psychological Health Report SPHERE scores Hickie et al. 2001 above median we found a reduction of SA in an occipito-temporal cluster which comprised part of the right lingual fusiform and parahippocampal gyrii. A similar reduction was observed in the Human Connectome Project HCP sample n = 890 age 22-37 56.5% female in those with Adult Self Report ASR DSM-oriented scores Achenbach et al. 2005 in the 25-95% quantiles. A post hoc vertex-wise analysis identified the right lingual and to a lesser extent the fusiform gyrus. Overall the surface reduction explained by the anxiety-depression scores was modest r = -0.10 3rd order spline and r = -0.040 1st order spline in the HCP. The discordant results in the top 5% of the anxiety-depression scores may be explained by differences in recruitment between the studies. However we could not conclude whether this cortical region was an endophenotype for anxiety-depression as the genetic correlations did not reach significance which we attribute to the modest effect size post hoc statistical power <10%.
