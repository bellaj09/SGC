"An estimated of 2000000 acute ankle sprains occur annually in the United States. Furthermore ankle disabilities are caused by neurological impairments such as traumatic brain injury cerebral palsy and stroke. The virtually interfaced robotic ankle and balance trainer vi-RABT was introduced as a cost-effective platform-based rehabilitation robot to improve overall ankle/balance strength mobility and control. The system is equipped with 2 degrees of freedom 2-DOF controlled actuation along with complete means of angle and torque measurement mechanisms. Vi-RABT was used to assess ankle strength flexibility and motor control in healthy human subjects while playing interactive virtual reality games on the screen. The results suggest that in the task with 2-DOF subjects have better control over ankles position vs. force."
