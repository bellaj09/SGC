The further exploration of the capacitive ECG cECG is hindered by frequent fluctuations in signal quality from body movement and changes in sleep position. The processing framework must be fundamentally adapted to make full use of this signal. Therefore we propose a new signal-processing framework that determines the signal quality for short signal segments 2 and 4 seconds using a multi-class classification model qua_model based on a convolutional neural network CNN. We built another independent deep CNN classifier pos_model to classify the sleep position. In the validation 12 subjects were recruited for a 30-minute experiment which required the subjects to lie on a bed in different sleeping positions. The short segments classified as clear C1 class by the qua_model were used to determine sleep positions with the pos_model. In 10-fold cross-validation the qua_model for signals of 4-second length could recognize the signal of the C1 class at a 0.99 precision and a 0.99 recall; the pos_model could recognize the supine sleep position the left and right lateral sleep positions at a 0.99 averaged precision and a 0.99 averaged recall. Given the amount of data accumulated per night and the instability in the signal quality this fully automatic processing framework is indispensable for a personal healthcare system. Therefore this study could serve as an important step for cECG technique trying to explore the cECG for unconstrained heart monitoring.
