For intravascular OCT IVOCT images we developed an automated atherosclerotic plaque characterization method that used a hybrid learning approach which combined deep-learning convolutional and hand-crafted lumen morphological features. Processing was done on innate A-line units with labels fibrolipidic fibrous tissue followed by lipidous tissue fibrocalcific fibrous tissue followed by calcification or other. We trained/tested on an expansive data set 6556 images and performed an active learning relabeling step to improve noisy ground truth labels. Conditional random field was an important post-processing step to reduce classification errors. Sensitivities/specificities were 84.8%/97.8% and 91.4%/95.7% for fibrolipidic and fibrocalcific plaques respectively. Over lesions en face classification maps showed automated results that agreed favorably to manually labeled counterparts. Adding lumen morphological features gave statistically significant improvement p\u2009<\u20090.05 as compared to classification with convolutional features alone. Automated assessments of clinically relevant plaque attributes arc angle and length compared favorably to those from manual labels. Our hybrid approach gave statistically improved results as compared to previous A-line classification methods using deep learning or hand-crafted features alone. This plaque characterization approach is fully automated robust and promising for live-time treatment planning and research applications.
