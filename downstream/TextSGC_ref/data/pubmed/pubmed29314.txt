Enhanced classification accuracy and a sufficient number of commands are highly demanding in brain computer interfaces BCIs. For a successful BCI early detection of brain commands in time is essential. In this paper we propose a novel classifier using a modified vector phase diagram and the power of electroencephalography EEG signal for early prediction of hemodynamic responses. EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS signals for a motor task thumb tapping were obtained concurrently. Upon the resting state threshold circle in the vector phase diagram that uses the maximum values of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin HbO and HbR during the resting state we introduce a secondary inner threshold circle using the HbO and HbR magnitudes during the time window of 1 s where an EEG activity is noticeable. If the trajectory of HbO and HbR touches the resting state threshold circle after passing through the inner circle this indicates that HbO was increasing and HbR was decreasing i.e. the start of a hemodynamic response. It takes about 0.5 s for an fNIRS signal to cross the resting state threshold circle after crossing the EEG-based circle. Thus an fNIRS-based BCI command can be generated in 1.5 s. We achieved an improved accuracy of 86.0% using the proposed method in comparison with the 63.8% accuracy obtained using linear discriminant analysis in a window of 0~1.5 s. Moreover the active brain locations identified using the proposed scheme were spatially specific when a t-map was made after 10 s of stimulation. These results demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the classification accuracy for a brain-computer interface with a time window of 1.5 s using the proposed method.
