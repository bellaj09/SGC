Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a rapidly rising prevalence currently affecting 1 in 68 children and over 3.5 million people in the United States. Current ASD interventions are primarily based on in-person behavioral therapies that are both costly and difficult to access. These interventions aim to address some of the fundamental deficits that clinically characterize ASD including deficits in social communication and the presence of stereotypies and other autism-related behaviors. Current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches seldom rely on quantitative data measures of symptomatology severity or condition trajectory.
