Children with severe disabilities are sometimes unable to access powered mobility training. Thus we developed the Kinect-Wheelchair Interface Controlled KWIC smart wheelchair trainer that converts a manual wheelchair into a powered wheelchair. The KWIC Trainer uses computer vision to create a virtual tether with adaptive shared-control between the wheelchair and a therapist during training. It also includes a mixed-reality video game system. Design and Evaluation of the Kinect-Wheelchair Interface Controlled KWIC Smart Wheelchair for Pediatric Powered Mobility Training.
