Increasing evidence suggests that the human hippocampus contributes to a range of different behaviors including episodic memory language short-term memory and navigation. A novel theoretical framework the Precision and Binding Model accounts for these phenomenon by describing a role for the hippocampus in high-resolution complex binding. Other theories like Cognitive Map Theory in contrast predict a specific role for the hippocampus in allocentric navigation while Declarative Memory Theory predicts a specific role in delay-dependent conscious memory. Navigation provides a unique venue for testing these predictions with past results from research with humans providing inconsistent findings regarding the role of the human hippocampus in spatial navigation. Here we tested five patients with lesions primarily restricted to the hippocampus and those extending out into the surrounding medial temporal lobe cortex on a virtual water maze task. Consistent with the Precision and Binding Model we found partially intact allocentric memory in all patients with impairments in the spatial precision of their searches for a hidden target. We found similar impairments at both immediate and delayed testing. Our findings are consistent with the Precision and Binding Model of hippocampal function arguing for its role across domains in high-resolution complex binding. Close but no cigar: Spatial precision deficits following medial temporal lobe lesions provide novel insight into theoretical models of navigation and memory.
