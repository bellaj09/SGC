Surgical treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis DIE is complex and preoperative diagnosis benefits both surgeon and patient. Studies in expert centres have reported high accuracy for transvaginal ultrasound TVUS diagnosis of DIE. External validation of these findings has been limited and no information is available on how quickly these skills can be acquired. The aim of this study was to measure the learning curve of DIE-TVUS and to identify the causes for inaccuracies in the diagnosis of bowel lesions and Pouch of Douglas POD obliteration. Can anyone screen for deep infiltrating endometriosis with transvaginal ultrasound?
