Developing complex real world graphics applications which leverage multiple GPUs and computers for interactive 3D rendering tasks is a complex task. It requires expertise in distributed systems and parallel rendering in addition to the application domain itself. We present a mature parallel rendering framework which provides a large set of features algorithms and system integration for a wide range of real-world research and industry applications. Using the Equalizer parallel rendering framework we show how a wide set of generic algorithms can be integrated in the framework to help application scalability and development in many different domains highlighting how concrete applications benefit from the diverse aspects and use cases of Equalizer. We present novel parallel rendering algorithms powerful abstractions for large visualization setups and virtual reality as well as new experimental results for parallel rendering and data distribution.
