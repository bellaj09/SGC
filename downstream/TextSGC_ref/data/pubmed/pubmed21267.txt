"The benefits of physical activity for people with multiple sclerosis pwMS have been recognised. However exercise regimens can be difficult to maintain over the longer term and pwMS may face unique barriers to physical activity engagement. Pilot research suggests the Nintendo Wii can be used safely at home by pwMS with minimal mobility/balance issues and may confer benefits. We have developed a home-based physiotherapist supported Wii intervention Mii-vitaliSe for pwMS that uses commercial software. This is a pilot study to explore the feasibility of conducting a full scale clinical and cost-effectiveness trial of Mii-vitaliSe." Testing the feasibility and acceptability of using the Nintendo Wii in the home to increase activity levels vitality and well-being in people with multiple sclerosis Mii-vitaliSe: protocol for a pilot randomised controlled study.
