Functional integration or connectivity in brain is directional non-linear as well as variable in time-lagged dependence. Deep neural networks DNN have become an indispensable tool everywhere by learning higher levels of abstract and complex patterns from raw data. However in neuroscientific community they generally work as black-boxes leading to the explanation of results difficult and less intuitive. We aim to propose a brain-connectivity measure based on an explainable NN xNN approach. Novel relative relevance score for estimating brain connectivity from fMRI data using an explainable neural network approach.
