Brain-computer interfaces BCIs record neural signals from cortical origin with the objective to control a user interface for communication purposes a robotic artifact or artificial limb as actuator. One of the key components of such a neuroprosthetic system is the neuro-technical interface itself the electrode array. In this chapter different designs and manufacturing techniques will be compared and assessed with respect to scaling and assembling limitations. The overview includes electroencephalogram EEG electrodes and epicortical brain-machine interfaces to record local field potentials LFPs from the surface of the cortex as well as intracortical needle electrodes that are intended to record single-unit activity. Two exemplary complementary technologies for micromachining of polyimide-based arrays and laser manufacturing of silicone rubber are presented and discussed with respect to spatial resolution scaling limitations and system properties. Advanced silicon micromachining technologies have led to highly sophisticated intracortical electrode arrays for fundamental neuroscientific applications. In this chapter major approaches from the USA and Europe will be introduced and compared concerning complexity modularity and reliability. An assessment of the different technological solutions comparable to a strength weaknesses opportunities and threats SWOT analysis might serve as guidance to select the adequate electrode array configuration for each control paradigm and strategy to realize robust fast and reliable BCIs.
