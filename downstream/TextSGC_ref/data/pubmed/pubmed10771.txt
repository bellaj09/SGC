Leukaemia is a disease found worldwide; it is a type of cancer that originates in the bone marrow and is characterised by an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells leukocytes. In order to correctly identify this abnormality haematologists examine blood smears from patients. A diagnosis obtained by this method may be influenced by factors such as the experience and level of fatigue of the haematologist resulting in non-standard reports and even errors. In the literature several methods have been proposed that involve algorithms to diagnose this disease. However no reviews or surveys have been conducted. This paper therefore presents an empirical investigation of computational methods focusing on the segmentation of leukocytes.
