Availability of trained radiologists for fast processing of CXRs in regions burdened with tuberculosis always has been a challenge affecting both timely diagnosis and patient monitoring. The paucity of annotated images of lungs of TB patients hampers attempts to apply data-oriented algorithms for research and clinical practices. The TB Portals Program database TBPP https://TBPortals.niaid.nih.gov is a global collaboration curating a large collection of the most dangerous hard-to-cure drug-resistant tuberculosis DR-TB patient cases. TBPP with 1179 83% DR-TB patient cases is a unique collection that is well positioned as a testing ground for deep learning classifiers. As of January 2019 the TBPP database contains 1538 CXRs of which 346 22.5% are annotated by a radiologist and 104 6.7% by a pulmonologist-leaving 1088 70.7% CXRs without annotations. The Qure.ai qXR artificial intelligence automated CXR interpretation tool was blind-tested on the 346 radiologist-annotated CXRs from the TBPP database. Qure.ai qXR CXR predictions for cavity nodule pleural effusion hilar lymphadenopathy was successfully matching human expert annotations. In addition we tested the 12 Qure.ai classifiers to find whether they correlate with treatment success information provided by treating physicians. Ten descriptors were found as significant: abnormal CXR p = 0.0005 pleural effusion p = 0.048 nodule p = 0.0004 hilar lymphadenopathy p = 0.0038 cavity p = 0.0002 opacity p = 0.0006 atelectasis p = 0.0074 consolidation p = 0.0004 indicator of TB disease p = < .0001 and fibrosis p = < .0001. We conclude that applying fully automated Qure.ai CXR analysis tool is useful for fast accurate uniform large-scale CXR annotation assistance as it performed well even for DR-TB cases that were not used for initial training. Testing artificial intelligence algorithms encapsulating both machine learning and deep learning classifiers on diverse data collections such as TBPP is critically important toward progressing to clinically adopted automatic assistants for medical data analysis.
