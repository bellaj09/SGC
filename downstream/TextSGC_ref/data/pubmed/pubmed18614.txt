The use of virtual reality through exergames or active video game i.e. a new form of interactive gaming as a complementary tool in rehabilitation has been a frequent focus in research and clinical practice in the last few years. However evidence of their effectiveness is scarce in the older population. This review aim to provide a summary of the effects of exergames in improving physical functioning in older adults. A search for randomized controlled trials was performed in the databases EMBASE MEDLINE PsyInfo Cochrane data base PEDro and ISI Web of Knowledge. Results from the included studies were analyzed through a critical review and methodological quality by the PEDro scale. Thirteen studies were included in the review. The most common apparatus for exergames intervention was the Nintendo Wii gaming console 8 studies followed by computers games Dance video game with pad two studies each and only one study with the Balance Rehabilitation Unit. The Timed Up and Go was the most frequently used instrument to assess physical functioning 7 studies. According to the PEDro scale most of the studies presented methodological problems with a high proportion of scores below 5 points 8 studies. The exergames protocols and their duration varied widely and the benefits for physical function in older people remain inconclusive. However a consensus between studies is the positive motivational aspect that the use of exergames provides. Further studies are needed in order to achieve better methodological quality external validity and provide stronger scientific evidence.
