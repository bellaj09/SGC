Major depression MD and obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD are psychiatric diseases with a huge impact on individual well-being. Despite optimal treatment regiments a subgroup of patients remains treatment resistant and stereotactic surgery stereotactic lesion surgery SLS or Deep Brain Stimulation DBS might be an option. Recent research has described four networks related to MD and OCD affect reward cognitive control default network but only on a cortical and the adjacent sub-cortical level. Despite the enormous impact of comparative neuroanatomy animal science and stereotactic approaches a holistic theory of subcortical and cortical network interactions is elusive. Because of the dominant hierarchical rank of the neocortex corticofugal approaches have been used to identify connections in subcortical anatomy without anatomical priors and in part confusing results. We here propose a different corticopetal approach by identifying subcortical networks and search for neocortical convergences thereby following the principle of phylogenetic and ontogenetic network development.
