A novel method to determine the Grade Group GG in prostate cancer PCa using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging mpMRI biomarkers is investigated in this paper. In this method high-level features are extracted from hand-crafted texture features using a deep network of stacked sparse autoencoders SSAE and classified them using a softmax classifier SMC. Transaxial T2 Weighted T2W Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC and high B-Value Diffusion-Weighted BVAL images obtained from PROSTATEx-2 2017 challenge dataset are used in this technique. The method was evaluated on the challenge dataset composed of a training set of 112 lesions and a test set of 70 lesions. It achieved a quadratic-weighted Kappa score of 0.2772 on evaluation using test dataset of the challenge. It also reached a Positive Predictive Value PPV of 80% in predicting PCa with GG\u202f>\u202f1. The method achieved first place in the challenge winning over 43 methods submitted by 21 groups. A 3-fold cross-validation using training data of the challenge was further performed and the method achieved a quadratic-weighted kappa score of 0.2326 and Positive Predictive Value PPV of 80.26% in predicting PCa with GG\u202f>\u202f1. Even though the training dataset is a highly imbalanced one the method was able to achieve a fair kappa score. Being one of the pioneer methods which attempted to classify prostate cancer into 5 grade groups from MRI images it could serve as a base method for further investigations and improvements. Computer-aided classification of prostate cancer grade groups from MRI images using texture features and stacked sparse autoencoder.
