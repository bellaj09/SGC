The neuromodulator acetylcholine ACh shapes neocortical function during sensory perception motor control arousal attention learning and memory. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which ACh affects neocortical pyramidal neurons in adult mice. Stimulation of cholinergic axons activated muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors on pyramidal neurons in all cortical layers and in multiple cortical areas. Nicotinic receptor activation evoked short-latency depolarizing postsynaptic potentials PSPs in many pyramidal neurons. Nicotinic receptor-mediated PSPs promoted spiking of pyramidal neurons. The duration of the increase in spiking was membrane potential dependent with nicotinic receptor activation triggering persistent spiking lasting many seconds in neurons close to threshold. Persistent spiking was blocked by intracellular BAPTA indicating that nicotinic ACh receptor activation evoked persistent spiking via a long-lasting calcium-activated depolarizing current. We compared nicotinic PSPs in primary motor cortex M1 prefrontal cortex PFC and visual cortex. The laminar pattern of nicotinic excitation was not uniform but was broadly similar across areas with stronger modulation in deep than superficial layers. Superimposed on this broad pattern were local differences with nicotinic PSPs being particularly large and common in layer 5 of M1 but not layer 5 of PFC or primary visual cortex V1. Hence in addition to modulating the excitability of pyramidal neurons in all layers via muscarinic receptors synaptically released ACh preferentially increases the activity of deep-layer neocortical pyramidal neurons via nicotinic receptors thereby adding laminar selectivity to the widespread enhancement of excitability mediated by muscarinic ACh receptors. Acetylcholine excites neocortical pyramidal neurons via nicotinic receptors.
