Computer aided detection CADe of pulmonary nodules from computed tomography CT is crucial for early diagnosis of lung cancer. Self-learned features obtained by training datasets via deep learning have facilitated CADe of the nodules. However the complexity of CT lung images renders a challenge of extracting effective features by self-learning only. This condition is exacerbated for limited size of datasets. On the other hand the engineered features have been widely studied. Expert knowledge-infused deep learning for automatic lung nodule detection.
