Accurate identification of coronary plaque is very important for cardiologists when treating patients with advanced atherosclerosis. We developed fully-automated semantic segmentation of plaque in intravascular OCT images. We trained/tested a deep learning model on a folded large manually annotated clinical dataset. The sensitivities/specificities were 87.4%/89.5% and 85.1%/94.2% for pixel-wise classification of lipidous and calcified plaque respectively. Automated clinical lesion metrics potentially useful for treatment planning and research compared favorably <4% with those derived from ground-truth labels. When we converted the results to A-line classification they were significantly better p\u2009<\u20090.05 than those obtained previously by using deep learning classifications of A-lines.
