The purpose of this work is to validate the application of a deep learning-based method for pelvic synthetic CT sCT generation that can be used for prostate proton beam therapy treatment planning. We propose to integrate dense block minimization into 3D cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks cycleGAN framework to effectively learn the nonlinear mapping between MRI and CT pairs. A cohort of 17 patients with co-registered CT and MR pairs were used to test the deep learning-based sCT generation method by leave-one-out cross-validation. Image quality between the sCT and CT images gamma analysis passing rate dose-volume metrics distal range displacement and the individual pencil beam Bragg peak shift between sCT- and CT-based proton plans were evaluated. The average mean absolute error MAE was 51.32\u2009\u2009\u2009\u200916.91 HU. The relative differences of the statistics of the PTV dose-volume histogram DVH metrics in between sCT and CT were generally less than 1%. Mean values of dose difference absolute dose difference in percent of the prescribed dose were\u2009\u2009-0.07%\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20090.07% and 0.23%\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20090.08%. Mean gamma analysis pass rate of 1\u2009mm/1% 2\u2009mm/2% 3\u2009mm/3% criteria with 10% dose threshold were 92.39%\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20095.97% 97.95%\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20092.95% and 98.97%\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20091.62% respectively. The median mean and standard deviation of absolute maximum range differences were 0.09\u2009cm and 0.23\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20090.25\u2009cm. The median and mean Bragg peak shifts among the 17 patients were 0.09\u2009cm and 0.18\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20090.07\u2009cm. The image similarity dosimetric and distal range agreement between sCT and original CT suggests the feasibility of further development of an MRI-only workflow for prostate proton radiotherapy.
