In the standard design of the brain-computer interfaces BCI based on the P300 component of the event-related potentials ERP target and non-target stimuli are presented at fixed positions in a motionless matrix. Can we let this matrix be moving e.g. if attached to a robot without loosing the efficiency of BCI? We assessed changes of the positive peak at Pz in the time interval 300-500 ms after the stimulus onset P300 and the negative peak at the occipital electrodes in the range 140-240 ms N1 both important for the operation of the P300 BCI during fixating a target cell of a moving matrix in healthy participants n=12. N1 amplitude in the difference target-non-target waveforms decreased with the velocity although remained high M=-4.3 SD=2.1 even at highest velocity 20/s. In general the amplitudes and latencies of these ERP components were remarkably stable in studied types of matrix movement and all velocities of horizontal movement 5 10 and 20/s comparing to matrix in fixed position. These data suggest that for the users controlling their gaze the P300 BCI design can be extended to modifications requiring stimuli matrix motion.
