"Alzheimers disease AD patients show altered patterns of functional connectivity FC on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging RSfMRI scans. It is yet unclear which RSfMRI measures are most informative for the individual classification of AD patients. We investigated this using RSfMRI scans from 77 AD patients MMSE\xa0=\xa020.4\xa0\xa04.5 and 173 controls MMSE\xa0=\xa027.5\xa0\xa01.8. We calculated i FC matrices between resting state components as obtained with independent component analysis ICA ii the dynamics of these FC matrices using a sliding window approach iii the graph properties e.g. connection degree and clustering coefficient of the FC matrices and iv we distinguished five FC states and administered how long each subject resided in each of these five states. Furthermore for each voxel we calculated v FC with 10 resting state networks using dual regression vi FC with the hippocampus vii eigenvector centrality and viii the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ALFF. These eight measures were used separately as predictors in an elastic net logistic regression and combined in a group lasso logistic regression model. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve plots AUC to determine classification performance. The AUC values ranged between 0.51 and 0.84 and the highest were found for the FC matrices 0.82 FC dynamics 0.84 and ALFF 0.82. The combination of all measures resulted in an AUC of 0.85. We show that it is possible to obtain moderate to good AD classification using RSfMRI scans. FC matrices FC dynamics and ALFF are most discriminative and the combination of all the resting state measures improves classification accuracy slightly."
