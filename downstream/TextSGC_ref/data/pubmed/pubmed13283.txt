In this paper we present a comprehensive comparison of wavelet features for the classification of snore sounds. Wavelet features have proven to be efficient in our previous work; however the benefits of wavelet transform energy WTE and wavelet packet transform energy WPTE features were not clearly established. In this study we firstly present our updated snore sounds database expanded from 24 patients collected by one medical centre to 40 patients collected by three medical centres. We then study the effects of varying frame sizes and overlaps for extraction of the wavelet low-level descriptors the effect of which have yet to be fully established. We also compare the performance of the WTE and WPTE features when fed into multiple classifiers namely Support Vector Machines SVM K-Nearest Neighbours Linear Discriminant Analysis Random Forests Extreme Learning Machines Kernel Extreme Learning Machines Multilayer Perceptron and Deep Neural Networks. Key results presented indicate that when fed into a SVM WTE outperforms WPTE one-tailed z-test p<;0.002. Further WPTE can achieve a significant improvement when trained by a k-nearest neighbours classifier one-tailed z-test p <; 0.001.
