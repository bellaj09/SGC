Artificial intelligence AI algorithms particularly deep learning have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically in radiology practice trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative rather than qualitative assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article we establish a general understanding of AI methods particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology with a general focus on applications in oncology and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced. Artificial intelligence in radiology.
