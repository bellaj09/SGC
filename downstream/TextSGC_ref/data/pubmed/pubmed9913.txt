Orchestrating cell-cycle-dependent mRNA oscillations is critical to cell proliferation in multicellular organisms. Even though our understanding of cell-cycle-regulated transcription has improved significantly over the last three decades the mechanisms remain untested in\xa0vivo. Unbiased transcriptomic profiling of G0 G1-S and S-G2-M sorted cells from FUCCI mouse embryos suggested a central role for E2Fs in the control of cell-cycle-dependent gene expression. The analysis of gene expression and E2F-tagged knockin mice with tissue imaging and deep-learning tools suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms universally coordinate the nuclear accumulation of E2F activators E2F3A and canonical E2F4 and atypical E2F8 repressors during the cell cycle in\xa0vivo. In summary we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of sentinel E2F activators and canonical and atypical repressors at the single-cell level in\xa0vivo and propose that two distinct E2F modules relay the control of gene expression in cells actively cycling E2F3A-8-4 and exiting the cycle E2F3A-4 during mammalian development. Two Distinct E2F Transcriptional Modules Drive Cell Cycles and Differentiation.
