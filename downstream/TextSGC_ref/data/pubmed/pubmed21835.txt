"This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition EMD and refined generalized zero crossing rGZC approach to achieve frequency recognition in steady-stated visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain computer interfaces BCIs. Six light emitting diode LED flickers with high flickering rates 30 31 32 33 34 and 35 Hz functioned as visual stimulators to induce the subjects SSVEPs. EEG signals recorded in the Oz channel were segmented into data epochs 0.75 s. Each epoch was then decomposed into a series of oscillation components representing fine-to-coarse information of the signal called intrinsic mode functions IMFs. The instantaneous frequencies in each IMF were calculated by refined generalized zero-crossing rGZC. IMFs with mean instantaneous frequencies fGZC within 29.5 Hz and 35.5 Hz i.e. 29.5fGZC35.5 Hz were designated as SSVEP-related IMFs. Due to the time-locked and phase-locked characteristics of SSVEP the induced SSVEPs had the same frequency as the gazing visual stimulator. The LED flicker that contributed the majority of the frequency content in SSVEP-related IMFs was chosen as the gaze target. This study tests the proposed system in five male subjects mean age=25.42.07 y/o. Each subject attempted to activate four virtual commands by inputting a sequence of cursor commands on an LCD screen. The average information transfer rate ITR and accuracy were 36.99 bits/min and 84.63%. This study demonstrates that EMD is capable of extracting SSVEP data in SSVEP-based BCI system."
