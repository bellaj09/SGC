This study proposes a methodology for computationally estimating resistive properties of tissue in multi-scale computational models used for studying the interaction of electromagnetic fields with neural tissue with applications to both dosimetry and neuroprosthetics. Traditionally models at bulk tissue- and cellular-level scales are solved independently linking resulting voltage from existing resistive tissue-scale models as extracellular sources to cellular models. This allows for solving the effects that external electric fields have on cellular activity. There are two major limitations to this approach: first the resistive properties of the tissue need to be chosen of which there are contradicting measurements in literature; second the measurements of resistivity themselves may be inaccurate leading to the mentioned contradicting results found across different studies. Our proposed methodology allows for constructing computed resistivity profiles using knowledge of only the neural morphology within the multi-scale model resulting in a practical implementation of the effective medium theory; this bypasses concerns regarding the choice of resistive properties and accuracy of measurement setups. A multi-scale model of retina is constructed with an external electrode to serve as a test bench for analyzing existing and resulting resistivity profiles and validation is presented through the reconstruction of a published resistivity profile of retina tissue. Results include a computed resistivity profile of retina tissue for use with a retina multi-scale model used to analyze effects of external electric fields on neural activity. On the computation of a retina resistivity profile for applications in multi-scale modeling of electrical stimulation and absorption.
