Background: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ADPKD is increasingly diagnosed during childhood by the presence of renal cysts in patients with a positive familial history. No curative treatment is available and early detection and diagnosis confronts pediatricians with the lack of early markers to decide whether to introduce renal-protective agents and prevent the progression of renal failure. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin NGAL is a tubular protein that has been recently proposed as an early biomarker of renal impairment in the ADPKD adult population. Methods: Urinary NGAL uNGAL levels were measured in 15 ADPKD children and compared with 15 age and gender matched controls using parametric non-parametric and Bayesian statistics. We also tested the association of uNGAL levels with markers of disease progression such as proteinuria albuminuria blood pressure and Total Kidney Volume TKV using correlation analysis. TKV was calculated by ultrasound using the ellipsoid method. Results: No difference in mean uNGAL levels was observed between groups ADPKD: 26.36 ng/ml; Controls: 27.24 ng/ml; P = 0.96. Moreover no correlation was found between uNGAL and proteinuria P = 0.51 albuminuria P = 0.69 TKV P = 0.68 or mean arterial pressure P = 0.90. By contrast TKV was positively correlated with proteinuria P = 0.04 albuminuria P = 0.001 and mean arterial pressure P = 0.03. Conclusion: uNGAL did not confirm its superiority as a marker of disease progression in a pediatric ADPKD population. In the contrary TKV appears to be an easy measurable variable and may be promising as a surrogate marker to follow ADPKD progression in children. Early Urinary Biomarkers in Pediatric Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ADPKD: No Evidence in the Interest of Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin uNGAL.
