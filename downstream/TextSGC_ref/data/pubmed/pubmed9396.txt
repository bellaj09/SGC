Combining reprogrammable optical networks with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS electronics is expected to provide a platform for technological developments in on-chip integrated optoelectronics. We demonstrate how opto-electro-mechanical effects in micrometer-scale hybrid photonic-plasmonic structures enable light switching under CMOS voltages and low optical losses 0.1 decibel. Rapid for example tens of nanoseconds switching is achieved by an electrostatic nanometer-scale perturbation of a thin and thus low-mass gold membrane that forms an air-gap hybrid photonic-plasmonic waveguide. Confinement of the plasmonic portion of the light to the variable-height air gap yields a strong opto-electro-mechanical effect while photonic confinement of the rest of the light minimizes optical losses. The demonstrated hybrid architecture provides a route to develop applications for CMOS-integrated reprogrammable optical systems such as optical neural networks for deep learning.
