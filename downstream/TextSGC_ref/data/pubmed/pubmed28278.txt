"Eye Gaze Tracking Systems EGTSs estimate the Point Of Gaze POG of a user. In diagnostic applications EGTSs are used to study oculomotor characteristics and abnormalities whereas in interactive applications EGTSs are proposed as input devices for human computer interfaces HCI e.g. to move a cursor on the screen when mouse control is not possible such as in the case of assistive devices for people suffering from locked-in syndrome. If the users head remains still and the cornea rotates around its fixed centre the pupil follows the eye in the images captured from one or more cameras whereas the outer corneal reflection generated by an IR light source i.e. glint can be assumed as a fixed reference point. According to the so-called pupil centre corneal reflection method PCCR the POG can be thus estimated from the pupil-glint vector." A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system.
