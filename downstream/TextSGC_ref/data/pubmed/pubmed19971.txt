Around 25000 war veterans in Portugal suffer posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. This clinically controlled study evaluates virtual reality exposure therapy VRET as an alternative procedure to reduce PTSD symptoms. Ten patients were assigned to three groups: VRET exposure in imagination EI and waiting list WL. The patients were Portuguese veterans from a series of wars fought in former African colonies more than 30 years ago. While the EI group participated in traditional imagination therapy the VRET group was exposed to a virtual reality VR war scenario. Cues such as ambush mortar blasting and waiting for rescue were used in the VR. Patients enrolled in the VRET group showed statistical reduction of PTSD-associated disorders like depression and anxiety. Far from being conclusive this pilot study nonetheless presents some promising data on the use of VRET on old war veteran populations. PTSD elderly war veterans: a clinical controlled pilot study.
