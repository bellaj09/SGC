"We conducted a pilot telerehabilitation study with post-stroke patients with arm motor impairment. We compared the degree of satisfaction of patients undergoing a virtual reality VR therapy programme at home Tele-VR group to satisfaction experienced by those undergoing the same VR therapy in a hospital setting VR-group. The rehabilitation equipment used a 3D motion tracking system to create a virtual environment in which the patients movement was represented. In tele-therapy the patient equipment was installed in their homes connected to the hospital by four ISDN lines at a total bandwidth of 512 kbit/s. Rehabilitation data were transmitted via one line and videoconferencing via the other three. Ten patients with mild to intermediate arm motor impairment due to an ischaemic stroke were randomized into VR or Tele-VR groups. A questionnaire was used at the end of treatment to measure each patients degree of satisfaction. Tele-VR treated patients showed median values equal to or higher than the VR group patients in all 12 items investigated except one. In motor performance the Tele-VR group improved significantly P < or = 0.05 while the VR group showed no significant change. Patients assigned to the Tele-VR group were able to engage in therapy at home and the videoconferencing system ensured a good relationship between the patient and the physical therapist whose physical proximity was not required."
