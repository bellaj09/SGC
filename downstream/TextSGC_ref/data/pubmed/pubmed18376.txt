Neurorehabilitation is a fundamental aspect in the treatment approach for multiple sclerosis MS in which new technologies have gained popularity especially the use of virtual reality VR. The aim of this paper is to analyze an occupational therapy OT intervention compared with OT\u2009+\u2009VR OT\u2009+\u2009VR on the manual dexterity of patients with MS. 26 MS subjects were initially recruited from an MS patient association and randomized into two groups. The OT group received 20 conventional OT sessions distributed in two sessions per week. The OT\u2009+\u2009VR group received 20 sessions of VR interventions twice weekly and lasting 30\u2009minutes consisting of VR games accessed via the online web page motiongamingconsole.com in addition to the conventional OT sessions. Pre- and postintervention assessments were based on the Purdue Pegboard Test the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and the Grooved Pegboard Test. Clinical improvements were found regarding the precision of movements the execution times and the efficiency of certain functional tasks in the Purdue Pegboard Test and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test tests in the OT\u2009+\u2009VR group. Although significant differences were not found in the manual dexterity between the OT and OT\u2009+\u2009VR groups improvements were found regarding the precision and effectiveness of certain functional tasks.
