Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs have focused on several areas of which motor substitution has received particular interest. Whereas open-source BCI software is available to facilitate cost-effective collaboration between research groups it mainly focuses on communication and computer control. We developed an open-source and cross-platform framework which works with cost-effective equipment that allows researchers to enter the field of BCI-based motor substitution without major investments upfront. It is based on the C++ programming language and the Qt framework and offers a separate class for custom MATLAB/Simulink scripts. It has been tested using a 14-channel wireless electroencephalography EEG device and a low-cost robotic arm that offers 5 of freedom. The software contains four modules to control the robotic arm one of which receives input from the EEG device. Strengths current limitations and future developments will be discussed.
