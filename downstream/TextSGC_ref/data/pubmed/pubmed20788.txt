Wireless physiological/neurological monitoring in virtual reality VR offers a unique opportunity for unobtrusively quantifying human responses to precisely controlled and readily modulated VR representations of health care environments. Here we present such a wireless light-weight head-mounted system for measuring electrooculogram EOG and electroencephalogram EEG activity in human subjects interacting with and navigating in the Calit2 StarCAVE a five-sided immersive 3-D visualization VR environment. The system can be easily expanded to include other measurements such as cardiac activity and galvanic skin responses. We demonstrate the capacity of the system to track focus of gaze in 3-D and report a novel calibration procedure for estimating eye movements from responses to the presentation of a set of dynamic visual cues in the StarCAVE. We discuss cyber and clinical applications that include a 3-D cursor for visual navigation in VR interactive environments and the monitoring of neurological and ocular dysfunction in vision/attention disorders.
