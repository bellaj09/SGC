Noninvasive and accurate assessment of driving fatigue in relation to brain activity during long-term driving can contribute to traffic safety and accident prevention. This study evaluated functional connectivity FC in relevant brain regions. Synergistic mechanisms in different brain regions were detected by a novel simulator which combined semi-immersive virtual reality technology and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Each subject was instructed to complete driving tasks coupled with a mental calculation task. Wavelet coherence WCO and wavelet phase coherence WPCO were calculated and assessed in frequency intervals I 0.6-2 and II 0.145-0.6Hz as global connectivity measures; III 0.052-0.145 IV 0.021-0.052 V 0.0095-0.021 and VI 0.005-0.0095Hz as FC. WCO and WPCO revealed the strength and synchronization of cerebral connectivity respectively. Significantly low WCO levels were found in intervals I and III in prefrontal cortex PFC and IV in motor cortex MC at the end of the driving task. Furthermore significantly low WPCO were found in intervals I and III in PFC and interval IV in MC. Experimental findings suggested that progressive mental fatigue adversely influences the cognitive function in the PFC and the cooperative mechanism between the PFC and MC.
