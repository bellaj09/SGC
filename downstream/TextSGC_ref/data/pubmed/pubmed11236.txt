Argonaute crosslinking and immunoprecipitation CLIP experiments are the most widely used high-throughput methodologies for miRNA targetome characterization. The analysis of Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced PAR CLIP methodology focuses on sequence clusters containing T-to-C conversions. Here we demonstrate for the first time that the non-T-to-C clusters frequently observed in PAR-CLIP experiments exhibit functional miRNA-binding events and strong RNA accessibility. This discovery is based on the analysis of an extensive compendium of bona fide miRNA-binding events and is further supported by numerous miRNA perturbation experiments and structural sequencing data. The incorporation of these previously neglected clusters yields an average of 14% increase in miRNA-target interactions per PAR-CLIP library. Our findings are integrated in microCLIP  www.microrna.gr/microCLIP  a cutting-edge framework that combines deep learning classifiers under a super learning scheme. The increased performance of microCLIP in CLIP-Seq-guided detection of miRNA interactions uncovers previously elusive regulatory events and miRNA-controlled pathways. microCLIP super learning framework uncovers functional transcriptome-wide miRNA interactions.
