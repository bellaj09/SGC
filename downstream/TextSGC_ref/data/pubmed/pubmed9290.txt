The time difference between coordinated universal time UTC and a hydrogen maser which is a master oscillator for the local realization of UTC at the National Metrology Institute of Japan NMIJ has been predicted by using one of the deep learning techniques called a one-dimensional convolutional neural network 1D-CNN. Regarding the prediction result obtained by the 1D-CNN we have observed improvement in the accuracy of prediction compared with that obtained by the Kalman filter. Although more investigations are required to conclude that the 1D-CNN can work as a good predictor the present results suggest that the computational approach based on the deep learning technique may become a versatile method for improving the synchronous accuracy of UTCNMIJ relative to UTC. Potential for improving the local realization of coordinated universal time with a convolutional neural network.
