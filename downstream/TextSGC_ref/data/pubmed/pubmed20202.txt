Two experiments were designed to study the time course of avoidance learning in spider fearfuls SFs under controlled experimental conditions. To achieve this we employed an immersive virtual environment IVE: While walking freely through a virtual art museum to search for specific paintings the participants were exposed to virtual spiders. Unbeknown to the participants only two of four museum rooms contained spiders allowing for avoidance learning. Indeed the more SF the participants were the faster they learned to avoid the rooms that contained spiders Experiment. 1 and within the first six trials high fearfuls already developed a preference for starting their search task in rooms without spiders Experiment 2. These results illustrate the time course of avoidance learning in SFs and they speak to the usefulness of IVEs in fundamental anxiety research. The time course of location-avoidance learning in fear of spiders.
