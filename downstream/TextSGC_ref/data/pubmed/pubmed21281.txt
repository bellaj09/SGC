An heuristic mesh generation technique is proposed that is based on the model of forced particle motion an edgewise cell-splitting algorithm and a moving tool concept. The method differs from conventional mesh generators in that it uses outward growth of the mesh in contrast to the inward growth used in traditional meshing techniques. The method does not require prior meshing and patching of two-dimensional 2D boundary surfaces. Instead it uses a pre-defined skeleton of one-dimensional segments or an arbitrary tool motion in three-dimensional 3D space. In this respect the technique can be considered as a 3D extension of a 2D drawing tool and can find applications in virtual reality systems. The method also guarantees the smoothness of the outer boundary of the mesh at each step of mesh generation which is not the case with traditional propagating-front methods. The approach is based on the model of tissue growth and is suitable for meshing complex networks of bifurcating branches commonly found in biological structures: blood vessels lungs neural networks plants etc. The generated meshes were used in solving unsteady flow and particle transport problems in lungs.
