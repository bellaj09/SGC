Kinship verification in the wild is an interesting and challenging problem. The goal of kinship verification is to determine whether a pair of faces are blood relatives or not. Most previous methods for kinship verification can be divided as handcrafted features-based shallow learning methods and convolutional neural network CNN-based deep-learning methods. Nevertheless these methods are still facing the challenging task of recognizing kinship cues from facial images. The reason is that the family ID information and the distribution difference of pairwise kin-faces are rarely considered in kinship verification tasks. To this end a family ID-based adversarial convolutional network AdvKin method focused on discriminative Kin features is proposed for both small-scale and large-scale kinship verification in this article. The merits of this article are four-fold: 1 for kin-relation discovery a simple yet effective self-adversarial mechanism based on a negative maximum mean discrepancy NMMD loss is formulated as attacks in the first fully connected layer; 2 a pairwise contrastive loss and family ID-based softmax loss are jointly formulated in the second and third fully connected layer respectively for supervised training; 3 a two-stream network architecture with residual connections is proposed in AdvKin; and 4 for more fine-grained deep kin-feature augmentation an ensemble of patch-wise AdvKin networks is proposed E-AdvKin. Extensive experiments on 4 small-scale benchmark KinFace datasets and 1 large-scale families in the wild FIW dataset from the first Large-Scale Kinship Recognition Data Challenge show the superiority of our proposed AdvKin model over other state-of-the-art approaches.
