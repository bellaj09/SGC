Flexible fibreoptic intubation FOI is a key element in difficult airway management. Training of FOI skills is an important part of the anaesthesiology curriculum. Simulation-based training has been shown to be effective when learning FOI but the optimal structure of the training is debated. The aspect of dividing the training into segments part-task training or assembling into one piece whole-task training has not been studied.
