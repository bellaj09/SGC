"Decision-makers have been shown to rely on probabilistic models for perception and action. However these models can be incorrect or partially wrong in which case the decision-maker has to cope with model uncertainty. Model uncertainty has recently also been shown to be an important determinant of sensorimotor behaviour in humans that can lead to risk-sensitive deviations from Bayes optimal behaviour towards worst-case or best-case outcomes. Here we investigate the effect of model uncertainty on cooperation in sensorimotor interactions similar to the stag-hunt game where players develop models about the other player and decide between a pay-off-dominant cooperative solution and a risk-dominant non-cooperative solution. In simulations we show that players who allow for optimistic deviations from their opponent model are much more likely to converge to cooperative outcomes. We also implemented this agent model in a virtual reality environment and let human subjects play against a virtual player. In this game subjects pay-offs were experienced as forces opposing their movements. During the experiment we manipulated the risk sensitivity of the computer player and observed human responses. We found not only that humans adaptively changed their level of cooperation depending on the risk sensitivity of the computer player but also that their initial play exhibited characteristic risk-sensitive biases. Our results suggest that model uncertainty is an important determinant of cooperation in two-player sensorimotor interactions."
