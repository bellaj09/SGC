Humans like many other species employ three fundamental forms of strategies to navigate: allocentric egocentric and beacon. Here we review each of these different forms of navigation with a particular focus on how our high-resolution visual system contributes to their unique properties. We also consider how we might employ allocentric and egocentric representations in particular across different spatial dimensions such as 1-D vs. 2-D. Our high acuity visual system also leads to important considerations regarding the scale of space we are navigating e.g. smaller room-sized "vista" spaces or larger city-sized "environmental" spaces. We conclude that a hallmark of human spatial navigation is our ability to employ these representations systems in a parallel and flexible manner which differ both as a function of dimension and spatial scale.
