Effective visualization of the operative field is vital to surgical safety and education. However additional metrics for visualization are needed to complement other common measures of surgeon proficiency such as time or errors. Unlike other surgical modalities robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery RAMIS enables data-driven feedback to trainees through measurement of camera adjustments. The purpose of this study was to validate and quantify the importance of novel camera metrics during RAMIS. Viewpoint matters: objective performance metrics for surgeon endoscope control during robot-assisted surgery.
