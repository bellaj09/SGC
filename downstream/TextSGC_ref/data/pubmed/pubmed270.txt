Coronavirus Disease 19 COVID-19 the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 has been declared a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality since first appearing in Wuhan China in late 2019. As many countries are grappling with the onset of their epidemics pharmacotherapeutics remain lacking. The window of opportunity to mitigate downstream morbidity and mortality is narrow but remains open. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system RAAS is crucial to the homeostasis of both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Importantly SARS-CoV-2 utilises and interrupts this pathway directly which could be described as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV-2-axis RAAS-SCoV-axis. There exists significant controversy and confusion surrounding how anti-hypertensive agents might function along this pathway. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the RAAS-SCoV-axis informed by prior studies of SARS-CoV how this relates to our currently evolving pandemic and how these insights might guide our next steps in an evidence-based manner.
