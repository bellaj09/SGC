Identification of nodal metastasis and tumor extranodal extension ENE is crucial for head and neck cancer management but currently only can be diagnosed via postoperative pathology. Pretreatment radiographic identification of ENE in particular has proven extremely difficult for clinicians but would be greatly influential in guiding patient management. Here we show that a deep learning convolutional neural network can be trained to identify nodal metastasis and ENE with excellent performance that surpasses what human clinicians have historically achieved. We trained a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network using a dataset of 2875 CT-segmented lymph node samples with correlating pathology labels cross-validated and fine-tuned on 124 samples and conducted testing on a blinded test set of 131 samples. On the blinded test set the model predicted ENE and nodal metastasis each with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC of 0.91 95%CI: 0.85-0.97. The model has the potential for use as a clinical decision-making tool to help guide head and neck cancer patient management.
