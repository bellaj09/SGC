Automatic segmentation of the prostate on magnetic resonance images MRI has many applications in prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy. We proposed a deep fully convolutional neural network CNN to segment the prostate automatically. Our deep CNN model is trained end-to-end in a single learning stage which uses prostate MRI and the corresponding ground truths as inputs. The learned CNN model can be used to make an inference for pixel-wise segmentation. Experiments were performed on three data sets which contain prostate MRI of 140 patients. The proposed CNN model of prostate segmentation PSNet obtained a mean Dice similarity coefficient of Formula: see text as compared to the manually labeled ground truth. Experimental results show that the proposed model could yield satisfactory segmentation of the prostate on MRI. PSNet: prostate segmentation on MRI based on a convolutional neural network.
