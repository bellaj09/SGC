"Tele-manipulation of heavy loads typically requires the simultaneous use of two asymmetric slaves: a crane for vertical weight support and a robot for accurate lateral positioning. The industrial standard prescribes a pair of operators for such tasks one operator to control each slave although in principle one operator might control both slaves with a single hybrid interface. Accurate and safe co-operative handling of the expensive and fragile heavy components is difficult presumably due to problems in the coordination of the subtasks and the lack of mutual awareness between the two operators. This study proposes a novel haptic assistance system to improve subtask coordination and task performance. Its novelty consists of haptically linking operators/interfaces through the joint task environment. The systems efficacy is evaluated with 15 pairs of co-operators and 15 individual uni-manual operators who maneuvered a heavy load through a bounded path in Virtual Reality. Haptic assistance improves task completion time for both groups. It also reduces control activity and self-reported workload without affecting a number of critical errors made by the operators. Moreover without haptic assistance uni-manual operators perform worse than co-operators but this difference between the interfaces was not found with haptic assistance."
