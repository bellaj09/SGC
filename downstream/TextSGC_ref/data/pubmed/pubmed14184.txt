Photoplethysmography PPG monitoring has been implemented in many portable and wearable devices we use daily for health and fitness tracking. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias fitness and sleep tracking and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation AF-a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. Deep learning approaches for plethysmography signal quality assessment in the presence of atrial fibrillation.
