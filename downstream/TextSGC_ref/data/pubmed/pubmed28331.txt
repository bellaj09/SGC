The learning of a motor task is known to be improved by sleep and sleep spindles are thought to facilitate this learning by enabling synaptic plasticity. In this study subjects implanted with electrocorticography ECoG arrays for long-term epilepsy monitoring were trained to control a cursor on a computer screen by modulating either the high-gamma or mu/beta power at a single electrode located over the motor or premotor area. In all trained subjects spindle density in posttraining sleep was increased with respect to pretraining sleep in a remarkably spatially specific manner. The pattern of increased spindle activity reflects the functionally specific regions that were involved in learning of a highly novel and salient task during wakefulness supporting the idea that sleep spindles are involved in learning to use a motor-based brain-computer interface device. Sleep spindles are locally modulated by training on a brain-computer interface.
