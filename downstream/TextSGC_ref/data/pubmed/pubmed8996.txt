Uncovering drug-target interactions DTIs is pivotal to understand drug mode-of-action MoA avoid adverse drug reaction ADR and seek opportunities for drug repositioning DR. For decades in silico predictions for DTIs have largely depended on structural information of both targets and compounds e.g. docking or ligand-based virtual screening. Recently the application of deep neural network DNN is opening a new path to uncover novel DTIs for thousands of targets. One important question is which features for targets are most relevant to DTI prediction. As an early attempt to answer this question we objectively compared three canonical target features extracted from: i the expression profiles by gene knockdown GEPs; ii the protein-protein interaction network PPI network; and iii the pathway membership PM of a target gene. For drug features the large-scale drug-induced transcriptome dataset or the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures LINCS L1000 dataset was used. All these features are closely related to protein function or drug MoA of which utility is only sparsely investigated. In particular few studies have compared the three types of target features in DNN-based DTI prediction under the same evaluation scheme. Among the three target features the PM and the PPI network show similar performances superior to GEPs. DNN models based on both features consistently outperformed other machine learning methods such as nave Bayes random forest or logistic regression.
