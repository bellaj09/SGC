Severely burned and non-burned trauma patients are at risk for acute kidney injury AKI. The study objective was to assess the theoretical performance of artificial intelligence AI/machine learning ML algorithms to augment AKI recognition using the novel biomarker neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin NGAL combined with contemporary biomarkers such as N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP urine output UOP and plasma creatinine. Machine learning approaches including logistic regression LR k-nearest neighbor k-NN support vector machine SVM random forest RF and deep neural networks DNN were used in this study. The AI/ML algorithm helped predict AKI 61.8 32.5 hours faster than the Kidney Disease and Improving Global Disease Outcomes KDIGO criteria for burn and non-burned trauma patients. NGAL was analytically superior to traditional AKI biomarkers such as creatinine and UOP. With ML the AKI predictive capability of NGAL was further enhanced when combined with NT-proBNP or creatinine. The use of AI/ML could be employed with NGAL to accelerate detection of AKI in at-risk burn and non-burned trauma patients.
