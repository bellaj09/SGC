Three-dimensional 3D relationships between head muscles and cranial nerves innervating them are complicated. Existing sources present these relationships in illustrations radiologic scans or autopsy photographs which are limited for learning and use. Developed electronic atlases are limited in content quality functionality and/or presentation. We create a truly 3D interactive stereotactic and high quality atlas which provides spatial relationships among head muscles glands and cranial nerves and correlates them to surface and sectional neuroanatomy. The head muscles and glands were created from a 3T scan by contouring them and generating 3D models. They were named and structured according to Terminologia anatomica. The muscles were divided into: extra-ocular facial masticatory and other muscles and glands into mouth and other glands. The muscles glands and also head were placed in a stereotactic coordinate system. This content was integrated with cranial nerves and neuroanatomy created earlier. To explore this complex content a scalable user interface was designed with 12 modules including central nervous system cerebrum cerebellum brainstem spinal cord cranial nerves muscles glands arterial system venous system tracts deep gray nuclei ventricles white matter visual system head. Anatomy exploration operations include compositing/decompositing individual/group selection 3D view-index mapping 3D labeling highlighting distance measuring 3D brain cutting and axial/coronal/sagittal triplanar display. To our best knowledge this is the first truly 3D stereotactic interactive fairly complete atlas of head muscles and the first attempt to create a 3D stereotactic atlas of glands. Its use ranges from education of students and patients to research to potential clinical applications. Three-dimensional interactive and stereotactic atlas of head muscles and glands correlated with cranial nerves and surface and sectional neuroanatomy.
