Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs enable users to control a computer by using pure brain activity. Recent BCIs based on visual evoked potentials VEPs have shown to be suitable for high-speed communication. However all recent high-speed BCIs are synchronous which means that the system works with fixed time slots so that the user is not able to select a command at his own convenience which poses a problem in real-world applications. In this paper we present the first asynchronous high-speed BCI with robust distinction between intentional control IC and non-control NC with a nearly perfect NC state detection of only 0.075 erroneous classifications per minute. The resulting asynchronous speller achieved an average information transfer rate ITR of 122.7\u2009bit/min using a 32 target matrix-keyboard. Since the method is based on random stimulation patterns it allows to use an arbitrary number of targets for any application purpose which was shown by using an 55 target German QWERTZ-keyboard layout which allowed the participants to write an average of 16.1 up to 30.7 correct case-sensitive letters per minute. As the presented system is the first asynchronous high-speed BCI speller with a robust non-control state detection it is an important step for moving BCI applications out of the lab and into real-life.
