This paper describes a novel approach to correct osteotomy deformities of long bones using virtual reality and image processing techniques on personal computers. The discussed method allows to simulate osteotomy corrections by implementing a single cut and a rearrangement of the dissected bone parts. It allows the surgeon to directly control the pre-operative situation and the post-operative result of the simulation by comparing bone-length angles and torsion of the bone. In addition he or she obtains the coordinates and angles of the planned cut relative to anatomical landmarks. Computer simulation of osteotomy correction.
