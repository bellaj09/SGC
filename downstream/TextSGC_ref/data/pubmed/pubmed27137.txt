Direct brain control of overground walking in those with paraplegia due to spinal cord injury SCI has not been achieved. Invasive brain-computer interfaces BCIs may provide a permanent solution to this problem by directly linking the brain to lower extremity prostheses. To justify the pursuit of such invasive systems the feasibility of BCI controlled overground walking should first be established in a noninvasive manner. To accomplish this goal we developed an electroencephalogram EEG-based BCI to control a functional electrical stimulation FES system for overground walking and assessed its performance in an individual with paraplegia due to SCI. The feasibility of a brain-computer interface functional electrical stimulation system for the restoration of overground walking after paraplegia.
