Considering the two-class classification problem in brain imaging data analysis we propose a sparse representation-based multi-variate pattern analysis MVPA algorithm to localize brain activation patterns corresponding to different stimulus classes/brain states respectively. Feature selection can be modeled as a sparse representation or sparse regression problem. Such technique has been successfully applied to voxel selection in fMRI data analysis. However single selection based on sparse representation or other methods is prone to obtain a subset of the most informative features rather than all. Herein our proposed algorithm recursively eliminates informative features selected by a sparse regression method until the decoding accuracy based on the remaining features drops to a threshold close to chance level. In this way the resultant feature set including all the identified features is expected to involve all the informative features for discrimination. According to the signs of the sparse regression weights these selected features are separated into two sets corresponding to two stimulus classes/brain states. Next in order to remove irrelevant/noisy features in the two selected feature sets we perform a nonparametric permutation test at the individual subject level or the group level. In data analysis we verified our algorithm with a toy data set and an intrinsic signal optical imaging data set. The results show that our algorithm has accurately localized two class-related patterns. As an application example we used our algorithm on a functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data set. Two sets of informative voxels corresponding to two semantic categories i.e. "old people" and "young people" respectively are obtained in the human brain.
