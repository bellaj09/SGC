We propose a novel domain-specific loss which is a differentiable loss function based on the dose-volume histogram DVH and combine it with an adversarial loss for the training of deep neural networks. In this study we trained a neural network for generating Pareto optimal dose distributions and evaluate the effects of the domain-specific loss on the model performance. Incorporating human and learned domain knowledge into training deep neural networks: A differentiable dose-volume histogram and adversarial inspired framework for generating Pareto optimal dose distributions in radiation therapy.
