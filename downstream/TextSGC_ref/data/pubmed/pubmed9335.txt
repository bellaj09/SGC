Molecular recognition features MoRFs are key functional regions of intrinsically disordered proteins IDPs which play important roles in the molecular interaction network of cells and are implicated in many serious human diseases. Identifying MoRFs is essential for both functional studies of IDPs and drug design. This study adopts the cutting-edge machine learning method of artificial intelligence to develop a powerful model for improving MoRFs prediction. We proposed a method named as en_DCNNMoRF ensemble deep convolutional neural network-based MoRF predictor. It combines the outcomes of two independent deep convolutional neural network DCNN classifiers that take advantage of different features. The first DCNNMoRF1 employs position-specific scoring matrix PSSM and 22 types of amino acid-related factors to describe protein sequences. The second DCNNMoRF2 employs PSSM and 13 types of amino acid indexes to describe protein sequences. For both single classifiers DCNN with a novel two-dimensional attention mechanism was adopted and an average strategy was added to further process the output probabilities of each DCNN model. Finally en_DCNNMoRF combined the two models by averaging their final scores. When compared with other well-known tools applied to the same datasets the accuracy of the novel proposed method was comparable with that of state-of-the-art methods.
