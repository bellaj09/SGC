"Objective: Whether the abnormal connectome of brains rich-club structure in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD remains unclear. Method: The current study used diffusion tensor imaging DTI and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to compare the performance of 42 adults with ADHD and 59 typical development TD adults. Results: A reduced density of rich-clubs among structural hub nodes including the bilateral precuneus the insula the caudate nucleus the left putamen and the right calcarine was found in adults with ADHD. Moreover lower global efficiency was found in adults with ADHD than in TD which might be caused by a reduced density of rich-club connections in ADHD patients. Conclusion: Given that adults with ADHD have greater coupling strength between structural and functional connectivity than TD adults connectome abnormalities with a reduced rich-club connectivity density might be accompanied by altered functional brain dynamics in ADHD patients."
