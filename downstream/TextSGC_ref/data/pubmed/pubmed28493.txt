Brain-computer interface BCI systems must process neural signals with consistent timing in order to support adequate system performance. Thus it is important to have the capability to determine whether a particular BCI configuration i.e. hardware and software provides adequate timing performance for a particular experiment. This report presents a method of measuring and quantifying different aspects of system timing in several typical BCI experiments across a range of settings and presents comprehensive measures of expected overall system latency for each experimental configuration. A procedure for measuring latencies in brain-computer interfaces.
