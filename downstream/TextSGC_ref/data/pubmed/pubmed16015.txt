"Perspective-taking is essential for improving intergroup relations. However it is difficult to implement especially in violent conflicts. Given that immersive virtual reality VR can simulate various points of view POV we examined whether it can lead to beneficial outcomes by promoting outgroup perspective-taking even in armed conflicts. In two studies Jewish-Israelis watched a 360 VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs-outgroups ingroups while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroups without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroups POV but not those who imagined the outgroups perspective perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroups POV. Moreover participants in the outgroups POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroups POV even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking."
