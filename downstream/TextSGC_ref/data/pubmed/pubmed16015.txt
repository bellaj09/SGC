Long-short term memory networks LSTMs which have recently emerged in sequential data analysis are the most widely used type of recurrent neural networks RNNs architecture. Progress on the topic of deep learning includes successful adaptations of deep versions of these architectures. In this study a new model for deep bidirectional LSTM network-based wavelet sequences called DBLSTM-WS was proposed for classifying electrocardiogram ECG signals. For this purpose a new wavelet-based layer is implemented to generate ECG signal sequences. The ECG signals were decomposed into frequency sub-bands at different scales in this layer. These sub-bands are used as sequences for the input of LSTM networks. New network models that include unidirectional ULSTM and bidirectional BLSTM structures are designed for performance comparisons. Experimental studies have been performed for five different types of heartbeats obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. These five types are Normal Sinus Rhythm NSR Ventricular Premature Contraction VPC Paced Beat PB Left Bundle Branch Block LBBB and Right Bundle Branch Block RBBB. The results show that the DBLSTM-WS model gives a high recognition performance of 99.39%. It has been observed that the wavelet-based layer proposed in the study significantly improves the recognition performance of conventional networks. This proposed network structure is an important approach that can be applied to similar signal processing problems.
