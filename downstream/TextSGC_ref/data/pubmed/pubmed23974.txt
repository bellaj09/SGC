Brain computer interface BCI is a new communication way between man and machine. It identifies mental task patterns stored in electroencephalogram EEG. So it extracts brain electrical activities recorded by EEG and transforms them machine control commands. The main goal of BCI is to make available assistive environmental devices for paralyzed people such as computers and makes their life easier. This study deals with feature extraction and mental task pattern recognition on 2-D cursor control from EEG as offline analysis approach. The hemispherical power density changes are computed and compared on alpha-beta frequency bands with only mental imagination of cursor movements. First of all power spectral density PSD features of EEG signals are extracted and high dimensional data reduced by principle component analysis PCA and independent component analysis ICA which are statistical algorithms. In the last stage all features are classified with two types of support vector machine SVM which are linear and least squares LS-SVM and three different artificial neural network ANN structures which are learning vector quantization LVQ multilayer neural network MLNN and probabilistic neural network PNN and mental task patterns are successfully identified via k-fold cross validation technique. Spectral feature extraction of EEG signals and pattern recognition during mental tasks of 2-D cursor movements for BCI using SVM and ANN.
