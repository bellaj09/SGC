This study examined resident exposure to and competency in new techniques for cataract removal and intraocular lens IOL implantation. A questionnaire was sent to 116 United States ophthalmology program directors and completed by 71. In response to the questionnaire program directors reported that 95.3% of their graduating seniors were competent to select and implant toric IOLs and 52.3% were competent to implant capsular tension rings CTRs. Divide and conquer 56.6% and stop and chop 25.4% dominated phacoemulsification teaching. Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was performed by residents in 44.1% of programs. In 25.4% residents observed but did not perform the procedure; in 35.6% they received didactic-only training; and in 22.0% they received no exposure. Most programs 73.2% had virtual-reality simulators for cataract surgery but wet-lab practice 91.1% didactic training 82.1% and watching videos 82.1% were the primary curricular tools used to teach advanced technologies. Advanced cataract learning experience in United States ophthalmology residency programs.
