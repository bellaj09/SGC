"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether trainees performance on a virtual reality angled laparoscope navigation task correlates with scores obtained on a validated conventional test of spatial ability. 56 participants of a surgery workshop performed an angled laparoscope navigation task on the Xitact LS 500 virtual reality Simulator. Performance parameters were correlated with the score of a validated paper-and-pencil test of spatial ability. Performance at the conventional spatial ability test significantly correlated with performance at the virtual reality task for overall task score p\u2009<\u20090.001 task completion time p\u2009<\u20090.001 and economy of movement p\u2009=\u20090.035 not for endoscope travel speed p\u2009=\u20090.947. In conclusion trainees performance in a standardized virtual reality camera navigation task correlates with their innate spatial ability. This VR session holds potential to serve as an assessment tool for trainees." Performance on a virtual reality angled laparoscope task correlates with spatial ability of trainees.
