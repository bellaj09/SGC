User content posted through Twitter has been used for biosurveillance to characterize public perception of health-related topics and as a means of distributing information to the general public. Most of the existing work surrounding Twitter and health care has shown Twitter to be an effective medium for these problems but more could be done to provide finer and more efficient access to all pertinent data. Given the diversity of user-generated content small samples or summary presentations of the data arguably omit a large part of the virtual discussion taking place in the Twittersphere. Still managing processing and querying large amounts of Twitter data is not a trivial task. This work describes tools and techniques capable of handling larger sets of Twitter data and demonstrates their use with the issue of antibiotics.
