Highly accurate detection of the intracranial hemorrhage without delay is a critical clinical issue for the diagnostic decision and treatment in an emergency room. In the context of a study on diagnostic accuracy there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In order to improve sensitivity while preserving specificity we propose a cascade deep learning model constructed using two convolutional neural networks CNNs and dual fully convolutional networks FCNs. The cascade CNN model is built for identifying bleeding; hereafter the dual FCN is to detect five different subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage and to delineate their lesions. Using a total of 135974 CT images including 33391 images labeled as bleeding each of CNN/FCN models was trained separately on image data preprocessed by two different settings of window level/width. One is a default window 50/100level/width and the other is a stroke window setting 40/40. By combining them we obtained a better outcome on both binary classification and segmentation of hemorrhagic lesions compared to a single CNN and FCN model. In determining whether it is bleeding or not there was around 1% improvement in sensitivity 97.91% \u20090.47 while retaining specificity 98.76% \u20090.10. For delineation of bleeding lesions we obtained overall segmentation performance at 80.19% in precision and 82.15% in recall which is 3.44% improvement compared to using a single FCN model.
