A central question in neuroscience and psychology is how the mammalian brain represents the outside world and enables interaction with it. Significant progress on this question has been made in the domain of spatial cognition where a consistent network of brain regions that represent external space has been identified in both humans and rodents. In rodents much of the work to date has been done in situations where the animal is free to move about naturally. By contrast the majority of work carried out to date in humans is static due to limitations imposed by traditional laboratory based imaging techniques. In recent years significant progress has been made in bridging the gap between animal and human work by employing virtual reality VR technology to simulate aspects of real-world navigation. Despite this progress the VR studies often fail to fully simulate important aspects of real-world navigation where information derived from self-motion is integrated with representations of environmental features and task goals. In the current review article we provide a brief overview of animal and human imaging work to date focusing on commonalties and differences in findings across species. Following on from this we discuss VR studies of spatial cognition outlining limitations and developments before introducing mobile brain imaging techniques and describe technical challenges and solutions for real-world recording. Finally we discuss how these advances in mobile brain imaging technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to illuminate how the brain represents complex multifaceted information during naturalistic navigation.
