"The rise in dementia and the evidence of cognitive benefits of exercise for the older adult population together make salient the research into variables affecting cognitive benefit and exercise behavior. One promising avenue for increasing exercise participation has been the introduction of exergaming a type of exercise that works in combination with virtual reality to enhance both the exercise experience and health outcomes. Past research has revealed that executive function EF was related to greater use of self-regulatory strategies which in turn was related to greater adherence to exercise following an intervention McAuley et al. 2011. Best et al. 2014 found improvement in EF related to adherence to exercise post- intervention. Anderson-Hanley et al. 2012 found that for older adults aerobic exergaming yielded greater cognitive benefit than traditional exercise alone; however questions remain as to the possible impact of greater cognitive benefit and other factors on participants involvement in exercise following the end of an intervention. The current study presents follow-up data exploring the relationship between EF self-regulation and exercise behavior in the post-intervention naturalistic period. Herein it was predicted that higher EF at the start of the naturalistic window would predict subsequent exercise with an exergame. Contrary to expectations results suggest that those with poorer EF are likely to exergame more frequently. The results of this study contradict previous literature but suggest an interesting relationship between EF self-regulation and exercise behaviors when exergaming is employed particularly with older adults with some cognitive decline. We hypothesize that other factors may be at work perhaps expectation of cognitive benefit might act as a unique motivator."
