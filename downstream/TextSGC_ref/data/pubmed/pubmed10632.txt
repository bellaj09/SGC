In fetal cardiology imaging especially echocardiography has demonstrated to help in the diagnosis and monitoring of fetuses with a compromised cardiovascular system potentially associated with several fetal conditions. Different ultrasound approaches are currently used to evaluate fetal cardiac structure and function including conventional 2-D imaging and M-mode and tissue Doppler imaging among others. However assessment of the fetal heart is still challenging mainly due to involuntary movements of the fetus the small size of the heart and the lack of expertise in fetal echocardiography of some sonographers. Therefore the use of new technologies to improve the primary acquired images to help extract measurements or to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities is of great importance for optimal assessment of the fetal heart. Machine leaning ML is a computer science discipline focused on teaching a computer to perform tasks with specific goals without explicitly programming the rules on how to perform this task. In this review we provide a brief overview on the potential of ML techniques to improve the evaluation of fetal cardiac function by optimizing image acquisition and quantification/segmentation as well as aid in improving the prenatal diagnoses of fetal cardiac remodeling and abnormalities.
