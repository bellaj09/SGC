Electronic textiles that are thin lightweight flexible and breathable have been widely explored with a variety of functionalities including power supplying displaying and sensing which may revolutionize many fields such as communication health care and artificial intelligence. To date unfortunately computing is the missing puzzle to close their functional loop. Memristor is compatible with the interwoven structure and fabricating process in textile due to its two-terminal and crossbar configuration. However it remains challenging to realize textile memristors due to the difficulties in designing advanced memristive materials and achieving high-quality active layers on fiber electrodes. Here we report a robust textile memristor based on an electrophoretic-deposited active layer of d eoxyribonucleic acid DNA on fiber electrodes. The unique architecture and orientation of DNA molecules with the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles offer the best-in-class performances e.g. both ultra- low operation voltage of ~0.3 V and power consumption of ~100 pW and high switching speed of 20 ns. Fundamental logic calculations such as implication and NAND are demonstrated as functions of textile chips and it has been thus integrated with power-supplying and displaying modules to make a proof-of-concept fabric computer . This work provides a promising route towards wearable computers and artificial neural networks for effective brain-machine interfaces. Robust DNA-bridged memristor for textile chip.
