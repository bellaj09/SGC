Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated support for clinical diagnosis. When medical data samples are limited collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical legal or ethical concerns. In this study we propose methods of distributing deep learning models as an attractive alternative to sharing patient data. Distributed deep learning networks among institutions for medical imaging.
