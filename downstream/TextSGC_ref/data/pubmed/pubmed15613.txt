This special issue of the Journal of Learning Disabilities focuses on studies of writing disabilities in Spanish-speaking children. The World Health Organization 2001 included writing difficulties as one of the problems considered to constitute an impediment to school participation a significant element in the normal developmental process of the child. In this introduction I describe the background of a larger project promoted by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO. This special series offers recent findings on writing disabilities in Spanish-Speaking children within the UNESCO project. The pilot study was carried out in the Canary Islands an autonomous Spanish region located between three continents and composed of seven islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the current empirical evidence on writing disabilities comes from English a language with deep orthography; therefore it is very relevant to investigate the writing process in Spanish a language with shallow fine-grained orthography. Included are a number of articles that form a conspectus on writing disabilities in the Spanish language. Topics center on early grade writing assessment prevalence of writing disabilities handwriting and keyboarding transcription and text generation graphonomic and handwriting analysis and instructional practices with an learning disabled population.
