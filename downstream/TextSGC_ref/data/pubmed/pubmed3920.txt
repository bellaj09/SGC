In the electroencephalogram EEG or magnetoencephalogram MEG context brain source localization beamforming methods often fail when the number of observations is small. This is particularly true when measuring evoked potentials especially when the number of electrodes is large. Due to the nonstationarity of the EEG/MEG an adaptive capability is desirable. Previous work has addressed these issues by reducing the adaptive degrees of freedom DoFs. This paper develops and tests a new multistage adaptive processing for brain source localization that has been previously used for radar statistical signal processing application with uniform linear antenna array. This processing referred to as the fast fully adaptive FFA approach could significantly reduce the required sample support and computational complexity while still processing all available DoFs. The performance improvement offered by the FFA approach in comparison to the fully adaptive minimum variance beamforming MVB with limited data is demonstrated by bootstrapping simulated data to evaluate the variability of the source location.
