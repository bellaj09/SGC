Convolutional neural networks CNNs trained on natural images are extremely successful in image classification and localization due to superior automated feature extraction capability. In extending their use to biomedical recognition tasks it is important to note that visual features of medical images tend to be uniquely different than natural images. There are advantages offered through training these networks on large scale medical common modality image collections pertaining to the recognition task. Further improved generalization in transferring knowledge across similar tasks is possible when the models are trained to learn modality-specific features and then suitably repurposed for the target task. In this study we propose modality-specific ensemble learning toward improving abnormality detection in chest X-rays CXRs. CNN models are trained on a large-scale CXR collection to learn modality-specific features and then repurposed for detecting and localizing abnormalities. Model predictions are combined using different ensemble strategies toward reducing prediction variance and sensitivity to the training data while improving overall performance and generalization. Class-selective relevance mapping CRM is used to visualize the learned behavior of the individual models and their ensembles. It localizes discriminative regions of interest ROIs showing abnormal regions and offers an improved explanation of model predictions. It was observed that the model ensembles demonstrate superior localization performance in terms of Intersection of Union IoU and mean Average Precision mAP metrics than any individual constituent model.
