"A subject of extensive research interest in the Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs niche is motor imagery MI where users imagine limb movements to control the system. This interest is owed to the immense potential for its applicability in gaming neuro-prosthetics and neuro-rehabilitation where the users thoughts of imagined movements need to be decoded. Electroencephalography EEG equipment is commonly used for keeping track of cerebrum movement in BCI systems. The EEG signals are recognized by feature extraction and classification. The current research proposes a Hybrid-KELM Kernel Extreme Learning Machine method based on PCA Principal Component Analysis and FLD Fishers Linear Discriminant for MI BCI classification of EEG data. The performance and results of the method are demonstrated using BCI competition dataset III and compared with those of contemporary methods. The proposed method generated an accuracy of 96.54%."
