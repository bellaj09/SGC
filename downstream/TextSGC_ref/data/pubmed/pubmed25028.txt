In this paper we present our application of latest information technology in assisting the Chinese acupuncture research. Having integrated the Chinese Visible Human CVH data virtual reality visualization and imaging techniques we have constructed a 3-dimensional digital human model for acupuncture. This model integrates the meridian positioning acupoint positioning arbitrary cutting-plane visualization multi-layer dissection needle puncturing simulation as well as the common diseases-therapy information. Our work can be widely applied to Chinese acupuncture education clinical usage and scientific research. Virtual acupuncture human based on chinese visible human dataset.
