To develop bridging algorithms to score the Veterans Rand-12 VR-12 scales for comparability to those of the SF-36 for facilitating multi-cohort studies using data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program SEER linked to Medicare Health Outcomes Survey MHOS and to provide a model for minimizing non-statistical error in pooled analyses stemming from changes to survey instruments over time. A new algorithm to build bridges between two patient-reported health outcome instruments: the MOS SF-36 and the VR-12 Health Survey.
