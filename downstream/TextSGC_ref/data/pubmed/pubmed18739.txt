"Virtual reality VR technology represents a novel and powerful tool for behavioral research in psychological assessment. VR provides simulated experiences able to create the sensation of undergoing real situations. Users become active participants in the virtual environment seeing hearing feeling and actuating as if they were in the real world. Currently the most psychological VR applications concern the treatment of various mental disorders but not the assessment that it is mainly based on paper and pencil tests. The observation of behaviors is costly labor-intensive and it is hard to create social situations in laboratory settings even if the observation of actual behaviors could be particularly informative. In this framework social stressful experiences can activate various behaviors of attachment for a significant person that can help to control and soothe them to promote individuals well-being. Social support seeking physical proximity and positive and negative behaviors represent the main attachment behaviors that people can carry out during experiences of distress. We proposed VR as a novel integrating approach to measure real attachment behaviors. The first studies on attachment behavioral system by VR showed the potentiality of this approach. To improve the assessment during the VR experience we proposed virtual stealth assessment VSA as a new method. VSA could represent a valid and novel technique to measure various psychological attributes in real-time during the virtual experience. The possible use of this method in psychology could be to generate a more complete exhaustive and accurate individuals psychological evaluation."
