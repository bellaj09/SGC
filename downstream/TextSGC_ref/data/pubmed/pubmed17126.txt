Post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD is a chronic psychiatric condition that develops following an exceptionally traumatic event. Core symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing the trauma for example through flashbacks and nightmares avoidance of reminders of trauma and hyperarousal for example feeling irritable or angry startling easily or experiencing difficulty sleeping or concentrating. Lifetime prevalence rates of PTSD have been estimated as 9.2% in Canada and ranging from 6.8% to 12.3% in the United States. Certain groups of people such as those exposed to military combat are at a higher risk of developing PTSD; lifetime prevalence of PTSD in Vietnam war veterans has been reported at 18.7% and up to 18% of Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans have experienced PTSD. Treatments for PTSD include pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most common choice for PTSD pharmacotherapy. Of the psychological therapies cognitive behavioural therapy CBT is considered to be a first-line therapy for PTSD based on strong evidence of effectiveness from clinical trials. CBT may involve multiple therapy approaches including elements of cognitive therapy development of coping skills and exposure therapy. Exposure therapy in particular refers to a method by which patients repeatedly confront memories or reminders of trauma in a safe and controlled environment in order to gradually reduce the distress associated with them. Imaginal exposure therapy focuses on patients revisiting the event in their minds in vivo exposure employs real-life trauma reminders and prolonged exposure PE combines both types of exposure therapy. A recent expansion on traditional exposure therapy virtual reality exposure therapy VRET creates an immersive and interactive virtual environment through the use of computer graphics and auditory cues to enhance a patients imaginative capacities. The virtual environment is often presented via a head-mounted display and can be manipulated by the therapist or patient as necessary. Since engagement in imaginal exposure can be hindered by the avoidance behaviour that is characteristic of PTSD VRETs use of multiple sensory prompts to assist recall of trauma and immersion has been suggested as an enhancement of conventional exposure therapy. However VRET is a relatively recent development in the field and uncertainty remains about its clinical effectiveness. The purpose of this report is to examine the clinical effectiveness of VRET for the treatment of PTSD.
