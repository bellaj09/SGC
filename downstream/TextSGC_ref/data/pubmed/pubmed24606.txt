Mobile electroencephalogram EEG-sensing technologies have rapidly progressed and made the access of neuroelectrical brain activity outside the laboratory in everyday life more realistic. However most existing EEG headsets exhibit a fixed design whereby its immobile montage in terms of electrode density and coverage inevitably poses a great challenge with applicability and generalizability to the fundamental study and application of the brain-computer interface BCI. In this study a cost-efficient custom EEG-electrode holder infrastructure was designed through the assembly of primary components including the sensor-positioning ring inter-ring bridge and bridge shield. It allows a user to reassemble a compact holder grid to accommodate a desired number of electrodes only to the regions of interest of the brain and iteratively adapt it to a given head size for optimal electrode-scalp contact and signal quality. This study empirically demonstrated its easy-to-fabricate nature by a low-end fused deposition modeling FDM 3D printer and proved its practicability of capturing event-related potential ERP and steady-state visual-evoked potential SSVEP signatures over 15 subjects. This paper highlights the possibilities for a cost-efficient electrode-holder assembly infrastructure with replaceable montage flexibly retrofitted in an unlimited fashion for an individual for distinctive fundamental EEG studies and BCI applications.
