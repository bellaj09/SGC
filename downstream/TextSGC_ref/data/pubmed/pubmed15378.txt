This paper presents a real-time fine gesture recognition system for multi-articulating hand prosthesis control using an embedded convolutional neural network CNN to classify hand-muscle contractions sensed at the forearm. The sensor consists in a custom non-intrusive compact and easy-to-install 32-channel high-density surface electromyography HDsEMG electrode array built on a flexible printed circuit board PCB to allow wrapping around the forearm. The sensor provides a low-noise digitization interface with wireless data transmission through an industrial scientific and medical ISM radio link. An original frequency-time-space cross-domain preprocessing method is proposed to enhance gesture-specific data homogeneity and generate reliable muscle activation maps leading to 98.15% accuracy when using a majority vote over 5 subsequent inferences by the proposed CNN. The obtained real-time gesture recognition within 100 to 200\xa0ms and CNN properties show reliable and promising results to improve on the state-of-the-art of commercial hand prostheses. Moreover edge computing using a specialized embedded artificial intelligence AI platform ensures reliable secure and low latency real-time operation as well as quick and easy access to training fine-tuning and calibration of the neural network. Co-design of the signal processing AI algorithms and sensing hardware ensures a reliable and power-efficient embedded gesture recognition system.
