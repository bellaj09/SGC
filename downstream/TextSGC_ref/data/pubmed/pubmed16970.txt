Medical Subject Headings MeSH indexing which is to assign a set of MeSH main headings to citations is crucial for many important tasks in biomedical text mining and information retrieval. Large-scale MeSH indexing has two challenging aspects: the citation side and MeSH side. For the citation side all existing methods including Medical Text Indexer MTI by National Library of Medicine and the state-of-the-art method MeSHLabeler deal with text by bag-of-words which cannot capture semantic and context-dependent information well.
