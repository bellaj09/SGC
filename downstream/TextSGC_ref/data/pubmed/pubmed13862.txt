Accurate and automated prostate whole gland and central gland segmentations on MR images are essential for aiding any prostate cancer diagnosis system. Our work presents a 2-D orthogonal deep learning method to automatically segment the whole prostate and central gland from T2-weighted axial-only MR images. The proposed method can generate high-density 3-D surfaces from low-resolution  z axis MR images. In the past most methods have focused on axial images alone e.g. 2-D based segmentation of the prostate from each 2-D slice. Those methods suffer the problems of over-segmenting or under-segmenting the prostate at apex and base which adds a major contribution for errors. The proposed method leverages the orthogonal context to effectively reduce the apex and base segmentation ambiguities. It also overcomes jittering or stair-step surface artifacts when constructing a 3-D surface from 2-D segmentation or direct 3-D segmentation approaches such as 3-D U-Net. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 92.4 %  3 % Dice similarity coefficient DSC for prostate and DSC of 90.1 %  4.6 % for central gland without trimming any ending contours at apex and base. The experiments illustrate the feasibility and robustness of the 2-D-based holistically nested networks with short connections method for MR prostate and central gland segmentation. The proposed method achieves segmentation results on par with the current literature.
