Focus group discussions also were conducted to further gauge the students\ feedback and insights into the flipped examination experience. Results. Changes in mean total study process scores at the deep and surface levels of learning were significant. The flipped examination experience was enjoyable facilitated a less-stressful learning environment and improved the students\ learning satisfaction knowledge and assessment grades. Conclusion. The flipped examination model is an innovative instructional approach that can bring about significant educational gains if designed well pedagogically.
