"As a specialist field of study medical physicists require a broad range of knowledge and skills to operate competently in their workplace. In Australia these competencies are accredited by the Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine ACPSEM. Education and training for medical physicists therefore consists of an exhaustive range of knowledge areas. This is made even more challenging due to the extremely diverse backgrounds of students in these specialist courses of study. These factors frequently lead to a disengagement by students with learning activities. To address some of these challenges the Radiotherapy Physics unit in a Masters level Medical Physics course of study was re-designed to increase active learning that included scaffolded in-class and online tasks and supported by virtual reality simulations. These re-design initiatives were informed by a diverse team including academic and clinical medical physicists as well as education experts. A survey conducted over two consecutive years was used to gain students perceptions about the re-design. The questions were designed to see if the students felt engaged with the various learning activities. Analysis of the survey data indicates that there was an overall improvement in students engagement with the learning activities and the learning content. The paper further discusses nuanced understanding about the ways in which students engaged with the various learning activities including online in-class practicals and industry attachments. The paper discusses the appropriately informed learning activities that can be used to improve student engagement for highly specialised content heavy areas of study."
