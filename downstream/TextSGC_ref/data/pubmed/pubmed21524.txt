This article reviews the 6-month followup data of a randomized multicenter parallel-group study conducted at five clinical sites in three European cities which compared two second-level treatments for bulimia nervosa BN and binge eating disorder BED: virtual reality-based cue exposure therapy VR-CET versus additional cognitive behavioral therapy A-CBT. Post-treatment outcomes of this study were previously published and details of its design can be found at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02237300. This article focuses on the evolution of symptoms assessed after 6 months of followup in a subgroup of 58 patients from the original study. In this study 64 patients with eating disorders EDs 35 with BN and 29 with BED who still showed active episodes of binge eating by the end of a structured CBT program first-level treatment were randomly assigned to one of two second-level treatments A-CBT or VR-CET. Frequency of binge and purge episodes and attitudinal features of binge-related EDs bulimia drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction were assessed before starting the second-level treatment n\u2009=\u200964 at the end n\u2009=\u200964 and at 6-month followup n\u2009=\u200958. Mixed between-within subject analyses of variance were used to compare outcomes of both second-level treatments over time. Although both treatment conditions showed statistically significant improvements at the end and after 6-month followup obtained reductions were greater after VR-CET regarding binge and purge episodes as well as the decrease of self-reported tendency to engage in overeating episodes. Accordingly abstinence from binge episodes were higher in VR-CET than A-CBT at followup 70 percent vs. 26 percent respectively; 2\u2009=\u200911.711 p\u2009=\u20090.001. These results provide further support for the use of VR-CET as an effective second-level intervention for BN and BED treatment-resistant patients.
