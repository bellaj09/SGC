The medical image analysis field has traditionally been focused on the development of organ- and disease-specific methods. Recently the interest in the development of more comprehensive computational anatomical models has grown leading to the creation of multi-organ models. Multi-organ approaches unlike traditional organ-specific strategies incorporate inter-organ relations into the model thus leading to a more accurate representation of the complex human anatomy. Inter-organ relations are not only spatial but also functional and physiological. Over the years the strategies proposed to efficiently model multi-organ structures have evolved from the simple global modeling to more sophisticated approaches such as sequential hierarchical or machine learning-based models. In this paper we present a review of the state of the art on multi-organ analysis and associated computation anatomy methodology. The manuscript follows a methodology-based classification of the different techniques available for the analysis of multi-organs and multi-anatomical structures from techniques using point distribution models to the most recent deep learning-based approaches. With more than 300 papers included in this review we reflect on the trends and challenges of the field of computational anatomy the particularities of each anatomical region and the potential of multi-organ analysis to increase the impact of medical imaging applications on the future of healthcare.
