"Opioid addiction in the United States has come to national attention as opioid overdose OD related deaths have risen at alarming rates. Combating opioid epidemic becomes a high priority for not only governments but also healthcare providers. This depends on critical knowledge to understand the risk of opioid overdose of patients. In this paper we present our work on building machine learning based prediction models to predict opioid overdose of patients based on the history of patients electronic health records EHR. We performed two studies using New York State claims data SPARCS with 440000 patients and Cerners Health Facts database with 110000 patients. Our experiments demonstrated that EHR based prediction can achieve best recall with random forest method precision: 95.3% recall: 85.7% F1 score: 90.3% best precision with deep learning precision: 99.2% recall: 77.8% F1 score: 87.2%. We also discovered that clinical events are among critical features for the predictions." Machine Learning Based Opioid Overdose Prediction Using Electronic Health Records.
