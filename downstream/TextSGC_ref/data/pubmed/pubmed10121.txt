Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging MRI is of great value to both clinical diagnosis and scientific research. However most MRI experiments remain qualitative especially dynamic MRI because repeated sampling with variable weighting parameter makes quantitative imaging time-consuming and sensitive to motion artifacts. A single-shot quantitative T2 mapping method based on multiple overlapping-echo acquisition dubbed MOLED-4 was proposed to obtain reliable T2 mapping in milliseconds. Different from traditional MRI acceleration methods such as compressed sensing and parallel imaging MOLED-4 accelerates quantitative T2 mapping via synchronized multisampling and then deep learning to map the complex nonlinear relationship that is difficult to solve by traditional optimization-based methods. The results of simulation phantom and in vivo human brain experiments show the great performance of the proposed method. The principle of MOLED-4 may be extended to other ultrafast quantitative parameter mappings and potentially lead to new dynamic MRI with high efficiency to catch quantitative variation of tissue properties.
