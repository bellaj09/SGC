Non-coding variants have been shown to be related to disease by alteration of 3D genome structures. We propose a deep learning method DeepMILO to predict the effects of variants on CTCF/cohesin-mediated insulator loops. Application of DeepMILO on variants from whole-genome sequences of 1834 patients of twelve cancer types revealed 672 insulator loops disrupted in at least 10% of patients. Our results show mutations at loop anchors are associated with upregulation of the cancer driver genes BCL2 and MYC in malignant lymphoma thus pointing to a possible new mechanism for their dysregulation via alteration of insulator loops. DeepMILO: a deep learning approach to predict the impact of non-coding sequence variants on 3D chromatin structure.
