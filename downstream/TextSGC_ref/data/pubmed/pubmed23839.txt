"One of the biggest problems of upper limb transplantation is lack of certainty as to whether a patient will be able to control voluntary movements of transplanted hands. Based on findings of the recent research on brain cortex plasticity a premise can be drawn that mental training supported with visual and sensory feedback can cause structural and functional reorganization of the sensorimotor cortex which leads to recovery of function associated with the control of movements performed by the upper limbs. In this study authors - based on the above observations - propose the computer-aided training CAT system which generating visual and sensory stimuli should enhance the effectiveness of mental training applied to humans before upper limb transplantation. The basis for the concept of computer-aided training system is a virtual hand whose reaching and grasping movements the trained patient can observe on the VR headset screen visual feedback and whose contact with virtual objects the patient can feel as a touch sensory feedback. The computer training system is composed of three main components: 1 the system generating 3D virtual world in which the patient sees the virtual limb from the perspective as if it were his/her own hand; 2 sensory feedback transforming information about the interaction of the virtual hand with the grasped object into mechanical vibration; 3 the therapists panel for controlling the training course. Results of the case study demonstrate that mental training supported with visual and sensory stimuli generated by the computer system leads to a beneficial change of the brain activity related to motor control of the reaching in the patient with bilateral upper limb congenital transverse deficiency."
