Although fingerprint-based systems are the commonly used biometric systems they suffer from a critical vulnerability to a presentation attack PA. Therefore several approaches based on a fingerprint biometrics have been developed to increase the robustness against a PA. We propose an alternative approach based on the combination of fingerprint and electrocardiogram ECG signals. An ECG signal has advantageous characteristics that prevent the replication. Combining a fingerprint with an ECG signal is a potentially interesting solution to reduce the impact of PAs in biometric systems. We also propose a novel end-to-end deep learning-based fusion neural architecture between a fingerprint and an ECG signal to improve PA detection in fingerprint biometrics. Our model uses state-of-the-art EfficientNets for generating a fingerprint feature representation. For the ECG we investigate three different architectures based on fully-connected layers FC a 1D-convolutional neural network 1D-CNN and a 2D-convolutional neural network 2D-CNN. The 2D-CNN converts the ECG signals into an image and uses inverted Mobilenet-v2 layers for feature generation. We evaluated the method on a multimodal dataset that is a customized fusion of the LivDet 2015 fingerprint dataset and ECG data from real subjects. Experimental results reveal that this architecture yields a better average classification accuracy compared to a single fingerprint modality.
