C5/C6 tetraplegic patients and transhumeral amputees may be able to use voluntary shoulder motion as command signals for a functional electrical stimulation system or transhumeral prosthesis. Stereotyped relationships termed "postural synergies" among the shoulder forearm and wrist joints emerge during goal-oriented reaching and transport movements as performed by able-bodied subjects. Thus the posture of the shoulder can potentially be used to infer the desired posture of the elbow and forearm joints during reaching and transporting movements. We investigated how well able-bodied subjects could learn to use a noninvasive command scheme based on inferences from these postural synergies to control a simulated transhumeral prosthesis in a virtual reality task. We compared the performance of subjects using the inferential command scheme ICS with subjects operating the simulated prosthesis in virtual reality according to complete motion tracking of their actual arm and hand movements. Initially subjects performed poorly with the ICS but improved rapidly with modest amounts of practice eventually achieving performance only slightly less than subjects using complete motion tracking. Thus inferring the desired movement of distal joints from voluntary shoulder movements appears to be an intuitive and noninvasive approach for obtaining command signals for prostheses to restore reaching and grasping functions.
