Motor imagery can be used to modulate sensorimotor rhythms SMR enabling detection of voltage fluctuations on the surface of the scalp using electroencephalographic EEG electrodes. Feedback is essential in learning how to intentionally modulate SMR in non-muscular communication using a brain-computer interface BCI. A BCI that is not reliant upon the visual modality for feedback is an attractive means of communication for the blind and the vision impaired and to release the visual channel for other purposes during BCI usage. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the traditional visual feedback modality with stereo auditory feedback. Twenty participants split into equal groups took part in ten BCI sessions involving motor imagery. The visual feedback group performed best using two performance measures but did not show improvement over time whilst the auditory group improved as the study progressed. Multiple loudspeaker presentation of audio allows the listener to intuitively assign each of two classes to the corresponding lateral position in a free-field listening environment.
