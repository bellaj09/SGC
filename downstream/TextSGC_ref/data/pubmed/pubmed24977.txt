Neural interfaces facilitating communication between the brain and machines must be compatible with the soft curvilinear and elastic tissues of the brain and yet yield enough power to read and write information across a wide range of brain areas through high-throughput recordings or optogenetics. Biocompatible-material engineering has facilitated the development of brain-compatible neural interfaces to support built-in modulation of neural circuits and neurological disorders. Recent developments in brain-compatible neural interfaces that use soft nanomaterials more suitable for complex neural circuit analysis and modulation are reviewed. Preclinical tests of the compatibility and specificity of these interfaces in animal models are also discussed. Progress in Brain-Compatible Interfaces with Soft Nanomaterials.
