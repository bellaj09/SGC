We demonstrate the use of shaped ultrafast laser pulses in the deep ultraviolet to control the ring opening isomerization of 13-cyclohexadiene to form 135-hexatriene. The experiments are performed with a gas phase sample and the isomerization yield is probed with dissociative ionization driven by a time-delayed intense infrared laser pulse. Differences in the electronic structure of the ions for the two isomers as shown by ab initio calculations result in very different fragmentation products following strong-field ionization. We find that a shaped pulse yields a approximately 37% increase in the isomerization over an unshaped laser pulse.
