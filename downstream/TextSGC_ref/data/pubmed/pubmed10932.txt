Deep neural network DNN is a useful machine learning approach although its applicability to metabolomics studies has rarely been explored. Here we describe the development of an ensemble DNN EDNN algorithm and its applicability to metabolomics studies. As a model case the developed EDNN approach was applied to metabolomics data of various fish species collected from Japan coastal and estuarine environments for evaluation of a regression performance compared with conventional DNN random forest and support vector machine algorithms. This study also revealed that the metabolic profiles of fish muscles were correlated with fish size growth in a species-dependent manner. The performance of EDNN regression for fish size based on metabolic profiles was superior to that of DNN random forest and support vector machine algorithms. The EDNN approach therefore should be helpful for analyses of regression and concerns pertaining to classification in metabolomics studies.
