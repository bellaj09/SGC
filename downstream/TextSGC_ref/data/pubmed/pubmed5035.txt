"Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells ipRGCs synchronize our biological clocks with the external light/dark cycle 1. In addition to photoentrainment they mediate the effects of light experience as a central modulator of mood learning and health 2. This makes a complete account of the circuity responsible for ipRGCs light responses essential to understanding their diverse roles in our well-being. Considerable progress has been made in understanding ipRGCs melanopsin-mediated responses in rodents 3-5. However in primates ipRGCs also have a rare blue-OFF response mediated by an unknown short-wavelength-sensitive S-cone circuit 6. Identifying this S-cone circuit is particularly important because ipRGCs mediate many of the wide-ranging effects of short-wavelength light on human biology. These effects are often attributed to melanopsin but there is evidence for an S-cone contribution as well 7 8. Here we tested the hypothesis that the S-OFF response is mediated by the S-ON pathway through inhibitory input from an undiscovered S-cone amacrine cell. Using serial electron microscopy in the macaque retina we reconstructed the neurons and synapses of the S-cone connectome revealing a novel inhibitory interneuron an amacrine cell receiving excitatory glutamatergic input exclusively from S-ON bipolar cells. This S-cone amacrine cell makes highly selective inhibitory synapses onto ipRGCs resulting in a blue-OFF response. Identification of the S-cone amacrine cell provides the missing component of an evolutionarily ancient circuit using spectral information for non-image forming visual functions."
