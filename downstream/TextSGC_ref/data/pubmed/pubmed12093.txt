"It is urgent to find the appropriate technology for the early detection of Alzheimers disease AD due to the unknown AD etiopathologies that bring about serious social problems. Early detection of mild cognitive impairment MCI has pivotal importance in delaying or preventing the AD onset. Herein we utilize deep learning DL techniques for the purpose of multiclass classification between normal control MCI and AD subjects. We used multi-categorical data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI including brain imaging measurements cognitive test results cerebrospinal fluid measures ApoE4 status and age. We achieved an overall accuracy of 87.197% for our artificial neural network classifier and a similar overall accuracy of 88.275% for our 1D convolutional neural network classifier. We conclude that DL-based techniques are powerful tools in analyzing ADNI data although further method refinements are needed."
