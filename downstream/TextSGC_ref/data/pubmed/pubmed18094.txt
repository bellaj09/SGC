Our patient had drainage of a large amoebic liver abscess. This got complicated by a severe degree of hypotension which required aggressive fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone support. Computerised tomography CT of the abdomen revealed bilateral adrenal gland haemorrhage BAH resulting in primary adrenal gland failure which was the cause for hypotension. Patient was on long-term warfarin for provoked deep vein thrombosis of lower limb which was discontinued before the procedure. Thrombophilia profile indicated the presence of lupus anticoagulant factor with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT. Patient was discharged on lifelong warfarin. This case emphasises the need for strong clinical suspicion for diagnosing BAH rare but life-threatening condition and its association with amoebic liver abscess and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome APLS. Bilateral adrenal gland haemorrhage: an unusual cause.
