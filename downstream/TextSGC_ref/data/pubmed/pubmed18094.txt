The aim of this study is to establish if the results obtained in the evaluation of the candidates for the laparoscopic surgery competence using the LapSim virtual reality simulator are comparable with intraoperative evaluation. For this study has been evaluated in front of the LapSim and in the operating room a number of 12 surgeons who have achieved the criteria for laparoscopic surgery competence evaluation. The results of any one of the candidates have been evaluated on Lapsim and by the exam committee in the operation room relating to four criteria: 1 utilization of 300 camera; 2 manipulation and coordination of laparoscopic instruments suturing; 3 grasping and cutting; 4 clip applying. The evaluation has been made relating to the time need for every candidate to perform the asked task and the subjective evaluation of the examining committee with marks from 1 to 10. The LapSim evaluation in concordance with intraoperative evaluation managed to establish 2 candidates with deficiency in manipulation and coordination of laparoscopic instruments and difficulty in the laparoscopic bidimensional field orientation. We consider this experiment only the beginning in the evaluation of the utility of virtual reality simulator in the training and examination of the results in laparoscopic surgery. We consider that large series of subjects with different levels of knowledge in laparoscopic surgery have to be evaluated to conclude if the benefit of laparoscopic surgery virtual reality simulator is the same as in airplane pilots. The use of LapSim virtual reality simulator in the evaluation of laparoscopic surgery skill. Preliminary results.
