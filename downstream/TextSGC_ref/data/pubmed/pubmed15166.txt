"Human activity recognition HAR is a popular and challenging research topic driven by a variety of applications. More recently with significant progress in the development of deep learning networks for classification tasks many researchers have made use of such models to recognise human activities in a sensor-based manner which have achieved good performance. However sensor-based HAR still faces challenges; in particular recognising similar activities that only have a different sequentiality and similarly classifying activities with large inter-personal variability. This means that some human activities have large intra-class scatter and small inter-class separation. To deal with this problem we introduce a margin mechanism to enhance the discriminative power of deep learning networks. We modified four kinds of common neural networks with our margin mechanism to test the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the margin-based models outperform the unmodified models on the OPPORTUNITY UniMiB-SHAR and PAMAP2 datasets. We also extend our research to the problem of open-set human activity recognition and evaluate the proposed methods performance in recognising new human activities."
