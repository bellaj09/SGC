Pattern classification algorithm is the crucial step in developing brain-computer interface BCI applications. In this paper a hierarchical support vector machine HSVM algorithm is proposed to address an EEG-based four-class motor imagery classification task. Wavelet packet transform is employed to decompose raw EEG signals. Thereafter EEG signals with effective frequency sub-bands are grouped and reconstructed. EEG feature vectors are extracted from the reconstructed EEG signals with one versus the rest common spatial patterns OVR-CSP and one versus one common spatial patterns OVO-CSP. Then a two-layer HSVM algorithm is designed for the classification of these EEG feature vectors where "OVO" classifiers are used in the first layer and "OVR" in the second layer. A public dataset BCI Competition IV-II-ais employed to validate the proposed method. Fivefold cross-validation results demonstrate that the average accuracy of classification in the first layer and the second layer is 67.5\xa0\xa017.7% and 60.3\xa0\xa014.7% respectively. The average accuracy of the classification is 64.4\xa0\xa016.7% overall. These results show that the proposed method is effective for four-class motor imagery classification.
