Recently wearable devices have become a prominent health care application domain by incorporating a growing number of sensors and adopting smart machine learning technologies. One closely related topic is the strategy of combining the wearable device technology with skill assessment which can be used in wearable device apps for coaching and/or personal training. Particularly pertinent to skill assessment based on high-dimensional time series data from wearable sensors is classifying whether a player is an expert or a beginner which skills the player is exercising and extracting some low-dimensional representations useful for coaching. In this paper we present a deep learning-based coaching assistant method which can provide useful information in supporting table tennis practice. Our method uses a combination of LSTM Long short-term memory with a deep state space model and probabilistic inference. More precisely we use the expressive power of LSTM when handling high-dimensional time series data and state space model and probabilistic inference to extract low-dimensional latent representations useful for coaching. Experimental results show that our method can yield promising results for characterizing high-dimensional time series patterns and for providing useful information when working with wearable IMU Inertial measurement unit sensors for table tennis coaching.
