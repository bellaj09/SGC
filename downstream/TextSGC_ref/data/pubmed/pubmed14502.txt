By 2004 senior leaders at Kaiser Permanente the largest not-for-profit health plan in the United States recognizing variations across service areas in quality safety service and efficiency began developing a performance improvement PI system to realizing best-in-class quality performance across all 35 medical centers. MEASURING SYSTEMWIDE PERFORMANCE: In 2005 a Web-based data dashboard "Big Q" which tracks the performance of each medical center and service area against external benchmarks and internal goals was created. PLANNING FOR PI AND BENCHMARKING PERFORMANCE: In 2006 Kaiser Permanente national and regional continued planning the PI system and in 2007 quality medical group operations and information technology leaders benchmarked five high-performing organizations to identify capabilities required to achieve consistent best-in-class organizational performance. THE PI SYSTEM: The PI system addresses the six capabilities: leadership priority setting a systems approach to improvement measurement capability a learning organization improvement capacity and a culture of improvement. PI "deep experts" mentors consult with national regional and local leaders and more than 500 improvement advisors are trained to manage portfolios of 90-120 day improvement initiatives at medical centers.
