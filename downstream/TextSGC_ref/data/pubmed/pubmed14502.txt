Latest advances of deep learning paradigm and 3D imaging systems have raised the necessity for more complete datasets that allow exploitation of facial features such as pose gender or age. In our work we propose a new facial dataset collected with an innovative RGBD multi-camera setup whose optimization is presented and validated. 3DWF includes 3D raw and registered data collection for 92 persons from low-cost RGBD sensing devices to commercial scanners with great accuracy. 3DWF provides a complete dataset with relevant and accurate visual information for different tasks related to facial properties such as face tracking or 3D face reconstruction by means of annotated density normalized 2K clouds and RGBD streams. In addition we validate the reliability of our proposal by an original data augmentation method from a massive set of face meshes for facial landmark detection in 2D domain and by head pose classification through common Machine Learning techniques directed towards proving alignment of collected data.
