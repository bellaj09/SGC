Cognitive impairment is a significant comorbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy that is associated with extensive hippocampal cell loss. Deep brain stimulation DBS of the anterior thalamic nucleus ANT has been used for the treatment of refractory partial seizures. In the pilocarpine model of epilepsy ANT DBS applied during status epilepticus SE reduces hippocampal inflammation and apoptosis. When given to chronic epileptic animals it reduces hippocampal excitability and seizure frequency. Here we tested whether ANT DBS delivered during SE and the silent phase of the pilocarpine model would reduce cognitive impairment when animals became chronically epileptic.
