Nineteen PD patients who received deep brain stimulation DBS 10 non-surgical control PD patients and 11 non-pathologic age- and gender-matched subjects performed sustained vowel phonations. The following acoustic measures were obtained on the sustained vowel phonations: correlation dimension D2 percent jitter percent shimmer SNR F0 vF0 and vAm. The results indicated the following: The mean D2 of control PD patients was significantly higher than the mean D2 of non-pathologic subjects and patients who received deep brain stimulation. These results suggest an improvement in PD voice in treated patients. Many PD vocal samples in this study have type 2 signals containing subharmonics that may not be suitable for perturbation analysis but are suitable for nonlinear dynamic analysis making the D2 results more reliable. These findings show that DBS may provide measurable improvement in patients with severe vocal impairment.
