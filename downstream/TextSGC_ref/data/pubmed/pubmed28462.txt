A Brain Computer Interface BCI provides direct communication from the brain to a computer or electronic device. In order for BCIs to become practical assistive devices it is necessary to develop robust systems which can be used outside of the laboratory. This paper appraises the technical challenges and outlines the design of an intuitive user interface which can be used for smart device control and entertainment applications of specific interest to users. We adopted a user-centred approach surveying two groups of participants: fifteen volunteers who could use BCI as an additional technology and six users with complex communication and assistive technology needs. Interaction is based on a four way choice parsing a hierarchical menu structure which allows selection of room location and then device e.g. light television within a smart home. The interface promotes ease of use which aim to improve the BCI communication rate. Can brain computer interfaces become practical assistive devices in the community?
