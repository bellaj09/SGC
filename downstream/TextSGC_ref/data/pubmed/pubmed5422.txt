Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL the most common cancer affecting young children have been associated with long-term cognitive impairments that reduce quality of life. Executive dysfunction is one of the most consistently observed deficits and can have substantial and pervasive effects on academic success occupational achievement psychosocial function and psychiatric status. We examined the neural mechanisms of executive dysfunction by measuring structural and functional connectomes in 161 long-term survivors of pediatric ALL age 8-21 years who were treated on a single contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol for standard/high- or low-risk disease. Lower global efficiency a measure of information exchange and network integration of both structural and functional connectomes was found in survivors with executive dysfunction compared with those without dysfunction p\u2009<\u20090.046. Patients with standard/high- versus low-risk disease and those who received greater number of intrathecal treatments containing methotrexate had the lowest network efficiencies. Patients with executive dysfunction also showed hyperconnectivity in sensorimotor visual and auditory-processing regions p\u2009=\u20090.037 and poor separation between sensorimotor executive/attention salience and default mode networks p\u2009<\u20090.0001. Connectome disruption was consistent with a pattern of delayed neurodevelopment that may be associated with reduced resilience adaptability and flexibility of the brain network. These findings highlight the need for interventions that will prevent or manage cognitive impairment in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
