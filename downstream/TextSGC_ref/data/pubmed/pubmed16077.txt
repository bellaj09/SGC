Augmented Reality AR is a method whereby virtual objects are superimposed on the real world. AR technology is becoming increasingly accessible and affordable and it has many potential health applications. This paper discusses current research on AR health applications such as medical education and medical practice. Some of the potential future uses for this technology e.g. health information systems consumer health applications will also be presented. Additionally there will be a discussion outlining some of usability and human factors challenges associated with AR in healthcare. It is expected that AR will become increasingly prevalent in healthcare; however further investigation is required to demonstrate that they provide benefits over traditional methods. Moreover AR applications must be thoroughly tested to ensure they do not introduce new errors into practice and have patient safety implications. A see through future: augmented reality and health information systems.
