Canonical -helices are short relatively unstable secondary structure elements found in proteins. They comprise seven or more residues and are present in 15% of all known protein structures often in functionally important regions such as ligand- and ion-binding sites. Given their similarity to -helices the prediction of -helices is a challenging task and none of the currently available secondary structure prediction methods tackle it. Here we present PiPred a neural network-based tool for predicting -helices in protein sequences. By performing a rigorous benchmark we show that PiPred can detect -helices with a per-residue precision of 48% and sensitivity of 46%. Interestingly some of the -helices mispredicted by PiPred as -helices exhibit a geometry characteristic of -helices. Also despite being trained only with canonical -helices PiPred can identify 6-residue-long /-bulges. These observations suggest an even higher effective precision of the method and demonstrate that -helices /-bulges and other helical deformations may impose similar constraints on sequences. PiPred is freely accessible at: https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/quick2d . A standalone version is available for download at: https://github.com/labstructbioinf/PiPred  where we also provide the CB6133 CB513 CASP10 and CASP11 datasets commonly used for training and validation of secondary structure prediction methods with correctly annotated -helices.
