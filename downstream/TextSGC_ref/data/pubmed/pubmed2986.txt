"Alzheimers disease AD is increasingly considered as a disconnection syndrome. Previous studies of the structural connectome in early AD stages have focused on mild cognitive impaired subjects MCI considering them as a homogeneous group. We studied 168 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database 116 MCI and 52 cognitively normal subjects. Biomarker-based stratification using amyloid biomarkers AV45 PET and neurodegeneration biomarkers MRI and FDG PET led to 4 subgroups based on amyloid positivity A+/- and neurodegeneration positivity N+/-: A-N- A+N- A-N+ and A+N+. Using diffusion MRI we showed that both MCI A-N+ and MCI A+N+ subjects displayed an alteration of the white matter in the fornix and a significant bihemispheric network of decreased connections. These network alterations in MCI A+N+ are stronger and more focal than those of MCI A-N+. Only MCI A+N+ subjects exhibited specific changes in hippocampal connectivity and an AD-like alteration pattern. Our results indicate that the connectome disintegration pattern of MCI subgroups differ with respect to brain amyloid and neurodegeneration. Each of these 2 AD biomarkers induces a connectome alteration that is maximal when they coexist." Amyloidosis and neurodegeneration result in distinct structural connectivity patterns in mild cognitive impairment.
