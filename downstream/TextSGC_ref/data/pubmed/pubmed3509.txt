Astrocytes are primary homeostatic cells of the central nervous system. They regulate glutamatergic transmission through the removal of glutamate from the extracellular space and by supplying neurons with glutamine. Glutamatergic transmission is generally believed to be significantly impaired in the contexts of all major neuropsychiatric diseases. In most of these neuropsychiatric diseases astrocytes show signs of degeneration and atrophy which is likely to be translated into reduced homeostatic capabilities. Astroglial glutamate uptake/release and glutamate homeostasis are affected in all forms of major psychiatric disorders and represent a common mechanism underlying neurotransmission disbalance aberrant connectome and overall failure on information processing by neuronal networks which underlie pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases.
