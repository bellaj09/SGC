Accelerating the design of technologies to support health in the home requires 1 better understanding of how the household context shapes consumer health behaviors and 2 the opportunity to afford engineers designers and health professionals the chance to systematically study the home environment. We developed the Living Environments Laboratory LEL with a fully immersive six-sided virtual reality CAVE to enable recreation of a broad range of household environments. We have successfully developed a virtual apartment including a kitchen living space and bathroom. Over 2000 people have visited the LEL CAVE. Participants use an electronic wand to activate common household affordances such as opening a refrigerator door or lifting a cup. Challenges currently being explored include creating natural gesture to interface with virtual objects developing robust simple procedures to capture actual living environments and rendering them in a 3D visualization and devising systematic stable terminologies to characterize home environments. Envisioning the future of home care: applications of immersive virtual reality.
