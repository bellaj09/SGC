Augmented reality AR allows to seamlessly insert virtual objects in an image sequence. In order to accomplish this goal it is important that synthetic elements are rendered and aligned in the scene in an accurate and visually acceptable way. The solution of this problem can be related to a pose estimation or equivalently a camera localization process. This paper aims at presenting a brief but almost self-contented introduction to the most important approaches dedicated to vision-based camera localization along with a survey of several extension proposed in the recent years. For most of the presented approaches we also provide links to code of short examples. This should allow readers to easily bridge the gap between theoretical aspects and practical implementations.
