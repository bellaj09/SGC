"Speller UI systems tend to be less accurate because of individual variation and the noise of EEG signals. Therefore we propose a new method to combine the EEG signals and gaze-tracking. This research is novel in the following four aspects. First two wearable devices are combined to simultaneously measure both the EEG signal and the gaze position. Second the speller UI system usually has a 6  6 matrix of alphanumeric characters which has disadvantage in that the number of characters is limited to 36. Thus a 12  12 matrix that includes 144 characters is used. Third in order to reduce the highlighting time of each of the 12  12 rows and columns only the three rows and three columns which are determined on the basis of the 3  3 area centered on the users gaze position are highlighted. Fourth by analyzing the P300 EEG signal that is obtained only when each of the 3  3 rows and columns is highlighted the accuracy of selecting the correct character is enhanced. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of proposed method was higher than the other methods."
