"Mining has long remained one of Americas most hazardous occupations. Researchers believe that by developing realistic affordable VR training software miners will be able to receive accurate training in hazard recognition and avoidance. In addition the VR software will allow miners to follow mine evacuation routes and safe procedures without exposing themselves to danger. This VR software may ultimately be tailored to provide training in other industries such as the construction agricultural and petroleum industries." Virtual reality for mine safety training.
