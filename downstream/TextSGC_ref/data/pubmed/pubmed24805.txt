In the present study we show for the first time that motor imagery of swallowing which is defined as the mental imagination of a specific motor act without overt movements by muscular activity can be successfully used as mental strategy in a neurofeedback training paradigm. Furthermore we demonstrate its effects on cortical correlates of swallowing function. Therefore N = 20 healthy young adults were trained to voluntarily increase their hemodynamic response in swallowing related brain areas as assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS. During seven training sessions participants received either feedback of concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin oxy-Hb group N = 10 or deoxygenated hemoglobin deoxy-Hb group N = 10 over the inferior frontal gyrus IFG during motor imagery of swallowing. Before and after the training we assessed cortical activation patterns during motor execution and imagery of swallowing. The deoxy-Hb group was able to voluntarily increase deoxy-Hb over the IFG during imagery of swallowing. Furthermore swallowing related cortical activation patterns were more pronounced during motor execution and imagery after the training compared to the pre-test indicating cortical reorganization due to neurofeedback training. The oxy-Hb group could neither control oxy-Hb during neurofeedback training nor showed any cortical changes. Hence successful modulation of deoxy-Hb over swallowing related brain areas led to cortical reorganization and might be useful for future treatments of swallowing dysfunction.
