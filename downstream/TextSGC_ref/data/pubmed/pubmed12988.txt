Automatic detection of arrhythmia is of great significance for early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Traditional feature engineering methods based on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and data representation ability so the traditional research on pattern recognition of arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently with the increase of deep learning technology automatic feature extraction of ECG data based on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the complementary strength between different schemes in this paper we propose an arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation MRR of ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based representations together with hand-crafted features of ECG forms the MRR which is the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed method is 0.9238 which is 1.31% 0.62% 1.18% and 0.6% higher than that of each channel model. From the perspective of architecture this proposed method is highly scalable and can be employed as an example for arrhythmia recognition.
