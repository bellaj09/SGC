Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring impairments. However given the life-long plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying neuronal reorganization. Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be mobilized. Novel technology based neurorehabilitation techniques hold promise to address this issue. Here we describe a Virtual Reality VR based system the Rehabilitation Gaming System RGS that is based on a number of hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recovery the structure of training and the role of individualization. We investigate the psychometrics of the RGS in stroke patients and healthy controls. Neurorehabilitation using the virtual reality based Rehabilitation Gaming System: methodology design psychometrics usability and validation.
