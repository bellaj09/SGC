Deep multitask learning for face analysis has received increasing attentions. From literature most existing methods focus on optimizing a main task by jointly learning several auxiliary tasks. It is challenging to consider the performance of each task in a multitask framework due to the following reasons: 1 different face tasks usually rely on different levels of semantic features; 2 each task has different learning convergence rate which could affect the whole performance when joint training; and 3 multitask model needs rich label information for efficient training but existing facial datasets provide limited annotations. To address these issues we propose a task-oriented feature-fused network TFN for simultaneously solving face detection landmark localization and attribute analysis. In this network a task-oriented feature-fused block is designed to learn task-specific feature combinations; then an alternative multitask training scheme is presented to optimize each task with considering of their different learning capacities. We also present a large-scale face dataset called JFA in support of proposed method which provides multivariate labels including face bounding box 68 facial landmarks and 3 attribute labels i.e. apparent age gender and ethnicity. The experimental results suggest that the TFN outperforms several multitask models on the JFA dataset. Furthermore our approach achieves competitive performances on WIDER FACE and 300W dataset and obtains state-of-the-art results for gender recognition on the MORPH II dataset.
