Neuroimaging studies have revealed that insomnia is characterized by aberrant neuronal connectivity in specific brain regions but the topological disruptions in the white matter WM structural connectivity networks remain largely unknown in insomnia. The current study uses diffusion tensor imaging DTI tractography to construct the WM structural networks and graph theory analysis to detect alterations of the brain structural networks. The study participants comprised 30 healthy subjects with insomnia symptoms IS and 62 healthy subjects without IS. Both the two groups showed small-world properties regarding their WM structural connectivity networks. By contrast increased local efficiency and decreased global efficiency were identified in the IS group indicating an insomnia-related shift in topology away from regular networks. In addition the IS group exhibited disrupted nodal topological characteristics in regions involving the fronto-limbic and the default-mode systems. To our knowledge this is the first study to explore the topological organization of WM structural network connectivity in insomnia. More importantly the dysfunctions of large-scale brain systems including the fronto-limbic pathways salience network and default-mode network in insomnia were identified which provides new insights into the insomnia connectome. Topology-based brain network analysis thus could be a potential biomarker for IS.
