"Retrieval of unintelligible speech is a basic need for speech impaired and is under research for several decades. But retrieval of random words from thoughts needs a substantial and consistent approach. This work focuses on the preliminary steps of retrieving vowels from Electroencephalography EEG signals acquired while speaking and imagining of speaking a consonant-vowel-consonant CVC word. The process referred to as Speech imagery is imagining of speaking to oneself silently in the mind. Speech imagery is a form of mental imagery. Brain connectivity estimators such as EEG coherence Partial Directed Coherence Directed Transfer Function and Transfer Entropy have been used to estimate the concurrency and causal dependence direction and strength between different brain regions. From brain connectivity results it has been observed that the left frontal and left temporal electrodes were activated for speech and speech imagery processes. These brain connectivity estimators have been used for training Recurrent Neural Networks RNN and Deep Belief Networks DBN for identifying the vowel from the subjects thought. Though the accuracy level was found to be varying for each vowel while speaking and imagining of speaking the CVC word the overall classification accuracy was found to be 72% while using RNN whereas a classification accuracy of 80% was observed while using DBN. DBN was found to outperform RNN in both the speech and speech imagery processes. Thus the combination of brain connectivity estimators and deep learning techniques appear to be effective in identifying the vowel from EEG signals of subjects thought."
