Individuals with chronic stroke have limited options for hand rehabilitation at home. Here we sought to determine the feasibility and efficacy of home-based MusicGlove therapy. Seventeen participants with moderate hand impairment in the chronic phase of stroke were randomized to 3 wk of home-based exercise with either the MusicGlove or conventional tabletop exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Box and Blocks test score from baseline to 1 mo posttreatment. Both groups significantly improved their Box and Blocks test score but no significant difference was found between groups. The MusicGlove group did exhibit significantly greater improvements than the conventional exercise group in motor activity log quality of movement and amount of use scores 1 mo posttherapy p = 0.007 and p = 0.04 respectively. Participants significantly increased their use of MusicGlove over time completing 466 gripping movements per day on average at study end. MusicGlove therapy was not superior to conventional tabletop exercises for the primary end point but was nevertheless feasible and led to a significantly greater increase in self-reported functional use and quality of movement of the impaired hand than conventional home exercises.
