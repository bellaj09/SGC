Deep networks have been successfully applied to visual tracking by learning a generic representation offline from numerous training images. However the offline training is time-consuming and the learned generic representation may be less discriminative for tracking specific objects. In this paper we present that even without offline training with a large amount of auxiliary data simple two-layer convolutional networks can be powerful enough to learn robust representations for visual tracking. In the first frame we extract a set of normalized patches from the target region as fixed filters which integrate a series of adaptive contextual filters surrounding the target to define a set of feature maps in the subsequent frames. These maps measure similarities between each filter and useful local intensity patterns across the target thereby encoding its local structural information. Furthermore all the maps together form a global representation via which the inner geometric layout of the target is also preserved. A simple soft shrinkage method that suppresses noisy values below an adaptive threshold is employed to de-noise the global representation. Our convolutional networks have a lightweight structure and perform favorably against several state-of-the-art methods on the recent tracking benchmark data set with 50 challenging videos.
