In this paper we develop possible realizations of pseudo-haptic feedback in teleoperation systems based on existing works for pseudo-haptic feedback in virtual reality and the intended applications. We derive four potential factors affecting the performance of haptic feedback calculation operator maximum displacement offset force and scaling factor which are analyzed in three compliance identification experiments. First we analyze the principle usability of pseudo-haptic feedback by comparing information transfer measures for teleoperation and direct interaction. Pseudo-haptic interaction yields well above-chance performance while direct interaction performs almost perfectly. In order to optimize pseudo-haptic feedback in the second study we perform a full-factorial experimental design with 36\xa0subjects performing 6480\xa0trials with 36\xa0different treatments. Information transfer ranges from 0.68\xa0bit to 1.72\xa0bit in a task with a theoretical maximum of 2.6\xa0bit with a predominant effect of the calculation operator and a minor effect of the maximum displacement. In a third study short- and long-term learning effects are analyzed. Learning effects regarding the performance of pseudo-haptic feedback cannot be observed for single-day experiments. Tests over 10 days show a maximum increase in information transfer of 0.8\xa0bit. The results show the feasibility of pseudo-haptic feedback for teleoperation and can be used as design basis for task-specific systems. Pseudo-Haptic Feedback in Teleoperation.
