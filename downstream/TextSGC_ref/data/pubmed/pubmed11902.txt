Computational analysis of cellular appearance and its dynamics is used to investigate physiological properties of cells in biomedical research. In consideration of the great success of deep learning in video analysis we first introduce two-stream convolutional networks ConvNets to automatically learn the biologically meaningful dynamics from raw live-cell videos. However the two-stream ConvNets lack the ability to capture long-range video evolution. Therefore a novel hierarchical pooling strategy is proposed to model the cell dynamics in a whole video which is composed of trajectory pooling for short-term dynamics and rank pooling for long-range ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline effectively captures the spatiotemporal dynamics from the raw live-cell videos and outperforms existing methods on our cell video database.
