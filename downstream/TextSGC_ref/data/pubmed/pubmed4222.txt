Functional constipation FCon is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder FGID; neuroimaging studies have shown brain functional abnormalities in thalamo-cortical regions in patients with FGID. However association between FCon and topological characteristics of brain networks remains largely unknown. We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging RS-fMRI and graph theory approach to investigate functional brain topological organization in 42 patients with FCon and 41 healthy controls HC from perspectives of global regional and modular levels. Results showed patients with FCon had a significantly lower normalized clustering coefficient and small-worldness implying decreased brain functional connectivity. Regions showed altered nodal degree and efficiency mainly located in the thalamus rostral anterior cingulate cortex rACC and supplementary motor area SMA which are involved in somatic/sensory emotional processing and motor-control. For the modular analysis thalamus rACC and SMA had an aberrant within-module nodal degree and nodal efficiency and thalamus-related network exhibited abnormal interaction with the limbic network amygdala and hippocampal gyrus. Nodal degree in the thalamus was negatively correlated with difficulty of defecation and nodal degree in the rACC was negatively correlated with sensation of incomplete evacuation. These findings indicated that FCon was associated with abnormalities in the thalamo-cortical network. Abnormalities in the thalamo-cortical network in patients with functional constipation.
