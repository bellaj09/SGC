"Segmentation of histological images is one of the most crucial tasks for many biomedical analyses involving quantification of certain tissue types such as fibrosis via Massons trichrome staining. However challenges are posed by the high variability and complexity of structural features in such images in addition to imaging artifacts. Further the conventional approach of manual thresholding is labor-intensive and highly sensitive to inter- and intra-image intensity variations. An accurate and robust automated segmentation method is of high interest. We propose and evaluate an elegant convolutional neural network CNN designed for segmentation of histological images particularly those with Massons trichrome stain. The network comprises 11 successive convolutional - rectified linear unit - batch normalization layers. It outperformed state-of-the-art CNNs on a dataset of cardiac histological images labeling fibrosis myocytes and background with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.947. With 100 times fewer only 300000 trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art our CNN is less susceptible to overfitting and is efficient. Additionally it retains image resolution from input to output captures fine-grained details and can be trained end-to-end smoothly. To the best of our knowledge this is the first deep CNN tailored to the problem of concern and may potentially be extended to solve similar segmentation tasks to facilitate investigations into pathology and clinical treatment."
