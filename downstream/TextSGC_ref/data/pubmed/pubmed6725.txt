Thermal Imaging Infrared-Imaging-IRI is a promising new technique for psychophysiological research and application. Unlike traditional physiological measures like skin conductance and heart rate it is uniquely contact-free substantially enhancing its ecological validity. Investigating facial regions and subsequent reliable signal extraction from IRI data is challenging due to head motion artefacts. Exploiting its potential thus depends on advances in analytical methods. Here we developed a novel semi-automated thermal signal extraction method employing deep learning algorithms for facial landmark identification. We applied this method to physiological responses elicited by a sudden auditory stimulus to determine if facial temperature changes induced by a stimulus of a loud sound can be detected. We compared thermal responses with psycho-physiological sensor-based tools of galvanic skin response GSR and electrocardiography ECG. We found that the temperatures of selected facial regions particularly the nose tip significantly decreased after the auditory stimulus. Additionally this response was quite rapid at around 4-5\u2009seconds starting less than 2\u2009seconds following the GSR changes. These results demonstrate that our methodology offers a sensitive and robust tool to capture facial physiological changes with minimal manual intervention and manual pre-processing of signals. Newer methodological developments for reliable temperature extraction promise to boost IRI use as an ecologically-valid technique in social and affective neuroscience. Detecting changes in facial temperature induced by a sudden auditory stimulus based on deep learning-assisted face tracking.
