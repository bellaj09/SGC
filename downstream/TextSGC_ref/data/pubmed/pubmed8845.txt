Using bright-field images of cultured human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes hiPSC-CMs we trained a convolutional neural network CNN a machine learning technique to decide whether the qualities of cell cultures are suitable for experiments. VGG16 an open-source CNN framework resulted in a mean F1 score of 0.89 and judged the cell qualities at a speed of approximately 2000 images per second when run on a commercially available laptop computer equipped with Core i7. Thus CNNs provide a useful platform for the high-throughput quality control of hiPSC-CMs. Deep learning-based quality control of cultured human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
