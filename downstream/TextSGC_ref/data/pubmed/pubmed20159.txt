Motor vehicle crashes are the third-leading cause of death to American children aged 1-5 years. When installed correctly child restraints car seats reduce risk of serious injury and death. However most restraints are installed incorrectly. The current gold standard for correct installation is systematic car seat checks where certified technicians help parents but car seat checks are highly underused due to barriers in access scheduling and resources. Study protocol: a randomised non-inferiority trial using interactive virtual presence to remotely assist parents with child restraint installations.
