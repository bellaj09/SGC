"Problems in social functioning e.g. unemployment social isolation are common in people with a psychotic disorder. Social cognition is a treatment target to improve social functioning as it is a proximal predictor of social functioning. Social Cognition Training SCT improves social cognition but may not generalize enduringly to social functioning perhaps due to insufficient opportunity to practice in daily-life social situations. Using virtual reality VR for SCT could address this problem as VR is customizable accessible and interactive. We will test the effect of a VR SCT DiSCoVR on social cognition and social functioning in a randomized controlled trial RCT." Dynamic Interactive Social Cognition Training in Virtual Reality DiSCoVR for social cognition and social functioning in people with a psychotic disorder: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
