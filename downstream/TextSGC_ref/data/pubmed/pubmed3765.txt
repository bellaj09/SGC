Modified electroconvulsive therapy MECT has been widely applied to help treat schizophrenia patients who are treatment-resistant to pharmaceutical therapy. Although the technique is increasingly prevalent the underlying neural mechanisms have not been well clarified. We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the alteration of global functional connectivity density gFCD in schizophrenia patients undergoing MECT using resting state fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two groups of schizophrenia inpatients were recruited. One group received a four-week MECT together with antipsychotic drugs ECT+Drug n=21; the other group only received antipsychotic drugs Drug n=21. Both groups were compared to a sample of healthy controls HC n=23. fMRI scans were obtained from the schizophrenia patients twice at baseline t1 and after 4-week treatment t2 and from healthy controls at baseline. gFCD was computed using resting state fMRI. Repeated ANCOVA showed a significant interaction effect of grouptime in the schizophrenia patients in left precuneus Pcu ventral medial prefrontal cortex vMPFC and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex dMPFC GRF-corrected P<0.05 which are mainly located within the default mode network DMN. Post-hoc analysis revealed that compared with baseline t1 an increased gFCD was found in the ECT+Drug group in the dMPFC t=3.87 p=0.00095 vMPFC t=3.95 p=0.00079 and left Pcu t=3.33 p=0.0034 but no significant effect was identified in the Drug group. The results suggested that increased global functional connectivity density within the DMN might be one important neural mechanism of MECT in schizophrenia. Increased resting-state global functional connectivity density of default mode network in schizophrenia subjects treated with electroconvulsive therapy.
