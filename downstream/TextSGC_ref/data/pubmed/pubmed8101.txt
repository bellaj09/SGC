Family history FH information including family members side of family of family members i.e. maternal or paternal living status of family members observations diseases of family members etc. is very important in the decision-making process of disorder diagnosis and treatment. However FH information cannot be used directly by computers as it is always embedded in unstructured text in electronic health records EHRs. In order to extract FH information form clinical text there is a need of natural language processing NLP. In the BioCreative/OHNLP2018 challenge there is a task regarding FH extraction i.e. task1 including two subtasks: 1 entity identification identifying family members and their observations diseases mentioned in clinical text; 2 family history extraction extracting side of family of family members living status of family members and observations of family members. For this task we propose a system based on deep joint learning methods to extract FH information. Our system achieves the highest F1- scores of 0.8901 on subtask1 and 0.6359 on subtask2 respectively.
