Three synthetic datasets - of observation size 15000 155000 and 1555000 participants respectively - were created by simulating eleven cardiac and anthropometric variables from nine collection ages of the ALSAPC birth cohort study. The synthetic datasets retain similar data properties to the ALSPAC study data they are simulated from co-variance matrices as well as the mean and variance values of the variables without including the original data itself or disclosing participant information. \xa0In this instance the three synthetic datasets have been utilised in an academia-industry collaboration to build a prototype virtual reality data analysis software but they could have a broader use in method and software development projects where sensitive data cannot be freely shared.
