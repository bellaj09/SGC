Antiphospholipid syndrome APS is an autoimmune condition involving arterial and venous thrombosis. An unusual APS variant catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome CAPS includes rapid multi-organ failure from widespread small vessel thrombosis. Central nervous system complications arise in one-third of CAPS patients. In rare cases CAPS co-manifests with cerebellar hemorrhage presenting a neurosurgical emergency. We present a 65-year-old woman with CAPS-related cerebellar hematoma co-morbid idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura deep vein thrombosis and altered mental status with treatment complicated by thrombocytopenia. The patient suddenly deteriorated secondary to a cerebellar subdural hematoma and underwent decompression and excision of the hematoma. After recovery in the intensive care unit she developed a new spontaneous epidural hematoma requiring additional surgery. Management of these patients is hematologically complex and often requires a multi-disciplinary team of physicians. This patient provides an important learning point for clinicians - consider CAPS when hemorrhage and thrombosis are present. Neurosurgical management for complicated catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
