"The past decade has seen the emergence of rehabilitation treatments using virtual reality environments. One of the advantages in using this technology is the potential to create positive motivation by means of engaging environments and tasks shaped in the form of serious games. In this work we propose a novel Neuro Rehabilitation System for children with movement disorders that is based on serious games in immersive virtual reality with haptic feedback. The system design aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of virtual reality in adapting exercises to the patients needs. We present a feasibility study of the method conducted through an experimental rehabilitation session in a group of 4 children with Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Dyspraxia 4 Typically Developing children and 4 healthy adults. Subjects and patients were able to accomplish the proposed rehabilitation session and average performance of the motor exercises in patients were lower although comparable to healthy subjects. Together with positive comments reported by children after the rehabilitation session results are encouraging for application of the method in a prolonged rehabilitation treatment." Integration of serious games and wearable haptic interfaces for Neuro Rehabilitation of children with movement disorders: A feasibility study.
