Techniques exploiting the sparsity of images in a transform domain are effective for various applications in image and video processing. In particular transform learning methods involve cheap computations and have been demonstrated to perform well in applications such as image denoising and medical image reconstruction. Recently we proposed methods for online learning of sparsifying transforms from streaming signals which enjoy good convergence guarantees and involve lower computational costs than online synthesis dictionary learning. In this paper we apply online transform learning to video denoising. We present a novel framework for online video denoising based on high-dimensional sparsifying transform learning for spatio-temporal patches. The patches are constructed either from corresponding 2D patches in successive frames or using an online block matching technique. The proposed online video denoising requires little memory and offers efficient processing. Numerical experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed video denoising algorithms on multiple video data sets. The proposed methods outperform several related and recent techniques including denoising with 3D DCT prior schemes based on dictionary learning non-local means background separation and deep learning as well as the popular VBM3D and VBM4D.
