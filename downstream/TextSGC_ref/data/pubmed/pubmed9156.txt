Estimation of intrinsic images still remains a challenging task due to weaknesses of ground-truth datasets which either are too small or present non-realistic issues. On the other hand end-to-end deep learning architectures start to achieve interesting results that we believe could be improved if important physical hints were not ignored. In this work we present a twofold framework: a a flexible generation of images overcoming some classical dataset problems such as larger size jointly with coherent lighting appearance; and b a flexible architecture tying physical properties through intrinsic losses. Our proposal is versatile presents low computation time and achieves state-of-the-art results. Deep intrinsic decomposition trained on surreal scenes yet with realistic light effects.
