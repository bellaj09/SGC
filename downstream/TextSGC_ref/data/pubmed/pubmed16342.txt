Direct prediction of protein structure from sequence is a challenging problem. An effective approach is to break it up into independent sub-problems. These sub-problems such as prediction of protein secondary structure can then be solved independently. In a previous study we found that an iterative use of predicted secondary structure and backbone torsion angles can further improve secondary structure and torsion angle prediction. In this study we expand the iterative features to include solvent accessible surface area and backbone angles and dihedrals based on C atoms. By using a deep learning neural network in three iterations we achieved 82% accuracy for secondary structure prediction 0.76 for the correlation coefficient between predicted and actual solvent accessible surface area 19 and 30 for mean absolute errors of backbone  and  angles respectively and 8 and 32 for mean absolute errors of C-based  and  angles respectively for an independent test dataset of 1199 proteins. The accuracy of the method is slightly lower for 72 CASP 11 targets but much higher than those of model structures from current state-of-the-art techniques. This suggests the potentially beneficial use of these predicted properties for model assessment and ranking.
