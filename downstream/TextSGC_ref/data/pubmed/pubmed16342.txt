As the performance of a conventional track and trigger system in a rapid response system has been unsatisfactory we developed and implemented an artificial intelligence for predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest denoted the deep learning-based early warning system. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of an artificial intelligence-based early warning system with that of conventional methods in a real hospital situation. Detecting Patient Deterioration Using Artificial Intelligence in a Rapid Response System.
