Given the dynamic nature of modern surgical education determining factors that may improve the efficiency of laparoscopic training is warranted. The objective of this study was to analyze whether perceptual visuo-spatial or psychomotor aptitude are related to the amount of training required to reach specific performance-based goals on a virtual reality surgical simulator. Sixteen MS4 medical students participated in an elective skills course intended to train laparoscopic skills. All were tested for perceptual visuo-spatial and psychomotor aptitude using previously validated psychological tests. Training involved as many instructor-guided 1-hour sessions as needed to reach performance goals on a custom designed MIST-VR manipulation-diathermy task Mentice AB Gothenberg Sweden. Thirteen subjects reached performance goals by the end of the course. Two were excluded from analysis due to previous experience with the MIST-VR total n = 11. Perceptual ability r = -0.76 P = 0.007 and psychomotor skills r = 0.62 P = 0.04 significantly correlated with the number of trials required. Visuo-spatial ability did not significantly correlate with training duration. The number of trials required to train subjects to performance goals on the MIST-VR manipulation diathermy task is significantly related to perceptual and psychomotor aptitude. Correlation between perceptual visuo-spatial and psychomotor aptitude to duration of training required to reach performance goals on the MIST-VR surgical simulator.
