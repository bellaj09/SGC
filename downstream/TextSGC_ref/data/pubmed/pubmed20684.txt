In the research of non-invasive brain-computer interfaceBCI independent component analysisICA has been considered as a promising method of electroencephalogramEEG preprocessing and feature enhancement. However there have been few investigations and implements about online ICA-BCI system up till now.This paper reports the investigation of the ICA-based motor imagery BCIMIBCI system combining the characteristics of unsupervised learning of ICA and event-related desynchronizationERD related to motor imagery. We constructed a simple and practical method of ICA spatial filter calculation and discriminate criterion of three-type motor imageries in the study. To validate the online performance of proposed algorithms an ICA-MIBCI experimental system was fully established based on Neuro Scan EEG amplifier and VC++ platform. Four subjects participated in the experiment of MIBCI testing and two of them took part in the online experiment. The average classification accuracies of the three-type motor imageries reached 89.78% and 89.89% in the offline and online testing respectively. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produced high classification accuracy and required less time consumption which would have a prospect of cross platform application. Online brain-computer interface system based on independent component analysis.
