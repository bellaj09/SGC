Sequence analysis is arguably a foundation of modern biology. Classic approaches to sequence analysis are based on sequence alignment which is limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data. A dozen of alignment-free approaches have been developed to provide computationally efficient alternatives to alignment-based approaches. However existing methods define sequence similarity based on various heuristics and can only provide rough approximations to alignment distances.
