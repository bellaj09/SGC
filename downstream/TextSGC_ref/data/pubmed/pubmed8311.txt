Although the degree of dispersion in Poincar plots of electroencephalograms EEG termed the Poincar-index detects the depth of anaesthesia the Poincar-index becomes estranged from the bispectral index BIS at lighter anaesthesia levels. The present study introduces Poincar-index20-30\xa0Hz targeting the 20- to 30-Hz frequency as the frequency range reported to contain large electromyogram EMG portions in frontal EEG. We combined Poincar-index20-30\xa0Hz with the conventional Poincar-index0.5-47\xa0Hz using a deep learning technique to adjust to BIS values and examined whether this layered Poincar analysis can provide an index of anaesthesia level like BIS. A total of 83867 datasets of these two Poincar-indices and BIS-monitor-derived parameters were continuously obtained every 3\xa0s from 30 patients throughout general anaesthesia and were randomly divided into 75% for a training dataset and 25% for a test dataset. Two Poincar-indices and two supplemental EEG parameters EMG70-110\xa0Hz suppression ratio in the training dataset were trained in a multi-layer perceptron neural network MLPNN with reference to BIS as supervisor. We then evaluated the trained MLPNN model using the test dataset by comparing the measured BIS mBIS with BIS predicted from the model PredBIS. The relationship between mBIS and PredBIS using the two Poincar-indices showed a tight linear regression equation: mBIS\u2009=\u20091.00\u2009\u2009PredBIS\u2009+\u20090.15 R\u2009=\u20090.87 p\u2009<\u20090.0001 root mean square error RMSE\u2009=\u20097.09 while the relationship between mBIS and PredBIS simply using the original Poincar-index0.5-47\xa0Hz was weaker R\u2009=\u20090.82 p\u2009<\u20090.0001 RMSE\u2009=\u20097.32. This suggests the 20- to 30-Hz hierarchical Poincar analysis has potential to improve on anaesthesia depth monitoring constructed by simple Poincar analysis.
