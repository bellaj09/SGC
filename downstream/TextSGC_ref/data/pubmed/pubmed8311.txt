"Deep brain stimulation DBS is a circuit-oriented treatment for mental disorders. Unfortunately even well-conducted psychiatric DBS clinical trials have yielded inconsistent symptom relief in part because DBS mechanisms of action are unclear. One clue to those mechanisms may lie in the efficacy of ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum VCVS DBS in both major depression MDD and obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. MDD and OCD both involve deficits in cognitive control. Cognitive control depends on prefrontal cortex PFC regions that project into the VCVS. Here we show that VCVS DBS effect is explained in part by enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta 5-8Hz oscillations in both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects clinical outcomes. Our results suggest a possible mechanistic approach to DBS therapy based on tuning stimulation to optimize these neurophysiologic phenomena." Deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule enhances human cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function.
