P300s are one of the most popular and robust control signals for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Fast classifying P300s is vital for the good performance of P300-based BCIs. However due to noisy background electroencephalography EEG environments current P300-based BCI systems need to collect multiple trials for a reliable output which is inefficient. This study compared a recently developed algorithm i.e. discriminative canonical pattern matching DCPM with five traditional classification methodsi.e. linear discriminant analysis LDA stepwise LDA Bayesian LDA shrinkage LDA and spatial-temporal discriminant analysis STDA for the detection of single-trial P300s. Eight subjects participated in the classical P300-speller experiments. Study results showed that the DCPM significantly outperformed the other traditional methods in single-trial P300 classification even with small training samples suggesting the DCPM is a promising classification algorithm for the P300-based BCI. A comparison of classification methods for recognizing single-trial P300 in brain-computer interfaces.
