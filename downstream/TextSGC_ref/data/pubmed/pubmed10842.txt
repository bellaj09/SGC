Evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry is becoming a cornerstone of medical practices by providing the patient of psychiatric disorders with the right medication at the right dose at the right time. In light of recent advances in neuroimaging and multi-omics more and more biomarkers associated with psychiatric diseases and treatment responses are being discovered in precision psychiatry applications by leveraging machine learning and neural network approaches. In this article we focus on the most recent developments for research in precision psychiatry using machine learning deep learning and neural network algorithms together with neuroimaging and multi-omics data. First we describe different machine learning approaches that are employed to assess prediction for diagnosis prognosis and treatment in various precision psychiatry studies. We also survey probable biomarkers that have been identified to be involved in psychiatric diseases and treatment responses. Furthermore we summarize the limitations with respect to the mentioned precision psychiatry studies. Finally we address a discussion of future directions and challenges.
