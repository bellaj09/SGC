Feature extraction is key in understanding and modeling of physiological data. Traditionally hand-crafted features are chosen based on expert knowledge and then used for classification or regression. To determine important features and pick the effective ones to handle a new task may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover the manual process does not scale well with new or large-size tasks. In this work we present a system based on Deep Belief Networks DBNs that can automatically extract features from raw physiological data of 4 channels in an unsupervised fashion and then build 3 classifiers to predict the levels of arousal valance and liking based on the learned features. The classification accuracies are 60.9% 51.2% and 68.4% respectively which are comparable with the results obtained by Gaussian Nave Bayes classifier on the state-of-the-art expert designed features. These results suggest that DBNs can be applied to raw physiological data to effectively learn relevant features and predict emotions. Modeling Physiological Data with Deep Belief Networks.
