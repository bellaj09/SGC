Vascular nursing presents constant challenges. The natural history of vascular disease coupled with the complexity of the patient population provides an environment for constant learning. Providing care to these unique individuals demands a thorough knowledge of vascular anatomy and physiology diagnostic interventions treatment modalities multidisciplinary resources and nursing interventions. This case study explores the multifaceted realm of vascular nursing by examining the hospital course and multidisciplinary plan of care of a 22-year-old man whose hospital course began with a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and progressed to pulmonary embolus phlegmasia cerulea dolens compartment syndrome sepsis arterial thrombosis severe coagulopathy priapism laryngeal bleeding/laryngospasm and subsequent notification of having received a unit of blood from a donor whose human immunodeficiency virus status was later determined to be positive. The intent of this article is not to define a specific means of practice but to share with colleagues the wealth of knowledge that was gained from this experience. Undiagnosed hypercoagulable state: a case study.
