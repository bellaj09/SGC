Maintaining balance is a complex process requiring multisensory processing and coordinated muscle activation. Previous studies have indicated that the cortex is directly involved in balance control but less information is known about cortical flow of signals for balance. We studied source-localized electrocortical effective connectivity dynamics of healthy young subjects 29 subjects: 14 male and 15 female walking and standing with both visual and physical perturbations to their balance. The goal of this study was to quantify differences in group-level corticomuscular connectivity responses to sensorimotor perturbations during walking and standing. We hypothesized that perturbed visual input during balance would transiently decrease connectivity between occipital and parietal areas due to disruptive visual input during sensory processing. We also hypothesized that physical pull perturbations would increase cortical connections to central sensorimotor areas because of higher sensorimotor integration demands. Our findings show decreased occipito-parietal connectivity during visual rotations and widespread increases in connectivity during pull perturbations focused on central areas as expected. We also found evidence for communication from cortex to muscles during perturbed balance. These results show that sensorimotor perturbations to balance alter cortical networks and can be quantified using effective connectivity estimation.
