Blunted nucleus accumbens NAc reactivity to reward is common across drug users. One theory is that individuals abuse substances due to this reward deficit. However whether there is a relationship between the amount an individual uses and the severity of NAc dysfunction is unclear. It also is possible that such a relationship is substance specific as nicotine transiently increases reward system sensitivity while alcohol another commonly used substance does not. As smokers may use nicotine to bolster NAc reward function we hypothesize that NAc reactivity to reward will be related to volume of cigarette use but not volume of alcohol use.
