The thalamus is the hub through which neural signals are transmitted from the basal ganglia and cerebellum to the neocortex. However thalamocortical axonal activity during motor learning remains largely undescribed. We conducted two-photon calcium imaging of thalamocortical axonal activity in the motor cortex of mice learning a self-initiated lever-pull task. Layer 1 L1 axons came to exhibit activity at lever-pull initiation and termination while layer 3 L3 axons did so at lever-pull initiation. L1 population activity had a sequence structure related to both lever-pull duration and reproducibility. Stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata activated more L1 than L3 axons whereas deep cerebellar nuclei DCN stimulation did the opposite. Lesions to either the dorsal striatum or the DCN impaired motor learning and disrupted temporal dynamics in both\xa0layers. Thus layer-specific thalamocortical signals evolve with the progression of learning which requires both the basal ganglia and cerebellar activities.
