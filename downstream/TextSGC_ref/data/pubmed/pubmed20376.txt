"Previous studies have shown that balls subjected to spin induce large errors in perceptual judgments Craig Berton Rao Fernandez & Bootsma 2006; Craig et al. 2009 due to the additional accelerative force that causes the balls flight path to deviate from a standard parabolic trajectory. A recent review however has suggested that the findings from such experiments may be imprecise due to the decoupling of perception and action and the reliance on the ventral system van der Kamp Rivas van Doorn & Savelsbergh 2008. The aim of this study was to present the same curved free kick trajectory simulations from the perception only studies Craig et al. 2006 2009 but this time allow participants to move to intercept the ball. By using immersive interactive virtual reality technology participants were asked to control the movement of a virtual effector presented in a virtual soccer stadium so that it would make contact with a virtual soccer ball as it crossed the goal-line. As in the perception only studies the direction of spin had a significant effect on the participants responses with significantly fewer balls being intercepted in the spin conditions when compared to no-spin conditions. A significantly higher percentage of movement reversals for the spin conditions served to highlight the link between information specifying ball heading direction and subsequent movement. The coherence of the findings for both the perception and perception/action study are discussed in light of the dual systems model for visual processing."
