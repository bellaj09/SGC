"Video-assisted thoracoscopic VAT procedures are emerging for treatment of both benign and malignant thoracic diseases and substituting classical approaches such as thoracotomies thanks to several advantages concerning postoperative morbidity rates and overall patients outcome i.e. postoperative pain chronic pain and quality of life. However a VAT approach needs an established learning curve making procedures as safe as in open surgery. With regard of trainee surgeons notwithstanding an increasing number of learning tools and strategies such as simulation programs i.e. black-boxes wet labs cadaver or animal labs 3D virtual reality simulators and direct observation both of live surgery and videos with a supportive evidence base from benchtop studies there remains inconsistent adoption in surgical educations."
