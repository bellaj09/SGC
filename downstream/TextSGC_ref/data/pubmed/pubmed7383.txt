3D reconstruction of a targeted area "safe" triangle and Kambin triangle may benefit the viability assessment of transforaminal epidural steroid injection especially at the L5/S1 level. However manual segmentation of lumbosacral nerves for 3D reconstruction is time-consuming. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of deep learning-based segmentation of lumbosacral nerves on CT and the reconstruction of the safe triangle and Kambin triangle. Deep Learning-Based Automatic Segmentation of Lumbosacral Nerves on CT for Spinal Intervention: A Translational Study.
