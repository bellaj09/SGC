Blind source separation BSS is commonly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data analysis. Recently BSS models based on restricted Boltzmann machine RBM one of the building blocks of deep learning models have been shown to improve brain network identification compared to conventional single matrix factorization models such as independent component analysis ICA. These models however trained RBM on fMRI volumes and are hence challenged by model complexity and limited training set. In this article we propose to apply RBM to fMRI time courses instead of volumes for BSS. The proposed method not only interprets fMRI time courses explicitly to take advantages of deep learning models in latent feature learning but also substantially reduces model complexity and increases the scale of training set to improve training efficiency. Our experimental results based on Human Connectome Project HCP datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over ICA and the one that applied RBM to fMRI volumes in identifying task-related components resulted in more accurate and specific representations of task-related activations. Moreover our method separated out components representing intermixed effects between task events which could reflect inherent interactions among functionally connected brain regions. Our study demonstrates the value of RBM in mining complex structures embedded in large-scale fMRI data and its potential as a building block for deeper models in fMRI data analysis.
