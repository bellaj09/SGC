Human functional MRI fMRI research primarily focuses on analyzing data averaged across groups which limits the detail specificity and clinical utility\xa0of fMRI resting-state functional connectivity RSFC and task-activation maps. To push our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of\xa0individual humans we assembled a novel MRI dataset containing 5\xa0hr of RSFC data 6\xa0hr of\xa0task fMRI multiple structural MRIs and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults. Using\xa0these data we generated ten high-fidelity individual-specific\xa0functional connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types\xa0of spatial and organizational variability in brain networks including unique network features and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features. We are\xa0releasing this highly sampled individual-focused dataset as\xa0a resource for neuroscientists and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human brains.
