The worldwide utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities has enabled researchers to analyze a gigantic volume of data to ensure automatic monitoring. An enhanced security system in smart cities schools hospitals and other surveillance domains is mandatory for the detection of violent or abnormal activities to avoid any casualties which could cause social economic and ecological damages. Automatic detection of violence for quick actions is very significant and can efficiently assist the concerned departments. In this paper we propose a triple-staged end-to-end deep learning violence detection framework. First persons are detected in the surveillance video stream using a light-weight convolutional neural network CNN model to reduce and overcome the voluminous processing of useless frames. Second a sequence of 16 frames with detected persons is passed to 3D CNN where the spatiotemporal features of these sequences are extracted and fed to the Softmax classifier. Furthermore we optimized the 3D CNN model using an open visual inference and neural networks optimization toolkit developed by Intel which converts the trained model into intermediate representation and adjusts it for optimal execution at the end platform for the final prediction of violent activity. After detection of a violent activity an alert is transmitted to the nearest police station or security department to take prompt preventive actions. We found that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for different benchmark datasets.
