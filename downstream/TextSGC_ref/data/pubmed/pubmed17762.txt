"Automated perimetry is used for the assessment of visual function in a variety of ophthalmic and neurologic diseases. We report development and clinical testing of a compact head-mounted and eye-tracking perimeter VirtualEye that provides a more comfortable test environment than the standard instrumentation. VirtualEye performs the equivalent of a full threshold 24-2 visual field in two modes: 1 manual with patient response registered with a mouse click and 2 visual grasp where the eye tracker senses change in gaze direction as evidence of target acquisition. 59 patients successfully completed the test in manual mode and 40 in visual grasp mode with 59 undergoing the standard Humphrey field analyzer HFA testing. Large visual field defects were reliably detected by VirtualEye. Point-by-point comparison between the results obtained with the different modalities indicates: 1 minimal systematic differences between measurements taken in visual grasp and manual modes 2 the average standard deviation of the difference distributions of about 5 dB and 3 a systematic shift of 4-6 dB to lower sensitivities for VirtualEye device observed mostly in high dB range. The usability survey suggested patients acceptance of the head-mounted device. The study appears to validate the concepts of a head-mounted perimeter and the visual grasp mode."
