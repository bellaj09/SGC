"Brain computer interfaces BCIs are one of the last communication options for patients in the locked-in state LIS. For complete LIS patients interfaces must be gaze-independent due to their eye impairment. However unimodal gaze-independent approaches typically present levels of performance substantially lower than gaze-dependent approaches. The combination of multimodal stimuli has been pointed as a viable way to increase users performance." Toward a reliable gaze-independent hybrid BCI combining visual and natural auditory stimuli.
