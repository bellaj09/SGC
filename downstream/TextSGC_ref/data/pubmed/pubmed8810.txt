"Supervised learning methods are commonly applied in medical image analysis. However the success of these approaches is highly dependent on the availability of large manually detailed annotated dataset. Thus an automatic refined segmentation of whole-slide image WSI is significant to alleviate the annotation workload of pathologists. But most of the current ways can only output a rough prediction of lesion areas and consume much time in each slide. In this paper we propose a fast and refined cancer regions segmentation framework v3_DCNN which first preselects tumor regions using a classification model Inception-v3 and then employs a semantic segmentation model DCNN for refined segmentation. Our framework can generate a dense likelihood heatmap with the 1/8 side of original WSI in 11.5 minutes on the Camelyon16 dataset which saves more than one hour for each WSI compared with the initial DCNN model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a higher FROC score 83.5% with the champions method of Camelyon16 challenge 80.7%. Based on v3 DCNN model we further automatically produce heatmap of WSI and extract polygons of lesion regions for doctors which is very helpful for their pathological diagnosis detailed annotation and thus contributes to developing a more powerful deep learning model."
