Breast cancer is a collection of multiple tissue pathologies each with a distinct molecular signature that correlates with patient prognosis and response to therapy. Accurately differentiating between breast cancer sub-types is an important part of clinical decision-making. Although this problem has been addressed using machine learning methods in the past there remains unexplained heterogeneity within the established sub-types that cannot be resolved by the commonly used classification algorithms.
