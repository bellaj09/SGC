"Alternative splice site selection is inherently competitive and the probability of a given splice site to be used also depends on the strength of neighboring sites. Here we present a new model named the competitive splice site model COSSMO which explicitly accounts for these competitive effects and predicts the percent selected index PSI distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3 acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5 donor site or the choice of a 5 donor site conditional on a fixed 3 acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers communication layers long short-term memory and residual networks respectively to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model." COSSMO: predicting competitive alternative splice site selection using deep learning.
