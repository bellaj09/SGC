We recently reported that prolonged exposure to the glucocorticoid receptor GR ligand corticosterone impairs decision-making that is dependent on the predictive relationship between an action and its outcome Gourley et al.; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2012. Additionally acute GR blockade when paired with action-outcome conditioning also blocks new learning. We then showed that dendritic spines in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex remodeled under both conditions. Nonetheless the relationship between deep-layer dendritic spines and outcome-based decision-making remains opaque. We report here that a history of prolonged corticosterone exposure increases dendritic spine density in deep-layer prelimbic cortex. When spines are imaged simultaneously with corticosteroid exposure i.e. without a washout period dendritic spine densities are however reduced. Thus the morphological response of deep-layer prelimbic cortical neurons to prolonged corticosteroid exposure may be quite dynamic with spine elimination during a period of chronic exposure and spine proliferation during a subsequent washout period. We provide evidence using a Rho-kinase inhibitor that GR-mediated dendritic spine remodeling is causally related to complex decision-making. Finally we conclude this report with evidence that a history of early-life adolescent GR blockade unlike acute blockade in adulthood enhances subsequent outcome-based decision-making. Together our findings suggest that physiological levels of GR binding enable an organism to learn about the predictive relationship between an action and its outcome but a history of GR blockade may under some circumstances also have beneficial consequences.
