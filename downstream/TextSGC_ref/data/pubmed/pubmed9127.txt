Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons are fundamental elements of cortical circuits and play critical roles in shaping network activity. Dysfunction of interneurons can lead to various brain disorders including epilepsy schizophrenia and anxiety. Based on the electrophysiological properties cell morphology and molecular identity interneurons could be classified into various subgroups. In this study we investigated the density and laminar distribution of different interneuron types and the co-expression of molecular markers in epileptic human cortex. We found that parvalbumin PV and somatostatin SST neurons were distributed in all cortical layers except layer I while tyrosine hydroxylase TH and neuropeptide Y NPY were abundant in the deep layers and white matter. Cholecystokinin CCK neurons showed a high density in layers IV and VI. Neurons with these markers constituted ~7.2% PV 2.6% SST 0.5% TH 0.5% NPY and 4.4% CCK of the gray-matter neuron population. Double- and triple-labeling revealed that NPY neurons were also SST-immunoreactive 97.7% and TH neurons were more likely to express SST 34.2% than PV 14.6%. A subpopulation of CCK neurons 28.0% also expressed PV but none contained SST. Together these results revealed the density and distribution patterns of different interneuron populations and the overlap between molecular markers in epileptic human cortex.
