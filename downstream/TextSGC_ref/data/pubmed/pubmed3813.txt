Cortical surface templates are an important standardized coordinate frame for cortical structure and function analysis in magnetic resonance MR imaging studies. The widely used adult cortical surface templates e.g. fsaverage Conte69 and the HCP-MMP atlas are based on the Caucasian population. Neuroanatomical differences related to environmental and genetic factors between Chinese and Caucasian populations make these templates unideal for analysis of the cortex in the Chinese population. We used a multimodal surface matching algorithm in an iterative procedure to create Chinese sCN200 and Caucasian sUS200 cortical surface atlases based on 200 demographically matched high-quality T1- and T2-weighted T1w and T2w respectively MR images from the Chinese Human Connectome Project CHCP and the Human Connectome Project HCP respectively. Templates for anatomical cortical surfaces white matter pial midthickness and cortical feature maps of sulcal depth curvature thickness T1w/T2w myelin and cortical labels were generated. Using independent subsets from the CHCP and the HCP we quantified the accuracy of cortical registration when using population-matched and mismatched atlases. The performance of the cortical registration and accuracy of curvature alignment when using population-matched atlases was significantly improved thereby demonstrating the importance of using the sCN200 cortical surface atlas for Chinese adult population studies. Finally we analyzed female and male cortical differences within the Chinese and Caucasian populations. We identified significant between-sex differences in cortical curvature sulcal depth thickness and T1w/T2w myelin maps in the frontal temporal parietal occipital and insular lobes as well as the cingulate cortices.
