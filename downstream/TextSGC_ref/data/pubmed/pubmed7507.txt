Noninvasive behavioral tracking of animals during experiments is critical to many scientific pursuits. Extracting the poses of animals without using markers is often essential to measuring behavioral effects in biomechanics genetics ethology and neuroscience. However extracting detailed poses without markers in dynamically changing backgrounds has been challenging. We recently introduced an open-source toolbox called DeepLabCut that builds on a state-of-the-art human pose-estimation algorithm to allow a user to train a deep neural network with limited training data to precisely track user-defined features that match human labeling accuracy. Here we provide an updated toolbox developed as a Python package that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces GUIs performance improvements and active-learning-based network refinement. We provide a step-by-step procedure for using DeepLabCut that guides the user in creating a tailored reusable analysis pipeline with a graphical processing unit GPU in 1-12 h depending on frame size. Additionally we provide Docker environments and Jupyter Notebooks that can be run on cloud resources such as Google Colaboratory. Using DeepLabCut for 3D markerless pose estimation across species and behaviors.
