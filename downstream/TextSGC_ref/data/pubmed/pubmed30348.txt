On page 4507 S. P. Lacour and co-workers present highly conductive and stretchable solid-liquid films that are formed by physical vapor deposition of gallium onto an alloying gold layer. The image shows patterns defined by lift-off on an elastomer membrane. The magnified view is a false-color scanning electron microscopy SEM image 5000 of the surface of the films under 50% applied strain showing the liquid Ga blue-gray flowing between the AuGa2 /Ga clusters gold.
