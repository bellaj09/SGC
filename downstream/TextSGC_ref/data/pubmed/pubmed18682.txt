This study examines the long-term efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT for fear of flying FOF after a catastrophic fear-relevant event the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks. Participants N = 115 were randomly assigned to and completed treatment for FOF using 8 sessions of either virtual reality exposure therapy VRE or standard exposure therapy SE prior to September 11 2001. Individuals were reassessed in June 2002 an average of 2.3 years after treatment with a response rate of 48% n = 55. Analyses were run on the original data and using multiple imputation procedures on imputed data for the full sample. Individuals maintained or improved upon gains made in treatment as measured by standardized FOF questionnaires and by number of flights taken. There were no differences between VRE and SE. Thus results suggest that individuals previously treated for FOF with cognitive-behavioral therapy can maintain treatment gains in the face of a catastrophic fear-relevant event even years after treatment is completed. Cognitive behavior therapy for fear of flying: sustainability of treatment gains after September 11.
