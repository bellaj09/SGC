Working memory WM refers to a set of cognitive processes that allows for the temporary storage and manipulation of information crucial for everyday life skills. WM deficits are present in several neurological psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders thus making the full understanding of its neural correlates a key aspect for the implementation of cognitive training interventions. Here we present a quantitative meta-analysis focusing on the underlying neural substrates upon which the n-back one of the most commonly used tasks for WM assessment is believed to rely on as highlighted by functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography findings. Relevant published work was scrutinized through the activation likelihood estimate ALE statistical framework in order to generate a set of task-specific activation maps according to n-back difficulty. Our results confirm the known involvement of frontoparietal areas across different types of n-back tasks as well as the recruitment of subcortical structures cerebellum and precuneus. Specific activations maps for four stimuli types six presentation modalities three WM loads and their combination are provided and discussed. Moreover functional overlap with resting-state networks highlighted a strong similarity between n-back nodes and the Dorsal Attention Network with less overlap with other networks like Salience Language and Sensorimotor ones. Additionally neural deactivations during n-back tasks and their functional connectivity profile were examined. Clinical and functional implications are discussed in the context of potential noninvasive brain stimulation and cognitive enhancement/rehabilitation programs.
