As a crucial step of biological event extraction event trigger identification has attracted much attention in recent years. Deep representation methods which have the superiorities of less feature engineering and end-to-end training show better performance than statistical methods. While most deep learning methods have been done on sentence-level event extraction there are few works taking document context into account losing potentially informative knowledge that is beneficial for trigger detection. In this paper we propose a variational neural approach for biomedical event extraction which can take advantage of latent topics underlying documents. By adopting a joint modeling manner of topics and events our model is able to produce more meaningful and event-indicative words compare to prior topic models. In addition we introduce a language model embeddings to capture context-dependent features. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms various baselines in a commonly used multi-level event extraction corpus. Topic-informed neural approach for biomedical event extraction.
