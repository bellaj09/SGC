"This articles goal is to outline the motivations progress and future objectives for the development of a state-of-the-art device that allows humans to visualize and feel synthetic objects superimposed on the physical world. The programming flexibility of these devices allows for a variety of scientific questions to be answered in psychology neurophysiology rehabilitation haptics and automatic control. The benefits are most probable in rehabilitation of brain-injured patients for whom the costs are high therapist time is limited and repetitive practice of movements has been shown to be beneficial. Moreover beyond simple therapy that guides strengthens or stretches the technology affords a variety of exciting potential techniques that can combine our knowledge of the nervous system with the tireless precise and swift capabilities of a robot. Because this is a prototype the system will also guide new experimental methods by probing the levels of quality that are necessary for future design cycles and related technology. Very important to the project is the early and intimate involvement of therapists and other clinicians in the design of software and its user interface. Inevitably it should also lead the way to new modes of practice and to the commercialization of haptic/graphic systems." Robotics and virtual reality: a perfect marriage for motor control research and rehabilitation.
