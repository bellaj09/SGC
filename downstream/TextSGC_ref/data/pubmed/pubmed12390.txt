"Vector-borne Chagas disease is endemic to the Americas and imposes significant economic and social burdens on public health. In a previous contribution we presented an automated identification system that was able to discriminate among 12 Mexican and 39 Brazilian triatomine Hemiptera: Reduviidae species from digital images. To explore the same data more deeply using machine-learning approaches hoping for improvements in classification we employed TensorFlow an open-source software platform for a deep learning algorithm. We trained the algorithm based on 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. Our system achieved 83.0 and 86.7% correct identification rates across all Mexican and Brazilian species respectively an improvement over comparable rates from statistical classifiers 80.3 and 83.9% respectively. Incorporating distributional information to reduce numbers of species in analyses improved identification rates to 95.8% for Mexican species and 98.9% for Brazilian species. Given the taxonomic impediment and difficulties in providing entomological expertise necessary to control such diseases automating the identification process offers a potential partial solution to crucial challenges."
