"The current study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity convergent validity and ecological validity of a newly developed virtual reality prospective memory PM task i.e. the Virtual Reality Shopping Task; VRST for use with individuals with traumatic brain injury TBI. Thirty individuals with severe TBI and 24 uninjured adults matched on age gender and education level were administered the VRST a lexical decision PM task LDPMT an index of task-friendliness and a cognitive assessment battery. Significant others rated disruptions in the TBI participants occupational activities interpersonal relationships and independent living skills. The performance of the TBI group was significantly poorer than that of controls on event-based PM as measured by the LDPMT and on time- and event-based PM as measured by the VRST. Performance on the VRST significantly predicted significant others ratings of patients occupational activities and independent living skills. The VRST was rated as significantly more reflective of an everyday activity interesting and was afforded a higher recommendation than the LDPMT. For the TBI group event and total PM performance on the VRST significantly correlated with performance on measures of mental flexibility and verbal fluency and total PM performance correlated with verbal memory. These results provide preliminary but promising evidence of the sensitivity as well as the convergent and ecological validity of the VRST."
