Cognitive deficit is considered to be a characteristic feature of schizophrenia disorder. A similar cognitive dysfunction was demonstrated in animal models of schizophrenia. However the poor comparability of methods used to assess cognition in animals and humans could be responsible for low predictive validity of current animal models. In order to assess spatial abilities in schizophrenia and compare our results with the data obtained in animal models we designed a virtual analog of the Morris water maze MWM the virtual Four Goals Navigation vFGN task. A virtual reality task based on animal research - spatial learning and memory in patients after the first episode of schizophrenia.
