Visual neuroscience experiments and Brain-Computer Interface BCI control often require strict timings in a millisecond scale. As most experiments are performed using a personal computer PC the latencies that are introduced by the setup should be taken into account and be corrected. As a standard computer monitor uses a rastering to update each line of the image sequentially this causes a monitor raster latency which depends on the position on the monitor and the refresh rate. The effect of monitor raster latency on VEPs ERPs and Brain-Computer Interface performance.
