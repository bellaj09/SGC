Thanks to deep convolutional neural networks CNNs Brain Tumor Segmentation BTS has made great progresses while most existing methods are parsed into several stages and cannot be trained end-to-end. In this paper we propose a novel and light noise suppression network ENS-Unet to achieve end-to-end learning without elaborate pre-processing and post-processing. Specifically Slice-based Normalization is first proposed to enhance the model adaptability where the impacts of different data distributions between training and test samples are restrained. Additionally aiming at suppressing noises Noise Suppression U-net NS-Unet is designed to obtain better image representation. Finally to cope with the unbalanced problem of training data Batch-based Loss deriving from the statistical distribution within mini-batch is adopted to adjust the weights of classes. Extensive experiments on BraTS 2013 and 2015 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves very competitive results with the state-of-the-art approaches.
