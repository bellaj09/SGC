The data presented in this article is part of the whole slide imaging WSI datasets generated in European project AIDPATH This data is also related to the research paper entitle "Glomerulosclerosis Identification in Whole Slide Images using Semantic Segmentation" published in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine Journal 1. In that article different methods based on deep learning for glomeruli segmentation and their classification into normal and sclerotic glomerulous are presented and discussed. The raw data used is described and provided here. In addition the detected glomeruli are also provided as individual image files. These data will encourage research on artificial intelligence AI methods create and compare fresh algorithms and measure their usability in quantitative nephropathology. Data for glomeruli characterization in histopathological images.
