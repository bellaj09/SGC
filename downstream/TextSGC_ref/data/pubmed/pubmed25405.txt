"A major difficulty of brain-computer interface BCI technology is dealing with the noise of EEG and its signal variations. Previous works studied time-dependent non-stationarities for BCIs in which the users mental task was independent of the device operation e.g. the mental task was motor imagery and the operational task was a speller. However there are some BCIs such as those based on error-related potentials where the mental and operational tasks are dependent e.g. the mental task is to assess the device action and the operational task is the device action itself. The dependence between the mental task and the device operation could introduce a new source of signal variations when the operational task changes which has not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to analyse task-dependent signal variations and their effect on EEG error-related potentials."
