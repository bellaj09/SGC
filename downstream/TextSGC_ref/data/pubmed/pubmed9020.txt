With the development of artificial intelligence AI technology centered on deep-learning the computer has evolved to a point where it can read a given text and answer a question based on the context of the text. Such a specific task is known as the task of machine comprehension. Existing machine comprehension tasks mostly use datasets of general texts such as news articles or elementary school-level storybooks. However no attempt has been made to determine whether an up-to-date deep learning-based machine comprehension model can also process scientific literature containing expert-level knowledge especially in the biomedical domain.
