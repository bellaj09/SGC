Gaps in colonoscopy skills among endoscopists primarily due to experience have been identified and solutions are critically needed. Hence the development of a real-time robust detection system for colorectal neoplasms is considered to significantly reduce the risk of missed lesions during colonoscopy. Here we develop an artificial intelligence AI system that automatically detects early signs of colorectal cancer during colonoscopy; the AI system shows the sensitivity and specificity are 97.3% 95% confidence interval CI\u2009=\u200995.9%-98.4% and 99.0% 95% CI\u2009=\u200998.6%-99.2% respectively and the area under the curve is 0.975 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.964-0.986 in the validation set. Moreover the sensitivities are 98.0% 95% CI\u2009=\u200996.6%-98.8% in the polypoid subgroup and 93.7% 95% CI\u2009=\u200987.6%-96.9% in the non-polypoid subgroup; To accelerate the detection tensor metrics in the trained model was decomposed and the system can predict cancerous regions 21.9\u2009ms/image on average. These findings suggest that the system is sufficient to support endoscopists in the high detection against non-polypoid lesions which are frequently missed by optical colonoscopy. This AI system can alert endoscopists in real-time to avoid missing abnormalities such as non-polypoid polyps during colonoscopy improving the early detection of this disease. Development of a real-time endoscopic image diagnosis support system using deep learning technology in colonoscopy.
