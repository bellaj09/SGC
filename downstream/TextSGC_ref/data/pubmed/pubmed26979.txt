Bimanual movements involve the interactions between both primary motor cortices. These interactions are assumed to involve phase-locked oscillatory brain activity referred to as inter-hemispheric functional coupling. So far inter-hemispheric functional coupling has been investigated as a function of motor performance. These studies report mostly a negative correlation between the performance in motor tasks and the strength of functional coupling. However correlation might not reflect a causal relationship. To overcome this limitation we opted for an alternative approach by manipulating the strength of inter-hemispheric functional coupling and assessing bimanual motor performance as a dependent variable. We hypothesize that an increase/decrease of functional coupling deteriorates/facilitates motor performance in an out-of-phase bimanual finger-tapping task. Healthy individuals were trained to volitionally regulate functional coupling in an operant conditioning paradigm using real-time magnetoencephalography neurofeedback. During operant conditioning two discriminative stimuli were associated with upregulation and downregulation of functional coupling. Effects of training were assessed by comparing motor performance prior to pre-test and after the training post-test. Participants receiving contingent feedback learned to upregulate and downregulate functional coupling. Comparing motor performance as indexed by the ratio of tapping speed for upregulation versus downregulation trials no change was found in the control group between pre- and post-test. In contrast the group receiving contingent feedback evidenced a significant decrease of the ratio implicating lower tapping speed with stronger functional coupling. Results point toward a causal role of inter-hemispheric functional coupling for the performance in bimanual tasks. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4353-4369 2017.
