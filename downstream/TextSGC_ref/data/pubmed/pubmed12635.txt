Computed tomography CT plays a key role in evaluation of paranasal sinus inflammation but improved and standardized objective assessment is needed. Computerized volumetric analysis has benefits over visual scoring but typically relies on manual image segmentation which is difficult and time consuming limiting practical applicability. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network CNN algorithm can perform automatic volumetric segmentation of the paranasal sinuses on CT enabling efficient objective measurement of sinus opacification. Volumetric assessment of paranasal sinus opacification on computed tomography can be automated using a convolutional neural network.
