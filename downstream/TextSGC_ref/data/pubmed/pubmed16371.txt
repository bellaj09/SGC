For more than a decade advancing computer technologies have allowed incorporation of virtual reality VR into surgical training. This has become especially important in training for laparoscopic procedures which often are complex and leave little room for error. With the advent of robotic surgery and the development and prevalence of a commercial surgical system da Vinci robot; Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvale CA a valid VR-assisted robotic surgery simulator could minimize the steep learning curve associated with many of these complex procedures and thus enable better outcomes. To date such simulation does not exist; however several agencies and corporations are involved in making this dream a reality. We review the history and progress of VR simulation in surgical training its promising applications in robotic-assisted surgery and the remaining challenges to implementation.
