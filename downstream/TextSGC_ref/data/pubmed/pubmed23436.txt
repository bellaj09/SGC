Background: The options for severely disabled children with intact cognition to interact with their environment are extremely limited. A brain computer interface BCI has the potential to allow such persons to gain meaningful function communication and independence. While the pediatric population might benefit most from BCI technology research to date has been predominantly in adults. Methods: In this prospective cross-over study we quantified the ability of healthy school-aged children to perform simple tasks using a basic commercially available EEG-based BCI. Typically developing children aged 6-18 years were recruited from the community. BCI training consisted of a brief set-up and EEG recording while performing specific tasks using an inexpensive commercially available BCI system EMOTIV EPOC. Two tasks were trained driving a remote-control car and moving a computer cursor each using two strategies sensorimotor and visual imagery. Primary outcome was the kappa coefficient between requested and achieved performance. Effects of task strategy age and learning were also explored. Results: Twenty-six of thirty children completed the study mean age 13.2  3.6 years 27% female. Tolerability was excellent with >90% reporting the experience as neutral or pleasant. Older children achieved performance comparable to adult studies but younger age was associated with lesser though still good performance. The car task demonstrated higher performance compared to the cursor task p = 0.027. Thought strategy was also associated with performance with visual imagery strategies outperforming sensorimotor approaches p = 0.031. Conclusion: Children can quickly achieve control and execute multiple tasks using simple EEG-based BCI systems. Performance depends on strategy task and age. Such success in the developing brain mandates exploration of such practical systems in severely disabled children. Evaluating If Children Can Use Simple Brain Computer Interfaces.
