Glioblastoma multiforme treatment is a challenging task in clinical oncology. Convection- enhanced delivery CED is showing encouraging but still suboptimal results due to drug leakages. Numerical models can predict drug distribution within the brain but require retrieving brain physical properties such as the axon diameter distribution ADD through axon architecture analysis. The goal of this work was to provide an automatic accurate and fast method for axon segmentation in electronic microscopy images based on fully convolutional neural network FCNN as to allow automatic ADD computation. FCNN-based axon segmentation for convection-enhanced delivery optimization.
