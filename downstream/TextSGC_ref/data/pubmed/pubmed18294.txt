Background A simulation environment for magnetically-driven active endoscopic capsules Abu-Kheil Y Seneviratne L Dias J A simulation environment for active endoscopic capsules. 2017 IEEE 30th international symposium on Computer Based Medical Systems CBMS Thessaloniki pp 714-719 2017 can perform four main operations: capsule tele- operation tracking of a specific region of interest haptic feedback for capsule navigation and virtual reality navigation.Methods The main operations of the simulation environment can be clinically evaluated. In this paper we proposed a clinical evaluation for the main functions of the simulation environment. There main testing procedures for the navigation strategies are proposed; i vision-based tele-operation ii vision/haptic-based navigation without head control and iii vision/haptic-based navigation with head control. The navigation ways can be compared with each other in terms of introduction time visualization and procedure comfort. Human-subject studies are to be conducted in which 20 students and 12 expert gastroenterologists participated.
