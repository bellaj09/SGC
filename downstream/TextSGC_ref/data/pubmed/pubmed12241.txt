Accurately segmenting organs-at-risk OARs is a key step in the effective planning of radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC treatment. In OAR segmentation of the head and neck CT the low contrast and surrounding adhesion tissues of the parotids thyroids and optic nerves result in the difficulty in segmentation and lower accuracy of automatic segmentation for these organs than the other organs. In this paper we propose a cascaded network structure to delineate these three OARs for NPC radiotherapy by combining deep learning and Boosting algorithm. Boosting-based Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks for the Segmentation of CT Organs-at-risk in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
