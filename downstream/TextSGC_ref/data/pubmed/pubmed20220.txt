Over 5 experiments we test the fictive pass asymmetry hypothesis. Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media we propose that fictional contexts such as reality imagination and virtual environments will mitigate people\s moral condemnation of harm violations more so than purity violations. That is imagining a purely harmful act is given a "fictive pass" in moral judgment whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1 an undergraduate sample N = 250 evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life watching them in films or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3 online participants N = 375 and N = 321 respectively evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life was imagined watched in a film or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 N = 348 used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to and a cause of a poor moral character. Lastly Experiment 5 N = 484 validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. We discuss implications for moral theories of act and character anger and disgust and for media use and regulation. PsycINFO Database Record.
