The analysis and interpretation of physiological signals acquired non-invasively are increasingly important in Smart Health precision medicine and medical research. However this analysis is hampered due to the length complexity and inter-subject variation of these signals and consequently dimensionality reduction and clustering offer substantial benefits. Machine learning used widely in biomedicine is increasingly being applied to physiological time series. Among the applications of unsupervised learning clustering is one of the most important. In this paper an unsupervised autoen-coder architecture deep convolutional embedded clustering is presented as a data-driven approach to study time-frequency characteristics of heart rate variability records. An autoen-coder network is trained on continuous wavelet transforms of heart rate variability signals calculated from publicly-available annotated ECG records with a wide variety of conditions. The latent variables learned by the clustering autoencoder are low-dimensional representations of wavelet transform characteristics that can be visualized and further analyzed. The results indicate that the learned clusters correspond to beat morphologies in the electrocardiogram in many cases but also that the reduced dimensions of the time-frequency features can potentially provide additional insights into cardiac activity and the autonomic nervous system.
