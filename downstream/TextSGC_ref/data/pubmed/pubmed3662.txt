Successful episodic memory involves dynamic increases in activity across distributed hippocampal networks including the posterior-medial PMN and the anterior-temporal ATN networks. We tested whether this up-regulation of functional connectivity during memory processing can be enhanced within hippocampal networks by noninvasive stimulation and whether such task-dependent connectivity enhancement predicts memory improvement. Participants received stimulation targeting the PMN or an out-of-network control location. We compared the effects of stimulation on fMRI connectivity during an autobiographical retrieval task versus during rest within the PMN and the ATN. PMN-targeted stimulation significantly increased connectivity during autobiographical retrieval versus rest within the PMN. This effect was not observed in the ATN or in either network following control stimulation. Task-dependent increases in connectivity within the medial temporal lobe predicted improved performance of a separate episodic memory test. It is therefore possible to enhance the task-dependent regulation of hippocampal network connectivity that supports memory processing using noninvasive stimulation. Stimulating the hippocampal posterior-medial network enhances task-dependent connectivity and memory.
