"For dental students textbooks and lectures provide basic knowledge and simulated and actual clinical training provide learning in technical and communication skills. At our college conservative dentistry is taught in the third and fourth years of a 6-year undergraduate degree. Clinical training is undertaken subsequently in the fifth year and includes cavity preparation and composite resin filling tasks. However despite the clinical importance of a full understanding surrounding these procedures sixth-year students occasionally provide incorrect answers regarding these procedures in assessments. Although they demonstrated a basic understanding of the procedures they may have forgotten the acquired knowledge during their clinical training. Therefore we developed an error-detection examination to evaluate and improve fifth-year students knowledge." Development of an error-detection examination for conservative dentistry education.
