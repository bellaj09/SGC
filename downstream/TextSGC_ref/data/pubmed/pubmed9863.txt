Electronic medical claims EMC database has been successfully used for predicting occurrences of stroke and a variety of other diseases. However inadequate predictive performances have been observed in cases of rare occurrences due to both insufficient training samples and highly imbalanced class distribution. In this work our aim is to improve stroke prediction especially for young age group 25-45 year-old in a large population-based EMC database 552898 subjects. We learn a young stroke predictive deep neural network model using a novel active data augmenter. The augmenter selects the most informative EHR data samples from old age stroke patients. This approach achieves 9.3% and 8.2% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC value improvements compared to training directly with only young age group data and training all age groups data respectively. We further provide analyses on the AUC values obtained as a function of the training data size and the amount and the type of augmented data samples.
