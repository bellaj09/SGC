"Graph theory-based analyses of brain network topology can be used to model the spatiotemporal correlations in neural activity detected through fMRI and such approaches have wide-ranging potential from detection of alterations in preclinical Alzheimers disease through to command identification in brain-machine interfaces. However due to prohibitive computational costs graph-based analyses to date have principally focused on measuring connection density rather than mapping the topological architecture in full by exhaustive shortest-path determination. This paper outlines a solution to this problem through parallel implementation of Dijkstras algorithm in programmable logic. The processor design is optimized for large sparse graphs and provided in full as synthesizable VHDL code. An acceleration factor between 15 and 18 is obtained on a representative resting-state fMRI dataset and maps of Euclidean path length reveal the anticipated heterogeneous cortical involvement in long-range integrative processing. These results enable high-resolution geodesic connectivity mapping for resting-state fMRI in patient populations and real-time geodesic mapping to support identification of imagined actions for fMRI-based brain-machine interfaces."
