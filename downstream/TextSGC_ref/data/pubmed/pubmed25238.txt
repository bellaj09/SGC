A new product prototype system for diagnosing vision and neurological disorders called NeuroDotVR is described herein: this system utilizes a novel wireless NeuroDot brain sensor Versek C et al. J Neural Eng. 2018 Aug; 154:046027 that quantitatively measures visual evoked potentials and fields resulting from custom visual stimuli displayed on a smartphone housed in a virtual reality headset. The NeuroDot brain sensor is unique in that it can be operated both in regular electroencephalography mode as well as a new electric field encephalography mode which yields improvements in signal sensitivity and provides new diagnostic information. Steady state and transient visual evoked potentials and fields using reversing checkerboard stimuli are presented with case studies in amblyopia glaucoma and dark adaptation. These preliminary data sets highlight potential clinical applications that may be pursued in further product development and scientific studies. Portable System for Neuro-Optical Diagnostics Using Virtual Reality Display.
