The neonatal period of a child is considered the most crucial phase of its physical development and future health. As per the World Health Organization India has the highest number of pre-term births 1 with over 3.5 million babies born prematurely and up to 40% of them are babies with low birth weights highly prone to a multitude of diseases such as Jaundice Sepsis Apnea and other Metabolic disorders. Apnea is the primary concern for caretakers of neonates in intensive care units. The real-time medical data is known to be noisy and nonlinear and to address the resultant complexity in classification and prediction of diseases; there is a need for optimizing learning models to maximize predictive performance. Our study attempts to optimize neural network architectures to predict the occurrence of apneic episodes in neonates after the first week of admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit NICU. The primary contribution of this study is the formulation and description of a set of generic steps involved in selecting various model-specific training and hyper-parametric optimization algorithms as well as model architectures for optimal predictive performance on complex and noisy medical datasets.
