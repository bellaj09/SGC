The stressful experiences that have been characteristic of the combat environments in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced significant numbers of returning service members at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder and other psychosocial/behavioral health conditions. This paper describes a set of projects that are expanding the content for inclusion in a newly updated "Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan" Virtual Reality system for the delivery of exposure therapy VRET for PTSD with Service Members and Veterans. In addition to the complete rebuilding of this VRET system using the latest version of the Unity Game Engine the system\s content and functionality has been expanded to now support the use of VRET with combat medics/corpsmen and persons who have experienced military sexual trauma MST. The focus of this paper is to present the rationale and general overview of the progress on these projects that will provide new relevant and customizable options for conducting VRET with a wider range of trauma experiences.
