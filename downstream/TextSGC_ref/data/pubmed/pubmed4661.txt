With resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI there are a variety of post-processing methods that can be used to quantify the human brain connectome. However there is also a choice of which preprocessing steps will be used prior to calculating the functional connectivity of the brain. In this manuscript we have tested seven different preprocessing schemes and assessed the reliability between and reproducibility within the various strategies by means of graph theoretical measures. Different preprocessing schemes were tested on a publicly available dataset which includes rs-fMRI data of healthy controls. The brain was parcellated into 190 nodes and four graph theoretical GT measures were calculated; global efficiency GEFF characteristic path length CPL average clustering coefficient ACC and average local efficiency ALE. Our findings indicate that results can significantly differ based on which preprocessing steps are selected. We also found dependence between motion and GT measurements in most preprocessing strategies. We conclude that by using censoring based on outliers within the functional time-series as a processing results indicate an increase in reliability of GT measurements with a reduction of the dependency of head motion. Evaluating the reliability of different preprocessing steps to estimate graph theoretical measures in resting state fMRI data.
