Brain-computer interfaces are sophisticated signal processing systems which directly operate on neuronal signals to identify specific human intents. These systems can be applied to overcome certain disabilities or to enhance the natural capabilities of human beings. The visual P300 mind-speller is a prominent one among them which has opened up tremendous possibilities in movement and communication applications. Today there exist many state-of-the-art visual P300 mind-speller implementations in the literature as a result of numerous researches in this domain over the past 2 decades. Each of these systems can be evaluated in terms of performance metrics like classification accuracy information transfer rate and processing time. Various classification techniques associated with these systems which include but are not limited to discriminant analysis support vector machine neural network distance-based and ensemble of classifiers have major roles in determining the overall system performances. The significance of a proper review on the recent developments in visual P300 mind-spellers with proper emphasis on their classification algorithms is the key insight for this work. This article is organized with a brief introduction to P300 concepts of visual P300 mind-spellers the survey of literature with special focus on classification algorithms followed by the discussion of various challenges and future directions.
