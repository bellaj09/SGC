Timely determination of antimicrobial susceptibility for a bacterial infection enables precision prescription shortens treatment time and helps minimize the spread of antibiotic resistant infections. Current antimicrobial susceptibility testing AST methods often take several days and thus impede these clinical and health benefits. Here we present an AST method by imaging freely moving bacterial cells in urine in real time and analyzing the videos with a deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm determines if an antibiotic inhibits a bacterial cell by learning multiple phenotypic features of the cell without the need for defining and quantifying each feature. We apply the method to urinary tract infection a common infection that affects millions of people to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of pathogens from human urine specimens spiked with lab strain E. coli ATCC 43888 and an E. coli strain isolated from a clinical urine sample for different antibiotics within 30 min and validate the results with the gold standard broth macrodilution method. The deep learning video microscopy-based AST holds great potential to contribute to the solution of increasing drug-resistant infections.
