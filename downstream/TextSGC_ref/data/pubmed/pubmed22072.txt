"While mechanisms of orienting attention in unilateral spatial neglect USN have frequently been studied in the visual domain these mechanisms remain relatively unexplored in the auditory domain. Our first goal was to replicate Spence and Drivers J Exp Psychol Hum 22:1005-1030 1994 results with a virtual reality paradigm. This paradigm simulated a 3-dimensional auditory space with headphones. Our second aim was to study auditory profiles of orienting attention in USN. In a first experiment 18 healthy participants performed an auditory cueing spatial paradigm either a target-detection task or a target-lateralization task. In a second experiment 14 right-stroke patients 10 with USN and 4 without USN performed these two same tasks. As in Spence and Drivers J Exp Psychol Hum 22:1005-1030 1994 our first experiment showed that spatial representations are not utilized for the detection of auditory stimuli. However during the lateralization task participants were quicker to detect targets preceded by a spatially congruent cue which suggests that our paradigm could be suitable for studying orienting attention in hearing. Our second experiment found that patients with USN also needed an explicit spatial task to be sensitive to auditory spatial cueing. In the target-lateralization task they showed effects lateralized only to one side of space whereas patients without USN did not. Although our paradigm needs replications to better understand orienting attention impairments in hearing in USN this study could have implications for the development of clinical tasks that could assess auditory spatial attention in USN syndrome."
