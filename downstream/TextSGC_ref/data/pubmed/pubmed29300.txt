Entrainment in physiological systems can be manifest in cases where phase-coupling synchronization between slow intrinsic oscillations and periodic motor responses or vice versa takes place. To test whether voluntary movement has something in common with entrainment of slow hemodynamic oscillations to motor responses we studied blood pressure BP heart rate beat-to-beat intervals RRI and prefrontal deoxyhemoglobin Hb/HbO2 during 5min of rest 10min of self-paced voluntary movements and 10min of stimulus-paced movements at 10s intervals in 9 subjects. Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of voluntary finger movements. It appeared that these movements occurred at relatively regular intervals of approximately 10s in 5 subjects group A; while 4 subjects showed random or very short inter-movement intervals group B. Two remarkable results were obtained: first the phase coupling COH2 between BP and RRI showed a significant p=0.0061 interaction between activity rest vs. movement and group A vs. B with an increased p=0.0003 coupling in group A. Second the COH2 between BP and Hb oscillations showed a significant p=0.034 interaction between activity and group with a decreased p=0.079 coupling in group B. These results suggest that subjects able to initiate self-paced voluntary movements at relatively regular intervals of 10s show an entrainment potential between physiological oscillations and motor responses. This also provides the first evidence that not only physiological oscillations can be entrained to motor responses but also motor responses voluntary movements can be entrained to slow intrinsic oscillations.
