"Parkinsons disease PD is a degenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system. PD-related alterations in structural and functional neuroimaging have not been fully explored. This study explored multi-modal PD neuroimaging and its application for predicting clinical scores on the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale MDS-UPDRS. Multi-modal imaging that combined 123I-Ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT and diffusion tensor imaging DTI were adopted to incorporate complementary brain imaging information. SPECT and DTI images of normal controls NC; n\u2009=\u200945 and PD patients n\u2009=\u200945 were obtained from a database. The specific binding ratio SBR was calculated from SPECT. Tractography was performed using DTI. Group-wise differences between NC and PD patients were quantified using SBR of SPECT and structural connectivity of DTI for regions of interest ROIs related to PD. MDS-UPDRS scores were predicted using multi-modal imaging features in a partial least-squares regression framework. Three regions and four connections within the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical circuit were identified using SBR and DTI respectively. Predicted MDS-UPDRS scores using identified regions and connections and actual MDS-UPDRS scores showed a meaningful correlation r\u2009=\u20090.6854 p\u2009<\u20090.001. Our study provided insight on regions and connections that are instrumental in PD." "Imaging analysis of Parkinsons disease patients using SPECT and tractography."
