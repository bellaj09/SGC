Discursive approaches to subjectivity have been critiqued most recently for its dismissal of a living body that moves and senses. While identity as performative has proven invaluable to contemporary cultural theory for its dynamic conceptualization of power in everyday practice the emergence of what some scholars have named an "affective turn" has prompted calls for configuring the body as more than a complex set of significations but also a vibrant energy field in perpetual emergence. Centered on an enacted story created by two clinical therapists and two South Asian immigrant domestic violence survivors during a therapeutic support group session this paper brings the affective turn into dialog with narrative theory. I juxtapose two different readings of this clinical "performance." One interpretation recognizes affect theory\s value for highlighting sensation and the virtual in moments of transformation. Nonetheless I argue it overlooks a lived history. Thus using a specifically dramatistic approach to narrative the second analysis stresses the importance of personal experience and meaning-making in strengthening the link between affect and subjectivity. In doing so the case study also argues for emotion\s critical link to practical and moral experience. The play is now reality: affective turns narrative struggles and theorizing emotion as practical experience.
