"Games are a significant and defining part of human culture and their utility beyond pure entertainment has been demonstrated with so-called serious games. Biotechnology--despite its recent advancements--has had no impact on gaming yet. Here we propose the concept of biotic games i.e. games that operate on biological processes. Utilizing a variety of biological processes we designed and tested a collection of games: Enlightenment Ciliaball PAC-mecium Microbash Biotic Pinball POND PONG PolymerRace and The Prisoners Smellemma. We found that biotic games exhibit unique features compared to existing game modalities such as utilizing biological noise providing a real-life experience rather than virtual reality and integrating the chemical senses into play. Analogous to video games biotic games could have significant conceptual and cost-reducing effects on biotechnology and eventually healthcare; enable volunteers to participate in crowd-sourcing to support medical research; and educate society at large to support personal medical decisions and the public discourse on bio-related issues."
