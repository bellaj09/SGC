Brain-computer interfaces BCIs aimed at restoring communication to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities often use event-related potentials ERPs in scalp-recorded EEG activity. Up to the present most research and development in this area has been done in the laboratory with young healthy control subjects. In order to facilitate the development of BCI most useful to people with disabilities the present study set out to: 1 determine whether people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and healthy age-matched volunteers HVs differ in the speed and accuracy of their ERP-based BCI use; 2 compare the ERP characteristics of these two groups; and 3 identify ERP-related factors that might enable improvement in BCI performance for people with disabilities.
