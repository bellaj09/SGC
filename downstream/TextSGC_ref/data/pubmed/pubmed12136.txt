Computer aided diagnostic CAD has become a significant tool in expanding patient quality-of-life by reducing human errors in diagnosis. CAD can expedite decision-making on complex clinical data automatically. Since brain diseases can be fatal rapid identification of brain pathology to prolong patient life is an important research topic. Many algorithms have been proposed for efficient brain pathology identification BPI over the past decade. Constant refinement of the various image processing algorithms must take place to expand performance of the automatic BPI task. In this paper a systematic survey of contemporary BPI algorithms using brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI is presented. A summarization of recent literature provides investigators with a helpful synopsis of the domain. Furthermore to enhance the performance of BPI future research directions are indicated.
