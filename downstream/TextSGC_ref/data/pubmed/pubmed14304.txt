According to the Industry 4.0 paradigm all objects in a factory including people are equipped with communication capabilities and integrated into cyber-physical systems CPS. Human activity recognition HAR based on wearable sensors provides a method to connect people to CPS. Deep learning has shown surpassing performance in HAR. Data preprocessing is an important part of deep learning projects and takes up a large part of the whole analytical pipeline. Data segmentation and data transformation are two critical steps of data preprocessing. This study analyzes the impact of segmentation methods on deep learning model performance and compares four data transformation approaches. An experiment with HAR based on acceleration data from multiple wearable devices was conducted. The multichannel method which treats the data for the three axes as three overlapped color channels produced the best performance. The highest overall recognition accuracy achieved was 97.20% for eight daily activities based on the data from seven wearable sensors which outperformed most of the other machine learning techniques. Moreover the multichannel approach was applied to three public datasets and produced satisfying results for multi-source acceleration data. The proposed method can help better analyze workers&rsquo; activities and help to integrate people into CPS. Comparison of Data Preprocessing Approaches for Applying Deep Learning to Human Activity Recognition in the Context of Industry 4.0.
