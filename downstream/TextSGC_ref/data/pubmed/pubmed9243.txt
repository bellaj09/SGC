There is tremendous enthusiasm surrounding the potential for machine learning to improve medical prognosis and diagnosis. However there are risks to translating a machine learning model into clinical care and clinical end users are often unaware of the potential harm to patients. This perspective presents the "Model Facts" label a systematic effort to ensure that front-line clinicians actually know how when how not and when not to incorporate model output into clinical decisions. The "Model Facts" label was designed for clinicians who make decisions supported by a machine learning model and its purpose is to collate relevant actionable information in 1-page. Practitioners and regulators must work together to standardize presentation of machine learning model information to clinical end users in order to prevent harm to patients. Efforts to integrate a model into clinical practice should be accompanied by an effort to clearly communicate information about a machine learning model with a "Model Facts" label. Presenting machine learning model information to clinical end users with model facts labels.
