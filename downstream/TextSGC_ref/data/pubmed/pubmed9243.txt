As a highly endangered species the giant panda panda has attracted significant attention in the past decades. Considerable efforts have been put on panda conservation and reproduction offering the promising outcome of maintaining the population size of pandas. To evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management strategies recognizing individual pandas is critical. However it remains a challenging task because the existing methods such as traditional tracking method discrimination method based on footprint identification and molecular biology method are invasive inaccurate expensive or challenging to perform. The advances of imaging technologies have led to the wide applications of digital images and videos in panda conservation and management which makes it possible for individual panda recognition in a noninvasive manner by using image-based panda face recognition method.In recent years deep learning has achieved great success in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. For panda face recognition a fully automatic deep learning algorithm which consists of a sequence of deep neural networks DNNs used for panda face detection segmentation alignment and identity prediction is developed in this study. To develop and evaluate the algorithm the largest panda image dataset containing 6441 images from 218 different pandas which is 39.78% of captive pandas in the world is established.The algorithm achieved 96.27% accuracy in panda recognition and 100% accuracy in detection.This study shows that panda faces can be used for panda recognition. It enables the use of the cameras installed in their habitat for monitoring their population and behavior. This noninvasive approach is much more cost-effective than the approaches used in the previous panda surveys.
