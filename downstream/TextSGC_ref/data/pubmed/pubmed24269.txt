Spinal cord injury SCI associates brain reorganization with a loss of cortical representation of paralyzed limbs. This effect is more pronounced in the chronic state which can be reached approximately 6 months after the lesion. As many of the brain-computer interfaces BCI developed to date rely on the user motor activity loss of this activity hinders the application of BCI technology for rehabilitation or motor compensation in these patients. This work is a preliminary study with three quadriplegic patients close to reaching the chronic state addressing two questions: i whether it is still possible to use BCI technology to detect motor intention of the paralyzed hand at this state of chronicity; and ii whether it is better for the BCI decoding to rely on the motor attempt or the motor imagery of the hand as mental paradigm. The results show that one of the three patients had already lost the motor programs related to the hand so it was not possible to build a motor-related BCI for him. For the other patients it was suitable to design a BCI based on both paradigms but the results were better using motor attempt as it has broader activation associated patterns that are easier to recognize. Continuous decoding of motor attempt and motor imagery from EEG activity in spinal cord injury patients.
