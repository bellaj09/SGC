Dispositional optimism is an individual characteristic that plays an important role in human experience. Optimists are people who tend to hold positive expectations for their future. Previous studies have focused on the neural basis of optimism such as task response neural activity and brain structure volume. However the functional connectivity between brain regions of the dispositional optimists are poorly understood. Previous study suggested that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmPFC are associated with individual differences in dispositional optimism but it is unclear whether there are other brain regions that combine with the vmPFC to contribute to dispositional optimism. Thus the present study used the resting-state functional connectivity RSFC approach and set the vmPFC as the seed region to examine if differences in functional brain connectivity between the vmPFC and other brain regions would be associated with individual differences in dispositional optimism. The results found that dispositional optimism was significantly positively correlated with the strength of the RSFC between vmPFC and middle temporal gyrus mTG and negativly correlated with RSFC between vmPFC and inferior frontal gyrus IFG. These findings may be suggested that mTG and IFG which associated with emotion processes and emotion regulation also play an important role in the dispositional optimism.
