"The reward-processing network is implicated in the aetiology of obesity. Several lines of evidence suggest obesity-linked genetic risk loci such as DRD2 and FTO may influence individual variation in body mass index BMI through neuropsychological processes reflected in alterations in activation of the striatum during reward processing. However no study has tested the broader hypotheses that a the relationship between BMI and reward-related brain activation measured through the blood oxygenation-dependent BOLD signal may be observed in a large population study and b the overall genetic architecture of these phenotypes overlap an assumption critical for the progression of imaging genetic studies in obesity research. Using data from the Human Connectome Project N\u2009=\u20091055 healthy young individuals: average BMI\u2009=\u200926.4 we first establish a phenotypic relationship between BMI and ventral striatal VS BOLD during the processing of rewarding monetary stimuli \u2009=\u20090.44 P\u2009=\u20090.013 accounting for potential confounds. BMI and VS BOLD were both significantly influenced by additive genetic factors H2r\u2009=\u20090.57; 0.12 respectively. Further decomposition of this variance suggested that the relationship was driven by shared genetic  g\u2009=\u20090.47 P\u2009=\u20090.011 but not environmental  E\u2009=\u2009-0.07 P\u2009=\u20090.29 factors. To validate the assumption of genetic pleiotropy between BMI and VS BOLD we further show that polygenic risk for higher BMI is also associated with increased VS BOLD response to appetitive stimuli calorically high food images in an independent sample N\u2009=\u200981; P FWE-ROI\u2009<\u20090.005. Together these observations suggest that the genetic factors link risk to obesity to alterations within key nodes of the brains reward circuity. These observations provide a basis for future work exploring the mechanistic role of genetic loci that confer risk for obesity using the imaging genetics approach." Preliminary evidence for genetic overlap between body mass index and striatal reward response.
