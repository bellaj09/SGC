Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of driving errors among patients with left or right hemispheric lesions due to stroke. Subjects and Methods Thirty stroke patients participated in the study. Driving errors were assessed using a virtual reality driving simulator. Results Significant differences were shown in center line crossing frequency accident rate brake reaction time total driving error scores and overall driving safety between participants with left or right hemispheric lesions. Conclusion Driving rehabilitation specialists should consider hemispheric function when teaching driving skills to stroke survivors because patients with lesions in the left or right hemispheres after stroke show differences in driving skills. A comparison of driving errors in patients with left or right hemispheric lesions after stroke.
