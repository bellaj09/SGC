Protein-protein interactionsPPIs engage in dynamic pathological and biological procedures constantly in our life. Thus it is crucial to comprehend the PPIs thoroughly such that we are able to illuminate the disease occurrence achieve the optimal drug-target therapeutic effect and describe the protein complex structures. However compared to the protein sequences obtainable from various species and organisms the number of revealed protein-protein interactions is relatively limited. To address this dilemma lots of research endeavor have investigated in it to facilitate the discovery of novel PPIs. Among these methods PPI prediction techniques that merely rely on protein sequence data are more widespread than other methods which require extensive biological domain knowledge. Multimodal deep representation learning for protein interaction identification and protein family classification.
