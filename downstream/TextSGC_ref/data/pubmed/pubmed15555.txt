Drug combinations are frequently used for the treatment of cancer patients in order to increase efficacy decrease adverse side effects or overcome drug resistance. Given the enormous number of drug combinations it is cost- and time-consuming to screen all possible drug pairs experimentally. Currently it has not been fully explored to integrate multiple networks to predict synergistic drug combinations using recently developed deep learning technologies. In this study we proposed a Graph Convolutional Network GCN model to predict synergistic drug combinations in particular cancer cell lines. Specifically the GCN method used a convolutional neural network model to do heterogeneous graph\xa0embedding and thus solved a link prediction task. The graph in this study was a multimodal graph which was constructed by integrating the drug-drug combination drug-protein interaction and protein-protein interaction networks. We found that the GCN model was able to correctly predict cell line-specific synergistic drug combinations from a large heterogonous network. The majority 30 of the 39 cell line-specific models show an area under the receiver operational characteristic curve AUC larger than 0.80 resulting in a mean AUC of 0.84. Moreover we conducted an in-depth literature survey to investigate the top predicted drug combinations in specific cancer cell lines and found that many of them have been found to show synergistic antitumor activity against the same or other cancers in vitro or in vivo. Taken together the results indicate that our study provides a promising way to better predict and optimize synergistic drug pairs in silico.
