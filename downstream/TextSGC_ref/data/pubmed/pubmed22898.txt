Peri- and post-traumatic factors predict the differential development of stress-associated mental disorders. Prospective designs assessing these risk factors in real-time under controlled experimental conditions can overcome limitations of retrospective designs. Therefore we aimed to investigate multi-sensory experimental analogues of a traumatic experience delivered in Virtual Reality VR or Script-Driven Imagery SDI. Psychophysiological reactivity coping behaviour and intrusive memories upon multisensory Virtual Reality and Script-Driven Imagery analogue trauma: A randomised controlled crossover study.
