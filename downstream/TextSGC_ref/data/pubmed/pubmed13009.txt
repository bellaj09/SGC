Deep learning is one of the most powerful machine learning methods that has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many domains. Since deep learning was introduced to the field of bioinformatics in 2012 it has achieved success in a number of areas such as protein residue-residue contact prediction secondary structure prediction and fold recognition. In this work we developed deep learning methods to improve the prediction of torsion dihedral angles of proteins. Deep learning methods for protein torsion angle prediction.
