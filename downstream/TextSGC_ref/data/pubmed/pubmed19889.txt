One post-stroke patient underwent neuro-motor rehabilitation of one upper limb with a novel system combining a passive robotic device Virtual Reality training applications and high resolution electroencephalography HR-EEG. The outcome of the clinical tests and the evaluation of the kinematic parameters recorded with the robotic device concurred to highlight an improved motor recovery of the impaired limb despite the age of the patient his compromised motor function and the start of rehabilitation at the 3rd week post stroke. The time frequency and functional source analysis of the HR-EEG signals permitted to quantify the functional changes occurring in the brain in association with the rehabilitation motor tasks and to highlight the recovery of the neuro-motor function. Assessing neuro-motor recovery in a stroke survivor with high-resolution EEG robotics and Virtual Reality.
