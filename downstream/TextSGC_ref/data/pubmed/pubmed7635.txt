"Multi-echo saturation recovery sequence can provide redundant information to synthesize multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Traditional synthesis methods such as GEs MAGiC platform employ a model-fitting approach to generate parameter-weighted contrasts. However models over-simplification as well as imperfections in the acquisition can lead to undesirable reconstruction artifacts especially in T2-FLAIR contrast. To improve the image quality in this study a multi-task deep learning model is developed to synthesize multi-contrast neuroimaging jointly using both signal relaxation relationships and spatial information. Compared with previous deep learning-based synthesis the correlation between different destination contrast is utilized to enhance reconstruction quality. To improve model generalizability and evaluate clinical significance the proposed model was trained and tested on a large multi-center dataset including healthy subjects and patients with pathology. Results from both quantitative comparison and clinical reader study demonstrate that the multi-task formulation leads to more efficient and accurate contrast synthesis than previous methods."
