We have developed computer-based clinical case histories incorporating multimedia elements to aid the learning of medicine in a problem-based manner. Topics have been developed in the specialty of Clinical Biochemistry but the approach used is suitable for any branch of clinical medicine. Each topic has material aimed at medical students and also postgraduate candidates for professional examinations. A browser program is also incorporated. Emphasis is made on interaction through the case and modeling of real-life decisions in diagnosis and treatment. Advantages of the program are self-paced learning assessment of understanding feedback and emphasis on deep understanding of the basic physiological and biochemical processes underlying clinical problems. Tutorial software for clinical chemistry incorporating interactive multimedia clinical cases.
