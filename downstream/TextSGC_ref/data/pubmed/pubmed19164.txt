Collaborative researches of three-dimensional molecular modeling can be limited by different time zones and locations. A networked virtual environment can be utilized to overcome the problem caused by the temporal and spatial differences. However traditional approaches did not sufficiently consider integration of different computing environments which were characterized by types of applications roles of users and so on. We propose a collaborative molecular modeling environment to integrate different molecule modeling systems using a virtual tunneling service. We integrated Co-Coot which is a collaborative crystallographic object-oriented toolkit with VRMMS which is a virtual reality molecular modeling system through a collaborative tunneling system. The proposed system showed reliable quantitative and qualitative results through pilot experiments. A collaborative molecular modeling environment using a virtual tunneling service.
