To address the problem of unstable training and poor accuracy in image classification algorithms based on generative adversarial networks GAN a novel sensor network structure for classification processing using auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks ACGAN is proposed in this paper. Firstly the real/fake discrimination of sensor samples in the network has been canceled at the output layer of the discriminative network and only the posterior probability estimation of the sample tag is outputted. Secondly by regarding the real sensor samples as supervised data and the generative sensor samples as labeled fake data we have reconstructed the loss function of the generator and discriminator by using the real/fake attributes of sensor samples and the cross-entropy loss function of the label. Thirdly the pooling and caching method has been introduced into the discriminator to enable more effective extraction of the classification features. Finally feature matching has been added to the discriminative network to ensure the diversity of the generative sensor samples. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm CP-ACGAN achieves better classification accuracy on the MNIST dataset CIFAR10 dataset and CIFAR100 dataset than other solutions. Moreover when compared with the ACGAN and CNN classification algorithms which have the same deep network structure as CP-ACGAN the proposed method continues to achieve better classification effects and stability than other main existing sensor solutions.
