Highly sensitive flexible sensors that can be manufactured with minimum environmental footprint and be seamlessly integrated into wearable devices are required for real-time tracking of complex human movement gestures and health conditions. This study reports on how biodegradation can be used to enhance the sensitivity and electromechanical performance of piezoresistive sensors. Polyglycerol sebacate PGS elastomeric porous sensor was synthesized and blended with multiwall carbon nanotubes MWCNTs and sodium chloride NaCl. Because of their unique porous characteristics a single linear behavior over a large range of pressures 8 kPa and an increase in their sensitivity from 0.12  0.03 kPa-1 up to 8.00  0.20 kPa-1 was achieved after 8 weeks in a simulated body fluid media. They can detect very low pressures 100 Pa with negligible hysteresis reliability long lifetime >200\u202f000 cycles short response time 20 ms and high force sensitivity 4 mN. The characteristics of the developed foam sensors match the sensing characteristics of the human finger to pave the way toward low-footprint wearable devices for applications including human movement and condition monitoring recreation health and wellness virtual reality and tissue engineering.
