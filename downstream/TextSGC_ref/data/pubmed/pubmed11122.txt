Bleeding events are common and critical and may cause significant morbidity and mortality. High incidences of bleeding events are associated with cardiovascular disease in patients on anticoagulant therapy. Prompt and accurate detection of bleeding events is essential to prevent serious consequences. As bleeding events are often described in clinical notes automatic detection of bleeding events from electronic health record EHR notes may improve drug-safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance.
