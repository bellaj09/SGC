Event-related potential ERP based brain-computer interfaces BCIs employ differences in brain responses to attended and ignored stimuli. When using a tactile ERP-BCI for navigation mapping is required between navigation directions on a visual display and unambiguously corresponding tactile stimuli tactors from a tactile control device: control-display mapping CDM. We investigated the effect of congruent both display and control horizontal or both vertical and incongruent vertical display horizontal control CDMs on task performance the ERP and potential BCI performance. Ten participants attended to a target determined via CDM in a stream of sequentially vibrating tactors. We show that congruent CDM yields best task performance enhanced the P300 and results in increased estimated BCI performance. This suggests a reduced availability of attentional resources when operating an ERP-BCI with incongruent CDM. Additionally we found an enhanced N2 for incongruent CDM which indicates a conflict between visual display and tactile control orientations. Control-display mapping in brain-computer interfaces.
