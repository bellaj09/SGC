For the development of minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces BCIs it is important to accurately localize the area of implantation. Using fMRI we investigated which brain areas are involved in motor imagery. Twelve healthy subjects performed a motor execution and imagery task during separate fMRI and EEG measurements. fMRI results showed that during imagery premotor and parietal areas were most robustly activated in individual subjects but surprisingly no activation was found in the primary motor cortex. EEG results showed that spectral power decreases in contralateral sensorimotor rhythms 8-24 Hz during both movement and imagery. To further verify the involvement of the motor imagery areas found with fMRI one epilepsy patient performed the same task during both fMRI and ECoG recordings. Significant ECoG low 8-24 Hz and high 65-95 Hz frequency power changes were observed selectively on premotor cortex and these co-localized with fMRI. During a subsequent BCI task excellent performance 91% was obtained based on ECoG power changes from the localized premotor area. These results indicate that other areas than the primary motor area may be more reliably activated during motor imagery. Specifically the premotor cortex may be a better area to implant an invasive BCI.
