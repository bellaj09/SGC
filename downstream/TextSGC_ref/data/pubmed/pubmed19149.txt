Mood and anxiety disorders are characterized by altered prefrontal-amygdala function and increased behavioral inhibition BI in response to potential threat. Whether these alterations constitute a vulnerability or a symptom of illness remains unclear. The medial orbitofrontal cortex mOFC is thought to play a central role in estimating probability and cost of threat in turn informing selection of subsequent behaviors. To better understand the behavioral and neural processes that may be associated with risk for psychopathology we used a virtual reality paradigm to examine behavioral and neural responses of psychiatrically healthy adults with familial history of affective disorders during anticipation of unpredictable threat. Recruitment of orbitofrontal cortex during unpredictable threat among adults at risk for affective disorders.
