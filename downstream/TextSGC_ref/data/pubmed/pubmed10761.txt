Deep learning methods utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs have led to dramatic advances in automated understanding of medical images. However in many medical image classification tasks lesions occupy only a few pixels of the image. This results in a significant class imbalance between lesion and background. From recent literature it is known that class imbalance may negatively affect the performance of CNN classification. However very few research exists in the context of lesion detection. In this work we propose a two-stage deep learning framework able to deal with the high class imbalance encountered during training of small lesion detectors. First we train a deep cascade DC of long sequences of decision trees with an algorithm designed to handle unbalanced data that also drastically reduces the number of background samples reaching the final stage. The remaining samples are fed to a CNN whose training benefits from both rebalance and hard mining done by the DC. We evaluated DC-CNN on two severely unbalanced classification problems: microcalcification detection and microaneurysm detection. In both cases DC-CNN outperformed the CNNs trained with commonly used methods for addressing class imbalance such as oversampling undersampling hard mining cost sensitive learning and one-class classification. The DC-CNN was also\u200910x faster than CNN at test time. Addressing class imbalance in deep learning for small lesion detection on medical images.
