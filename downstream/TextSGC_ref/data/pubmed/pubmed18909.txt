The need to develop new methods of surgical training combined with advances in computing has led to the development of sophisticated virtual reality surgical simulators. The PERC Mentortrade mark is designed to train the user in percutaneous renal collecting system access puncture. We evaluated and established face content and construct validation of the simulator in this task. A randomized controlled prospective study validating the acquisition of percutaneous renal collecting system access skills using a computer based hybrid virtual reality surgical simulator: phase I.
