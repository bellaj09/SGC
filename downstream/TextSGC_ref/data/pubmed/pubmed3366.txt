Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures PNES are relatively common occurrences in epilepsy centers. Pathophysiology of PNES is still poorly understood. In this paper the evidence for a neurobiological origin of PNES will be reviewed. Recent evidence suggests altered functional and structural brain connectivity as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism in patients with PNES. Pursuing the concept of connectome in patients with PNES and comparing the findings with healthy individuals may result in a breakthrough in identifying the exact neurobiological origin of PNES. Finding the neurobiological bases and identification of biomarkers of PNES will potentially have important clinical implications in formulating better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for affected patients.
