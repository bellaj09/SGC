"Autism spectrum disorder ASD is exceptionally heterogeneous in both clinical and physiopathological presentations. Clinical variability applies to ASD-specific symptoms and frequent comorbid psychopathology such as emotional lability EL. To date the physiopathological underpinnings of the co-occurrence of EL and ASD are unknown. As a first step we examined within-ASD inter-individual variability of EL and its neuronal correlates using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI. We analyzed R-fMRI data from 58 children diagnosed with ASD 5-12 years in relation to the Conners Parent Rating Scale EL index. We performed both an a priori amygdala region-of-interest ROI analysis and a multivariate unbiased whole-brain data-driven approach. While no significant brain-behavior relationships were identified regarding amygdala intrinsic functional connectivity iFC multivariate whole-brain analyses revealed an extended functional circuitry centered on two regions: middle frontal gyrus MFG and posterior insula PI. Follow-up parametric and nonparametric ROI-analyses of these regions revealed relationships between EL and MFG- and PI-iFC with default salience and visual networks suggesting that higher-order cognitive and somatosensory processes are critical for emotion regulation in ASD. We did not detect evidence of amygdala iFC underpinning EL in ASD. However exploratory whole-brain analyses identified large-scale networks that have been previously reported abnormal in ASD. Future studies should consider EL as a potential source of neuronal heterogeneity in ASD and focus on multinetwork interactions."
