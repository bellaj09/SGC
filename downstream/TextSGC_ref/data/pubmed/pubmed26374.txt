"Techniques using electroencephalography EEG-based brain computer interfaces BCIs have been developed and are eagerly anticipated as novel interfaces for controlling power wheelchairs. In addition to the BCIs smart glass technology has been developed. In our previous study we propose a prototype of an intuitive control system for a power wheelchair; this system comprises a simple EEG recorder smart glass and a microcomputer. Using this system the power wheelchair moves straight ahead when a user concentrates stops when the user blinks and turns left or right when the user tilt his/her neck to the left or right respectively. A / ratio as an indicator of the concentration and blinks are detected from raw EEG waves and the tilting of the neck is detected by acceleration sensors in the smart glass. In this study we proposed a new control system which display the visual feedback of the / ratio on the smart glass to induce users concentration. Our results show that during the experiment the system successfully worked and induced for the / ratio in specific concentrating states."
