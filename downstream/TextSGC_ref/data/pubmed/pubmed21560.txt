The Nintendo Wii Fit may provide an affordable alternative to traditional biofeedback or virtual reality systems for retraining or improving motor function in populations with impaired balance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postural control strategies healthy individuals use to play Wii Fit videogames. Sixteen young adults played 10 trials of Ski Slalom and Soccer Heading respectively. Centre of pressure COP excursion and three-dimensional movement data were acquired to determine variability in medial-lateral COP sway and shoulder-pelvic movement. While there was no difference in medial-lateral COP variability between games during trial 1 there was a significant difference after 10 trials. COP sway increased 59-75 mm for Soccer Heading while it decreased 67-33 mm for Ski Slalom from trial 1 to trial 10. During Ski Slalom participants demonstrated decreased shoulder and pelvic movement combined with increased pelvic-shoulder coupling. Conversely participants demonstrated greater initial shoulder tilt when playing Soccer Heading with no reduction in pelvic rotation and tilt. Participants decreased pelvic and trunk movements when skiing suggesting a greater contribution of lower extremity control while they primarily used a trunk strategy to play Soccer Heading. Assessment of the postural control strategies used to play two Wii Fit videogames.
