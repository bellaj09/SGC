"Wave propagation during locomotory movements of Caenorhabditis elegans is constrained to a single dorso/ventral plane. By contrast the tip of the head snout can make rapid exploratory movements in all directions relative to the body axis. These extra degrees of freedom are probably important for animals to seek and identify desirable passages in the interstices of the three-dimensional matrix of soil particles their usual habitat. The differences in degrees of freedom of movement between snout and body are reflected in the innervation of the musculature. Along the length of the body the two quadrants of dorsal muscle receive common innervation as do the two quadrants of ventral muscle. By contrast muscles in the snout have an octagonal arrangement of innervation. It is likely that the exploratory behaviour of the snout is mediated by octant-specific motor and sensory neurons together with their associated interneurons. The well-defined anatomical structure and neural circuitry of the snout together with behavioural observations should facilitate the implementation of models of the neural basis of exploratory movements which could lead to an understanding of the basis of this relatively complex behaviour a behaviour that has similarities to foraging in some vertebrates.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution."
