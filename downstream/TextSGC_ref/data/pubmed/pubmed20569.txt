"The authors present a method to interconnect the Visualisation Toolkit VTK and Unity. This integration enables them to exploit the visualisation capabilities of VTK with Unitys widespread support of virtual augmented and mixed reality displays and interaction and manipulation devices for the development of medical image applications for virtual environments. The proposed method utilises OpenGL context sharing between Unity and VTK to render VTK objects into the Unity scene via a Unity native plugin. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simple Unity application that performs VTK volume rendering to display thoracic computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance images. Quantitative measurements of the achieved frame rates show that this approach provides over 90 fps using standard hardware which is suitable for current augmented reality/virtual reality display devices."
