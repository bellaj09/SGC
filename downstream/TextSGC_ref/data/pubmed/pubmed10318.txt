"To address the problem of model error and tracking dependence in the process of intelligent vehicle motion planning an intelligent vehicle model transfer trajectory planning method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed which is able to obtain an effective control action sequence directly. Firstly an abstract model of the real environment is extracted. On this basis a deep deterministic policy gradient DDPG and a vehicle dynamic model are adopted to jointly train a reinforcement learning model and to decide the optimal intelligent driving maneuver. Secondly the actual scene is transferred to an equivalent virtual abstract scene using a transfer model. Furthermore the control action and trajectory sequences are calculated according to the trained deep reinforcement learning model. Thirdly the optimal trajectory sequence is selected according to an evaluation function in the real environment. Finally the results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with the problem of intelligent vehicle trajectory planning for continuous input and continuous output. The model transfer method improves the models generalization performance. Compared with traditional trajectory planning the proposed method outputs continuous rotation-angle control sequences. Moreover the lateral control errors are also reduced." Intelligent Land-Vehicle Model Transfer Trajectory Planning Method Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
