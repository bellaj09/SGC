"As educators strive toward improving student learning outcomes many find it difficult to instill their students with a deep understanding of the material the instructors share. One challenge lies in how to provide the material with a meaningful and engaging method that maximizes student understanding and synthesis. By following a simple strategy involving Active Learning across the 3 primary domains of Blooms Taxonomy cognitive affective and psychomotor instructors can dramatically improve the quality of the lesson and help students retain and understand the information. By applying our strategy instructors can engage their students at a deeper level and may even find themselves enjoying the process more." "An active learning approach to Blooms Taxonomy."
