"Patients with advanced Parkinsons disease regularly experience unstable motor states. Objective and reliable monitoring of these fluctuations is an unmet need. We used deep learning to classify motion data from a single wrist-worn IMU sensor recording in unscripted environments. For validation purposes patients were accompanied by a movement disorder expert and their motor state was passively evaluated every minute. We acquired a dataset of 8661\u2009minutes of IMU data from 30 patients with annotations about the motor state OFFON DYSKINETIC based on MDS-UPDRS global bradykinesia item and the AIMS upper limb dyskinesia item. Using a 1-minute window size as an input for a convolutional neural network trained on data from a subset of patients we achieved a three-class balanced accuracy of 0.654 on data from previously unseen subjects. This corresponds to detecting the OFF ON or DYSKINETIC motor state at a sensitivity/specificity of 0.64/0.89 0.67/0.67 and 0.64/0.89 respectively. On average the model outputs were highly correlated with the annotation on a per subject scale r\u2009=\u20090.83/0.84; p\u2009<\u20090.0001 and sustained so for the highly resolved time windows of 1\u2009minute r\u2009=\u20090.64/0.70; p\u2009<\u20090.0001. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of long-term motor-state detection in a free-living setting with deep learning using motion data from a single IMU."
