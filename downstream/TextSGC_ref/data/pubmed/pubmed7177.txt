The classification of the heartbeat type is an essential function in the automatical electrocardiogram ECG analysis algorithm. The guideline of the ANSI/AAMI EC57 defined five types of heartbeat: non-ectopic or paced beat N supraventricular ectopic beat S ventricular ectopic beat V fusion of a ventricular and normal beat F pace beat or fusion of a paced and a normal or beat that cannot be classified Q. In the work a deep neural network based method was proposed to classify these five types of heartbeat. After removing the noise from ECG signals by a low-pass filter the two-lead heartbeat segments with 2-s length were generated on the filtered signals and classified by an adaptive ResNet model. The proposed method was evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database with the patient-specific pattern. The overall accuracy was 98.6% and sensitivity of N S V F were 99.4% 85.4% 96.6% 90.6% respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a good performance and would be useful in the clinic practice.
