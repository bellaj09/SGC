With the recently explosive growth of deep learning automatic modulation recognition has undergone rapid development. Most of the newly proposed methods are dependent on large numbers of labeled samples. We are committed to using fewer labeled samples to perform automatic modulation recognition in the cognitive radio domain. Here a semi-supervised learning method based on adversarial training is proposed which is called signal classifier generative adversarial network. Most of the prior methods based on this technology involve computer vision applications. However we improve the existing network structure of a generative adversarial network by adding the encoder network and a signal spatial transform module allowing our framework to address radio signal processing tasks more efficiently. These two technical improvements effectively avoid nonconvergence and mode collapse problems caused by the complexity of the radio signals. The results of simulations show that compared with well-known deep learning methods our method improves the classification accuracy on a synthetic radio frequency dataset by 0.1% to 12%. In addition we verify the advantages of our method in a semi-supervised scenario and obtain a significant increase in accuracy compared with traditional semi-supervised learning methods.
