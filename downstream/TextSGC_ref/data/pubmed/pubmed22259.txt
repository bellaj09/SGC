Prior studies report that accidents involving intoxicated drivers are more likely to occur during performance of secondary tasks. We studied this phenomenon using a dual-task paradigm involving performance of a visual oddball VO task while driving in an alcohol challenge paradigm. Previous functional MRI fMRI studies of the VO task have shown activation in the anterior cingulate hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Thus we predicted dose-dependent decreases in activation of these areas during VO performance. Effects of alcohol on performance on a distraction task during simulated driving.
