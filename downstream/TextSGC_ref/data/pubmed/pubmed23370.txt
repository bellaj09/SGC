Brain-machine interfaces BMIs translate brain signals into control signals for an external device such as a computer cursor or robotic limb. These signals can be obtained either noninvasively or invasively. Invasive recordings using electrocorticography ECoG or intracortical microelectrodes provide higher bandwidth and more informative signals. Rehabilitative BMIs which aim to drive plasticity in the brain to enhance recovery after brain injury have almost exclusively used non-invasive recordings such electroencephalography EEG or magnetoencephalography MEG which have limited bandwidth and information content. Invasive recordings provide more information and spatiotemporal resolution but do incur risk and thus are not usually investigated in people with stroke or traumatic brain injury TBI. Here in this paper we describe a new BMI paradigm to investigate the use of higher frequency signals in brain-injured subjects without incurring significant risk. We recorded EEG in TBI subjects who required hemicraniectomies removal of a part of the skull. EEG over the hemicraniectomy hEEG contained substantial information in the high gamma frequency range 65-115 Hz. Using this information we decoded continuous finger flexion force with moderate to high accuracy variance accounted for 0.06 to 0.52 which at best approaches that using epidural signals. These results indicate that people with hemicraniectomies can provide a useful resource for developing BMI therapies for the treatment of brain injury.
