"Individuals with autism are often characterized by impairments in communication reciprocal social interaction and explicit expression of their affective states. In conventional techniques a therapist adjusts the intervention paradigm by monitoring the affective state e.g. anxiety of these individuals for effective floor-time-therapy. Conventional techniques though powerful are observation-based and face resource limitations. Technology-assisted systems can provide a quantitative individualized rehabilitation platform. Presently-available systems are designed primarily to chain learning via aspects of ones performance alone restricting individualization. Specifically these systems are not sensitive to ones anxiety. Our presented work seeks to bridge this gap by developing a novel VR-based interactive system with Anxiety-Sensitive adaptive technology. Specifically such a system is capable of objectively identifying and quantifying ones anxiety level from real-time biomarkers along with performance metrics. In turn it can adaptively respond in an individualized manner to foster improved social communication skills. In our present research we have used Virtual Reality VR to design a proof-of-concept application that exposes participants to social tasks of varying challenges. Results of a preliminary usability study indicate the potential of our VR-based Anxiety-Sensitive system to foster improved task performance thereby serving as a potent complementary tool in the hands of therapist."
