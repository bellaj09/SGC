Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs have become more and more popular these last years. Researchers use this technology for several types of applications including attention and workload measures but also for the direct control of objects by the means of BCIs. In this work we present a first multidimensional feature space for EEG-based BCI applications to help practitioners to characterize compare and design systems which use EEG-based BCIs. Our feature space contains 4 axes and 9 sub-axes and consists of 41 options in total as well as their different combinations. We presented the axes of our feature space and we positioned our feature space regarding the existing BCI and HCI taxonomies and we showed how our work integrates the past works and/or complements them. A conceptual space for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.
