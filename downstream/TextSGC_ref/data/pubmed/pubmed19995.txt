Spatial memory is core to wayfinding and everyday memory. Interestingly individuals with schizophrenia using spatial navigation strategies cognitive mapping are impaired whereas those using response-based e.g. single-landmark strategies show relatively intact memory performance. We observed abnormal brain communication in schizophrenia participants who used a spatial strategy during a virtual-reality navigation task particularly between temporal and frontal brain regions. In contrast schizophrenia participants using a response strategy recruited similar brain systems to healthy participants but to a greater extent to support memory performance. These findings highlight that strategy use is an important consideration for understanding memory systems and navigation in schizophrenia.
