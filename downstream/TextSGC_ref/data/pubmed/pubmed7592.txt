Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance outperforming the ordinary methods. Nevertheless these methods are inapplicable for small datasets which are very common in medical problems. To this end we propose a knowledge transfer method between diseases via the Generative Bayesian Prior network. Our approach is compared to a pre-train approach and random initialization and obtains the best results in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient metric for the small subsets of the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 database BRATS2018.
