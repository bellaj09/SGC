"This study investigated the relationship between personality states and driving behavior from a dynamic perspective. A personality baseline was introduced to reflect the drivers trait level and can be used as a basic reference for the dynamic change of personality states. Three kinds of simulated scenarios triggered by pedestrian crossing the street were established using a virtual reality driving simulator. Fifty licensed drivers completed the driving experiments and filled in the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five-Factor Inventory NEO-FFI questionnaire to measure the drivers personality baselines. Key indicators were quantified to characterize the five types of personality states by K-means clustering algorithm. The results indicated that the high-risk situation had a greater impact on the drivers especially for drivers with openness and extroversion. Furthermore for the drivers of extroverted personality the fluctuation of personality states in the high-risk scenario was more pronounced. This paper put forward a novel idea for the analysis of driving behavior and the research results provide a personalized personality database for the selection of different driving modes."
