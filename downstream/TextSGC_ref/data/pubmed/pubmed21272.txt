The loss of hand function can result in severe physical and psychosocial impairment. Thus compensation of a lost hand function using assistive robotics that can be operated in daily life is very desirable. However versatile intuitive and reliable control of assistive robotics is still an unsolved challenge. Here we introduce a novel brain/neural-computer interaction BNCI system that integrates electroencephalography EEG and electrooculography EOG to improve control of assistive robotics in daily life environments. To evaluate the applicability and performance of this hybrid approach five healthy volunteers HV four men average age 26.5  3.8 years and a 34-year-old patient with complete finger paralysis due to a brachial plexus injury BPI used EEG condition 1 and EEG/EOG condition 2 to control grasping motions of a hand exoskeleton. All participants were able to control the BNCI system BNCI control performance HV: 70.24  16.71% BPI: 65.93  24.27% but inclusion of EOG significantly improved performance across all participants HV: 80.65  11.28 BPI: 76.03  18.32%. This suggests that hybrid BNCI systems can achieve substantially better control over assistive devices e.g. a hand exoskeleton than systems using brain signals alone and thus may increase applicability of brain-controlled assistive devices in daily life environments.
