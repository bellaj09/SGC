Background: An increasing lifespan and the resulting change in our expectations of later life stages are dependent on a good health state. This emphasizes the importance of the development of strategies to further strengthen healthy aging. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function. Objective: Here we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential. Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants n = 18 elderly participants n = 18 young controls trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on 2 consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements e.g. speed and number of chasing ghosts additional rules and haptic feedback. Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories. Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time t 874 = 2.97 p < 0.01. The applied game elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly the game-based learning was transferable to simple robot manipulation that resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present smaller overall learning gain and different effects of the wall-crash penalty rule in the elderly group. Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient and relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.
