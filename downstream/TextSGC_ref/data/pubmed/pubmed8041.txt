"Deep kernel learning has been well explored for multi-class classification tasks; however relatively less work is done for one-class classification OCC. OCC needs samples from only one class to train the model. Most recently kernel regularized least squares KRL method-based deep architecture is developed for the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension of this method by embedding minimum variance information within this architecture. This embedding improves the generalization capability of the classifier by reducing the intra-class variance. In contrast to traditional deep learning methods this method can effectively work with small-size datasets. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on 18 benchmark datasets 13 biomedical and 5 other datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed classifier. We compare the results with 16 state-of-the-art one-class classifiers. Further we also test our method for 2 real-world biomedical datasets viz.; detection of Alzheimers disease from structural magnetic resonance imaging data and detection of breast cancer from histopathological images. Proposed method exhibits more than 5% F1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for various biomedical benchmark datasets. This makes it viable for application in biomedical fields where relatively less amount of data is available."
