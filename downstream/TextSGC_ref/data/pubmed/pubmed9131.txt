In this paper we present a novel framework for dermoscopy image recognition via both a deep learning method and a local descriptor encoding strategy. Specifically deep representations of a rescaled dermoscopy image are first extracted via a very deep residual neural network pretrained on a large natural image dataset. Then these local deep descriptors are aggregated by orderless visual statistic features based on Fisher vector FV encoding to build a global image representation. Finally the FV encoded representations are used to classify melanoma images using a support vector machine with a Chi-squared kernel. Our proposed method is capable of generating more discriminative features to deal with large variations within melanoma classes as well as small variations between melanoma and nonmelanoma classes with limited training data. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show the superiority of our method using the publicly available ISBI 2016 Skin lesion challenge dataset.
