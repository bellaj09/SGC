The advent of robot-assisted laparoscopy RAL is an important innovation which has provided new perspectives for the treatment of endometriosis and particularly of deep infiltrating endometriosis DIE. RAL offers several technical advantages in the treatment of this complex disease such as 3D view tremor filtration and better surgical ergonomics thus improving surgical performances without no increase in surgical time blood loss and intra- or postoperative complications while also reducing the rate of conversion to laparotomy. Additionally thanks to its reduced learning curve compared to conventional laparoscopy CL it facilitates the training of less experienced surgeons. For these reasons DIE might be one of the best indications for RAL in gynecologic surgery. However very few retrospective studies and small cases series and only one randomized clinical trial have been published in this regard. Further randomized control trials comparing CL to RAL for different stages of endometriosis and different procedures performed are warranted in order to be able to define potential benefits of RAL for endometriosis surgery. The role of robotics in the management of endometriosis.
