A distorted body representation is a core symptom in eating disorders EDs though its mechanism is unclear. Allocentric lock theory emphasising the role of reference frame processing in body image suggests that ED patients may be blocked to an allocentric representation of their own body stored in long-term memory e.g. my body is fat that is not updated modified by the real-time egocentric perception-driven experience of the physical body. Employing a well-validated virtual reality-based procedure relative to healthy controls ED patients showed deficits in the ability to refer to and update a long-term stored allocentric representation with egocentric perceptual-driven inputs.
