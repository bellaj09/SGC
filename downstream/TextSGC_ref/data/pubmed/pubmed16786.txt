The traditional biomedical image retrieval methods as well as content-based image retrieval CBIR methods originally designed for non-biomedical images either only consider using pixel and low-level features to describe an image or use deep features to describe images but still leave a lot of room for improving both accuracy and efficiency. In this work we propose a new approach which exploits deep learning technology to extract the high-level and compact features from biomedical images. The deep feature extraction process leverages multiple hidden layers to capture substantial feature structures of high-resolution images and represent them at different levels of abstraction leading to an improved performance for indexing and retrieval of biomedical images. A novel biomedical image indexing and retrieval system via deep preference learning.
