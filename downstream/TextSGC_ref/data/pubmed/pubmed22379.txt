EEG-based motor imagery is very useful in brain-computer interface. How to identify the imaging movement is still being researched. Electroencephalography EEG microstates reflect the spatial configuration of quasi-stable electrical potential topographies. Different microstates represent different brain functions. In this paper microstate method was used to process the EEG-based motor imagery to obtain microstate. The single-trial EEG microstate sequences differences between two motor imagery tasks - imagination of left and right hand movement were investigated. The microstate parameters - duration time coverage and occurrence per second as well as the transition probability of the microstate sequences were obtained with spatio-temporal microstate analysis. The results were shown significant differences P\u2009<\u20090.05 with paired t-test between the two tasks. Then these microstate parameters were used as features and a linear support vector machine SVM was utilized to classify the two tasks with mean accuracy 89.17% superior performance compared to the other methods. These indicate that the microstate can be a promising feature to improve the performance of the brain-computer interface classification. Exploring differences between left and right hand motor imagery via spatio-temporal EEG microstate.
