The suitability of the Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML for the communication of scientists via the internet is demonstrated with recent results from computer assisted cancer research: I. Substrate channels in cytochrome P450 enzymes. II. Binding properties of the wild type and mutated p53 tumor suppressor protein. Complex 3D molecular models were used to visualize new insights in the active site access of cytochrome P450 enzymes and in the p53 protein-DNA binding achieved by the use of computational methods. These 3D models of biomolecular systems were transferred into VRML scenarios. Additional implemented features allow users to receive related information interactively. With these examples it is shown that VRML provides an efficient method for scientific information exchange by the use of complex 3D molecular models. Molecular modeling information transfer with VRML: from small molecules to large systems in bioscience.
