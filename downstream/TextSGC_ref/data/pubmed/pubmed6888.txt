Deep learning has shown great potential for curvilinear structure e.g. retinal blood vessels and neurites segmentation as demonstrated by a recent auto-context regression architecture based on filter banks learned by convolutional sparse coding. However learning such filter banks is very time-consuming thus limiting the amount of filters employed and the adaptation to other data sets i.e. slow re-training. We address this limitation by proposing a novel acceleration strategy to speed-up convolutional sparse coding filter learning for curvilinear structure segmentation. Our approach is based on a novel initialisation strategy warm start and therefore it is different from recent methods improving the optimisation itself. Our warm-start strategy is based on carefully designed hand-crafted filters SCIRD-TS modelling appearance properties of curvilinear structures which are then refined by convolutional sparse coding. Experiments on four diverse data sets including retinal blood vessels and neurites suggest that the proposed method reduces significantly the time taken to learn convolutional filter banks i.e. up to -82% compared to conventional initialisation strategies. Remarkably this speed-up does not worsen performance; in fact filters learned with the proposed strategy often achieve a much lower reconstruction error and match or exceed the segmentation performance of random and DCT-based initialisation when used as input to a random forest classifier.
