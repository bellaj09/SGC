Deep learning DL is affecting each and every sphere of public and private lives and becoming a tool for daily use. The power of DL lies in the fact that it tries to imitate the activities of neurons in the neocortex of human brain where the thought process takes place. Therefore like the brain it tries to learn and recognize patterns in the form of digital images. This power is built on the depth of many layers of computing neurons backed by high power processors and graphics processing units GPUs easily available today. In the current scenario we have provided detailed survey of various types of DL systems available today and specifically we have concentrated our efforts on current applications of DL in medical imaging. We have also focused our efforts on explaining the readers the rapid transition of technology from machine learning to DL and have tried our best in reasoning this paradigm shift. Further a detailed analysis of complexities involved in this shift and possible benefits accrued by the users and developers. State-of-the-art review on deep learning in medical imaging.
