Various studies in the brain mapping field have demonstrated that there exist multiple concurrent functional networks that are spatially overlapped and interacting with each other during specific task performance to jointly realize the total brain function. Assessing such spatial overlap patterns of functional networks SOPFNs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI has thus received increasing interest for brain function studies. However there are still two crucial issues to be addressed. First the SOPFNs are assessed over the entire fMRI scan assuming the temporal stationarity while possibly time-dependent dynamics of the SOPFNs is not sufficiently explored. Second the SOPFNs are assessed within individual subjects while group-wise consistency of the SOPFNs is largely unknown.
