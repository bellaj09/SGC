Palpation of soft tissues helps to diagnose varying diseases within the tissues. Using a phantom the current method of training palpation lacks for feedback of the training. Similar to a robot-assisted surgical system a virtual reality VR system could be potential for such training due to its interactive nature. In such a VR system studies revealed the observation that the human perception of objects is insensitive to subtle discrepancies in a simulation. Based upon this observation we propose a real-time viscoelastic model of a breast phantom as soft tissues. The model consists of a surface membrane and an inside gel. We evaluate this model through a comparison with a Finite Element Method FEM model featuring physical parameters and different force contacts. The results show that the model can handle multi vertex force contact on an arbitrary location and yields reasonable accurate deformation compared to the FEM model.
