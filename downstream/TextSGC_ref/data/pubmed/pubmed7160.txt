"Deep learning and analysis of heavy metal concentration are very crucial to our life for it plays an essential role in both environmental and human health. In this paper we developed a new Cu II ions sensor made by all organic material with bending and stretching properties. The new sensor consists of chlorophyll-a extracted from fresh leaves of Common Garcinia plant fiber and with the use of PDMS as a substrate. Fluorescence spectra study shows that chlorophyll-a is significantly much more sensitive to Cu II ions than any other heavy metal ions and the device sensitivity outperforms all the Cu II ions sensors ever reported. The result fully shows the selectivity of chlorophyll-a toward Cu II ions. Bending and stretching tests show that the sensor has an outstanding durability which can be used to develop accompanying applications such as real-time sampling and the analysis of Cu II concentration specified in athletes sweat or patients with brain death and Parkinsons disease."
