"Creating a significant negative impact on both their quality of life and the quality of patient care with an evident economical burden for the healthcare system there is a growing concern over physician burnout. The range of interventions and treatments that have been used to address this problem however appear quite fragmented and lack compelling efficacy. We describe the main factors known to contribute to the development of physician burnout as well as currently available treatments. Studies seem to indicate that both specialisation area as well as personality traits may contribute to the manifestation. The highest risk specialties appear to be critical care physicians emergency physicians oncologists and internal medicine physicians while the highest risk personality attributes are high neuroticism low agreeableness introversion and negative affectivity. In addition being exceedingly enthusiastic about ones work and having high aspirations at work with an idealistic approach also serve as factors which contribute to increased risk of burnout and in particular for those who are new to the occupation."
