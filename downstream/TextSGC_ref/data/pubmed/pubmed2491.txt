The connections linking neurons within and between cerebral cortical areas form a multiscale network for communication. We review recent work relating essential features of cortico-cortical connections such as their existence and laminar origins and terminations to fundamental structural parameters of cortical areas such as their distance similarity in cytoarchitecture defined by lamination or neuronal density and other macroscopic and microscopic structural features. These analyses demonstrate the presence of an architectonic type principle. Across species and cortices the essential features of cortico-cortical connections vary consistently and strongly with the cytoarchitectonic similarity of cortical areas. By contrast in multivariate analyses such relations were not found consistently for distance similarity of cortical thickness or cellular morphology. Gradients of laminar cortical differentiation as reflected in overall neuronal density also correspond to regional variations of cellular features forming a spatially ordered natural axis of concerted architectonic and connectional changes across the cortical sheet. The robustness of findings across mammalian brains allows cross-species predictions of the existence and laminar patterns of projections including estimates for the human brain that are not yet available experimentally. The architectonic type principle integrates cortical connectivity and architecture across scales with implications for computational explorations of cortical physiology and developmental mechanisms. An architectonic type principle integrates macroscopic cortico-cortical connections with intrinsic cortical circuits of the primate brain.
