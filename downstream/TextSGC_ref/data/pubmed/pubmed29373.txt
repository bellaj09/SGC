"The ability to decode an individuals intentions in real time has long been a holy grail of research on human volition. For example a reliable method could be used to improve scientific study of voluntary action by allowing external probe stimuli to be delivered at different moments during development of intention and action. Several Brain Computer Interface applications have used motor imagery of repetitive actions to achieve this goal. These systems are relatively successful but only if the intention is sustained over a period of several seconds; much longer than the timescales identified in psychophysiological studies for normal preparation for voluntary action. We have used a combination of sensorimotor rhythms and motor imagery training to decode intentions in a single-trial cued-response paradigm similar to those used in human and non-human primate motor control research. Decoding accuracy of over 0.83 was achieved with twelve participants. With this approach we could decode intentions to move the left or right hand at sub-second timescales both for instructed choices instructed by an external stimulus and for free choices generated intentionally by the participant. The implications for volition are considered." Decoding intention at sensorimotor timescales.
