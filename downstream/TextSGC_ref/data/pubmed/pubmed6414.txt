Epilepsy is a neurological illness caused by abnormal discharge of brain neurons where epileptic seizure can lead to life-threatening emergencies. By analyzing the encephalogram EEG signals of patients with epilepsy their conditions can be monitored and seizure can be detected and intervened in time. As the identification of effective features in EEG signals is important for accurate seizure detection this paper proposes a multi-view deep feature extraction method in attempt to achieve this goal. The method first uses fast Fourier transform FFT and wavelet packet decomposition WPD to construct the initial multi-view features. Convolutional neural network CNN is then used to automatically learn deep features from the initial multi-view features which reduces the dimensionality and obtain the features with better seizure identification ability. Furthermore the multi-view Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system MV-TSK-FS an interpretable rule-based classifier is used to construct a classification model with strong generalizability based on the deep multi-view features obtained. Experimental studies show that the classification accuracy of the proposed multi-view deep feature extraction method is at least 1% higher than that of common feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis PCA FFT and WPD. The classification accuracy is also at least 4% higher than the average accuracy achieved with single-view deep features. Deep Multi-View Feature Learning for EEG-Based Epileptic Seizure Detection.
