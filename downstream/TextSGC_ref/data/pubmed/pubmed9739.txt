"After decades of basic research with many setbacks artificial intelligence AI has recently obtained significant breakthroughs enabling computer programs to outperform human interpretation of medical images in very specific areas. After this shock wave that probably exceeds the impact of the first AI victory of defeating the world chess champion in 1997 some reflection may be appropriate on the consequences for clinical imaging in rheumatology. In this narrative review a short explanation is given about the various AI techniques including deep learning and how these have been applied to rheumatological imaging focussing on rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis as examples. By discussing the principle limitations of AI and deep learning this review aims to give insight into possible future perspectives of AI applications in rheumatology." Use of artificial intelligence in imaging in rheumatology - current status and future perspectives.
