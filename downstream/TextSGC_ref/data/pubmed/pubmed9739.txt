"Longstanding debate on evidence-based medicine EBM may have reached a critical saturation point. I briefly report on systematic reviews on the recurring themes in the critical literature. In this context some criticisms to EBM are substantial and enduring although convincing arguments to contrast unresolved issues have yet to be produced. Nonetheless few changes have been adopted and conservative attitudes persist in EBM. Despite its success implementation in practice has been inexorably overshadowed leading to paradoxical shortcomings. This controversial scenario offers a formidable occasion to gain needed insight. The aim of this paper is to attempt a comprehensive analysis by reframing a number of key concerns while furnishing pragmatic interdisciplinary solutions for these deep-rooted dilemmas. In the interests of all stakeholders I seek to promote a concerted effort to resolve conflict and build consensus." "Beyond faith-based medicine and EBM."
