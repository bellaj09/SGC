There is growing evidence that cognitive training CT can improve the cognitive functioning of the elderly. CT may be influenced by cultural and linguistic factors but research examining CT programs has mostly been conducted on Western populations. We have developed an innovative electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI CT program that has shown preliminary efficacy in improving cognition in 32 healthy English-speaking elderly adults in Singapore. In this second pilot trial we examine the acceptability safety and preliminary efficacy of our BCI CT program in healthy Chinese-speaking Singaporean elderly. A pilot randomized controlled trial using EEG-based brain-computer interface training for a Chinese-speaking group of healthy elderly.
