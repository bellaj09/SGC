Recent work has demonstrated that human whole-brain functional connectivity patterns measured with fMRI contain information about cognitive abilities including sustained attention. To derive behavioral predictions from connectivity patterns our group developed a connectome-based predictive modeling CPM approach Finn et al. 2015; Rosenberg et al. 2016. Previously using CPM we defined a high-attention network comprising connections positively correlated with performance on a sustained attention task and a low-attention network comprising connections negatively correlated with performance. Validating the networks as generalizable biomarkers of attention models based on network strength at rest predicted attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD symptoms in an independent group of individuals Rosenberg et al. 2016. To investigate whether these networks play a causal role in attention here we examined their strength in healthy adults given methylphenidate Ritalin a common ADHD treatment compared with unmedicated controls. As predicted individuals given methylphenidate showed patterns of connectivity associated with better sustained attention: higher high-attention and lower low-attention network strength than controls. There was significant overlap between the high-attention network and a network with greater strength in the methylphenidate group and between the low-attention network and a network with greater strength in the control group. Network strength also predicted behavior on a stop-signal task such that participants with higher go response rates showed higher high-attention and lower low-attention network strength. These results suggest that methylphenidate acts by modulating functional brain networks related to sustained attention and that changing whole-brain connectivity patterns may help improve attention.
