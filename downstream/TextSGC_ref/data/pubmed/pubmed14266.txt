Compact binary representations of histopa-thology images using hashing methods provide efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for direct visual query in large-scale databases. They can be utilized to measure the probability of the abnormality of the query image based on the retrieved similar cases thereby providing support for medical diagnosis. They also allow for efficient managing of large-scale image databases because of a low storage requirement. However the effectiveness of binary representations heavily relies on the visual descriptors that represent the semantic information in the histopathological images. Traditional approaches with hand-crafted visual descriptors might fail due to significant variations in image appearance. Recently deep learning architectures provide promising solutions to address this problem using effective semantic representations. In this paper we propose a deep convolutional hashing method that can be trained "point-wise" to simultaneously learn both semantic and binary representations of histopathological images. Specifically we propose a convolutional neural network that introduces a latent binary encoding LBE layer for low-dimensional feature embedding to learn binary codes. We design a joint optimization objective function that encourages the network to learn discriminative representations from the label information and reduce the gap between the real-valued low-dimensional embedded features and desired binary values. The binary encoding for new images can be obtained by forward propagating through the network and quantizing the output of the LBE layer. Experimental results on a large-scale histopathological image dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
