"We propose a method for generating the synthetic images of human embryo cells that could later be used for classification analysis and training thus resulting in the creation of new synthetic image datasets for research areas lacking real-world data. Our focus was not only to generate the generic image of a cell such but to make sure that it has all necessary attributes of a real cell image to provide a fully realistic synthetic version. We use human embryo images obtained during cell development processes for training a deep neural network DNN. The proposed algorithm used generative adversarial network GAN to generate one- two- and four-cell stage images. We achieved a misclassification rate of 12.3% for the generated images while the expert evaluation showed the true recognition rate TRR of 80.00% for four-cell images 86.8% for two-cell images and 96.2% for one-cell images. Texture-based comparison using the Haralick features showed that there is no statistically using the Students t-test significant p < 0.01 differences between the real and synthetic embryo images except for the sum of variance for one-cell and four-cell images and variance and sum of average for two-cell images features. The obtained synthetic images can be later adapted to facilitate the development training and evaluation of new algorithms for embryo image processing tasks."
