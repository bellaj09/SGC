We developed a computer-aided diagnosis CADx method for classification between benign nodule primary lung cancer and metastatic lung cancer and evaluated the following: i the usefulness of the deep convolutional neural network DCNN for CADx of the ternary classification compared with a conventional method hand-crafted imaging feature plus machine learning ii the effectiveness of transfer learning and iii the effect of image size as the DCNN input. Among 1240 patients of previously-built database computed tomography images and clinical information of 1236 patients were included. For the conventional method CADx was performed by using rotation-invariant uniform-pattern local binary pattern on three orthogonal planes with a support vector machine. For the DCNN method CADx was evaluated using the VGG-16 convolutional neural network with and without transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization of the DCNN method was performed by random search. The best averaged validation accuracies of CADx were 55.9% 68.0% and 62.4% for the conventional method the DCNN method with transfer learning and the DCNN method without transfer learning respectively. For image size of 56 112 and 224 the best averaged validation accuracy for the DCNN with transfer learning were 60.7% 64.7% and 68.0% respectively. DCNN was better than the conventional method for CADx and the accuracy of DCNN improved when using transfer learning. Also we found that larger image sizes as inputs to DCNN improved the accuracy of lung nodule classification.
