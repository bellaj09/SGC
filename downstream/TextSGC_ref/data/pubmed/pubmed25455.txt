In this work one single Laplacian derivation and a full description of band power values in a broad frequency band are used to detect brisk foot movement execution in the ongoing EEG. Two support vector machines SVM are trained to detect the event-related desynchronization ERD during motor execution and the following beta rebound event-related synchronization ERS independently. Their performance is measured through the simulation of an asynchronous brain switch. ERS true positive rate=0.74+/-0.21 after motor execution is shown to be more stable than ERD true positive rate=0.21+/-0.12. A novel combination of ERD and post-movement ERS is introduced. The SVM outputs are combined with a product rule to merge ERD and ERS detection. For this novel approach the average information transfer rate obtained was 11.19+/-3.61bits/min.
