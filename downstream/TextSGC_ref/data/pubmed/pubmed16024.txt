"Vehicle re-identification re-ID is an area that has received far less attention in the computer vision community than the prevalent person re-ID. Possible reasons for this slow progress are the lack of appropriate research data and the special 3D structure of a vehicle. Previous works have generally focused on some specific views e.g. front; but these methods are less effective in realistic scenarios where vehicles usually appear in arbitrary views to cameras. In this paper we focus on the uncertainty of vehicle viewpoint in re-ID proposing two end-to-end deep architectures: the Spatially Concatenated ConvNet and convolutional neural network CNN-LSTM bi-directional loop. Our models exploit the great advantages of the CNN and long short-term memory LSTM to learn transformations across different viewpoints of vehicles. Thus a multi-view vehicle representation containing all viewpoints information can be inferred from the only one input view and then used for learning to measure distance. To verify our models we also introduce a Toy Car RE-ID data set with images from multiple viewpoints of 200 vehicles. We evaluate our proposed methods on the Toy Car RE-ID data set and the public Multi-View Car VehicleID and VeRi data sets. Experimental results illustrate that our models achieve consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art vehicle re-ID approaches." Vehicle Re-Identification by Deep Hidden Multi-View Inference.
