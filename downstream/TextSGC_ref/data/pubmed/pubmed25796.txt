Can Virtual Reality VR developments in audio navigation for blind persons support therapies for all? Working with Crystal River Engineering we are developing navigable Virtual Reality worlds for blind users using spatialized audio 1 2. All persons however use specialized channels such as: visual aural and kinetic learning senses. Predominantly visual VR worlds and health informatics models from World Wide Webs may be downloaded tailored augmented and delivered to each of these learning senses using VR. We are also testing a proof of concept system with Boston Dynamics which downloads 3-dimensional satellite-derived map models from the World Wide Web and makes them navigable by "feeling" the terrain using haptic tactual or force feedback to your hand robotic interfaces. Ultimately these multi-sensory VR access methods: sight localization by audio and "feeling" of data sets could open up the World Wide Web to individuals with sight impairments. This could also however benefit government businesses universities and elementary education. It could contribute more powerful communications education and medical simulation applications on the World Wide Web. This work is part of government technology transfer to telemedicine elementary education disabilities access to the Web and new Internet access and productivity efforts under Vice President Gore\s National Performance Review. Blind persons navigate in virtual reality VR; hearing and feeling communicates "reality".
