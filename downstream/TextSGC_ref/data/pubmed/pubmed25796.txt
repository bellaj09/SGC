We present here a microfabricated multi-functional neural interface with the ability to selectively apply electrical and chemical stimuli while simultaneously monitoring both electrical and chemical activity in the brain. Such a comprehensive approach is required to understand and treat neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder MDD and to understand the mechanisms underlying treatments such as pharmaceutical therapies and deep brain stimulation DBS. The polymer-based multi-functional neural interface is capable of electrical stimulation and recording targeted drug delivery and electrochemical sensing. A variety of different electrode and fluidic channel arrangements are possible with this fabrication process. Preliminary testing has shown the suitability of these neural interfaces for in vivo electrical stimulation and recording as well as in vitro chemical sensing. Testing of the in vitro drug delivery and combined in vivo functionalities this neural interface are currently underway. Microfabricated polymer-based neural interface for electrical stimulation/recording drug delivery and chemical sensing--development.
