The use of virtual reality VR is associated with several adverse effects including dizziness headache and motion sickness. This study investigates how full-immersion VR games cause changes in static balance with associated adverse effects and whether a fixed or a changing game background is more likely to contribute to such problems. Static balance and adverse effects eye fatigue and dizziness were measured in 15 healthy adults under three conditions: baseline; after a full-immersion virtual reality game PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation VR headset with a fixed background 15\u2009min; and after a full-immersion virtual reality game with a unfixed background 15\u2009min. Static balance was measured with an AMTI force plate while eye fatigue and dizziness were measured with the Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire VRSQ and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire SSQ. It was determined that playing a full-immersion VR game had a negative effect on static balance and produced several adverse effects including eye fatigue and dizziness. Moreover sway velocity and sway length increased significantly in the game with a moving background compared to both the baseline and the game with a fixed background p\u2009<\u20090.05; VRSQ and SSQ were also significantly higher in this case. It is thus preferable from the perspective of reducing adverse effects that only fixed-background full-immersion VR games be used in rehabilitative interventions.
