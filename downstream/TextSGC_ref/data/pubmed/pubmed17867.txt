"Objectives. Despite evidence of self-efficacy and physical functions influences on functional limitations in older adults few studies have examined relationships in the context of complex real-world tasks. The present study tested the roles of self-efficacy and physical function in predicting older adults street-crossing performance in single- and dual-task simulations. Methods. Lower-extremity physical function gait self-efficacy and street-crossing success ratio were assessed in 195 older adults 60-79 years old at baseline of a randomized exercise trial. During the street-crossing task participants walked on a self-propelled treadmill in a virtual reality environment. Participants crossed the street without distraction single-task trials and conversed on a cell phone dual-task trials. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesized associations independent of demographic and clinical covariates. Results. Street-crossing performance was better on single-task trials when compared with dual-task trials. Direct effects of self-efficacy and physical function on success ratio were observed in dual-task trials only. The total effect of self-efficacy was significant in both conditions. The indirect path through physical function was evident in the dual-task condition only. Conclusion. Physical function can predict older adults performance on high fidelity simulations of complex real-world tasks. Perceptions of function i.e. self-efficacy may play an even greater role. The trial is registered with United States National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01472744; Fit & Active Seniors Trial."
