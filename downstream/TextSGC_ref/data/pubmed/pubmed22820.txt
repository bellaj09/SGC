"Affordances have recently been proposed as a guiding principle in perception-action research in sport Fajen Riley & Turvey 2009. In the present study perception of the passability affordance of a gap between two approaching defenders in rugby is explored. A simplified rugby gap closure scenario was created using immersive interactive virtual reality technology where 14 novice participants attacker judged the passability of the gap between two virtual defenders via a perceptual judgment button press task. The scenario was modeled according to tau theory Lee 1976 and a psychophysical function was fitted to the response data. Results revealed that a tau-based informational quantity could account for 82% of the variance in the data. Findings suggest that the passability affordance in this case is defined by this variable and participants were able to use it in order to inform prospective judgments as to passability. These findings contribute to our understanding of affordances and how they may be defined in this particular sporting scenario; however some limitations regarding methodology such as decoupling perception and action are also acknowledged."
