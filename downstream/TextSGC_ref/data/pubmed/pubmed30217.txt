Modeling of consciousness-related phenomena and neuroengineering are fields that are rapidly growing together. We review recent approaches and developments and point out some promising directions of future research: Understanding the dynamics of consciousness states and associated oscillations pathological oscillations as well as their treatment by stimulation neuroprosthetics and brain-computer-interface approaches and stimulation approaches that probe influence and strengthen memory consolidation. In all these fields computational models connect theory neurophysiology and neuroengineering research and pave a way towards medical applications. Sleep neuroengineering and dynamics.
