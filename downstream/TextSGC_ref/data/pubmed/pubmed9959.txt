"We present an atrous convolutional encoder-decoder trained to denoise electron micrographs. It consists of a modified Xception backbone atrous convoltional spatial pyramid pooling module and a multi-stage decoder. Our neural network was trained end-to-end using 512\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f512 micrographs created from a large dataset of high-dose \u202f>\u202f2500 counts per pixel micrographs with added Poisson noise to emulate low-dose \u202f\u202f 300 counts per pixel data. It was then fine-tuned for high dose data 200-2500 counts per pixel. Its performance is benchmarked against bilateral Gaussian median total variation wavelet and Wiener restoration methods with their default parameters. Our network outperforms their best mean squared error and structural similarity index performances by 24.6% and 9.6% for low doses and by 43.7% and 5.5% for high doses. In both cases our networks mean squared error has the lowest variance.
