With the introduction of various advanced deep learning algorithms initiatives for image classification systems have transitioned over from traditional machine learning algorithms e.g. SVM to Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs using deep learning software tools. A prerequisite in applying CNN to real world applications is a system that collects meaningful and useful data. For such purposes Wireless Image Sensor Networks WISNs that are capable of monitoring natural environment phenomena using tiny and low-power cameras on resource-limited embedded devices can be considered as an effective means of data collection. However with limited battery resources sending high-resolution raw images to the backend server is a burdensome task that has direct impact on network lifetime. To address this problem we propose an energy-efficient pre- and post- processing mechanism using image resizing and color quantization that can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred while maintaining the classification accuracy in the CNN at the backend server. We show that if well designed an image in its highly compressed form can be well-classified with a CNN model trained in advance using adequately compressed data. Our evaluation using a real image dataset shows that an embedded device can reduce the amount of transmitted data by 71% while maintaining a classification accuracy of 98%. Under the same conditions this process naturally reduces energy consumption by 71% compared to a WISN that sends the original uncompressed images.
