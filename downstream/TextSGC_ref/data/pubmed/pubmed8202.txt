Incorporating the knowledge encoded in the Unified Medical Language System UMLS in deep learning methods requires learning knowledge embeddings from the knowledge graphs available in UMLS: the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network. In this paper we present a technique using Generative Adversarial Networks GANs for learning UMLS embeddings and showcase their usage in a clinical prediction model. When the UMLS embeddings are available the predictions improve by up to 6.9% absolute F1 score. Adversarial Learning of Knowledge Embeddings for the Unified Medical Language System.
