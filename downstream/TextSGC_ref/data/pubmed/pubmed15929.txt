We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep 3D convolutional encoder networks with shortcut connections and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis MS lesions in magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network that consists of two interconnected pathways a convolutional pathway which learns increasingly more abstract and higher-level image features and a deconvolutional pathway which predicts the final segmentation at the voxel level. The joint training of the feature extraction and prediction pathways allows for the automatic learning of features at different scales that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of image types and segmentation task. In addition shortcut connections between the two pathways allow high- and low-level features to be integrated which enables the segmentation of lesions across a wide range of sizes. We have evaluated our method on two publicly available data sets MICCAI 2008 and ISBI 2015 challenges with the results showing that our method performs comparably to the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods even when only relatively small data sets are available for training. In addition we have compared our method with five freely available and widely used MS lesion segmentation methods EMS LST-LPA LST-LGA Lesion-TOADS and SLS on a large data set from an MS clinical trial. The results show that our method consistently outperforms these other methods across a wide range of lesion sizes.
