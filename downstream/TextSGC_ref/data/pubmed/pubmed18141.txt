Three-dimensional modeling has long been regarded as an ideal application for virtual reality VR but current VR-based 3D modeling tools suffer from two problems that limit creativity and applicability: 1 the lack of control for freehand modeling and 2 the difficulty of starting from scratch. To address these challenges we present Lift-Off an immersive 3D interface for creating complex models with a controlled handcrafted style. Artists start outside of VR with 2D sketches which are then imported and positioned in VR. Then using a VR interface built on top of image processing algorithms 2D curves within the sketches are selected interactively and "lifted" into space to create a 3D scaffolding for the model. Finally artists sweep surfaces along these curves to create 3D models. Evaluations are presented for both long-term users and for novices who each created a 3D sailboat model from the same starting sketch. Qualitative results are positive with the visual style of the resulting models of animals and other organic subjects as well as architectural models matching what is possible with traditional fine art media. In addition quantitative data from logging features built into the software are used to characterize typical tool use and suggest areas for further refinement of the interface.
