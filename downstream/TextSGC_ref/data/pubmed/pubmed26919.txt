Electroencephalogram EEG signals are non-stationary. This could be due to internal fluctuation of brain states such as fatigue frustration etc. This necessitates the development of adaptive brain-computer interfaces BCI whose performance does not deteriorate significantly with the adversary change in the cognitive state. In this paper we put forward an unsupervised adaptive scheme to adapt the feature extractor of motor imagery MI BCIs by tracking the fatigue level of the user. Adaptive feature extraction in EEG-based motor imagery BCI: tracking mental fatigue.
