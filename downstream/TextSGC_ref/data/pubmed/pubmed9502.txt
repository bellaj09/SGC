Accurate surgery duration estimation is necessary for optimal OR planning which plays an important role in patient comfort and safety as well as resource optimization. It is however challenging to preoperatively predict surgery duration since it varies significantly depending on the patient condition surgeon skills and intraoperative situation. In this paper we propose a deep learning pipeline referred to as RSDNet which automatically estimates the remaining surgery duration RSD intraoperatively by using only visual information from laparoscopic videos. The previous state-of-the-art approaches for RSD prediction are dependent on manual annotation whose generation requires expensive expert knowledge and is time-consuming especially considering the numerous types of surgeries performed in a hospital and the large number of laparoscopic videos available. A crucial feature of RSDNet is that it does not depend on any manual annotation during training making it easily scalable to many kinds of surgeries. The generalizability of our approach is demonstrated by testing the pipeline on two large datasets containing different types of surgeries: 120 cholecystectomy and 170 gastric bypass videos. The experimental results also show that the proposed network significantly outperforms a traditional method of estimating RSD without utilizing manual annotation. Further this paper provides a deeper insight into the deep learning network through visualization and interpretation of the features that are automatically learned.
