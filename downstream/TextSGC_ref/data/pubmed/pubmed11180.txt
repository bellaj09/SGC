Traffic sign detection and recognition are crucial in the development of intelligent vehicles. An improved traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm for intelligent vehicles is proposed to address problems such as how easily affected traditional traffic sign detection is by the environment and poor real-time performance of deep learning-based methodologies for traffic sign recognition. Firstly the HSV color space is used for spatial threshold segmentation and traffic signs are effectively detected based on the shape features. Secondly the model is considerably improved on the basis of the classical LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model by using Gabor kernel as the initial convolutional kernel adding the batch normalization processing after the pooling layer and selecting Adam method as the optimizer algorithm. Finally the traffic sign classification and recognition experiments are conducted based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. The favorable prediction and accurate recognition of traffic signs are achieved through the continuous training and testing of the network model. Experimental results show that the accurate recognition rate of traffic signs reaches 99.75% and the average processing time per frame is 5.4 ms. Compared with other algorithms the proposed algorithm has remarkable accuracy and real-time performance strong generalization ability and high training efficiency. The accurate recognition rate and average processing time are markedly improved. This improvement is of considerable importance to reduce the accident rate and enhance the road traffic safety situation providing a strong technical guarantee for the steady development of intelligent vehicle driving assistance.
