Recurrent botulinum toxin BoNT injections are used in the pediatric population for management of spasticity but the procedure is often associated with significant pain and anxiety for patients. Non-pharmacologic treatment alternatives for procedural discomfort are limited. Immersive virtual reality VR has shown efficacy in treatment of procedural discomfort in pediatric patients. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess feasibility and use of treating BoNT procedure-related discomfort in pediatric patients with VR. Decreasing pediatric pain and agitation during botulinum toxin injections for spasticity with virtual reality: Lessons learned from clinical use.
