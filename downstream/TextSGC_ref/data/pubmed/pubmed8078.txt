Single-molecule imaging analysis has been applied to study the dynamics and kinetics of molecular behaviors and interactions in living cells. In spite of its high potential as a technique to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cellular phenomena single-molecule imaging analysis has not been extended to a large scale of molecules in cells due to the low measurement throughput as well as required expertise. To overcome these problems we have automated the imaging processes by using computer operations robotics and artificial intelligence AI. AI is an ideal substitute for expertise to obtain high-quality images for quantitative analysis. Our automated in-cell single-molecule imaging system AiSIS could analyze 1600 cells in 1 day which corresponds to  100-fold higher efficiency than manual analysis. The large-scale analysis revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the molecular behavior which had not been recognized in previous studies. An analysis of the receptor behavior and downstream signaling was accomplished within a significantly reduced time frame and revealed the detailed activation scheme of signal transduction advancing cell biology research. Furthermore by combining the high-throughput analysis with our previous finding that a receptor changes its behavioral dynamics depending on the presence of a ligand/agonist or inhibitor/antagonist we show that AiSIS is applicable to comprehensive pharmacological analysis such as drug screening. This AI-aided automation has wide applications for single-molecule analysis. Large-scale single-molecule imaging aided by artificial intelligence.
