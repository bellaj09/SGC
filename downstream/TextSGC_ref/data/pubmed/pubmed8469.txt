We propose a deep learning computational ghost imaging CGI scheme to achieve sub-Nyquist and high-quality image reconstruction. Unlike the second-order-correlation CGI and compressive-sensing CGI which use lots of illumination patterns and a one-dimensional 1-D light intensity sequence LIS for image reconstruction a deep neural network DAttNet is proposed to restore the target image only using the 1-D LIS. The DAttNet is trained with simulation data and retrieves the target image from experimental data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme can provide high-quality images with a sub-Nyquist sampling ratio and performs better than the conventional and compressive-sensing CGI methods in sub-Nyquist sampling ratio conditions e.g. 5.45%. The proposed scheme has potential practical applications in underwater real-time and dynamic CGI. Sub-Nyquist computational ghost imaging with deep learning.
