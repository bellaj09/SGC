"Error-related potentials ErrP have been recently incorporated in brain-machine interfaces BMIs due to its ability to adapt and correct both the output of the BMI or the behavior of the machine. Most of these applications rely on synchronous tasks with different users evaluations associated to correct and wrong events. Asynchronous detection during the continuous evaluation of the task however has to cope with background noise and an increased number of misdetections common in event-related potential detection. This paper studies a different characteristic that may carry additional information to be exploited by asynchronous ErrP detectors: brain connectivity coherence patterns appearing while the user monitors the continuous operation of a device. The results obtained with five subject revealed the presence of an error potential in an asynchronous reaching task an showed an increase in the coherency within the theta band."
