Virtual slides could replace the conventional microscope. However it can take 60% longer to make a diagnosis with a virtual slide due to the small display size and inadequate user interface of current systems. The aim was to create and test a virtual reality VR microscope using a Powerwall a high-resolution array of 28 computer screens for viewing virtual slides more efficiently. Virtual reality Powerwall versus conventional microscope for viewing pathology slides: an experimental comparison.
