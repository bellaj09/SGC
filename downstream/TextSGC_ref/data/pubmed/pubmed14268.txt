Background: Advances in omics and computational Artificial Intelligence AI have been said to be key to meeting the objectives of precision cardiovascular medicine. The focus of precision medicine includes a better assessment of disease risk and understanding of disease mechanisms. Our objective was to determine whether significant epigenetic changes occur in isolated non-syndromic CoA. Further we evaluated the AI analysis of DNA methylation for the prediction of CoA.Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of newborn blood DNA was performed in 24 isolated non-syndromic CoA cases and 16 controls using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays. Cytosine nucleotide CpG methylation changes in CoA in each of 450000 CpG loci were determined. Ingenuity pathway analysis IPA was performed to identify molecular and disease pathways that were epigenetically dysregulated. Using methylation data six artificial intelligence AI platforms including deep learning DL was used for CoA detection.Results: We identified significant FDR p-value  .05 methylation changes in 65 different CpG sites located in 75 genes in CoA subjects. DL achieved an AUC 95% CI = 0.97 0.80-1 with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Gene ontology GO analysis yielded epigenetic alterations in important cardiovascular developmental genes and biological processes: abnormal morphology of cardiovascular system left ventricular dysfunction heart conduction disorder thrombus formation and coronary artery disease.Conclusion: In an exploratory study we report the use of AI and epigenomics to achieve important objectives of precision cardiovascular medicine. Accurate prediction of CoA was achieved using a newborn blood spot. Further we provided evidence of a significant epigenetic etiology in isolated CoA development.
