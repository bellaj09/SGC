"Experiential learning experiences ELEs opportunities for students to apply knowledge and skills critically in a hands-on environment are fundamental to the apprenticeship model of biological and biotechnological sciences. ELEs enhance student-learning gains increase career readiness and provide important networking opportunities. However students do not often recognize the benefits of ELEs. Reflection is a highly effective tool to articulate learning gains and connect new content with established knowledge. Therefore senior undergraduate students n = 23 majoring in biological sciences or biotechnology wrote required reflective essays about their ELE in response to an intentionally vague prompt. Qualitative assessment of the reflective essays identified themes present in the reflective essays that typically included descriptions of what students did with whom they worked and what they learned during their ELE but lacked critical analysis or deep reflection about their experience. Differences were also present between different types of ELEs. These results provide a foundation for guiding students to deeper reflection ultimately resulting in greater benefits from their ELEs. To promote more robust reflection and therefore theoretically enhance learning gains from ELEs we suggest multiple iterations of reflection instructor feedback and coaching and ELE-specific prompts that focus on the placement of ELEs within students personal and professional trajectory."
