"Social competence is often impaired in children with acquired brain injury ABI but evidence-based rehabilitation has remained undeveloped. This pilot-study aimed to create a structured model for sociocognitive rehabilitation for children with ABI. A total of 32 children aged 8-13\u2009years participated: 22 with ABI -epilepsy traumatic brain injury or tic disorder and 10 healthy controls. Interactive computer-based applications were implemented into rehabilitation design using multitouch-multiuser tabletop MMT devices: Snowflake MultiTeach MT and Diamond Touch Table DTT plus MediqVR virtual reality VR platform. At baseline patients demonstrated social incompetence compared to healthy controls. Post-training evaluations showed that rehabilitation on Snowflake MT improved childrens executive and cooperation skills. DTT developed new communication and language skills metacognitive skills and coping with difficult social situations. This structured model for social competence rehabilitation helps therapists to understand the objectives and tools for improving social and cooperation skills in children with ABI. We provide practical recommendations using next-generation devices which are effective and motivating for children."
