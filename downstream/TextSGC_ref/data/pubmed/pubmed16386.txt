"Computer aided detection CADe of pulmonary nodules plays an important role in assisting radiologists diagnosis and alleviating interpretation burden for lung cancer. Current CADe systems aiming at simulating radiologists examination procedure are built upon computer tomography CT images with feature extraction for detection and diagnosis. Human visual perception in CT image is reconstructed from sinogram which is the original raw data acquired from CT scanner. In this work different from the conventional image based CADe system we propose a novel sinogram based CADe system in which the full projection information is used to explore additional effective features of nodules in the sinogram domain. Facing the challenges of limited research in this concept and unknown effective features in the sinogram domain we design a new CADe system that utilizes the self-learning power of the convolutional neural network to learn and extract effective features from sinogram. The proposed system was validated on 208 patient cases from the publicly available online Lung Image Database Consortium database with each case having at least one juxtapleural nodule annotation. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method obtained a value of 0.91 of the area under the curve AUC of receiver operating characteristic based on sinogram alone comparing to 0.89 based on CT image alone. Moreover a combination of sinogram and CT image could further improve the value of AUC to 0.92. This study indicates that pulmonary nodule detection in the sinogram domain is feasible with deep learning." Improved computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules via deep learning in the sinogram domain.
