When undergo ambulatory surgical operations the majority of patients experience high level of anxiety. Different experimental studies have shown that distraction techniques are effective in reducing pain and related anxiety. Since Virtual reality VR has been demonstrated a good distraction technique it has been repeatedly used in hospital contexts for reducing pain in burned patients but it has never been used during surgical operations. With the present randomized controlled study we intended to verify the effectiveness of VR in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing ambulatory operations under local or regional anaesthesia. In particular we measured the degree to which anxiety associated with surgical intervention was reduced by distracting patients with immersive VR provided through a cell phone connected to an HMD compared to a no-distraction control condition. A significant reduction of anxiety was obtained after 45 minutes of operation in the VR group but not in the control group and after 90 minutes the reduction was larger in the experimental group than in other one. In conclusion this study presents an innovative promising technique to reduce anxiety during surgical interventions even if more studies are necessary to investigate its effectiveness in other kinds of operations and in larger numbers of patients.
