Medical education is changing. Simulation is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of clinical training and though effective is resource intensive. With increasing pressures on budgets and standardisation virtual reality VR is emerging as a new method of delivering simulation. VR offers benefits for learners and educators delivering cost-effective repeatable standardised clinical training on demand. A large body of evidence supports VR simulation in all industries including healthcare. Though VR is not a panacea it is a powerful educational tool for defined learning objectives and implementation is growing worldwide. The future of VR lies in its ongoing integration into curricula and with technological developments that allow shared simulated clinical experiences. This will facilitate quality interprofessional education at scale independent of geography and transform how we deliver education to the clinicians of the future. Virtual reality and the transformation of medical education.
