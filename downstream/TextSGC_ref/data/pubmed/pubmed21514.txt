"In previous studies children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD have been found to have more difficulties with processing speed working memory and attentional tasks. The present study aimed to compare the cognitive variables working memory and processing speed and the attentional profiles of a sample of students with and without ADHD using scales from the WISC-IV and the virtual reality-based attentional test known as Aula Nesplora; and determine the extent to which the aforementioned variables may predict student group membership. A total of 88 students took part in this study 66 males and 22 females aged from 6 to 16 years M = 10.20; SD = 2.79. The sample was divided into two groups: an ADHD group n = 50 and a Control group n = 38. Students in the ADHD group obtained lower scores in working memory and in processing speed as well as demonstrating poorer performance in Aula Nesplora than did their peers. Working memory and the number of omissions were both shown to be reliable predictors of group membership. This study revealed the importance of obtaining data from attentional variables differentiated by modality when considering cognitive variables in order to better characterize the difficulties experienced by individuals diagnosed with ADHD." Analysis of cognitive and attentional profiles in children with and without ADHD using an innovative virtual reality tool.
