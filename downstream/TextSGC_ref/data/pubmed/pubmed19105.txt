"Adjustment Disorders AD is a very common mental health problem in primary care. Only general treatment guidelines are available for its treatment. Our research team has developed a cognitive-behavioural treatment CBT supported by Virtual reality EMMA system that has shown its utility in the treatment of AD. EMMA is a VR adaptive display that adapts its presentation to the patient therapeutic needs. So far researchers have been centered on how to use the Information and Communication Technologies to deliver treatment within the therapeutic context. TEO is a completely open Online Emotional Therapy web-based system that allows creating personalized therapeutic material. The patient can access this material over the Internet. Preliminary data about the acceptability of TEO system in a case study has already been obtained. The aim of the present work is to describe the session protocol regarding the homework assignments component in the treatment of AD designed in TEO system. Also data about preferences and efficacy of TEO system versus traditional homework assignments implementation in a single case study with AD are presented. A web-based system of this kind increases the possibilities for therapy." An online emotional regulation system to deliver homework assignments for treating adjustment disorders.
