This study aimed to examine the source-level cortical brain networks of post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD based on the graph theory using electroencephalography EEG. Sixty-six cortical source signals were estimated from 78 PTSD and 58 healthy controls HCs of resting-state EEG. Four global indices strength clustering coefficient CC path length PL and efficiency and one nodal index CC were evaluated in six frequency bands delta theta alpha low beta high beta and gamma. PTSD showed decreased global strength CC and efficiency in delta theta and low beta band and enhanced PL in theta and low beta band. In low beta band the strength and CC correlated positively with the anxiety scores while PL had a negative correlation. In addition nodal CCs were reduced in PTSD in delta theta and low beta band. Nodal CCs of theta band correlated negatively with rumination and re-experience symptom scores; while nodal CCs in low beta band correlated positively with anxiety and pain severity. Inefficiently altered and symptom-dependent changes in cortical networks were seen in PTSD. Our source-level cortical network indices might be promising biomarkers for evaluating PTSD.
