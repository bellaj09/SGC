Traditional Support Vector Machine SVM is widely used classification method for brain-computer interface BCI. However SVM has a high computational complexity. In this paper Gaussian Mixture Model GMM-based training data reduction is proposed to reduce high computational complexity. The proposed method is configured as follows: First wavelet-based combined feature vectors are applied for motor imagery electroencephalography EEG identification and principal component analysis PCA are used to reduce the dimension of feature vectors. Thereafter the GMM is implemented to reduce training data sizes. Finally a nonlinear SVM classifier is used to classify the reduced training data. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy and training time. The results from the study indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with faster computational time in motor imagery EEG classification. Speeding up SVM training in brain-computer interfaces.
