In biomedicine there is a wealth of information hidden in unstructured narratives such as research articles and clinical reports. To exploit these data properly a word sense disambiguation WSD algorithm prevents downstream difficulties in the natural language processing applications pipeline. Supervised WSD algorithms largely outperform un- or semisupervised and knowledge-based methods; however they train 1 separate classifier for each ambiguous term necessitating a large number of expert-labeled training data an unattainable goal in medical informatics. To alleviate this need a single model that shares statistical strength across all instances and scales well with the vocabulary size is desirable. deepBioWSD: effective deep neural word sense disambiguation of biomedical text data.
