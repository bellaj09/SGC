High-resolution Hi-C data are indispensable for the studies of three-dimensional 3D genome organization at kilobase level. However generating high-resolution Hi-C data e.g. 5\u2009kb by conducting Hi-C experiments needs millions of mammalian cells which may eventually generate billions of paired-end reads with a high sequencing cost. Therefore it will be important and helpful if we can enhance the resolutions of Hi-C data by computational methods. HiCNN: a very deep convolutional neural network to better enhance the resolution of Hi-C data.
