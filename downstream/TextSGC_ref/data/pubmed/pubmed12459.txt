By exploiting the total variation TV regularization scheme and the contrast transfer function CTF a phase map can be retrieved from single-distance coherent diffraction images via the sparsity of the investigated object. However the CTF-TV phase retrieval algorithm often struggles in the presence of strong noise since it is based on the traditional compressive sensing optimization problem. Here convolutional neural networks a powerful tool from machine learning are used to regularize the CTF-based phase retrieval problems and improve the recovery performance. This proposed method the CTF-Deep phase retrieval algorithm was tested both via simulations and experiments. The results show that it is robust to noise and fast enough for high-resolution applications such as in optical x-ray or terahertz imaging.
