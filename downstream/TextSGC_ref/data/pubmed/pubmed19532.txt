The target based drug design approaches are a series of computational procedures including visualization tools to support the decision systems of drug design/discovery process. In the essence of biological targets shaping the potential lead/drug molecules this review presents a comprehensive position of different components of target based drug design which include target identification protein modeling molecular dynamics simulations binding/catalytic sites identification docking virtual screening fragment based strategies substructure treatment of targets in tackling drug resistance in silico ADMET structural vaccinology etc along with the key issues involved therein and some well investigated case studies. The concepts and working of these procedures are critically discussed to arouse interest and to advance the drug research. Target based drug design - a reality in virtual sphere.
