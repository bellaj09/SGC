"Self-driving cars are posing a new challenge to our ethics. By using algorithms to make decisions in situations where harming humans is possible probable or even unavoidable a self-driving cars ethical behavior comes pre-defined. Ad hoc decisions are made in milliseconds but can be based on extensive research and debates. The same algorithms are also likely to be used in millions of cars at a time increasing the impact of any inherent biases and increasing the importance of getting it right. Previous research has shown that moral judgment and behavior are highly context-dependent and comprehensive and nuanced models of the underlying cognitive processes are out of reach to date. Models of ethics for self-driving cars should thus aim to match human decisions made in the same context. We employed immersive virtual reality to assess ethical behavior in simulated road traffic scenarios and used the collected data to train and evaluate a range of decision models. In the study participants controlled a virtual car and had to choose which of two given obstacles they would sacrifice in order to spare the other. We randomly sampled obstacles from a variety of inanimate objects animals and humans. Our model comparison shows that simple models based on one-dimensional value-of-life scales are suited to describe human ethical behavior in these situations. Furthermore we examined the influence of severe time pressure on the decision-making process. We found that it decreases consistency in the decision patterns thus providing an argument for algorithmic decision-making in road traffic. This study demonstrates the suitability of virtual reality for the assessment of ethical behavior in humans delivering consistent results across subjects while closely matching the experimental settings to the real world scenarios in question."
