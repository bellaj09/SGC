Convolutional neural network CNN is of great interest in machine learning and has demonstrated excellent performance in hyperspectral image classification. In this paper we propose a classification framework called diverse region-based CNN which can encode semantic context-aware representation to obtain promising features. With merging a diverse set of discriminative appearance factors the resulting CNN-based representation exhibits spatial-spectral context sensitivity that is essential for accurate pixel classification. The proposed method exploiting diverse region-based inputs to learn contextual interactional features is expected to have more discriminative power. The joint representation containing rich spectral and spatial information is then fed to a fully connected network and the label of each pixel vector is predicted by a softmax layer. Experimental results with widely used hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass any other conventional deep learning-based classifiers and other state-of-the-art classifiers.
