"Theta activity is generated in the septohippocampal system and can be recorded using deep intrahippocampal electrodes and implantable electroencephalography EEG radiotelemetry or tether system approaches. Pharmacologically hippocampal theta is heterogeneous see dualistic theory and can be differentiated into type I and type II theta. These individual EEG subtypes are related to specific cognitive and behavioral states such as arousal exploration learning and memory higher integrative functions etc. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers structural and functional alterations of the septohippocampal system can result in impaired theta activity/oscillations. A standard quantitative analysis of the hippocampal EEG includes a Fast-Fourier-Transformation FFT-based frequency analysis. However this procedure does not provide details about theta activity in general and highly-organized theta oscillations in particular. In order to obtain detailed information on highly-organized theta oscillations in the hippocampus we have developed a new analytical approach. This approach allows for time- and cost-effective quantification of the duration of highly-organized theta oscillations and their frequency characteristics."
