Partial Directed Coherence PDC is a spectral multivariate estimator for effective connectivity relying on the concept of Granger causality. Even if its original definition derived directly from information theory two modifies were introduced in order to provide better physiological interpretations of the estimated networks: i normalization of the estimator according to rows ii squared transformation. In the present paper we investigated the effect of PDC normalization on the performances achieved by applying the statistical validation process on investigated connectivity patterns under different conditions of Signal to Noise ratio SNR and amount of data available for the analysis. Results of the statistical analysis revealed an effect of PDC normalization only on the percentages of type I and type II errors occurred by using Shuffling procedure for the assessment of connectivity patterns. No effects of the PDC formulation resulted on the performances achieved during the validation process executed instead by means of Asymptotic Statistic approach. Moreover the percentages of both false positives and false negatives committed by Asymptotic Statistic are always lower than those achieved by Shuffling procedure for each type of normalization.
