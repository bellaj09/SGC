Mild traumatic brain injury mTBI accounts for over one million emergency visits each year in the United States. The large-scale structural and functional network connectivity changes of mTBI are still unknown. This study was designed to determine the connectome-scale brain network connectivity changes in mTBI at both structural and functional levels. 40 mTBI patients at the acute stage and 50 healthy controls were recruited. A novel approach called Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks DICCCOLs was applied for connectome-scale analysis of both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional MRI data. Among 358 networks identified on DICCCOL analysis 41 networks were identified as structurally discrepant between patient and control groups. The involved major white matter tracts include the corpus callosum and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. Functional connectivity analysis identified 60 connectomic signatures that differentiate patients from controls with 93.75% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Analysis of functional domains showed decreased intra-network connectivity within the emotion network and among emotion-cognition interactions and increased interactions among action-emotion and action-cognition as well as within perception networks. This work suggests that mTBI may result in changes of structural and functional connectivity on a connectome scale at the acute stage.
