Augmented and mixed reality are emerging interactive and display technologies. These technologies are able to merge virtual objects in either 2 or 3 dimensions with the real world. Image guidance is the cornerstone of interventional radiology. With augmented or mixed reality medical imaging can be more readily accessible or displayed in actual 3-dimensional space during procedures to enhance guidance at times when this information is most needed. In this review the current state of these technologies is addressed followed by a fundamental overview of their inner workings and challenges with 3-dimensional visualization. Finally current and potential future applications in interventional radiology are highlighted. Augmented and Mixed Reality: Technologies for Enhancing the Future of IR.
