Patients with bilateral vestibulopathy BV can still have residual "natural" function. This might interact with "artificial" vestibular implant input VI-input. When fluctuating it could lead to vertigo attacks. Main objective was to investigate how "artificial" VI-input is integrated with residual "natural" input by the central vestibular system. This to explore 1 whether misalignment in the response of "artificial" VI-input is sufficiently counteracted by well-aligned residual "natural" input and 2 whether "artificial" VI-input is able to influence and counteract the response to residual "natural" input to show feasibility of a "vestibular pacemaker." The Vestibular Implant Input Interacts with Residual Natural Function.
