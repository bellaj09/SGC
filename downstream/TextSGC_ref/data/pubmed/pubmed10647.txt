Virus phylogeographers rely on DNA sequences of viruses and the locations of the infected hosts found in public sequence databases like GenBank for modeling virus spread. However the locations in GenBank records are often only at the country or state level and may require phylogeographers to scan the journal articles associated with the records to identify more localized geographic areas. To automate this process we present a named entity recognizer NER for detecting locations in biomedical literature. We built the NER using a deep feedforward neural network to determine whether a given token is a toponym or not. To overcome the limited human annotated data available for training we use distant supervision techniques to generate additional samples to train our NER.
