In a natural environment affective information is perceived via multiple senses mostly audition and vision. However the impact of multisensory information on affect remains relatively undiscovered. In this study we investigated whether the auditory-visual presentation of aversive stimuli influences the experience of fear. We used the advantages of virtual reality to manipulate multisensory presentation and to display potentially fearful dog stimuli embedded in a natural context. We manipulated the affective reactions evoked by the dog stimuli by recruiting two groups of participants: dog-fearful and non-fearful participants. The sensitivity to dog fear was assessed psychometrically by a questionnaire and also at behavioral and subjective levels using a Behavioral Avoidance Test BAT. Participants navigated in virtual environments in which they encountered virtual dog stimuli presented through the auditory channel the visual channel or both. They were asked to report their fear using Subjective Units of Distress. We compared the fear for unimodal visual or auditory and bimodal auditory-visual dog stimuli. Dog-fearful participants as well as non-fearful participants reported more fear in response to bimodal audiovisual compared to unimodal presentation of dog stimuli. These results suggest that fear is more intense when the affective information is processed via multiple sensory pathways which might be due to a cross-modal potentiation. Our findings have implications for the field of virtual reality-based therapy of phobias. Therapies could be refined and improved by implicating and manipulating the multisensory presentation of the feared situations. Auditory-visual aversive stimuli modulate the conscious experience of fear.
