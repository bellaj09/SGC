Due to lacking predictors of depression recovery successful treatment of major depressive disorder MDD is frequently only achieved after therapeutic optimization leading to a prolonged suffering of patients. This study aimed to determine neural prognostic predictors identifying non-remitters prior or early after treatment initiation. Moreover it intended to detect time-sensitive neural mediators indicating depression recovery. This longitudinal interventional single-arm open-label phase IV pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study comprised four scans at important stages prior day 0 and after escitalopram treatment initiation day 1 28 and 56. Totally 22 treatment-free MDD patients age mean\u2009\u2009SD: 31.5\u2009\u20097.7; females: 50% suffering from a concurrent major depressive episode without any comorbid DSM-IV axis I diagnosis completed the study protocol. Primary outcome were neural prognostic predictors of depression recovery. Enhanced de-activation of anterior medial prefrontal cortex amPFC single neural mediator indicated depression recovery correlating with MADRS score and working memory improvements. Strong dorsolateral PFC dlPFC activation and weak dlPFC-amPFC dlPFC-posterior cingulate cortex PCC dlPFC-parietal lobe PL coupling three prognostic predictors hinted at depression recovery at day 0 and 1. Preresponse prediction of continuous dlPFC-PL: R2day1\u2009=\u200955.9% 95% CI: 22.6-79% P\u2009<\u20090.005 and dichotomous specificity/sensitivity: SP/SNday1\u2009=\u20090.91/0.82 recovery definitions remained significant after leave-one-out cross-validation. Identified prefrontal neural predictors might propel the future development of fMRI markers for clinical decision making which could lead to increased response rates and adherence during acute phase treatment periods. Moreover this study underscores the importance of the amPFC in depression recovery.
