The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a specific stress management protocol based on immersive Virtual Reality VR to be used as part of a multidisciplinary inpatient program for the treatment of obesity. The stress management protocol included imagery relaxation and different cognitive behavioral approaches -- emotion focused coping self-monitoring and record keeping. Forty 40 participants all female were recruited for the study at the San Giuseppe Hospital Istituto Auxologico Italiano Piancavallo VB Italy. Participants were chosen among the obese patients without a specific Binge Eating diagnosis but with high level of anxiety and a history of emotional eating. The sample was randomly distributed in three conditions as follows: a VR stress Management Protocol; b DVD based stress management protocol; c no treatment control condition. Data show that the VR condition produced a significantly higher reduction in anxiety as compared both to DVD and control groups. More we found a significant correlation between changes in the emotional state and the level of presence: the more present the users felt the higher the reduction in anxiety. This datum suggests the possible role of presence in mediating the effects of a stress management protocol. Why you really eat? Virtual reality in the treatment of obese emotional eaters.
