Only recently advanced direct volume visualization techniques have been widely used due to the availability of low cost hardware accelerators; such techniques have a great potential of use for many applications of the virtual reality in medicine. We proposed and implemented a low cost system for interactive and stereoscopic 3D visualization of the full color visible human dataset. Potential use of the proposed system includes anatomical atlases and surgical simulators. A prototype of the proposed system is rendering full color volumes with 256 x 152 x 470 in real time 15-20 Hz with stereoscopy. Interactive stereoscopic full-color direct volume visualization for virtual reality applications in medicine.
