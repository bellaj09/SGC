Engagement in academic work was viewed from a multiple goals perspective. Two studies were conducted in which high school math students completed an instrument measuring five goals students might have for doing academic work learning goals performance goals obtaining future consequences pleasing the teacher and pleasing the family perceived math ability self-regulatory activities strategies deep or shallow used when studying for math and the amount of effort and persistence expended on the class. Factor analysis indicated that the five goals scales and the perceived ability scale represented unique factors. The correlations among the variables revealed theoretically consistent interrelationships. Multiple regression analyses indicated that various goals e.g. learning goals obtaining future consequences and pleasing the teacher perceived ability and some interactions accounted for significant amounts of variance in the task engagement measures self-regulation strategy use effort and persistence and achievement. Results are discussed in relation to current theory and their practical implications. Engagement in Academic Work: The Role of Learning Goals Future Consequences Pleasing Others and Perceived Ability
