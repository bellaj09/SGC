Intensive care units ICUs are responsible for generating a wealth of useful data in the form of electronic health records. We aimed to build a mortality prediction model on a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care MIMIC-III database and to assess whether the use of deep learning techniques like long short-term memory LSTM can effectively utilize the temporal relations among clinical variables. The models were built on clinical variable dynamics of the first 48 h of ICU admission of 12550 records from the MIMIC-III database. A total of 36 variables including 33 time series variables and three static variables were used for the prediction. We present the application of LSTM and LSTM attention LSTM-AT model for mortality prediction with such a large number of clinical variables dataset. For training and validation purpose we have used International Classification of Diseases 9th edition ICD-9 codes for extracting the patients with cardiovascular disease and infections and parasitic disease respectively. The effectiveness of the LSTM model is achieved over non-recurrent baseline models like nave Bayes logistic regression LR support vector machine and multilayer perceptron MLP by generating state of the art results area under the curve AUC 0.852. Next by providing attention at each time stamp we developed a model LSTM-AT which exhibits even better performance AUC 0.876. A comprehensive evaluation for the prediction of mortality in intensive care units with LSTM networks: patients with cardiovascular disease.
