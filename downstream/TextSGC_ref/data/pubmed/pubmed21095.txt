We consider the gravity-induced draping of a 3D object with a naturally flat isotropic elastic sheet. As the size of the sheet increases we observe the appearance of new folded structures of increasing complexity that arise because of the competition between elasticity and gravity. We analyze some of the simpler 3D structures by determining their shape and analyzing their response and stability and show that these structures can easily switch between a number of metastable configurations. For more complex draperies we derive scaling laws for the appearance and disappearance of new length scales. Our results are consistent with commonplace observations of drapes and complement large-scale computations of draping by providing benchmarks. They also yield a qualitative guide to fashion design and virtual reality animation. The elements of draping.
