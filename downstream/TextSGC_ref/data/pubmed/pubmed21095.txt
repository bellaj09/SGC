This study confirmed the educational effectiveness of practical exercises PE using intravenous IV simulators incorporating virtual reality VR/haptics based on the sense of touch device technologies. First-year nursing students n=114 were randomly divided into three PE groups: Group A utilizing a conventional arm model IV arm; Group B utilizing a VR/Haptics IV Simulator IV sim; and Group C utilizing both the IV arm and IV sim. Group C scored highest on procedures for conducting venipuncture. Group B was more successful in performing injections than Groups A and C. Group C required significantly less time than Group B to complete a venipuncture injection and was faster than Group A although this difference was not significant. In conclusion a new paradigm of PE is suggested using both IV sim and IV arm. Evaluation of practical exercises using an intravenous simulator incorporating virtual reality and haptics device technologies.
