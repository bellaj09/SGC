Bladder cancer is a common problem facing urologists worldwide. The gold standard for its diagnosis and follow-up is the direct visualization of the tumor using conventional cystoscopy. Despite having high sensitivity and specificity for detecting bladder cancer conventional cystoscopy is regarded as an invasive procedure which is associated with several complications. In addition regular follow-up of patients with bladder cancer is a financial burden on the health system. With the progressive development in diagnostic imaging and medical computer software technologies it was possible to generate virtual reality images to aid the clinician to inspect the interior of the bladder in real time. This technology is considered as a safe test for bladder cancer diagnosis and follow-up and it is associated with cancer detection rates comparable with conventional cystoscopy. However it is associated with some drawbacks that limit its use in routine clinical practice at the current time. In this paper we review the development and clinical applications of this technology.
