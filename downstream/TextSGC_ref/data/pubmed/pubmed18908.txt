Several approaches to perform assessment in training simulators based on virtual reality have been proposed. There are two kinds of assessment methods: offline and online. The main requirements related to online training assessment methodologies applied to virtual reality systems are the low computational complexity and the high accuracy. In the literature it can be found several approaches for general cases which can satisfy such requirements. An inconvenient about those approaches is related to an unsatisfactory solution for specific cases as in some medical procedures where there are quantitative and qualitative information available to perform the assessment. In this paper we present an approach to online training assessment based on a Modified Naive Bayes which can manipulate qualitative and quantitative variables simultaneously. A special medical case was simulated in a bone marrow harvest simulator. The results obtained were satisfactory and evidenced the applicability of the method. A qualitative and quantitative assessment for a bone marrow harvest simulator.
