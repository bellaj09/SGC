Deep Learning opens up opportunities for routinely scanning large bodies of biomedical literature and clinical narratives to represent the meaning of biomedical and clinical terms. However the validation and integration of this knowledge on a scale requires cross checking with ground truths i.e. evidence-based resources that are unavailable in an actionable or computable form. In this paper we explore how to turn information about diagnoses prognoses therapies and other clinical concepts into computable knowledge using free-text data about human and animal health. We used a Semantic Deep Learning approach that combines the Semantic Web technologies and Deep Learning to acquire and validate knowledge about 11 well-known medical conditions mined from two sets of unstructured free-text data: 300\u2009K PubMed Systematic Review articles the PMSB dataset and 2.5\u2009M veterinary clinical notes the VetCN dataset. For each target condition we obtained 20 related clinical concepts using two deep learning methods applied separately on the two datasets resulting in 880 term pairs target term candidate term. Each concept represented by an n-gram is mapped to UMLS using MetaMap; we also developed a bespoke method for mapping short forms e.g. abbreviations and acronyms. Existing ontologies were used to formally represent associations. We also create ontological modules and illustrate how the extracted knowledge can be queried. The evaluation was performed using the content within BMJ Best Practice. Exploring semantic deep learning for building reliable and reusable one health knowledge from PubMed systematic reviews and veterinary clinical notes.
