In this paper we consider building extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. At present most building extraction methods are based on artificial features. However the diversity and complexity of buildings mean that building extraction methods still face great challenges so methods based on deep learning have recently been proposed. In this paper a building extraction framework based on a convolution neural network and edge detection algorithm is proposed. The method is called Mask R-CNN Fusion Sobel. Because of the outstanding achievement of Mask R-CNN in the field of image segmentation this paper improves it and then applies it in remote sensing image building extraction. Our method consists of three parts. First the convolutional neural network is used for rough location and pixel level classification and the problem of false and missed extraction is solved by automatically discovering semantic features. Second Sobel edge detection algorithm is used to segment building edges accurately so as to solve the problem of edge extraction and the integrity of the object of deep convolutional neural networks in semantic segmentation. Third buildings are extracted by the fusion algorithm. We utilize the proposed framework to extract the building in high-resolution remote sensing images from Chinese satellite GF-2 and the experiments show that the average value of IOU intersection over union of the proposed method was 88.7% and the average value of Kappa was 87.8% respectively. Therefore our method can be applied to the recognition and segmentation of complex buildings and is superior to the classical method in accuracy.
