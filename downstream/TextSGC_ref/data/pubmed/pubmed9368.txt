Developing automated methods to efficiently process large volumes of point cloud data remains a challenge for three-dimensional 3D plant phenotyping applications. Here we describe the development of machine learning methods to tackle three primary challenges in plant phenotyping: lamina/stem classification lamina counting and stem skeletonization. For classification we assessed and validated the accuracy of our methods on a dataset of 54 3D shoot architectures representing multiple growth conditions and developmental time points for two Solanaceous species tomato Solanum lycopersicum cv 75 m82D and Nicotiana benthamiana Using deep learning we classified lamina versus stems with 97.8% accuracy. Critically we also demonstrated the robustness of our method to growth conditions and species that have not been trained on which is important in practical applications but is often untested. For lamina counting we developed an enhanced region-growing algorithm to reduce oversegmentation; this method achieved 86.6% accuracy outperforming prior methods developed for this problem. Finally for stem skeletonization we developed an enhanced tip detection technique which ran an order of magnitude faster and generated more precise skeleton architectures than prior methods. Overall our improvements enable higher throughput and accurate extraction of phenotypic properties from 3D point cloud data.
