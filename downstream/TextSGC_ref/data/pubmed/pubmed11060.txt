The benefits of homework on student learning and academic achievement to a large extent depend on the degree of student engagement. Motivational engagement my intention or why I do the homework cognitive engagement how I get involved in homework and behavioral engagement how much homework I do how much time I devote to it how I manage that time are key aspects that condition the quality of the process of doing homework learning and academic achievement. Prior academic achievement is one of the variables that seems to be positively related to student engagement both due its motivational component and to the training to do homework. The main purpose of this work was to study in detail this relationship in students of the last stage of Primary Education N = 516. The results showed that i as achievement levels rise the use of a shallow focus to doing homework decreases and the use of a deep approach increases; ii there is also a progressive increase in the amount of homework done and in the management of the time dedicated to homework. On another hand as in previous research iii no relationship was observed between the levels of prior achievement and the amount of time spent doing homework. The Role of Prior Achievement as an Antecedent to Student Homework Engagement.
