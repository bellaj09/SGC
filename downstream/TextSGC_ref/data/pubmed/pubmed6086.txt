"Purpose: Isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH mutations in glioma patients confer longer survival and may guide treatment decision making. We aimed to predict the IDH status of gliomas from MR imaging by applying a residual convolutional neural network to preoperative radiographic data.Experimental Design: Preoperative imaging was acquired for 201 patients from the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania HUP 157 patients from Brigham and Womens Hospital BWH and 138 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive TCIA and divided into training validation and testing sets. We trained a residual convolutional neural network for each MR sequence FLAIR T2 T1 precontrast and T1 postcontrast and built a predictive model from the outputs. To increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting we augmented the training set images by introducing random rotations translations flips shearing and zooming.Results: With our neural network model we achieved IDH prediction accuracies of 82.8% AUC = 0.90 83.0% AUC = 0.93 and 85.7% AUC = 0.94 within training validation and testing sets respectively. When age at diagnosis was incorporated into the model the training validation and testing accuracies increased to 87.3% AUC = 0.93 87.6% AUC = 0.95 and 89.1% AUC = 0.95 respectively.Conclusions: We developed a deep learning technique to noninvasively predict IDH genotype in grade II-IV glioma using conventional MR imaging using a multi-institutional data set.
