Functional connectivity FC analysis of fMRI data typically rests on prior identification of network nodes from activation profiles. We compared Activation Likelihood Estimate ALE and the Experimentally Derived Estimate EDE approaches to network node identification and functional inference for both verbal and visual forms of working memory. ALE arrives at canonical activation maxima that are assumed to reliably represent peaks of brain activity underlying a psychological process e.g. working memory. By comparison EDEs of activation maxima are typically derived from individual participant data and are thus sensitive to individual participant activation profiles. Here nodes were localized by both ALE and EDE methods for each participant and subsequently extracted time series were compared using connectivity analysis. Two sets of significance tests were performed: 1 correlations computed between nodal time series of each method were compared and 2 correlations computed between network edges functional connections of each network node pair were compared. Large proportions of edge correlations significantly differed between methods. ALE effectively summarizes working memory network node locations across studies and subjects but the sensitivity to individual functional loci suggest that EDE methods provide individualized estimates of network connectivity. We suggest that a hybrid method incorporating both ALE and EDE is optimal for network inference.
