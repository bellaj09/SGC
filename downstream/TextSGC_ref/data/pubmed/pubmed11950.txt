As the number of known proteins has expanded how to accurately identify DNA binding proteins has become a significant biological challenge. At present various computational methods have been proposed to recognize DNA-binding proteins from only amino acid sequences such as SVM DNABP and CNN-RNN. However these methods do not consider the context in amino acid sequences which makes it difficult for them to adequately capture sequence features. In this study a new method that coordinates a bidirectional long-term memory recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network called CNN-BiLSTM is proposed to identify DNA binding proteins. The CNN-BiLSTM model can explore the potential contextual relationships of amino acid sequences and obtain more features than can traditional models. The experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM achieves a validation set prediction accuracy of 96.5%-7.8% higher than that of SVM 9.6% higher than that of DNABP and 3.7% higher than that of CNN-RNN. After testing on 20000 independent samples provided by UniProt that were not involved in model training the accuracy of CNN-BiLSTM reached 94.5%-12% higher than that of SVM 4.9% higher than that of DNABP and 4% higher than that of CNN-RNN. We visualized and compared the model training process of CNN-BiLSTM with that of CNN-RNN and found that the former is capable of better generalization from the training dataset showing that CNN-BiLSTM has a wider range of adaptations to protein sequences. On the test set CNN-BiLSTM has better credibility because its predicted scores are closer to the sample labels than are those of CNN-RNN. Therefore the proposed CNN-BiLSTM is a more powerful method for identifying DNA-binding proteins. An improved deep learning method for predicting DNA-binding proteins based on contextual features in amino acid sequences.
