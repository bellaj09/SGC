"Generative models bear promising implications to learn data representations in an unsupervised fashion with deep learning. Generative Adversarial Nets GAN is one of the most popular frameworks in this arena. Despite the promising results from different types of GANs in-depth understanding on the adversarial training process of the models remains a challenge to domain experts. The complexity and the potential long-time training process of the models make it hard to evaluate interpret and optimize them. In this work guided by practical needs from domain experts we design and develop a visual analytics system GANViz aiming to help experts understand the adversarial process of GANs in-depth. Specifically GANViz evaluates the model performance of two subnetworks of GANs provides evidence and interpretations of the models performance and empowers comparative analysis with the evidence. Through our case studies with two real-world datasets we demonstrate that GANViz can provide useful insight into helping domain experts understand interpret evaluate and potentially improve GAN models."
