"As virtual reality technology is increasingly attracting significant attention in clinical psychology especially in the treatment of phobias physiological monitoring is increasingly considered as an objective measuring tool for studying participants. However there are few studies of the normal individuals physiological response to virtual environments or their reactions to different virtual environments. The goal of this study is to analyze non-phobic participants physiological reaction to two virtual environments: driving and flying and to investigate the usefulness of heart rate variability. Eleven non-phobic participants were exposed to each virtual environment for 15 minutes. Heart rate skin resistance and skin temperature measurements were taken for physiological monitoring and Presence and Simulator Sickness Questionnaires were obtained after each exposure. This study found that skin resistance and heart rate variability can be used to show arousal of participant exposed to virtual environments experience and that such measures generally returned to normal as time went by. The Study showed that skin resistance and heart rate can be used as objective measures in monitoring the reaction of non-phobic participants to virtual environments. Significantly heart rate variability analysis in virtual environments showed that it could be useful for assessing the emotional states of participants." An investigation of immersiveness in virtual reality exposure using physiological data.
