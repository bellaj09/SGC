OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to compare the effectiveness of practical radiology learning by medical students in a 3D virtual world versus the real world. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Two hundred fifteen 3rd-year medical students were randomized into two groups to attend the same workshop on abdominal radiography interpretation in a virtual world classroom VW group and in real life RL group. Pre- and post-training knowledge tests consisting of 12 multiple choice questions were performed at the beginning of the workshop and 2 months later. RESULTS. Fifty-four of 107 and five of 108 students refused to attend their respective group resulting in the participation of 53 students VW group and 103 students RL group in this study. No significant differences were found between groups in the tests taken before VW group mean  SD 4.5  1.8 points; RL group 4.0  1.3 points and after VW group 6.2  1.2; RL group 6.0  1.7 points training. CONCLUSION. Radiology education in a 3D virtual classroom fosters participatory learning and results in similar acquisition of interpretive skills as a traditional face-to-face classroom. Virtual worlds allow the performance of online activities to learn interpretive skills with guaranteed success in learning similar to that of conventional activities. Additionally the relative lack of identity in the virtual workshops makes students less afraid to speak and more participatory.
