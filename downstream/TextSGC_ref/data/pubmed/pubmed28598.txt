In the present investigation we studied four methods of blind source separation/independent component analysis BSS/ICA AMUSE SOBI JADE and FastICA. We did the feature extraction of electroencephalogram EEG signals of brain computer interface BCI for classifying spontaneous mental activities which contained four mental tasks including imagination of left hand right hand foot and tongue movement. Different methods of extract physiological components were studied and achieved good performance. Then three combined methods of SOBI and FastICA for extraction of EEG features of motor imagery were proposed. The results showed that combining of SOBI and ICA could not only reduce various artifacts and noise but also localize useful source and improve accuracy of BCI. It would improve further study of physiological mechanisms of motor imagery. Research on the methods for electroencephalogram feature extraction based on blind source separation.
