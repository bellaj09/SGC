In patients with rectal cancer pelvic dissection is challenging. A complete total mesorectal excision TME is particularly difficult in a narrow and long pelvis often encountered in males. This difficulty is compounded in the obese. In addition to the open approach being morbid laparoscopy has often proven difficult secondary to rigid instruments along with a steep learning curve. Robot assistance offers an advantage however limitations are observed in abdominal colon dissection outside of the pelvis. As these individual modalities have their disadvantages they each can contribute unique aspects in a combined or a hybrid approach to rectal tumors. Therefore a multi-modal combined approach involving hand assist laparoscopic and robotic assistance to a 5-cm tumor at the anal verge was applied to an abdominoperineal resection in an obese male patient. Combining all forces: abdominoperineal resection in an obese male.
