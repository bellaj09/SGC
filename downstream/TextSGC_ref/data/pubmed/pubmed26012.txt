"This paper aims to review selectively a fair proportion of the literature on human-computer interaction HCI over the three years since Shackel J. Am. Soc. Inform. Sci. 48 11 1997 970-986. After a brief note of history I discuss traditional input output and workplace aspects the web and E-topics web-related aspects virtual reality safety-critical systems and the need to move from HCI to human-system integration HSI. Finally I suggest and consider briefly some future possibilities and issues including web consequences embedded ubiquitous computing and back to systems ergonomics?."
