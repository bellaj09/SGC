Here we describe a vision of VR games that combine the best features of gaming and VR: large persistent worlds experienced in photorealistic settings with full immersion. For example Figure 1 illustrates a hypothetical immersive VR game that could be developed using current technologies including real-time cinematic-quality graphics; a panoramic head-mounted display HMD; and wide-area tracking. We also examine the gap between available VR and gaming technologies and offer solutions for bridging it. Toward natural selection in virtual reality.
