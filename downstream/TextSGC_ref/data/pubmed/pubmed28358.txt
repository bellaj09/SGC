Motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interface systems BCIs normally use a powerful spatial filtering and classification method to maximize their performance. The common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is a widely used spatial filtering method for MI-based BCIs. In this work we propose a new sparse representation-based classification SRC scheme for MI-based BCI applications. Sensorimotor rhythms are extracted from electroencephalograms and used for classification. The proposed SRC method utilizes the frequency band power and CSP algorithm to extract features for classification. We analyzed the performance of the new method using experimental datasets. The results showed that the SRC scheme provides highly accurate classification results which were better than those obtained using the well-known linear discriminant analysis classification method. The enhancement of the proposed method in terms of the classification accuracy was verified using cross-validation and a statistical paired t-test p < 0.001.
