"Brain computer interfaces are currently considered to greatly enhance assistive technologies and improve the experiences of people with special needs in the workplace. The proposed adaptive control model for smart offices provides a complete prototype that senses an environments temperature and lighting and responds to users feelings in terms of their comfort and engagement levels. The model comprises the following components: a sensors to sense the environment including temperature and brightness sensors and a headset that collects electroencephalogram EEG signals which represent workers comfort levels; b an application that analyzes workers feelings regarding their willingness to adjust to a space based on an analysis of collected data and that determines workers attention levels and thus engagement; and c actuators to adjust the temperature and/or lighting. This research implemented independent component analysis to remove eye movement artifacts from the EEG signals and used an engagement index to calculate engagement levels. This research is expected to add value to research on smart city infrastructures and on assistive technologies to increase productivity in smart offices."
