In this paper a non-invasive spontaneous Brain-Machine Interface BMI is used to control the movement of a planar robot. To that end two mental tasks are used to manage the visual interface that controls the robot. The robot used is a PupArm a force-controlled planar robot designed by the nBio research group at the Miguel Hernndez University of Elche Spain. Two control strategies are compared: hierarchical and directional control. The experimental test performed by four users consists of reaching four targets. The errors and time used during the performance of the tests are compared in both control strategies hierarchical and directional control. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are shown after the analysis of the results. The hierarchical control allows an accurate approaching to the goals but it is slower than using the directional control which on the contrary is less precise. The results show both strategies are useful to control this planar robot. In the future by adding an extra device like a gripper this BMI could be used in assistive applications such as grasping daily objects in a realistic environment. In order to compare the behavior of the system taking into account the opinion of the users a NASA Tasks Load Index TLX questionnaire is filled out after two sessions are completed.
