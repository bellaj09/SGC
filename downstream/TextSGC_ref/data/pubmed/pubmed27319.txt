We investigated whether listener-assisted scanning an alternative communication method for persons with severe motor and visual impairments but preserved cognitive skills could be used for spelling with EEG. To that end spoken letters were presented sequentially and the participants made selections by performing motor execution/imagery or a cognitive task. The motor task was a brisk dorsiflexion of both feet and the cognitive task was related to working memory and perception of human voice. The motor imagery task yielded the most promising results with respect to letter selection accuracy albeit with a large variation in individual performance. The cognitive task yielded significant  p = 0.05 albeit moderate results. Closer inspection of grand average ERPs for the cognitive task revealed task-related modulation of a late negative component which is novel in the auditory BCI literature. Guidelines for further development are presented. Evaluation of healthy EEG responses for spelling through listener-assisted scanning.
