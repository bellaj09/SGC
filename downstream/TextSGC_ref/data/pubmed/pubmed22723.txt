This manuscript presents a hybrid study of a comprehensive review and a systematicresearch analysis. Myoelectric control is the cornerstone ofmany assistive technologies used in clinicalpractice such as prosthetics and orthoses and human-computer interaction such as virtual reality control.Although the classification accuracy of such devices exceeds 90% in a controlled laboratory settingmyoelectric devices still face challenges in robustness to variability of daily living conditions.The intrinsic physiological mechanisms limiting practical implementations of myoelectric deviceswere explored: the limb position effect and the contraction intensity effect. The degradationof electromyography EMG pattern recognition in the presence of these factors was demonstratedon six datasets where classification performance was 13% and 20% lower than the controlledsetting for the limb position and contraction intensity effect respectively. The experimental designsof limb position and contraction intensity literature were surveyed. Current state-of-the-art trainingstrategies and robust algorithms for both effects were compiled and presented. Recommendationsfor future limb position effect studies include: the collection protocol providing exemplars of at least 6positions four limb positions and three forearm orientations three-dimensional space experimentaldesigns transfer learning approaches and multi-modal sensor configurations. Recommendationsfor future contraction intensity effect studies include: the collection of dynamic contractions nonlinearcomplexity features and proportional control.
