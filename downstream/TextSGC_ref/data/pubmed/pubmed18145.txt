The importance of training surgical residents in GI endoscopy has been recognized for years. Despite advice from SAGES and the RRC few programs have managed to incorporate effective flexible endoscopy training into their curriculum making it difficult for their graduates to be credentialed in GI endoscopy. Prior to October 2001 our residents obtained their entire clinical experience in the endoscopy unit with staff surgical endoscopists. Attendance was inconsistent because of their many other responsibilities and residents often used much of their clinical endoscopic exposure gaining basic familiarity with the equipment precluding the development of therapeutic facility. Since October 2001 we have used the Simbionix endoscopic simulator to supplement resident training in GI endoscopy. With the advent of virtual-reality simulators and studies validating their effectiveness in teaching fundamental technical skills we report our initial success in implementing a formal GI endoscopy curriculum using a virtual reality endoscopic simulator to provide basic experience before the clinical endoscopic experience begins.
