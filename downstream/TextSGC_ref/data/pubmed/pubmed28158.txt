This paper demonstrates a better classification performance of an ensemble classifier using a regularized linear discriminant analysis LDA for P300-based brain-computer interface BCI. The ensemble classifier with an LDA is sensitive to the lack of training data because covariance matrices are estimated imprecisely. One of the solution against the lack of training data is to employ a regularized LDA. Thus we employed the regularized LDA for the ensemble classifier of the P300-based BCI. The principal component analysis PCA was used for the dimension reduction. As a result an ensemble regularized LDA classifier showed significantly better classification performance than an ensemble un-regularized LDA classifier. Therefore the proposed ensemble regularized LDA classifier is robust against the lack of training data.
