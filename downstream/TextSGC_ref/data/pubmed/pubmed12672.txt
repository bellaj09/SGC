Applying infrared microscopy in the context of tissue diagnostics heavily relies on computationally preprocessing the infrared pixel spectra that constitute an infrared microscopic image. Existing approaches involve physical models which are non-linear in nature and lead to classifiers that do not generalize well e.g. across different types of tissue preparation. Furthermore existing preprocessing approaches involve iterative procedures that are computationally demanding so that computation time required for preprocessing does not keep pace with recent progress in infrared microscopes which can capture whole-slide images within minutes.
