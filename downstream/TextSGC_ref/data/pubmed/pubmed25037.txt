Recent studies have shown that brain-machine interfaces BMIs offer great potential for restoring upper limb function. However grasping objects is a complicated task and the signals extracted from the brain may not always be capable of driving these movements reliably. Vision-guided robotic assistance is one possible way to improve BMI performance. We describe a method of shared control where the user controls a prosthetic arm using a BMI and receives assistance with positioning the hand when it approaches an object. Blending of brain-machine interface and vision-guided autonomous robotics improves neuroprosthetic arm performance during grasping.
