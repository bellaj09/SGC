Eye movements can be used as alternative inputs for human-computer interface HCI systems such as virtual or augmented reality systems as well as new communication ways for patients with locked-in syndrome. In this study we developed a real-time electrooculogram EOG-based eye-writing recognition system with which users can write predefined symbolic patterns with their volitional eye movements. For the "eye-writing" recognition the proposed system first reconstructs the eye-written traces from EOG waveforms in real-time; then the system recognizes the intended symbolic inputs with a reliable recognition rate by matching the input traces with the trained eye-written traces of diverse input patterns. Experiments with 20 participants showed an average recognition rate of 87.38% F1 score for 29 different symbolic patterns 26 lower case alphabet characters and three functional input patterns representing Space Backspace and Enter keys demonstrating the promise of our EOG-based eye-writing recognition system in practical scenarios.
