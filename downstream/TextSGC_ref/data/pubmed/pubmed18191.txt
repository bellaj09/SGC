Defects confined to spatial memory can severely affect a variety of daily life activities such as remembering the location of objects or navigating the environment until now the skills involved have been mostly assessed with regard to the visual domain using traditional pencil and paper tests. Our aim was to test the efficacy of a recently developed psychometric instrument Walking Corsi Test: WalCT to assess the specific contribution of spatial memory to the complex task of retrieving route knowledge. The WalCT is a 3  2.5-m version of the well-known Corsi Block-tapping Test CBT in which patients are required to memorize and replicate a sequence of body displacements. We assessed the ability of left and right brain-damaged patients as well as healthy young and senior controls to perform both the CBT and the WalCT. Results showed differences related to age in the healthy individuals and specific functional dissociations in the brain-damaged patients. The double dissociations found in this study demonstrate the importance of having a task able to detect navigational disorders because virtual reality tasks are often much too difficult for aged brain-damaged patients to perform. Dissociated deficits of visuo-spatial memory in near space and navigational space: evidence from brain-damaged patients and healthy older participants.
