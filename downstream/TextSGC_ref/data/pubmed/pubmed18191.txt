The importance of evaluating the functional capacity of patients with COPD is well known and there is a wide range of tests described in the literature. The 6-min stationary walk test associated with virtual reality STVR-6 was created in light of the current limitations of evaluation tests. It does not require a large physical space or sophisticated equipment and it is not costly; furthermore it can be performed by a single rater. The objective of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reproducibility and to verify the criterion validity of the STVR-6. Reproducibility and Validity of the 6-Minute Stationary Walk Test Associated With Virtual Reality in Subjects With COPD.
