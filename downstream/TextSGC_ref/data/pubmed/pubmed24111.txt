Patients have typically been passive participants in their own healthcare. However with a change in philosophy towards outcomes driven care it has become necessary to make sure that patients mutually set their healthcare goals with their providers Both eHealth and mobile health applications have required patient participation in ways never before valued. The virtual reality world of Second Life offers one eHealth solution that requires computer literate patients to participate via avatars in synchronous healthcare visits and support groups as well as explore online resources asynchronously. This paper describes the development of a Second Life environment that served as a platform for nurse practitioner driven care supplemented by a patient portal as well as the institutional electronic health record. In addition the use of Second Life is described as an active exercise to expose students in a Consumer Health course to support groups and resources available to actively engage patients.
