Human alpha satellite and satellite 2/3 contribute to several percent of the human genome. However identifying these sequences with traditional algorithms is computationally intensive. Here we develop dna-brnn a recurrent neural network to learn the sequences of the two classes of centromeric repeats. It achieves high similarity to RepeatMasker and is times faster. Dna-brnn explores a novel application of deep learning and may accelerate the study of the evolution of the two repeat classes. Identifying centromeric satellites with dna-brnn.
