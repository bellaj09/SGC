With the advent of susceptibility-weighted imaging SWI the ability to identify cerebral microbleeds CMBs associated with mild traumatic brain injury mTBI has become increasingly commonplace. Nevertheless the clinical significance of post-traumatic CMBs remains controversial partly because it is unclear whether mTBI-related CMBs entail brain circuitry disruptions which although structurally subtle are functionally significant. This study combines magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging MRI and DTI to map white matter WM circuitry differences across 6 months in 26 healthy control volunteers and in 26 older mTBI victims with acute CMBs of traumatic etiology. Six months post-mTBI significant changes p < 0.001 in the mean fractional anisotropy of perilesional WM bundles were identified in 21 volunteers and an average of 47%  = 21% of TBI-related CMBs were associated with such changes. These results suggest that CMBs can be associated with lasting changes in perilesional WM properties even relatively far from CMB locations. Future strategies for mTBI care will likely rely on the ability to assess how subtle circuitry changes impact neural/cognitive function. Thus assessing CMB effects upon the structural connectome can play a useful role when studying CMB sequelae and their potential impact upon the clinical outcome of individuals with concussion.
