Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is associated with hyperarousal and active fight or flight defensive responses. By contrast the dissociative subtype of PTSD characterized by depersonalization and derealization symptoms is frequently accompanied by additional passive or submissive defensive responses associated with autonomic blunting.\xa0Here the periaqueductal gray PAG plays a central role in defensive responses where the dorsolateral DL-PAG and ventrolateral PAG VL-PAG are thought to mediate active and passive defensive responses respectively. fMRI functional connectivity of the periaqueductal gray in PTSD and its dissociative subtype.
