It is essential but quite challenging to alleviate speech information loss and distortion while developing the speech processing algorithms in hearing aids. Recently many speech enhancement methods based on deep learning are proven effective. However most of the algorithms fail to achieve real-time processing which is significant for hearing aids especially for a smartphone-centered binaural hearing aid system. A supervised speech enhancement method based on an RNN structure is proposed to address the real-time problem. The problem is explored as a resource-constrained speech intelligibility improvement problem with the target of improving speech intelligibility at low SNR situations. Both the objective and subjective experimental results using the standard evaluation metrics and the experiments on volunteers respectively have verified the superiority of the proposed method.
