"Long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs are emerging as a novel class of noncoding RNAs and potent gene regulators which play an important and varied role in cellular functions. lncRNAs are closely related with the occurrence and development of some diseases. High-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques combined with de novo assembly have identified a large number of novel transcripts. The discovery of large and hidden transcriptomes urgently requires the development of effective computational methods that can rapidly distinguish between coding and long noncoding RNAs. In this study we developed a powerful predictor named as lncRNA-MFDL to identify lncRNAs by fusing multiple features of the open reading frame k-mer the secondary structure and the most-like coding domain sequence and using deep learning classification algorithms. Using the same human training dataset and a 10-fold cross validation test lncRNA-MFDL can achieve 97.1% prediction accuracy which is 5.7 3.7 and 3.4% higher than that of CPC CNCI and lncRNA-FMFSVM predictors respectively. Compared with CPC and CNCI predictors in other species e.g. anole lizard zebrafish chicken gorilla macaque mouse lamprey orangutan xenopus and C. elegans testing datasets the new lncRNA-MFDL predictor is also much more effective and robust. These results show that lncRNA-MFDL is a powerful tool for identifying lncRNAs.
