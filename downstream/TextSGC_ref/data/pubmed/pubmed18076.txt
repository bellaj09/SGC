Anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC is the most lethal of all thyroid cancers and one of the most aggressive human carcinomas. In the search for effective treatment options research toward targeted personalized therapies is proving to be a path with great potential. As we gain a deeper understanding of the genetic eg BRAFV600E PIK3CA TP53 hTERT mutations etc and epigenetic eg histone methylation histone de-acetylation microRNA regulatory circuits etc alterations driving ATC we are able to find targets when developing novel therapies to improve the lives of patients. Beyond development we can look into the effectiveness of already approved targeted therapies eg anti-BRAFV600E selective inhibitors tyrosine kinase inhibitors histone deacetylase inhibitors inhibitors of DNA methylation etc to potentially test in ATC after learning the molecular mechanisms that aid in tumor progression. Personalized therapy in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer: targeting genetic and epigenetic alterations.
