This work presents a brain-computer interface BCI used to operate a robotic wheelchair. The experiments were performed on 15 subjects 13 of them healthy. The BCI is based on steady-state visual-evoked potentials SSVEP and the stimuli flickering are performed at high frequency 37 38 39 and 40 Hz. This high frequency stimulation scheme can reduce or even eliminate visual fatigue allowing the user to achieve a stable performance for long term BCI operation. The BCI system uses power-spectral density analysis associated to three bipolar electroencephalographic channels. As the results show 2 subjects were reported as SSVEP-BCI illiterates not able to use the BCI and consequently 13 subjects 12 of them healthy could navigate the wheelchair in a room with obstacles arranged in four distinct configurations. Volunteers expressed neither discomfort nor fatigue due to flickering stimulation. A transmission rate of up to 72.5 bits/min was obtained with an average of 44.6 bits/min in four trials. These results show that people could effectively navigate a robotic wheelchair using a SSVEP-based BCI with high frequency flickering stimulation. Commanding a robotic wheelchair with a high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential based brain-computer interface.
