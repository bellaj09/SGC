Volume and ejection fraction EF measurements of the left ventricle LV in 2D echocardiography is associated with a high uncertainty due to inter-observer variability of the manual measurement but also due to ultrasound acquisition errors such as apical foreshortening. In this work a real-time and fully automated ejection fraction measurement and foreshortening detection method is proposed. The method uses several deep learning components such as view classification cardiac cycle timing segmentation and landmark extraction to measure the amount of foreshortening LV volume and EF. A dataset of 500 patients from an outpatient clinic was used to train the deep neural networks while a separate dataset of 100 patients from another clinic was used for evaluation where LV volume and EF were measured by an expert using clinical protocols and software. A quantitative analysis using 3D ultrasound showed that EF is considerably affected by apical foreshortening and that the proposed method can detect and quantify the amount of apical foreshortening. The bias and standard deviation of the automatic EF measurements were -3.68.1% while the mean absolute difference was measured at 7.2% which are all within the inter-observer variability and comparable with related studies. The proposed real-time pipeline allows for a continuous acquisition and measurement workflow without user interaction and has the potential to significantly reduce time spent on analysis and measurement error due to foreshortening while providing quantitative volume measurements in the everyday echo lab.
