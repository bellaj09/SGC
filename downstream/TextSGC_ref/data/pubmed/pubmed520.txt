"In addition to the absolute case number a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases within a short time was supposed to result in insufficiency of the healthcare system and further negatively affect patients outcomes. This study was conducted to investigate the association between the outcomes of COVID-19 patients and daily cumulative index DCI which was defined as the average daily number of new cases of COVID-19 and calculated by cumulative cases/number of days between the first reported case and March 6 2020 by country. Spearmans rank correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between mortality incidence and DCI. In this study we found that DCI was positively correlated with incidence adjusted risk ratio aRR\u202f=\u202f1.01 95% confidence interval CI\u202f=\u202f1.00-1.02 p < 0.01. Higher correlation between mortality and DCI mortality rate: r\u202f=\u202f0.397 p\u202f=\u202f0.018; mortality per 1000000 people: r\u202f=\u202f0.0.428 p\u202f=\u202f0.004 was observed than disease incidence. DCI remained statistically associated with mortality per 1000000 people after adjustment of Health Care Index aRR\u202f=\u202f1.02 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.01-1.03 p < 0.001 or Healthcare Access and Quality Index aRR\u202f=\u202f1.02 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.01-1.04 p < 0.01. Reducing DCI through strict infection control measures can help slow the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and further improve outcome in COVID-19 patients."
