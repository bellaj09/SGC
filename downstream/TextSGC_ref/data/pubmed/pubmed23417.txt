Virtual reality VR systems can offer benefits of improved ergonomics but their resolution may currently be limited for the detection of small features. For detection of lung nodules we compared the performance of VR versus standard picture archiving and communication system PACS monitor. Four radiologists and 1 novice radiologist reviewed axial computed tomography CTs of the thorax using standard PACS monitors SM and a VR system HTC Vive HTC. In this study 3 radiologists evaluated axial lung-window CT images of a Lungman phantom. One radiologist and the novice radiologist reviewed axial lung-window patient CT thoracic images 32 patients. This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Detection of 227 lung nodules on patient CTs did not result in different sensitivity with SM compared with VR. Detection of 23 simulated Lungman phantom lung nodules on CT with SM resulted in statistically greater sensitivity 78.3% than with VR 52.2% P = .041 for 1 of 3 radiologists. The trend was similar but not significant for the other radiologists. There was no significant difference in the time spent by readers reviewing CT images with VR versus SM. These findings indicate that performance of a commercially available VR system for detection of lung nodules may be similar to traditional radiology monitors for assessment of small lung nodules on CTs of the thorax for most radiologists. These results along with the potential of improving ergonomics for radiologists are promising for the future development of VR in diagnostic radiology.
