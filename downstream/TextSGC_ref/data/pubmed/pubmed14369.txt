As a typical deep-learning model Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs can be exploited to automatically extract features from images using the hierarchical structure inspired by mammalian visual system. For image classification tasks traditional CNN models employ the softmax function for classification. However owing to the limited capacity of the softmax function there are some shortcomings of traditional CNN models in image classification. To deal with this problem a new method combining Biomimetic Pattern Recognition BPR with CNNs is proposed for image classification. BPR performs class recognition by a union of geometrical cover sets in a high-dimensional feature space and therefore can overcome some disadvantages of traditional pattern recognition. The proposed method is evaluated on three famous image classification benchmarks that is MNIST AR and CIFAR-10. The classification accuracies of the proposed method for the three datasets are 99.01% 98.40% and 87.11% respectively which are much higher in comparison with the other four methods in most cases.
