Spinal cord injury SCI often leaves affected individuals unable to ambulate. Electroencephalogram EEG based brain-computer interface BCI controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility the authors developed and tested a novel EEG-based data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment VRE. Self-paced brain-computer interface control of ambulation in a virtual reality environment.
