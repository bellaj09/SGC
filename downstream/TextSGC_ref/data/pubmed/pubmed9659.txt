Peptide-based vaccine development needs accurate prediction of the binding affinity between major histocompatibility complex I MHC I proteins and their peptide ligands. Nowadays more and more machine learning methods have been developed to predict binding affinity and some of them have become the popular tools. However most of them are designed by the shallow neural networks. Bengio said that deep neural networks can learn better fits with less data than shallow neural networks. In our case some of the alleles only have dozens of peptide data. In addition we transform each peptide into a characteristic matrix and input it into the model. As we know when dealing with the problem that the input is a matrix convolutional neural network CNN can find the most critical features by itself. Obviously compared with the traditional neural network model CNN is more suitable for predicting binding affinity. Different from the previous studies which are based on blocks substitution matrix BLOSUM we used novel feature to do the prediction. Since we consider that the order of the sequence hydropathy index polarity and the length of the peptide could affect the binding affinity and the properties of these amino acids are key factors for their binding to MHC we extracted these information from each peptide. In order to make full use of the data we have obtained we have integrated different lengths of peptides into 15mer based on the binding mode of peptide to MHC I. In order to demonstrate that our method is reliable to predict peptide-MHC binding we compared our method with several popular methods. The experiments show the superiority of our method.
