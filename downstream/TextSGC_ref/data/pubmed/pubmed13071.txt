Translation initiation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites TISs the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs including both AUG and non-AUG codons which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution e.g. GTI-seq and QTI-seq provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification.
