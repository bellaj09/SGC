Age-related macular degeneration AMD is a common threat to vision. While classification of disease stages is critical to understanding disease risk and progression several systems based on color fundus photographs are known. Most of these require in-depth and time-consuming analysis of fundus images. Herein we present an automated computer-based classification algorithm. A Deep Learning Algorithm for Prediction of Age-Related Eye Disease Study Severity Scale for Age-Related Macular Degeneration from Color Fundus Photography.
