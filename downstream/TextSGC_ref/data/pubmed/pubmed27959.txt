Visual brain-computer interfaces BCIs often yield high performance only when targets are fixated with the eyes. Furthermore many paradigms use intense visual stimulation which can be irritating especially in long BCI sessions. However BCIs can more directly directly tap the neural processes underlying visual attention. Covert shifts of visual attention induce changes in oscillatory alpha activity in posterior cortex even in the absence of visual stimulation. The aim was to investigate whether different pairs of directions of attention shifts can be reliably differentiated based on the electroencephalogram. To this end healthy participants N = 8 had to strictly fixate a central dot and covertly shift visual attention to one out of six cued directions. Brain-computer interfacing using modulations of alpha activity induced by covert shifts of attention.
