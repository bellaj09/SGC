"Changes and developments in child health have led to children who would not normally have lived surviving with very complex needs. The psychosocial impact on the family unit is immense which in turn has had an effect on childrens nursing and nurse education. Psychological and sociological needs of the child and family are therefore pivotal in any childrens nursing curriculum. As a clinician I have a wealth of experience caring for families whose child has cancer and therefore have an in depth knowledge of the pressures they face throughout their childs illness trajectory. Fortunately I have not personally lived the experience therefore it would seem that a parent would have much to contribute to the learning of student nurses regarding the psychosocial impact of diagnosis of a life-threatening illness on the child and family. This action research study examines and demonstrates the value of a parent in fostering deep learning in childrens nursing students."
