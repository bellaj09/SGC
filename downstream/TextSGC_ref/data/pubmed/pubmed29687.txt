Achieving high classification performance in electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs often entails a large number of channels which impedes their use in practical applications. Despite the previous efforts it remains a challenge to determine the optimal subset of channels in a subject-specific manner without heavily compromising the classification performance. In this article we propose a new method called spatiotemporal-filtering-based channel selection STECS to automatically identify a designated number of discriminative channels by leveraging the spatiotemporal information of the EEG data. In STECS the channel selection problem is cast under the framework of spatiotemporal filter optimization by incorporating a group sparsity constraints and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The performance of STECS is assessed on three motor imagery EEG datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art spatiotemporal filtering algorithms using full EEG channels STECS yields comparable classification performance with only half of the channels. Moreover STECS significantly outperforms the existing channel selection methods. These results suggest that this algorithm holds promise for simplifying BCI setups and facilitating practical utility.
