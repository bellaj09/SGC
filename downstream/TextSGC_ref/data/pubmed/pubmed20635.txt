Electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs often use spatial filters to improve signal-to-noise ratio of task-related EEG activities. To obtain robust spatial filters large amounts of labeled data which are often expensive and labor-intensive to obtain need to be collected in a training procedure before online BCI control. Several studies have recently developed zero-training methods using a session-to-session scenario in order to alleviate this problem. To our knowledge a state-to-state translation which applies spatial filters derived from one state to another has never been reported. This study proposes a state-to-state zero-training method to construct spatial filters for extracting EEG changes induced by motor imagery. Independent component analysis ICA was separately applied to the multi-channel EEG in the resting and the motor imagery states to obtain motor-related spatial filters. The resultant spatial filters were then applied to single-trial EEG to differentiate left- and right-hand imagery movements. On a motor imagery dataset collected from nine subjects comparable classification accuracies were obtained by using ICA-based spatial filters derived from the two states motor imagery: 87.0% resting: 85.9% which were both significantly higher than the accuracy achieved by using monopolar scalp EEG data 80.4%. The proposed method considerably increases the practicality of BCI systems in real-world environments because it is less sensitive to electrode misalignment across different sessions or days and does not require annotated pilot data to derive spatial filters.
