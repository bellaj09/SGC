Cortical activity has been shown to correlate with different parameters of movement. However the dynamic properties of cortico-motor mappings still remain unexplored in humans. Here we show that during the repetition of simple stereotyped wrist movements both stable and unstable correlates simultaneously emerge in human sensorimotor cortex. Using visual feedback of wrist movement target inferred online from MEG we assessed the dynamics of the tuning properties of two neuronal signals: the MEG signal below 1.6 Hz and within the 4 to 6 Hz range. We found that both components are modulated by wrist movement allowing for closed-loop inference of movement targets. Interestingly while tuning of 4 to 6 Hz signals remained stable over time leading to stable inference of movement target using a static classifier the tuning of cortical signals below 1.6 Hz significantly changed resulting in steadily decreasing inference accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that non-invasive neuronal population signals in human sensorimotor cortex can reflect a stable correlate of voluntary movements. Hence we provide first evidence for a stable control signal in non-invasive human brain-machine interface research. However as not all neuronal signals initially tuned to movement were stable across days a careful selection of features for real-life applications seems to be mandatory.
