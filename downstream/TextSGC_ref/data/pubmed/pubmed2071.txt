The S100B protein is an intra-cellular calcium-binding protein that mainly resides in astrocytes in the central nervous system. The serum level of S100B is used as biomarker for the severity of brain damage in traumatic brain injury TBI patients. In this study we investigated the relationship between intrinsic resting-state brain connectivity measured 1-22\xa0days mean 8\xa0days after trauma and serum levels of S100B in a patient cohort with mild-to-severe TBI in need of neuro-intensive care in the acute phase. In line with previous investigations our results show that the peak level of S100B acquired during the acute phase of TBI was negatively correlated with behavioral measures Glasgow Outcome Score GOS of functional outcome assessed 6 to 12\xa0months post injury. Using a multi-variate pattern analysis-informed seed-based correlation analysis we show that the strength of resting-state brain connectivity in multiple resting-state networks was negatively correlated with the peak of serum levels of S100B. A negative correspondence between S100B peak levels recorded 12-36\xa0h after trauma and intrinsic connectivity was found for brain regions located in the default mode fronto-parietal visual and motor resting-state networks. Our results suggest that resting-state brain connectivity measures acquired during the acute phase of TBI is concordant with results obtained from molecular biomarkers and that it may hold a capacity to predict long-term cognitive outcome in TBI patients. Functional resting-state fMRI connectivity correlates with serum levels of the S100B protein in the acute phase of traumatic brain injury.
