Subcortical reflexive motor responses are under continuous cortical control to produce the most effective behaviour. For example the excitability of brainstem circuitry subserving the defensive hand-blink reflex HBR a response elicited by intense somatosensory stimuli to the wrist depends on a number of properties of the eliciting stimulus. These include face-hand proximity which has allowed the description of an HBR response field around the face commonly referred to as a defensive peripersonal space DPPS as well as stimulus movement and probability of stimulus occurrence. However the effect of stimulus-independent movements of objects in the environment has not been explored. Here we used virtual reality to test whether and how the HBR-derived DPPS is affected by the presence and movement of threatening objects in the environment. In two experiments conducted on 40 healthy volunteers we observed that threatening arrows flying towards the participant result in DPPS expansion an effect directionally-tuned towards the source of the arrows. These results indicate that the excitability of brainstem circuitry subserving the HBR is continuously adjusted taking into account the movement of environmental objects. Such adjustments fit in a framework where the relevance of defensive actions is continually evaluated to maximise their survival value. Movement of environmental threats modifies the relevance of the defensive eye-blink in a spatially-tuned manner.
