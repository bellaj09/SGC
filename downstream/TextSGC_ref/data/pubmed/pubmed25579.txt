Recently electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have attracted much attention in the fields of neural engineering and rehabilitation due to their noninvasiveness. However the low communication speed of current BCI systems greatly limits their practical application. In this paper we present a high-speed BCI based on code modulation of visual evoked potentials c-VEP. Thirty-two target stimuli were modulated by a time-shifted binary pseudorandom sequence. A multichannel identification method based on canonical correlation analysis CCA was used for target identification. The online system achieved an average information transfer rate ITR of 108  12 bits min-1 on five subjects with a maximum ITR of 123 bits min-1 for a single subject.
