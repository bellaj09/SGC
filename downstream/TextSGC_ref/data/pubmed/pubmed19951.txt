The digitization of society has an increasing impact on healthcare in general and therefore also on psychiatry.<br/> AIM: To provide an overview of digital developments and their influence on the design of future professional psychiatric care.<br/> METHOD: With the help of examples from literature show how digitization will influence diagnostic procedures as well as psychiatric treatment.<br/> RESULTS: Digitization will have a major impact on psychiatric diagnostics and treatment. For example psychiatric diagnostics will be strengthened by continuous monitoring of behaviour with digital wearables and the collection of large amounts of personal data. How we deal with these new sources of information needs to be developed in everyday practice. Psychiatric treatments with E-health online therapies apps and virtual reality are being developed rapidly. There is increasing evidence concerning the efficacy of these treatments in a variety of patient groups.<br/> CONCLUSION: The digital revolution in psychiatric health services has just begun. To maximise the benefits of digitization for psychiatry it is necessary to connect technological possibilities with well-founded scientific knowledge professional expertise expectations and needs of patients and clear legal instructions.
