"Transradial access is associated with enhanced patients comfort significant lower complication rates in diagnostic coronary angiography and better immediate and long-term outcomes after transradial percutaneous coronary interventions. Access failure has been reported to occur in less than 3-7% of cases due to anatomical circumstances e.g. anomalous radial branching patterns tortuosity e.g. radial loops and small radial artery diameters. Radial coronary angiography and angioplasty entail a secondary learning curve of at least 150 cases in order to become familiar and comfortable with this technique. In contrast to previous established techniques e.g. Sones-arteriotomy the patient should be positioned in a comfortable supine position with his right arm next to his hip and the interventionist next to the right side of the patient. 19 gauge needles and 0.018 inch wires enhance the chance of successful cannulation the radial artery. A spasmolytic cocktail 3 mg Dinitrate 3 mg verapamil at least 3.000 U Heparine should always be given intraarterially. Longer sheaths > 13 cm are not necessary. Essential for easy passage of the vertebralian artery and the common brachio-cephalic trunc as the most dangerous part of the procedure in order to reach the ascending aorta the patient should be asked for a deep inspiration and/or dorsoflexion of his head An Amplatz-II catheter can be used for LCA RCA and in some cases for LV-angiogram. The sheath should always be removed immediately and hemostasis achieved by radial compression e.g. clamp. There is a close relationship between access failure respective radial spasm or occlusions and anatomical circumstances i.e. hypoplastic radial artery radioulnar loop or small radial diameters: radial diameter-to-catheter ration < 1.0; assessment by Duplex. Although the radial access can be used in the majority of patients the use is limited in patients with very small radial diameters and/or with complex lesions e.g kissing balloon etc." Transradial percutaneous coronary interventions: technique materials & procedure in the light of anatomical and technical considerations.
