Surgical treatment of tibial head fractures can be challenging due to the close anatomic relationship to the knee joint which can be affected including its intraarticular structures. Frequently soft tissue damages are present which can have a strong impact on the planning and choice of surgical technique. An important therapeutic requirement is the anatomic reconstruction and high primary stability to allow early functional treatment. The aim of the present study was to describe a recent locking device and its surgical technique and to analyse the early results. Proximal tibia fracture treatment with a new locking device                     with polyaxial screw placement: technique and early results.
