"Minimizing the foreign body reaction to polyimide-based implanted devices plays a pivotal role in several biomedical applications. In this work we propose materials exhibiting nonbiofouling properties and a Youngs modulus reflecting that of soft human tissues. We describe the synthesis characterization and in vitro validation of polycarboxybetaine hydrogel coatings covalently attached to polyimide substrates via a photolabile 4-azidophenyl group incorporated in polycarboxybetaine chains at two concentrations of 1.6 and 3.1 mol %. The presence of coatings was confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. White light interferometry was used to evaluate the coating continuity and thickness between 3 and 6 m under dry conditions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy allowed us to quantify the thickness of the swollen hydrogel coatings that ranged between 13 and 32 m. The different hydrogel formulations resulted in stiffness values ranging from 2 to 19 kPa and led to different fibroblast and macrophage responses in vitro. Both cell types showed a minimum adhesion on the softest hydrogel type. In addition both the overall macrophage activation and cytotoxicity were observed to be negligible for all of the tested material formulations. These results are a promising starting point toward future advanced implantable systems. In particular such technology paves the way for novel neural interfaces able to minimize the fibrotic reaction once implanted in vivo and to maximize their long-term stability and functionality."
