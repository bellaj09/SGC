We exploit flow propagation on the directed neuronal network of the nematode C. elegans to reveal dynamically relevant features of its connectome. We find flow-based groupings of neurons at different levels of granularity which we relate to functional and anatomical constituents of its nervous system. A systematic in silico evaluation of the full set of single and double neuron ablations is used to identify deletions that induce the most severe disruptions of the multi-resolution flow structure. Such ablations are linked to functionally relevant neurons and suggest potential candidates for further in vivo investigation. In addition we use the directional patterns of incoming and outgoing network flows at all scales to identify flow profiles for the neurons in the connectome without pre-imposing a priori categories. The four flow roles identified are linked to signal propagation motivated by biological input-response scenarios. Flow-Based Network Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans Connectome.
