"Background and objective: The development of objective assessment tools for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD has become a hot research topic in recent years. This study was conducted to explore the feasibility and availability of virtual reality VR for evaluating symptoms of ADHD. Methods: School-aged children were recruited. The children with ADHD or without ADHD were assigned into the ADHD group or Control group respectively. They were all evaluated using the Conners Parent Rating Scale CPRS Child Behavior Checklist CBCL Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test IVA-CPT and a VR test. Results: The correct items incorrect items and the accuracy rate of the VR test of the children with ADHD were significantly different with those of the children in the Control group. The correct items incorrect items total time and accuracy of the VR test were significantly correlated with the scores of IVA-CPT auditory attention and visual attention CPRS impulsion/hyperactivity and ADHD index and CBCL attention problems and social problems respectively. Discussion: The results supported the discriminant validity of the VR test for evaluating ADHD in school-age children suffering from learning problems. The VR test results are associated with the commonly used clinical measurements results. A VR test is interesting for children and therefore it attracts them to complete the test; whilst at the same time it can also effectively evaluate ADHD symptoms."
