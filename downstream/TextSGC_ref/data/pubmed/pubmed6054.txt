Semantic processing is central to cognition and is supported by widely distributed gray matter GM regions and white matter WM tracts. The exact manner in which GM regions are anatomically connected to process semantics remains unknown. We mapped the semantic anatomical network connectome by conducting diffusion imaging tractography in 48 healthy participants across 90 GM "nodes" and correlating the integrity of each obtained WM edge and semantic performance across 80 brain-damaged patients. Fifty-three WM edges were obtained whose lower integrity associated with semantic deficits and together with their linked GM nodes constitute a semantic WM network. Graph analyses of this network revealed three structurally segregated modules that point to distinct semantic processing components and identified network hubs and connectors that are central in the communication across the subnetworks. Together our results provide an anatomical framework of human semantic network advancing the understanding of the structural substrates supporting semantic processing.
