Scalp EEG is the most widely used modality to record the electrical signals of the brain. It is well known that the volume conduction of these brain waves through the brain cerebrospinal fluid skull and scalp reduces the spatial resolution and the signal amplitude. So far the volume conduction has primarily been investigated by realistic head models or interictal spike analysis. We have set up a novel and more realistic experiment that made it possible to compare the information in the intra- and extracranial EEG. We found that intracranial EEG channels contained correlated patterns when placed less than 30 mm apart that intra- and extracranial channels were partly correlated when placed less than 40 mm apart and that extracranial channels probably were correlated over larger distances. The underlying cortical area that influences the extracranial EEG is found to be up to 45 cm2. This area is larger than previously reported. Correlation between intra- and extracranial background EEG.
