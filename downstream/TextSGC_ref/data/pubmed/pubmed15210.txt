Big web data from sources including online news and Twitter are good resources for investigating deep learning. However collected news articles and tweets almost certainly contain data unnecessary for learning and this disturbs accurate learning. This paper explores the performance of word2vec Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs to classify news articles and tweets into related and unrelated ones. Using two word embedding algorithms of word2vec Continuous Bag-of-Word CBOW and Skip-gram we constructed CNN with the CBOW model and CNN with the Skip-gram model. We measured the classification accuracy of CNN with CBOW CNN with Skip-gram and CNN without word2vec models for real news articles and tweets. The experimental results indicated that word2vec significantly improved the accuracy of the classification model. The accuracy of the CBOW model was higher and more stable when compared to that of the Skip-gram model. The CBOW model exhibited better performance on news articles and the Skip-gram model exhibited better performance on tweets. Specifically CNN with word2vec models was more effective on news articles when compared to that on tweets because news articles are typically more uniform when compared to tweets.
