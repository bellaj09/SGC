Deep learning approaches have been recently applied to traffic prediction because of their ability to extract features of traffic data. While convolutional neural networks may improve the predictive accuracy by transiting traffic data to images and extracting features in the images the convolutional results can be improved by using the global-level representation that is a direct way to extract features. The time intervals are not considered as aspects of convolutional neural networks for traffic prediction. The attention mechanism may adaptively select a sequence of regions and only process the selected regions to better extract features when aspects are considered. In this paper we propose the attention mechanism over the convolutional result for traffic prediction. The proposed method is based on multiple links. The time interval is considered as the aspect of attention mechanism. Based on the dataset provided by Highways England the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better accuracy than the baseline methods.
