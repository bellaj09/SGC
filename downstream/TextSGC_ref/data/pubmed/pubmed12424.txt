"Deep Brain Stimulation DBS is a widely used therapy to ameliorate symptoms experienced by patients with Parkinsons Disease PD. Conventional DBS is continuously ON even though PD symptoms fluctuate over time leading to undesirable side-effects and high energy requirements. This study investigates the use of a Iogistic regression-based classifier to identify periods when PD patients have rest tremor exploiting Local Field Potentials LFPs recorded with DBS electrodes implanted in the Subthalamic Nucleus in 7 PD patients 8 hemispheres. Analyzing 36.1 minutes of data with a 512 milliseconds non-overlapping window the classification accuracy was well above chance-level for all patients with Area Under the Curve AUC ranging from 0.67 to 0.93. The features with the most discriminative ability were in descending order power in the 31-45 Hz 5-7 Hz 21-30 Hz 46-55 Hz and 56-95 Hz frequency bands. These results suggest that using a machine learning-based classifier such as the one proposed in this study can form the basis for on-demand DBS therapy for PD tremor with the potential to reduce side-effects and lower battery consumption."
