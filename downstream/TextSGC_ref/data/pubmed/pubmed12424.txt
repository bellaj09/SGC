Fine needle aspiration FNA is the procedure of choice for evaluating thyroid nodules. It is indicated for nodules >2\u200acm even in cases of very low suspicion of malignancy. FNA has associated risks and expenses. In this study we developed an image analysis model using a deep learning algorithm and evaluated if the algorithm could predict thyroid nodules with benign FNA results.Ultrasonographic images of thyroid nodules with cytologic or histologic results were retrospectively collected. For algorithm training 1358 670 benign 688 malignant thyroid nodule images were input into the Inception-V3 network model. The model was pretrained to classify nodules as benign or malignant using the ImageNet database. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was tested with the prospectively collected internal n\u200a=\u200a55 and external test sets n\u200a=\u200a100.For the internal test set 20 of the 21 FNA malignant nodules were correctly classified as malignant by the algorithm sensitivity 95.2%; and of the 22 nodules algorithm classified as benign 21 were FNA benign negative predictive value NPV 95.5%. For the external test set 47 of the 50 FNA malignant nodules were correctly classified by the algorithm sensitivity 94.0%; and of the 31 nodules the algorithm classified as benign 28 were FNA benign NPV 90.3%.The sensitivity and NPV of the deep learning algorithm shown in this study are promising. Artificial intelligence may assist clinicians to recognize nodules that are likely to be benign and avoid unnecessary FNA.
