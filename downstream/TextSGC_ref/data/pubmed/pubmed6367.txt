People with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder FASD often have structural or functional alterations of the central nervous system including changes in brain network organization. These have been associated with neuropsychological deficits but outcomes are not consistent across studies. We used a rat model of FASD to assess brain network alterations in males and females following ethanol exposure during a prenatal period similar to the first half of gestation in humans. Alterations in the whole brain network organization after prenatal ethanol exposure.
