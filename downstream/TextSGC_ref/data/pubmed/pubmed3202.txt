Advances in computational network analysis have enabled the characterization of topological properties of human brain networks connectomics from high angular resolution diffusion imaging HARDI MRI structural measurements. In this study the effect of changing the diffusion weighting b value and sampling number of gradient directions was investigated in ten healthy volunteers with specific focus on graph theoretical network metrics used to characterize the human connectome. Structural connectome with high angular resolution diffusion imaging MRI: assessing the impact of diffusion weighting and sampling on graph-theoretic measures.
