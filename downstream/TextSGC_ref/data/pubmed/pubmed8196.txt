Machine Learning especially deep learning has been used in typical x-ray computed tomography CT applications including image reconstruction image enhancement image\xa0domain feature detection and image\xa0domain feature characterization. To our knowledge this is the first study on machine learning for feature detection and analysis directly based on CT projection data. Specifically we present neural network methods for blood vessel detection and characterization in the sinogram domain avoiding any partial volume beam hardening or motion artifacts introduced during reconstruction. First we estimate sinogram\xa0domain vessel maps using a residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network REDCNN. Next we estimate the vessel centerline and we extract the vessel-only sinogram from the original sinogram eliminating any background information. Finally we use a fully connected neural network to estimate the vessel lumen cross-sectional area from the vessel-only sinogram. We trained and tested the proposed methods using CatSim simulations real CT measurements of vessel phantoms and clinical data from the NIH CT image database. We achieved encouraging initial results showing the feasibility of CT analysis in the sinogram domain. In principle sinogram\xa0domain analysis should be possible for many other and more complicated clinical CT analysis tasks. Further studies are needed for this sinogram\xa0domain analysis approach to become practical for clinical applications.
