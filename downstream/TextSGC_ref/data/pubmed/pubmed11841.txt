"Purpose: To perform automatic assessment of dementia severity using a deep learning framework applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI data. Method: We divided 133 Alzheimers disease AD patients with clinical dementia rating CDR scores from 0.5 to 3 into two groups based on dementia severity; the groups with very mild/mild CDR: 0.5-1 and moderate to severe CDR: 2-3 dementia consisted of 77 and 56 subjects respectively. We used rs-fMRI to extract functional connectivity features calculated using independent component analysis ICA and performed automated severity classification with three-dimensional convolutional neural networks 3D-CNNs based on deep learning. Results: The mean balanced classification accuracy was 0.923  0.042 p < 0.001 with a specificity of 0.946  0.019 and sensitivity of 0.896  0.077. The rs-fMRI data indicated that the medial frontal sensorimotor executive control dorsal attention and visual related networks mainly correlated with dementia severity. Conclusions: Our CDR-based novel classification using rs-fMRI is an acceptable objective severity indicator. In the absence of trained neuropsychologists dementia severity can be objectively and accurately classified using a 3D-deep learning framework with rs-fMRI independent components."
