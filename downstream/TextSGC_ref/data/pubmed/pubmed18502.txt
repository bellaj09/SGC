Pediatric Rehabilitation therapists have always worked using a variety of off-the-shelf or custom-made objects and devices more recently including computer based systems. These Information and Communication Technology ICT solutions vary widely in complexity from easy-to-use interactive videogame consoles originally intended for entertainment purposes to sophisticated systems specifically developed for rehabilitation.This paper describes the principles underlying an innovative "Pediatric Rehabilitation 2.0" approach based on the combination of suitable ICT solutions and traditional rehabilitation which has been progressively refined while building up and using a computer-assisted rehabilitation laboratory. These principles are thus summarized in the acronym EPIQ to account for the terms Ecological Personalized Interactive and Quantitative. The paper also presents the laboratory which has been designed to meet the children\s rehabilitation needs and to empower therapists in their work. The laboratory is equipped with commercial hardware and specially developed software called VITAMIN: a virtual reality platform for motor and cognitive rehabilitation.
