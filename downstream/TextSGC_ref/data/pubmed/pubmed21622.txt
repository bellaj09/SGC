"In this work mechanical vibrotactile stimulation was applied to subjects left and right wrist skins with equal intensity and a selective sensation perception task was performed to achieve two types of selections similar to motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface. The proposed system was based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/ERS which had a correlation with processing of afferent inflow in human somatosensory system and attentional effect which modulated the ERD/ERS. The experiments were carried out on nine subjects without experience in selective sensation and six of them showed a discrimination accuracy above 80% three of them above 95%. Comparative experiments with motor imagery with and without presence of stimulation were also carried out which further showed the feasibility of selective sensation as an alternative BCI task complementary to motor imagery. Specifically there was significant improvement Formula: see text from near 65% in motor imagery with and without presence of stimulation to above 80% in selective sensation on some subjects. The proposed BCI modality might well cooperate with existing BCI modalities in the literature in enlarging the widespread usage of BCI system."
