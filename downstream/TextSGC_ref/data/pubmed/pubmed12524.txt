Biomedical imaging Is an important source of information in cancer research. Characterizations of cancer morphology at onset progression and in response to treatment provide complementary information to that gleaned from genomics and clinical data. Accurate extraction and classification of both visual and latent image features Is an increasingly complex challenge due to the increased complexity and resolution of biomedical image data. In this paper we present four deep learning-based image analysis methods from the Computational Precision Medicine CPM satellite event of the 21st International Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention MICCAI 2018 conference. One method Is a segmentation method designed to segment nuclei in whole slide tissue images WSIs of adult diffuse glioma cases. It achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.868 with the CPM challenge datasets. Three methods are classification methods developed to categorize adult diffuse glioma cases into oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma classes using radiographic and histologic image data. These methods achieved accuracy values of 0.75 0.80 and 0.90 measured as the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the number of total cases with the challenge datasets. The evaluations of the four methods indicate that 1 carefully constructed deep learning algorithms are able to produce high accuracy in the analysis of biomedical image data and 2 the combination of radiographic with histologic image information improves classification performance.
