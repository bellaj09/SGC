Virtual reality VR is as effective in inducing emotional responses as reality and its application is extremely valuable in exposure treatment. In virtual environments the patients experience similar physiological symptoms and fear as they do in real life situations thereby facilitating the habituation process. Our goal is to offer an overview of the current panorama of VR and psychotherapy underlining the virtual exposure technique and the studies that focus on panic disorder treatment through the use of VR. The literature was revised through consultation to the ISI and PubMed databases. Virtual exposure treatment offers good results and great patient acceptability. However despite the importance of this data for the evaluation of treatment efficacy only a few studies measure physiological responses during exposure. Lack of controlled studies and standardized treatment protocols were observed. Despite the great advance of VR use in psychotherapy a great deal of its potential is still unknown therefore requiring the creation of new virtual environments so that controlled studies regarding its clinical application can be conducted. Throughout the process of elaboration and investigation clinical experiences in virtual environments must be related to real experiences in a flexible context that combines relevant cultural physical and cognitive aspects. Virtual reality as a mechanism for exposure therapy.
