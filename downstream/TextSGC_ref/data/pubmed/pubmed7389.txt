Recent introduction of data-driven approaches based on deep-learning technology has revolutionized the field of nanophotonics by allowing efficient inverse design methods. In this paper a simultaneous inverse design of materials and structure parameters of core-shell nanoparticles is achieved for the first time using deep learning of a neural network. A neural network to learn the correlation between the extinction spectra of electric and magnetic dipoles and core-shell nanoparticle designs which include material information and shell thicknesses is developed and trained. We demonstrate deep-learning-assisted inverse design of core-shell nanoparticles for 1 spectral tuning electric dipole resonances 2 finding spectrally isolated pure magnetic dipole resonances and 3 finding spectrally overlapped electric dipole and magnetic dipole resonances. Our finding paves the way for the rapid development of nanophotonics by allowing a practical utilization of deep-learning technology for nanophotonic inverse design.
