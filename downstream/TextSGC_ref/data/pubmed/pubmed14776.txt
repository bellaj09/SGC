"Motion analysis is used in computer vision to understand the behaviour of moving objects in sequences of images. Optimising the interpretation of dynamic biological systems requires accurate and precise motion tracking as well as efficient representations of high-dimensional motion trajectories so that these can be used for prediction tasks. Here we use image sequences of the heart acquired using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to create time-resolved three-dimensional segmentations using a fully convolutional network trained on anatomical shape priors. This dense motion model formed the input to a supervised denoising autoencoder 4Dsurvival which is a hybrid network consisting of an autoencoder that learns a task-specific latent code representation trained on observed outcome data yielding a latent representation optimised for survival prediction. To handle right-censored survival outcomes our network used a Cox partial likelihood loss function. In a study of 302 patients the predictive accuracy quantified by Harrells C-index was significantly higher p = .0012 for our model C=0.75 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.79 than the human benchmark of C=0.59 95% CI: 0.53 - 0.65. This work demonstrates how a complex computer vision task using high-dimensional medical image data can efficiently predict human survival."
