Human body models are key components of VR surgical simulators. We overview here our efforts and share experience in constructing cerebral models and using them in VR-based applications for brain intervention. We have constructed four groups of brain atlases: anatomical functional vascular and physically-based. The atlas-assisted VR systems discussed here are applied to stereotactic and functional neurosurgery interventional neuroradiology and brain stereotaxy. We also briefly feature our concept of future surgery. Virtual reality in brain intervention: models and applications.
