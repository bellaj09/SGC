In this review we focus on research that has used technology to provide cognitive training - i.e. to improve performance on some measurable aspect of behaviour - in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. We review technology-enhanced interventions that target three different cognitive domains: a emotion and face recognition b language and literacy and c social skills. The interventions reviewed allow for interaction through different modes including point-and-click and eye-gaze contingent software and are delivered through diverse implementations including virtual reality and robotics. In each case we examine the evidence of the degree of post-training improvement observed following the intervention including evidence of transfer to altered behaviour in ecologically valid contexts. We conclude that a number of technological interventions have found that observed improvements within the computerised training paradigm fail to generalise to altered behaviour in more naturalistic settings which may result from problems that people with autism spectrum disorders experience in generalising and extrapolating knowledge. However we also point to several promising findings in this area. We discuss possible directions for future work.
