The aim of this literature review was to assemble an inventory of intervention strategies utilized for children diagnosed with cerebral palsy CP based on the Manual Ability Classification System MACS. The purpose of the inventory is to guide physicians and therapists in intervention selection aimed at improving upper limb function in children with CP. The following databases were searched: CINAHL Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ERIC Educational Research Information Center Google Scholar OTSeeker Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence OVID Ovid Technologies Inc. and PubMed. Inclusion criteria were whether the study 1 identified MACS levels of participants and 2 addressed the effectiveness of intervention on upper limb function. Overall 74 articles met the inclusion criteria. The summarized data identified 10 categories of intervention. The majority of participants across studies were MACS level II. The most frequently cited interventions were constraint-induced movement therapy CIMT bimanual training and virtual reality and computer-based training. Multiple interventions demonstrated effectiveness for upper limb improvement at each MACS level. However there is a need for additional research for interventions appropriate for MACS levels IV and V. To fully develop an intervention inventory based on manual ability future studies need to report MACS levels of participants particularly for splinting and therapy interventions used in combination with surgery.
