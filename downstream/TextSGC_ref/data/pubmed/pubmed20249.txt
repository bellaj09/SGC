The sense of "Presence" evolving from "telepresence" has always been associated with virtual reality research and is still an exceptionally mystifying constituent. Now the study of presence clearly spans over various disciplines associated with cognition. This paper attempts to put forth a concept that argues that it\s an experience of an "Evoked Reality ER" illusion of reality that triggers an "Evoked Presence EP" sense of presence in our minds. A Three Pole Reality Model is proposed to explain this phenomenon. The poles range from Dream Reality to Simulated Reality with Primary Physical Reality at the center. To demonstrate the relationship between ER and EP a Reality-Presence Map is developed. We believe that this concept of ER and the proposed model may have significant applications in the study of presence and in exploring the possibilities of not just virtual reality but also what we call "reality." Achieving Presence through Evoked Reality.
