"An entitys existence in an image can be depicted by the activity instantiation vector from a group of neurons called capsule. Recently multi-layered capsules called CapsNet have proven to be state-of-the-art for image classification tasks. This research utilizes the prowess of this algorithm to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray CXR images. Here an entity in the CXR image can help determine if the patient whose CXR is used is suffering from pneumonia or not. A simple model of capsules also known as Simple CapsNet has provided results comparable to best Deep Learning models that had been used earlier. Subsequently a combination of convolutions and capsules is used to obtain two models that outperform all models previously proposed. These models-Integration of convolutions with capsules ICC and Ensemble of convolutions with capsules ECC-detect pneumonia with a test accuracy of 95.33% and 95.90% respectively. The latter model is studied in detail to obtain a variant called EnCC where n = 3 4 8 16. Here the E4CC model works optimally and gives test accuracy of 96.36%. All these models had been trained validated and tested on 5857 images from Mendeley." Detecting Pneumonia using Convolutions and Dynamic Capsule Routing for Chest X-ray Images.
