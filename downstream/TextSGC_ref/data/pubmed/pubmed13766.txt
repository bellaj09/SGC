Deep learning models including recurrent neural network RNN and gated recurrent unit GRU were used to construct the clinical prognostic prediction models for peritoneal dialysis PD patients based on routine clinical data. The performance of the RNN and GRU were compared with logistic regression LR which is commonly used in medical researches. The possible underlining clinical implications based on the result from the GRU model were also investigated. Application of recurrent neural network in prognosis of peritoneal dialysis.
