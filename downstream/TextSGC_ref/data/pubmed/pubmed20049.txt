We have developed a brain-computer interface BCI system based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI with virtual reality feedback. The advantage of fMRI is the relatively high spatial resolution and the coverage of the whole brain; thus we expect that it may be used to explore novel BCI strategies based on new types of mental activities. However fMRI suffers from a low temporal resolution and an inherent delay since it is based on a hemodynamic response rather than electrical signals. Thus our objective in this paper was to explore whether subjects could perform a BCI task in a virtual environment using our system and how their performance was affected by the delay.
