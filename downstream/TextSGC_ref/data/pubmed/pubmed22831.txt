"Accidents happen and unfortunately people may loose part of their body members. Studies have shown that in this case most individuals suffer physically and psychologically. For this reason actions to restore the patients freedom and mobility are imperative. Traditional solutions require ways to adapt the individual to prosthetic devices. This idea is also applied to patients who have congenital limitations. However one of the major difficulties faced by those who are fitted with these devices is the great mental effort needed during first stages of training. As a result a meaningful number of patients give up the use of theses devices very soon. Thus this article reports on a solution designed by the authors to help patients during the learning phases without actually having to wear the prosthesis. This solution considers Virtual VR and Augmented Reality AR techniques to mimic the prosthesis natural counterparts. Thus it is expected that problems such as weight heat and pain should not contribute to an already hard task." On the use of virtual and augmented reality for upper limb prostheses training and simulation.
