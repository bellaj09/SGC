"The basic principle behind diffusion is Brownian motion. The diffusion parameters obtained in a clinical association provide information on the spatial distribution of water molecule mobility and therefore evidence of the morphological integrity of the white and grey matters of the brain. In recent years functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI could contribute to obtaining a detailed understanding of the cortical and subcortical cerebral networks. Diffusion tensor imaging DTI investigations can demonstrate the extent of anisotropy and the fiber pathways in so-called parametric images. For example in Alzheimers disease DTI reveals a reduced structural connectivity between the posterior cingulum and the hippocampus. This article shows examples of the application of diffusion-weighted imaging DWI in psychiatric disorders." Diffusion formation and psychiatric diseases.
