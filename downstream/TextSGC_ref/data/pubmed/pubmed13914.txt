"The Cox proportional hazards model commonly used to evaluate prognostic variables in survival of cancer patients may be too simplistic to properly predict a cancer patients outcome since it assumes that the outcome is a linear combination of covariates. In this retrospective study including 255 patients suitable for analysis who underwent surgical treatment in our department from 2000 to 2017 we applied a deep learning-based survival prediction method in oral squamous cell carcinoma SCC patients and validated its performance. Survival prediction using DeepSurv a deep learning based-survival prediction algorithm was compared with random survival forest RSF and the Cox proportional hazard model CPH. DeepSurv showed the best performance among the three models the c-index of the training and testing sets reaching 0.810 and 0.781 respectively followed by RSF 0.770/0.764 and CPH 0.756/0.694. The performance of DeepSurv steadily improved with added features. Thus deep learning-based survival prediction may improve prediction accuracy and guide clinicians both in choosing treatment options for better survival and in avoiding unnecessary treatments."
