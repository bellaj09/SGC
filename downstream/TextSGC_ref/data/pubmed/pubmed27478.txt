"Brain computer interfaces BCI can provide communication opportunities for individuals with severe motor disabilities. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound TCD measures cerebral blood flow velocities and can be used to develop a BCI. A previously implemented TCD BCI system used verbal and spatial tasks as control signals; however the spatial task involved a visual cue that awkwardly diverted the users attention away from the communication interface. Therefore vision-independent right-lateralized tasks were investigated. Using a bilateral TCD BCI ten participants controlled online an on-screen keyboard using a left-lateralized task verbal fluency a right-lateralized task fist motor imagery or 3D-shape tracing and unconstrained rest. 3D-shape tracing was generally more discernible from other tasks than was fist motor imagery. Verbal fluency 3D-shape tracing and unconstrained rest were distinguished from each other using a linear discriminant classifier achieving a mean agreement of =0.430.17. These rates are comparable to the best offline three-class TCD BCI accuracies reported thus far. The online communication system achieved a mean information transfer rate ITR of 1.080.69bits/min with values reaching up to 2.46bits/min thereby exceeding the ITR of previous online TCD BCIs. These findings demonstrate the potential of a three-class online TCD BCI that does not require visual task cues." An online three-class Transcranial Doppler ultrasound brain computer interface.
