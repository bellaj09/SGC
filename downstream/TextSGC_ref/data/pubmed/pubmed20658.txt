There is increasing interest in real-time brain-computer interfaces BCIs for the passive monitoring of human cognitive state including cognitive workload. Too often however effective BCIs based on machine learning techniques may function as "black boxes" that are difficult to analyze or interpret. In an effort toward more interpretable BCIs we studied a family of N-back working memory tasks using a machine learning model Gaussian Process Regression GPR which was both powerful and amenable to analysis. Participants performed the N-back task with three stimulus variants auditory-verbal visual-spatial and visual-numeric each at three working memory loads. GPR models were trained and tested on EEG data from all three task variants combined in an effort to identify a model that could be predictive of mental workload demand regardless of stimulus modality. To provide a comparison for GPR performance a model was additionally trained using multiple linear regression MLR. The GPR model was effective when trained on individual participant EEG data resulting in an average standardized mean squared error sMSE between true and predicted N-back levels of 0.44. In comparison the MLR model using the same data resulted in an average sMSE of 0.55. We additionally demonstrate how GPR can be used to identify which EEG features are relevant for prediction of cognitive workload in an individual participant. A fraction of EEG features accounted for the majority of the model\s predictive power; using only the top 25% of features performed nearly as well as using 100% of features. Subsets of features identified by linear models ANOVA were not as efficient as subsets identified by GPR. This raises the possibility of BCIs that require fewer model features while capturing all of the information needed to achieve high predictive accuracy.
