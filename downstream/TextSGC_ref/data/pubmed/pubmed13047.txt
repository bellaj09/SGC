There is interest in using convolutional neural networks CNNs to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis CAD. Recent work has suggested that image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task.
