"Learning and enhancing of manual skills in the field of neurosurgery requires an intensive training which can be maintained by using virtual reality VR-based or physical model PM-based simulators. However both simulator types are limited to one specific intracranial procedure e.g. the application of an external ventricular drainage EVD and they do not provide any accuracy verification. We present a brain simulator which consists of a 3D human skull model having five electroconductive balls in its interior. The installed balls represent intracranial target points providing various accuracy problems in neuronavigation. They are electrically contacted to lamps getting an optical signal by touching them with a current-carrying target tool. The simulator fulfills two requirements: First it can prove the accuracy of navigation systems and algorithms. Second it allows becoming familiar with a navigation systems application in an ex vivo setting. It could be a helpful device in neurosurgical skills labs."
