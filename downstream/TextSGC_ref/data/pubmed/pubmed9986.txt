"Fringe projection profilometry FPP has become increasingly important in dynamic 3-D shape measurement. In FPP it is necessary to retrieve the phase of the measured object before shape profiling. However traditional phase retrieval techniques often require a large number of fringes which may generate motion-induced error for dynamic objects. In this paper a novel phase retrieval technique based on deep learning is proposed which uses an end-to-end deep convolution neural network to transform a single or two fringes into the phase retrieval required fringes. When the objects surface is located in a restricted depth the presented network only requires a single fringe as the input which otherwise requires two fringes in an unrestricted depth. The proposed phase retrieval technique is first theoretically analyzed and then numerically and experimentally verified on its applicability for dynamic 3-D measurement."
