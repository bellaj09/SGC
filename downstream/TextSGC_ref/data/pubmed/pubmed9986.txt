"The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility of using deep learning as artificial intelligence AI to classify cervical squamous epithelial lesions SIL from colposcopy images. A total of 330 patients who underwent colposcopy and biopsy by gynecologic oncologists were enrolled in the current study. A total of 97 patients received a pathological diagnosis of low-grade SIL LSIL and 213 of high-grade SIL HSIL. An original AI-classifier with 11 layers of the convolutional neural network was developed and trained. The accuracy sensitivity specificity and Youdens J index of the AI-classifier and oncologists for diagnosing HSIL were 0.823 and 0.797 0.800 and 0.831 0.882 and 0.773 and 0.682 and 0.604 respectively. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.8260.052 mean  standard error and the 95% confidence interval 0.721-0.928. The optimal cut-off point was 0.692. Cohens Kappa coefficient for AI and colposcopy was 0.437 P<0.0005. The AI-classifier performed better than oncologists although not significantly. Although further study is required the clinical use of AI for the classification of HSIL/LSIL from by colposcopy may be feasible."
