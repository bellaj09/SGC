Most recent steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI systems have used a single frequency for each target so that a large number of targets require a large number of stimulus frequencies and therefore a wider frequency band. However human beings show good SSVEP responses only in a limited range of frequencies. Furthermore this issue is especially problematic if the SSVEP-based BCI takes a PC monitor as a stimulator which is only capable of generating a limited range of frequencies. To mitigate this issue this study presents an innovative coding method for SSVEP-based BCI by means of intermodulation frequencies. Brain-computer interface based on intermodulation frequency.
