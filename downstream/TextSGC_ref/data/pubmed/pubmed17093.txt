Physical exercise has long been recognized as highly beneficial for brain and body health. The molecular mechanisms responsible for translation of exercise stimuli in the brain have claimed attention due to mounting evidence for the neuroprotective actions of the exercise and its positive effects in preventing both ageing and neurodegenerative disease. These molecular mediators are currently under investigation with new tools able to yield deep insights into the neurobiology of exercise. In the present work we focus on the evidence pertaining to the mediation of exercise effects by insulin-like growth factor 1 IGF1 as recent reports suggest that this growth factor shows brain area-specific temporal rank-sensitive and behavioural task-dependent features in response to exercise. Growth factors as mediators of exercise actions on the brain.
