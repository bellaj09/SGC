Individuals with complex communication needs often use alternative access technologies to control their augmentative and alternative communication AAC devices their computers and mobile technologies. While a range of access devices is available many challenges continue to exist particularly for those with severe motor-control limitations. For some access options may not be readily available or access itself may be inaccurate and frustrating. For others access may be available but only under optimal conditions and support. There is an urgent need to develop new options for individuals with severe motor impairments and to leverage existing technology to improve efficiency increase accuracy and decrease fatigue of access. This paper describes person-centred research and development activities related to new and emerging access technologies with a particular focus on adults with acquired neurological conditions. New and emerging access technologies for adults with complex communication needs and severe motor impairments: State of the science.
