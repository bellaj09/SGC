"Simulation training for surgical residents can shorten learning curves improve technical skills and expedite competency. Several studies have shown that skills learned in the simulated environment are transferable to the operating room. Residency programs are trying to incorporate simulation into the resident training curriculum to supplement the hands-on experience gained in the operating room. Despite the availability and proven utility of surgical simulators and simulation laboratories they are still widely underutilized by surgical trainees. Studies have shown that voluntary use leads to minimal participation in a training curriculum. Although there are several simulation tools there is no clear evidence of the superiority of one tool over the other in skill acquisition. The purpose of this study was to explore resident perceptions training experiences and preferences regarding laparoscopic simulation training. Our goal was to profile resident participation in surgical skills simulation recognize potential barriers to voluntary simulator use and identify simulation tools and tasks preferred by residents. Furthermore this study may help to inform whether mandatory/protected training time as part of the residents curriculum is essential to enhance participation in the simulation laboratory."
