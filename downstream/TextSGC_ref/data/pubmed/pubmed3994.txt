Cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD posit dysfunctional appraisal of disorder-relevant stimuli in patients suggesting disturbances in the processes relying on amygdala-prefrontal connectivity. Recent neuroanatomical models add to the traditional view of dysfunction in corticostriatal circuits by proposing alterations in an affective circuit including amygdala-prefrontal connections. However abnormalities in amygdala-prefrontal coupling during symptom provocation and particularly during conditions that require stimulus appraisal remain to be demonstrated directly.
