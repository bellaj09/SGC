Computed tomography CT is a widely used screening and diagnostic tool that allows clinicians to obtain a high-resolution volumetric image of internal structures in a non-invasive manner. Increasingly efforts have been made to improve the image quality of low-dose CT LDCT to reduce the cumulative radiation exposure of patients undergoing routine screening exams. The resurgence of deep learning has yielded a new approach for noise reduction by training a deep multi-layer convolutional neural networks CNN to map the low-dose to normaldose CT images. However CNN-based methods heavily rely on convolutional kernels which use fixed-size filters to process one local neighborhood within the receptive field at a time. As a result they are not efficient at retrieving structural information across large regions. In this paper we propose a novel 3D self-attention convolutional neural network for the LDCT denoising problem. Our 3D selfattention module leverages the 3D volume of CT images to capture a wide range of spatial information both within CT slices and between CT slices. With the help of the 3D self-attention module CNNs are able to leverage pixels with stronger relationships regardless of their distance and achieve better denoising results. In addition we propose a self-supervised learning scheme to train a domain-specific autoencoder as the perceptual loss function. We combine these two methods and demonstrate their effectiveness on both CNN-based neural networks and WGAN-based neural networks with comprehensive experiments. Tested on the AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge data set our experiments demonstrate that self-attention SA module and autoencoder AE perceptual loss function can efficiently enhance traditional CNNs and can achieve comparable or better results than the state-of-the-art methods.
