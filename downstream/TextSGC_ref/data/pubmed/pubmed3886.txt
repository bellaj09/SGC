We characterize the development of intrinsic connectivity networks ICNs from 4 to 9months of age with resting state magnetic resonance imaging performed on sleeping infants without sedative medication. Data is analyzed with independent component analysis ICA. Using both low 30 components and high 100 components ICA model order decompositions we find that the functional network connectivity FNC map is largely similar at both 4 and 9months. However at 9months the connectivity strength decreases within local networks and increases between more distant networks. The connectivity within the default-mode network which contains both local and more distant nodes also increases in strength with age. The low frequency power spectrum increases with age only in the posterior cingulate cortex and posterior default mode network. These findings are consistent with a general developmental pattern of increasing longer distance functional connectivity over the first year of life and raise questions regarding the developmental importance of the posterior cingulate at this age.
