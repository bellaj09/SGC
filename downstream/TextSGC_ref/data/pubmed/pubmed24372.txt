The surgical treatment of many dentofacial deformities is often complex due to its three-dimensional nature. To determine the dental occlusion in the most stable position is essential for the success of the treatment. Computer-aided virtual planning on individualized patient-specific 3D model can help formulate the surgical plan and predict the surgical change. However in current computer-aided planning systems it is not possible to determine the dental occlusion of the digital models in the intuitive way during virtual surgical planning because of absence of haptic feedback. In this paper a physically based haptic simulation framework is proposed which can provide surgeons with the intuitive haptic feedback to determine the dental occlusion of the digital models in their most stable position. Haptic simulation framework for determining virtual dental occlusion.
