Portable devices for home sleep apnea testing are often limited by their inability to discriminate sleep/wake status possibly resulting in underestimations. Tracheal sound TS which can be visualized as a spectrogram carries information about apnea/hypopnea and sleep/wake status. We hypothesized that image analysis of all-night TS recordings by a deep neural network DNN would be capable of detecting breathing events and classifying sleep/wake status. The aim of this study is to develop a DNN-based system for sleep apnea testing and validate it using a large sampling of polysomnography PSG data.
