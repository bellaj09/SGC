"Due in large part to the significant advances in PC hardware that have been made over the last 3 years PC-based virtual environments are approaching reality. Virtual Reality Environments for Psychoneurophysiological Assessment and Rehabilitation VREPAR are two European Community funded projects Telematics for health-HC 1053/HC 1055 http:// www.psicologia.net that are trying to develop a PC-based virtual reality system PC-VRS for the medical market that can be marketed at a price that is accessible to its possible endusers hospitals universities and research centres and that would have the modular connectability and interoperability characteristics that the existing systems lack. In particular the projects are developing three hardware/software modules for the application of the PCVRS in psycho-neuro-physiological assessment and rehabilitation. The chosen development areas are eating disorders bulimia anorexia and obesity movement disorders Parkinsons disease and torsion dystonia and stroke disorders unilateral neglect and hemiparesis. This article describes the rationale of the modules and the preliminary results obtained." VREPAR projects: the use of virtual environments in psycho-neuro-physiological assessment and rehabilitation.
