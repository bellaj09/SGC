This chapter proposes a prospective view on using a real-time functional magnetic imaging rt-fMRI brain-computer interface BCI application as a new treatment for pedophilia. Neurofeedback mediated by interactive virtual stimuli is presented as the key process in this new BCI application. Results on the diagnostic discriminant power of virtual characters depicting sexual stimuli relevant to pedophilia are given. Finally practical and ethical implications are briefly addressed. Real-time functional magnetic imaging-brain-computer interface and virtual reality promising tools for the treatment of pedophilia.
