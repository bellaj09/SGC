Visual-vestibular mismatch is a common occurrence with causes ranging from vehicular travel to vestibular dysfunction to virtual reality displays. Behavioral and physiological consequences of this mismatch include adaptation of reflexive eye movements oscillopsia vertigo and nausea. Despite this significance we still do not have a good understanding of how the nervous system evaluates visual-vestibular conflict. Here we review research that quantifies perceptual sensitivity to visual-vestibular conflict and factors that mediate this sensitivity such as noise on visual and vestibular sensory estimates. We emphasize that dynamic modeling methods are necessary to investigate how the nervous system monitors conflict between time-varying visual and vestibular signals and we present a simple example of a drift-diffusion model for visual-vestibular conflict detection. The model makes predictions for detection of conflict arising from changes in both visual gain and latency. We conclude with discussion of topics for future research. Towards dynamic modeling of visual-vestibular conflict detection.
