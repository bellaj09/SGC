Here we report the findings after application of neurobiotin tracing to pallial and stellar nerves in the mantle of the cephalopod mollusk Octopus vulgaris and to the axial nerve cord in its arm. Neurobiotin backfilling is a known technique in other molluscs but it is applied to octopus for the first time to be best of our knowledge. Different neural tracing techniques have been carried out in cephalopods to study the intricate neural connectivity of their nervous system but mapping the nervous connections in this taxon is still incomplete mainly due to the absence of a reliable tracing method allowing whole-mount imaging. In our experiments neurobiotin backfilling allowed: 1 imaging of large/thick samples larger than 2\xa0mm through optical clearing; 2 additional application of immunohistochemistry on the backfilled tissues allowing identification of neural structures by coupling of a specific antibody. This work opens a series of future studies aimed to the identification of the neural diagram and connectome of octopus nervous system. Neural pathways in the pallial nerve and arm nerve cord revealed by neurobiotin backfilling in the cephalopod mollusk Octopus vulgaris.
