"Many studies have assessed virtual reality exposures efficacy but very few examined its treatment processes. The addition of objective measures of arousal and information processing mechanisms would be a valuable contribution in order to provide a more complete and detailed picture. The goal of this study was to better document the cognitive mechanisms associated with therapeutic change after an in virtuo exposure treatment. Twenty-eight adults suffering from arachnophobia were assessed and received an exposure-based treatment using virtual reality. General outcome and specific processes measures included a battery of standardized questionnaires a pictorial emotional Stroop task a Behavioral Avoidance Test and a measure of participants cardiac response while they looked at a live tarantula. The analyses showed that changes in perceived self-efficacy and dysfunctional beliefs were the best predictors of change in general outcome and cardiac response; change in dysfunctional beliefs were the best predictor of change in behavioral avoidance. These innovative results provide a very detailed and organized picture of the complex cognitive mechanisms involved in therapeutic change following in virtuo exposure for arachnophobia."
