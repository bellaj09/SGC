In bioinformatics machine learning-based methods that predict the compound-protein interactions CPIs play an important role in the virtual screening for drug discovery. Recently end-to-end representation learning for discrete symbolic data e.g. words in natural language processing using deep neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance on various difficult problems. For the CPI problem data are provided as discrete symbolic data i.e. compounds are represented as graphs where the vertices are atoms the edges are chemical bonds and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. In this study we investigate the use of end-to-end representation learning for compounds and proteins integrate the representations and develop a new CPI prediction approach by combining a graph neural network GNN for compounds and a convolutional neural network CNN for proteins. Compound-protein interaction prediction with end-to-end learning of neural networks for graphs and sequences.
