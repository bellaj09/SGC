Purpose This study investigated whether a shoulder reaching exercise was beneficial for restoring the standing balance of patients with hemiplegia after stroke. Subjects and Methods There were 13 subjects in the experimental group EG and 14 subjects in the control group CG all with hemiplegia following stroke. The shoulder reaching exercise intervention was performed by the EG and conventional physical therapy was administered to the CG for 30 minutes 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Virtual reality RM BioRescue -AP 1153 France was used as an assessment tool. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 Statistical Package for the Social Science. Results After the intervention the EG showed significant differences in the distances moved in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. The length and velocity were reduced after the intervention in both the EG and the CG. There were significant differences in the distances moved in the north south and west directions between the groups. The sway path lengths of the subjects in the Romberg test were reduced under both the eyes open and closed conditions in the EG. There was no significant variation in sway velocity in the EG and the CG. Conclusion The shoulder reaching exercise had beneficial effects on the distances moved in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. Effects of shoulder reaching exercise on the balance of patients with hemiplegia after stroke.
