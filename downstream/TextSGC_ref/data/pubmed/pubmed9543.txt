Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging SI is a unique imaging technique that provides biochemical information from in vivo tissues. The 1H spectra acquired from several spatial regions are quantified to yield metabolite concentrations reflective of tissue metabolism. However since these metabolites are found in tissues at very low concentrations SI is often acquired with limited spatial resolution. In this work we test the hypothesis that deep learning is able to upscale low resolution SI together with the T1-weighted T1w image to reconstruct high resolution SI. We report on a novel densely connected UNet D-UNet architecture capable of producing super-resolution spectroscopic images. The inputs for the D-UNet are the T1w image and the low resolution SI image while the output is the high resolution SI. The results of the D-UNet are compared both qualitatively and quantitatively to simulated and in vivo high resolution SI. It is found that this deep learning approach can produce high quality spectroscopic images and reconstruct entire 1H spectra from low resolution acquisitions which can greatly advance the current SI workflow.
