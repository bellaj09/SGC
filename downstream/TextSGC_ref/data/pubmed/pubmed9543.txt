Retinal disease classification is a significant problem in computer-aided diagnosis CAD for medical applications. This paper is focused on a 4-class classification problem to automatically detect choroidal neovascularization CNV diabetic macular edema DME DRUSEN and NORMAL in optical coherence tomography OCT images. The proposed classification algorithm adopted an ensemble of four classification model instances to identify retinal OCT images each of which was based on an improved residual neural network ResNet50. The experiment followed a patient-level 10-fold cross-validation process on development retinal OCT image dataset. The proposed approach achieved 0.973 95% confidence interval CI 0.971-0.975 classification accuracy 0.963 95% CI 0.960-0.966 sensitivity and 0.985 95% CI 0.983-0.987 specificity at the B-scan level achieving a matching or exceeding performance to that of ophthalmologists with significant clinical experience. Other performance measures used in the study were the area under receiver operating characteristic curve AUC and kappa value. The observations of the study implied that multi-ResNet50 ensembling was a useful technique when the availability of medical images was limited. In addition we performed qualitative evaluation of model predictions and occlusion testing to understand the decision-making process of our model. The paper provided an analytical discussion on misclassification and pathology regions identified by the occlusion testing also. Finally we explored the effect of the integration of retinal OCT images and medical history data from patients on model performance.
