Histopathologic grading of prostate cancer using Gleason patterns GPs is subject to a large inter-observer variability which may result in suboptimal treatment of patients. With the introduction of digitization and whole-slide images of prostate biopsies computer-aided grading becomes feasible. Computer-aided grading has the potential to improve histopathological grading and treatment selection for prostate cancer. Automated detection of GPs and determination of the grade groups GG using a convolutional neural network. In total 96 prostate biopsies from 38 patients are annotated on pixel-level. Automated detection of GP 3 and GP\u2009\u20094 in digitized prostate biopsies is performed by re-training the Inception-v3 convolutional neural network CNN. The outcome of the CNN is subsequently converted into probability maps of GP\u2009\u20093 and GP\u2009\u20094 and the GG of the whole biopsy is obtained according to these probability maps. Differentiation between non-atypical and malignant GP\u2009\u20093 areas resulted in an accuracy of 92% with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 93% respectively. The differentiation between GP\u2009\u20094 and GP\u2009\u20093 was accurate for 90% with a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 94% respectively. Concordance of our automated GG determination method with a genitourinary pathologist was obtained in 65% \u2009=\u20090.70 indicating substantial agreement. A CNN allows for accurate differentiation between non-atypical and malignant areas as defined by GPs leading to a substantial agreement with the pathologist in defining the GG. Deep learning for automatic Gleason pattern classification for grade group determination of prostate biopsies.
