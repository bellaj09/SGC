We present a complete BCI-enabled Brain Computer Interface solution for Ambient Assisted Living system control. BCI are alternative augmentative communication means capable of exploiting just the brain waveforms to infer intent thus potentially posing as a technological bridge capable of overcoming limitations in the usual neuromuscular pathways. The module was completely developed in a customized way encompassing hardware and software components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a practical control scenario in which the user can issue 4 different commands at his own pace and will in real-time. No initial calibration is necessary in line with the aimed plug&amp;play approach. Results are very promising especially in false positives rejection well improving over literature. A plug&play Brain Computer Interface solution for AAL systems.
