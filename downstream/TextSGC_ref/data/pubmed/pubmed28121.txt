In neuronal population signals including the electroencephalogram EEG and electrocorticogram ECoG the low-frequency component LFC is particularly informative about motor behavior and can be used for decoding movement parameters for brain-machine interface BMI applications. An idea previously expressed but as of yet not quantitatively tested is that it is the LFC phase that is the main source of decodable information. To test this issue we analyzed human ECoG recorded during a game-like one-dimensional continuous motor task with a novel decoding method suitable for unfolding magnitude and phase explicitly into a complex-valued time-frequency signal representation enabling quantification of the decodable information within the temporal spatial and frequency domains and allowing disambiguation of the phase contribution from that of the spectral magnitude. The decoding accuracy based only on phase information was substantially at least 2 fold and significantly higher than that based only on magnitudes for position velocity and acceleration. The frequency profile of movement-related information in the ECoG data matched well with the frequency profile expected when assuming a close time-domain correlate of movement velocity in the ECoG e.g. a noisy "copy" of hand velocity. No such match was observed with the frequency profiles expected when assuming a copy of either hand position or acceleration. There was also no indication of additional magnitude-based mechanisms encoding movement information in the LFC range. Thus our study contributes to elucidating the nature of the informative LFC of motor cortical population activity and may hence contribute to improve decoding strategies and BMI performance. The role of ECoG magnitude and phase in decoding position velocity and acceleration during continuous motor behavior.
