Do men and women have different brains? Previous neuroimage studies sought to answer this question based on morphological difference between specific brain regions reporting unfortunately conflicting results. In the present study we aim to use a deep learning technique to address this challenge based on a large open-access diffusion MRI database recorded from 1065 young healthy subjects including 490 men and 575 women healthy subjects. Different from commonly used 2D Convolutional Neural Network CNN we proposed a 3D CNN method with a newly designed structure including three hidden layers in cascade with a linear layer and a terminal Softmax layer. The proposed 3D CNN was applied to the maps of factional anisotropy FA in the whole-brain as well as specific brain regions. The entropy measure was applied to the lowest-level image features extracted from the first hidden layer to examine the difference of brain structure complexity between men and women. The obtained results compared with the results from using the Support Vector Machine SVM and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics TBSS. The proposed 3D CNN yielded a better classification result 93.3% than the SVM 78.2% on the whole-brain FA images indicating gender-related differences likely exist in the whole-brain range. Moreover high classification accuracies are also shown in several specific brain regions including the left precuneus the left postcentral gyrus the left cingulate gyrus the right orbital gyrus of frontal lobe and the left occipital thalamus in the gray matter and middle cerebellum peduncle genu of corpus callosum the right anterior corona radiata the right superior corona radiata and the left anterior limb of internal capsule in the while matter. This study provides a new insight into the structure difference between men and women which highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in brain research.
