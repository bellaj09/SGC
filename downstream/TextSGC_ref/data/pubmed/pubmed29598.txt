"In recent years the readiness potential RP a type of pre-movement neural activity has been investigated for asynchronous electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Since the RP is attenuated for involuntary movements a BCI driven by RP alone could facilitate intentional control amid a plethora of unintentional movements. Previous studies have mainly attempted binary single-trial classification of RP. An RP-based BCI with three or more states would expand the options for functional control. Here we propose a ternary BCI based on single-trial RPs. This BCI classifies amongst an idle state a left hand and a right hand self-initiated fine movement. A pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering with per participant parameter optimization was used for feature extraction. The ternary classification was decomposed into binary classifications using a decision-directed acyclic graph DDAG. For each class pair in the DDAG structure an ordered diversified classifier system ODCS-DDAG was used to select the best among various classification algorithms or to combine the results of different classification algorithms. Using EEG data from 14 participants performing self-initiated left or right key presses punctuated with rest periods we compared the performance of ODCS-DDAG to a ternary classifier and four popular multiclass decomposition methods using only a single classification algorithm. ODCS-DDAG had the highest performance 0.769 Cohens Kappa score and was significantly better than the ternary classifier and two of the four multiclass decomposition methods. Our work supports further study of RP-based BCI for intuitive asynchronous environmental control or augmentative communication."
