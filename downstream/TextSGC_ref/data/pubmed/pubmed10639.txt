A 45-year-old man who was implanted with an inferior vena cava IVC filter in his infrarenal IVC had a complication of deep vein thrombosis DVT propagation from the IVC beyond the IVC filter to the right calf and left external iliac veins. The entire IVC filter was covered with a massive thrombus. We first decided to retrieve the IVC filter itself which was suspected of causing metallic allergy. The thrombotic IVC filter was successfully retrieved using multi-step catheter intervention. To our knowledge this is the first case report to describe successful multi-step catheter intervention for retrieval of an IVC filter covered with a massive thrombus. <Learning objectives: Inferior vena cava IVC filter thrombosis is one of the most serious IVC filter complications. It is difficult to retrieve the IVC filter covered with a massive thrombus. Multi-step catheter intervention technique may be useful to retrieve an IVC filter with thrombotic occlusion.>. Successful multi-step catheter intervention for thrombotic inferior vena cava filter retrieval.
