The skin is the largest organ of our body. Skin disease abnormalities which occur within the skin layers are difficult to examine visually and often require biopsies to make a confirmation on a suspected condition. Such invasive methods are not well-accepted by children and women due to the possibility of scarring. Optical coherence tomography OCT is a non-invasive technique enabling in vivo examination of sub-surface skin tissue without the need for excision of tissue. However one of the challenges in OCT imaging is the interpretation and analysis of OCT images. In this review we discuss the various methodologies in skin layer segmentation and how it could potentially improve the management of skin diseases. We also present a review of works which use advanced machine learning techniques to achieve layers segmentation and detection of skin diseases. Lastly current challenges in analysis and applications are also discussed. Techniques and Applications in Skin OCT Analysis.
