Functional connectivity FC characterizes brain activity from a multivariate set of N brain signals by means of an NxN matrix A whose elements estimate the dependence within each possible pair of signals. Such matrix can be used as a feature vector for unsupervised subject classification. Yet if N is large A is highly dimensional. Little is known on the effect that different strategies to reduce its dimensionality may have on its classification ability. Here we apply different machine learning algorithms to classify 33 children age 6-14 years into two groups healthy controls and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder patients using EEG FC patterns obtained from two phase synchronisation indices. We found that the classification is highly successful around 95% if the whole matrix A is taken into account and the relevant features are selected using machine learning methods. However if FC algorithms are applied instead to transform A into a lower dimensionality matrix the classification rate drops to less than 80%. We conclude that for the purpose of pattern classification the relevant features should be selected among the elements of A by using appropriate machine learning algorithms. The blessing of Dimensionality: Feature Selection outperforms functional connectivity-based feature transformation to classify ADHD subjects from EEG patterns of phase synchronisation.
