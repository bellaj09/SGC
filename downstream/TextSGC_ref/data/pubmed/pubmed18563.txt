Pain is a protective perceptual response shaped by contextual psychological and sensory inputs that suggest danger to the body. Sensory cues suggesting that a body part is moving toward a painful position may credibly signal the threat and thereby modulate pain. In this experiment we used virtual reality to investigate whether manipulating visual proprioceptive cues could alter movement-evoked pain in 24 people with neck pain. We hypothesized that pain would occur at a lesser degree of head rotation when visual feedback overstated true rotation and at a greater degree of rotation when visual feedback understated true rotation. Our hypothesis was clearly supported: When vision overstated the amount of rotation pain occurred at 7% less rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback and when vision understated rotation pain occurred at 6% greater rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback. We concluded that visual-proprioceptive information modulated the threshold for movement-evoked pain which suggests that stimuli that become associated with pain can themselves trigger pain. Bogus visual feedback alters onset of movement-evoked pain in people with neck pain.
