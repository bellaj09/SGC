Ultrasound US provides real-time two-/three-dimensional safe imaging. Due to these capabilities it is considered a safe alternative to intra-operative fluoroscopy in various computer-assisted orthopedic surgery CAOS procedures. However interpretation of the collected bone US data is difficult due to high levels of noise various imaging artifacts and bone surfaces response appearing several millimeters mm in thickness. For US-guided CAOS procedures it is an essential objective to have a segmentation mechanism that is both robust and computationally inexpensive. Automatic segmentation of bone surfaces from ultrasound using a filter-layer-guided CNN.
