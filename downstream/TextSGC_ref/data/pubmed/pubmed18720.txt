"The training of a surgeon includes the acquisition of a number of\ncharacteristics. These include a cognitive knowledge base\nproblem formulation and decisionmaking abilities appropriate\npsychosocial relationships and other attributes that can be\nmeasured with objective testing such as national board or\nspecialty certifying examinations. Perhaps most critical to the\nsurgeon however are the core technical skills of the\nprofession. A battery of sophisticated devices is being created\nto teach and provide objective evaluations of the trainees\ntechnical abilities. These innovative state-of-the-art\nsimulation devices used to teach basic skills and surgical\ntasks through repetitive proctored challenges will enable\ndetection and analysis of surgical errors and near miss\nincidents without risk to patients. As with flight simulation\nnear miss detection capabilities anticipate potential errors\nbefore they occur and prevent resulting complications. In\ncollaboration with a number of otolaryngology residency\nprograms we have developed a comprehensive training curriculum\nbased on complementary simulation tools and several perceptual\nand spatial ability test instruments to provide objective\nmetrics for assessing the technical skills of trainees. These\ntools include an endoscopic sinus surgery simulator for\nprocedural training and the Minimally Invasive Surgical\nTrainer-Virtual Reality MIST-VR system for basic surgical\nskills training. Technical errors are identified quantified\nand used to monitor surgical performance after which the\nmetrics are used for outcome analysis for the purpose of\nimproving patient safety. Validated metrics include\ntime-to-completion errors economy of motion and psychomotor\ntracking. Endoscopic sinus surgery is a suitable operation\nsubstrate since it is a frequently performed procedure more\nthan 300000 times annually in the United States. and carries a\nsignificant risk of injury to the delicate neighboring eye and\nbrain structures. The endoscopic sinus surgery simulator ES3\nis an advanced surgical simulation device based largely on jet\npilot flight simulation and provides the trainee with\nappropriate levels of challenge and instruction. ES3 validation\nstudies are reported here along with a description of the World\nWide Web-based Intelligent Information Interface WI3\nsimulation database."
