"Having reviewed certain similarities and differences between the various psychoanalytic models historical reconstruction/development of the container and of the minds metabolic and transformational function; the significance to be attributed to dream-type material; reality gradients of narrations; tolerability of truth/lies as polar opposites; and the form in which characters are understood in a psychoanalytic session the author uses clinical material to demonstrate his conception of a session as a virtual reality in which the central operation is transformation in dreaming de-construction de-concretization and re-dreaming accompanied in particular by the development of this attitude in both patient and analyst as an antidote to the operations of transformation in hallucinosis that bear witness to the failure of the functions of meaning generation. The theoretical roots of this model are traced in the concept of the field and its developments as a constantly expanding oneiric holographic field; in the developments of Bions ideas waking dream thought and its derivatives and the patient as signaller of the movements of the field; and in the contributions of narratology narrative transformations and the transformations of characters and screenplays. Stress is also laid on the transition from a psychoanalysis directed predominantly towards contents to a psychoanalysis that emphasizes the development of the instruments for dreaming feeling and thinking. An extensive case history and a session reported in its entirety are presented so as to convey a living impression of the ongoing process in the consulting room of the unsaturated co-construction of an emotional reality in the throes of continuous transformation. The author also describes the technical implications of this model in terms of forms of interpretation the countertransference reveries and in particular how the analyst listens to the patients communications. The paper ends with an exploration of the concepts of grasping in the sense of clinging to the known and casting in relation to what is as yet undefined but seeking representation and transformation as a further oscillation of the minds of the analyst and the patient in addition to those familiar from classical psychoanalysis." Transformations in dreaming and characters in the psychoanalytic field.
