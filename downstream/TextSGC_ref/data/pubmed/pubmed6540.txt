"The transition from childhood to adolescence is a vulnerable period for the development of anxiety symptoms. There is some evidence that hormonal changes occurring during adrenarche an early pubertal phase might play a role in this increased vulnerability. Little is known about underlying brain mechanisms. Given the role of the amygdala-based fear circuit in anxiety the current study aimed to investigate whether childrens adrenarcheal hormone levels were associated with functional connectivity of the amygdala while processing fearful facial expressions and how this in turn related to anxiety symptoms." Associations between adrenarcheal hormones amygdala functional connectivity and anxiety symptoms in children.
