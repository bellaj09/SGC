Big sensor data provide significant potential for chemical fault diagnosis which involves the baseline values of security stability and reliability in chemical processes. A deep neural network DNN with novel active learning for inducing chemical fault diagnosis is presented in this study. It is a method using large amount of chemical sensor data which is a combination of deep learning and active learning criterion to target the difficulty of consecutive fault diagnosis. DNN with deep architectures instead of shallow ones could be developed through deep learning to learn a suitable feature representation from raw sensor data in an unsupervised manner using stacked denoising auto-encoder SDAE and work through a layer-by-layer successive learning process. The features are added to the top Softmax regression layer to construct the discriminative fault characteristics for diagnosis in a supervised manner. Considering the expensive and time consuming labeling of sensor data in chemical applications in contrast to the available methods we employ a novel active learning criterion for the particularity of chemical processes which is a combination of Best vs. Second Best criterion BvSB and a Lowest False Positive criterion LFP for further fine-tuning of diagnosis model in an active manner rather than passive manner. That is we allow models to rank the most informative sensor data to be labeled for updating the DNN parameters during the interaction phase. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two well-known industrial datasets. Results indicate that the proposed method can obtain superior diagnosis accuracy and provide significant performance improvement in accuracy and false positive rate with less labeled chemical sensor data by further active learning compared with existing methods.
