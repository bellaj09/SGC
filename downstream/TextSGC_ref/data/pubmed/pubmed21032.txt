Adults with sedentary lifestyles seem to face a higher risk of falling in their later years. Several causes such as impairment of strength coordination and cognitive function influence worsening health conditions including balancing ability. Many modalities can be applied to improve the balance function and prevent falling. Several studies have also recorded the effects of balance training in elderly adults for fall prevention. Accordingly the aim of this study is to define the effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control abilities in healthy adults. The effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and postural control in healthy adults: a randomized preliminary study.
