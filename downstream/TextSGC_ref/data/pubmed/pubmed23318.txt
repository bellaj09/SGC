Electricity governs the function of both nervous systems and computers. Whilst ions move in polar fluids to depolarize neuronal membranes electrons move in the solid-state lattices of microelectronic semiconductors. Joining these two systems together to create an iono-electric brain-computer interface is an immense challenge. However such interfaces offer and in select clinical contexts have already delivered a method of overcoming disability caused by neurological or musculoskeletal pathology. To fulfill their theoretical promise several specific challenges demand consideration. Rate-limiting steps cover a diverse range of disciplines including microelectronics neuro-informatics engineering and materials science. As those who work at the tangible interface between brain and outside world neurosurgeons are well placed to contribute to and inform this cutting edge area of translational research. This article explores the historical background status quo and future of brain-computer interfaces; and outlines the challenges to progress and opportunities available to the clinical neurosciences community. Engineering brain-computer interfaces: past present and future.
