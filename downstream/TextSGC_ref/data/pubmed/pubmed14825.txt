The training to learn how to perform perforator flaps requires practice on a living model to optimize dissection and to evaluate outcome. The purpose of this study was to describe a training model that optimizes the use of animals in order to perform the maximum number of exercises per animal. A sequence of flaps and dissection exercises in the living model to improve the learning curve for perforator flap surgery.
