The development of standardised methods for ultrasound US scanning and evaluation of synovitis activity by the OMERACT-EULAR Synovitis Scoring OESS system is a major step forward in the use of US in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory arthritis. The variation in interpretation of disease activity on US images can affect diagnosis treatment and outcomes in clinical trials. We therefore set out to investigate if we could utilise neural network architecture for the interpretation of disease activity on Doppler US images using the OESS scoring system. Neural networks for automatic scoring of arthritis disease activity on ultrasound images.
