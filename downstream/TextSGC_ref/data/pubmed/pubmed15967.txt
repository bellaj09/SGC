The concept of maximizing bone removal along the skull base has been advocated to expand the operative space for large firm and encasing ventral and ventrolateral skull base tumors. However indications for the use of such osteotomies have not been well defined. The improved maneuverability and enhanced extent of expansion of the operative corridor via the skull base approaches compared to those of standard craniotomies have been based on cadaveric studies that might not simulate the operative environment realistically. Bony removal alone is not adequate to protect neurovascular structures and strategic use of dynamic retraction and innovative operative routes are some of the other factors that contribute to successful microsurgery. In this analysis the more discriminate indications and modified techniques for orbitozygomatic osteotomy are discussed. The Orbitozygomatic Craniotomy and Its Judicious Use.
