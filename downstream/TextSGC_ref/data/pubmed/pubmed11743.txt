"Parkinsons Disease PD is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly progressive and heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted in recent years on predictive or disease progression modeling of PD using clinical and biomarkers data. Neuroimaging as another important information source for neurodegenerative disease has also arisen considerable interests from the PD community. In this paper we propose a deep learning method based on Graph Convolutional Networks GCN for fusing multiple modalities of brain images in relationship prediction which is useful for distinguishing PD cases from controls. On Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative PPMI cohort our approach achieved 0.95370.0587 AUC compared with 0.64430.0223 AUC achieved by traditional approaches such as PCA."
