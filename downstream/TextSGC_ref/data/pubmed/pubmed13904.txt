The mechanisms underlying the effects of cannabinoids on cognitive processes are not understood. Here we show that cannabinoid type-1 receptors CB1Rs control hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated HCN channels that underlie the h-current Ih a key regulator of dendritic excitability. The CB1R-HCN pathway involving c-Jun-N-terminal kinases JNKs nitric oxide synthase and intracellular cGMP exerts a tonic enhancement of Ih selectively in pyramidal cells located in the superficial portion of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer whereas it is absent from deep-layer cells. Activation of the CB1R-HCN pathway impairs dendritic integration of excitatory inputs long-term potentiation LTP and spatial memory formation. Strikingly pharmacological inhibition of Ih or genetic deletion of HCN1 abolishes CB1R-induced deficits in LTP and memory. These results demonstrate that the CB1R-Ih pathway in the hippocampus is obligatory for the action of cannabinoids on LTP and spatial memory formation.
