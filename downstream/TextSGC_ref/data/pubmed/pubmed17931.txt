Reconstruction has evolved long way from primary closure to flaps. As time evolved better understanding of vascularity of flap has led to the development of innovative reconstructive techniques. These flaps can be raised from various parts of the body for reconstruction and have shown least donor site morbidity. We use one such peroneal artery perforator flap for tongue reconstruction with advantage of thin pliable flap minimal donor site morbidity and hidden scar. Perforator Peroneal Artery Flap for Tongue Reconstruction.
