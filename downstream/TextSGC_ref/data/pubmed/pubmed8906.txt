Since 2009 out-of-hospital care of junctional hemorrhage bleeding from the trunk-appendage junctions has changed in part due to the newly available junctional tourniquets JTs that have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. Given four new models of JT available in 2014 several military services have begun to acquire train or even use such JTs in care. The ability of users to be trained in JT use has been observed by multiple instructors. The experience of such instructors has been broad as a group but their experience as individuals has been neither long nor deep. A gathering into one source of the collective experience of trainers of JT users could permit a collation of useful information to include lessons learned tips in skill performance identification of pitfalls of use to avoid and strategies to optimize user learning. The purpose of the present review is to record the experiences of several medical personnel in their JT training of users to provide a guide for future trainers.
