"Frozen shoulder is a common clinical shoulder condition. Measuring the degree of shoulder joint movement is crucial to the rehabilitation process. Such measurements can be used to evaluate the severity of patients condition establish rehabilitation goals and appropriate activity difficulty levels and understand the effects of rehabilitation. Currently measurements of the shoulder joint movement degree are typically conducted by therapists using a protractor. However along with the growth of telerehabilitation measuring the shoulder joint mobility on patients own at home will be needed. In this study wireless inertial sensors were combined with the virtual reality interactive technology to provide an innovative shoulder joint mobility self-measurement system that can enable patients to measure their performance of four shoulder joint movements on their own at home. Pilot clinical trials were conducted with 25 patients to confirm the feasibility of the system. In addition the results of correlation and differential analyses compared with the results of traditional measurement methods exhibited a high correlation verifying the accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover according to interviews with patients they are confident in their ability to measure shoulder joint mobility themselves."
