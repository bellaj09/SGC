"While virtual humans are increasingly used to benefit the elderly considerably little is still known about older adults virtual experiences. However due to age-related changes older adults perceptions of virtual environments VEs may be unique. Hence our objective was to examine possible gender differences in immersion flow and emotional states as well as physical and social presence in elderly males and females interacting either with a computer-controlled agent or a human-controlled avatar. Seventy-eight German-speaking older adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or an agent condition and were exposed to a brief social encounter in a virtual caf. Results indicate no overall gender differences but a significant effect of agency on social presence physical presence immersion and flow. Participants in the avatar condition reported higher levels in all measures except for involvement. Furthermore significant gender\u2009\u2009agency interactions were found with females showing more social presence spatial presence and flow when interacting with a human-controlled avatar and more realism when conversing with an agent. Also all participants showed significant changes in their affect post exposure. In sum older adults virtual experiences seem to follow unique patterns yet they do not preclude the elderly from successfully participating in VEs."
