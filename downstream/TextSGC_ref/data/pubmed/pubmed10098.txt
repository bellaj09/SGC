One of the main obstacles for memristors to become commonly used in electrical engineering and in the field of artificial intelligence is the unreliability of physical implementations. A non-uniform range of resistance low mass-production yield and high fault probability during operation are disadvantages of the current memristor technologies. In this article the authors offer a solution for these problems with a circuit design which consists of many memristors with a high operational variance that can form a more robust single memristor. The proposition is confirmed by physical device measurements by gaining similar results as in previous simulations. These results can lead to more stable devices which are a necessity for neuromorphic computation artificial intelligence and neural network applications.
