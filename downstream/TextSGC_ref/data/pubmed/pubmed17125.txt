Blunt impact on the eye could results in lens capsular rupture that allows foreign substances to enter into the lens and leads to cataract formation. This paper aimed to investigate the mechanism of lens capsular rupture using finite element FE method. A FE model of the human eye was developed to simulate dynamic response of the lens capsule to a BB a standard 4.5-mm-diameter pellet impact. Sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of the parameters on capsular rupture including the impact velocity the elastic modulus of the lens the thickness and the elastic modulus of the lens capsule. The results indicated that the lens was subjected to anterior compression and posterior intension when the eye was stricken by a BB pellet. The strain on the posterior capsule 0.392 was almost twice as much as that on the anterior capsule 0.207 at an impact velocity of 20 m/s. The strain on the capsule was proportional to the impact velocity while the capsular strain showed no significant change when the lens modulus elastic varied with age. The findings confirmed that blunt traumatic capsular rupture is the result of shockwave propagation throughout the eye. The posterior capsule is subjected to greater tension in blunt trauma which is the main cause that ruptures are more commonly found on the posterior capsule than the anterior capsule. Also thinner thickness and lower elastic modulus would contribute to the posterior capsular rupture. Mechanism of lens capsular rupture following blunt trauma: a finite element study.
