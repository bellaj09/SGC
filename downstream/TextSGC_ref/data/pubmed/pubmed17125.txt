"Clinical skills laboratories have been established in medical institutions as facilities for simulation-based medical education SBME. SBME is believed to be superior to the traditional style of medical education from the viewpoint of the active and adult learning theories. SBME can provide a learning cycle of debriefing and feedback for learners as well as evaluation of procedures and competency. SBME offers both learners and patients a safe environment for practice and error. In a full-environment simulation learners can obtain not only technical skills but also non-technical skills such as leadership team work communication situation awareness decision-making and awareness of personal limitations. SBME is also effective for integration of clinical medicine and basic medicine. In addition technology-enhanced simulation training is associated with beneficial effects for outcomes of knowledge skills behaviors and patient-related outcomes. To perform SBME effectively not only simulators including high-fidelity mannequin-type simulators or virtual-reality simulators but also full-time faculties and instructors as professionals of SBME are essential in a clinical skills laboratory for SBME. Clinical skills laboratory is expected to become an integrated medical education center to achieve continuing professional development integrated learning of basic and clinical medicine and citizens participation and cooperation in medical education."
