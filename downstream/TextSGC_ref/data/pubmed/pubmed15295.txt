Recent advances in deep learning have seen an increase in its application to automated image analysis in ophthalmology for conditions with a high prevalence. We wanted to identify whether deep learning could be used for the automated classification of optical coherence tomography OCT images from patients with Stargardt disease STGD using a smaller dataset than traditionally used. Automated classification of normal and Stargardt disease optical coherence tomography images using deep learning.
