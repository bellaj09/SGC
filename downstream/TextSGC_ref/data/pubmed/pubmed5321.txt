Focusing on sex differences is necessary to fully understand basic neurobiological processes such as the engagement of large-scale brain networks involved in attention. Prior work suggests that women show enhanced attention during tasks of reward/punishment relative to men. Yet sex differences in the engagement of neural networks sub serving internal and external focus has been unexplored in regard to reward and punishment. Using data from a large sample n = 190 of healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project we investigated sex differences in default mode network DMN dorsal attention network DAN and frontal parietal network FPN activation during exposure to reward and punishment. To determine if sex differences are specific to valenced stimuli we analyzed network activation during working memory. Results indicate that relative to men women have increased suppression of the DMN and greater activation of the DAN during exposure to reward and punishment. Given the relative roles of these networks in internal DMN and external DAN attention this pattern of activation suggests that women have enhanced external attention to reward and punishment. In contrast there were no sex differences in network activation during working memory indicating that this sex difference is specific to the processing of reward and punishment. These findings suggest a neurobiological explanation for prior work showing women have greater sensitivity to reward/punishment and are more prone to psychiatric disorders characterized by enhanced attention to such stimuli. Furthermore given the large sample from the Human Connectome Project the current findings provide general implications for the study of sex as a biological variable in investigation of reward processes.
