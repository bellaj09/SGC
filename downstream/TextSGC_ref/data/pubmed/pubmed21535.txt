As the population of older adults is growing the interest in a simple way to detect characterize amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI a prodromal stage of Alzheimer\s disease AD is becoming increasingly important. Serious game SG -based cognitive and motor performance profiles while performing everyday activities and dual-task walking DTW "motor signatures" are two very promising markers that can be detected in predementia states. We aim to compare the consistency or conformity of measurements made by a custom SG with DTW NAV a SG without DTW DOT neuropsychological measures and genotyping as markers for early detection of aMCI. Reliability of a novel serious game using dual-task gait profiles to early characterize aMCI.
