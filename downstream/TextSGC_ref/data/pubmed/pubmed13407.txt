Underwater acoustic target recognition based on ship-radiated noise belongs to the small-sample-size recognition problems. A competitive deep-belief network is proposed to learn features with more discriminative information from labeled and unlabeled samples. The proposed model consists of four stages: 1 A standard restricted Boltzmann machine is pretrained using a large number of unlabeled data to initialize its parameters; 2 the hidden units are grouped according to categories which provides an initial clustering model for competitive learning; 3 competitive training and back-propagation algorithms are used to update the parameters to accomplish the task of clustering; 4 by applying layer-wise training and supervised fine-tuning a deep neural network is built to obtain features. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve classification accuracy of 90.89% which is 8.95% higher than the accuracy obtained by the compared methods. In addition the highest accuracy of our method is obtained with fewer features than other methods. Competitive Deep-Belief Networks for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition.
