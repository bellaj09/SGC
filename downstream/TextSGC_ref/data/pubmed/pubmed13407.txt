Computationally predicting disease genes helps scientists optimize the in-depth experimental validation and accelerates the identification of real disease-associated genes. Modern high-throughput technologies have generated a vast amount of omics data and integrating them is expected to improve the accuracy of computational prediction. As an integrative model multimodal deep belief net DBN can capture cross-modality features from heterogeneous datasets to model a complex system. Studies have shown its power in image classification and tumor subtype prediction. However multimodal DBN has not been used in predicting disease-gene associations. Enhancing the prediction of disease-gene associations with multimodal deep learning.
