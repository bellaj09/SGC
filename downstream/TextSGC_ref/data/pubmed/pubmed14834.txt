The studies have indicated that not only microRNAs miRNAs or long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs play important roles in biological activities but also their interactions affect the biological process. A growing number of studies focus on the miRNA-lncRNA interactions while few of them are proposed for plant. The prediction of interactions is significant for understanding the mechanism of interaction between miRNA and lncRNA in plant.
