In this paper we proposed a gait type classification method based on deep learning using a smart insole with various sensor arrays. We measured gait data using a pressure sensor array an acceleration sensor array and a gyro sensor array built into a smart insole. Features of gait pattern were then extracted using a deep convolution neural network DCNN. In order to accomplish this measurement data of continuous gait cycle were divided into unit steps. Pre-processing of data were then performed to remove noise followed by data normalization. A feature map was then extracted by constructing an independent DCNN for data obtained from each sensor array. Each of the feature maps was then combined to form a fully connected network for gait type classification. Experimental results for seven types of gait walking fast walking running stair climbing stair descending hill climbing and hill descending showed that the proposed method provided a high classification rate of more than 90%.
