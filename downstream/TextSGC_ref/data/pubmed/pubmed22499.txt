"This article presents the VIRTOPS VIRTual Operation Planning in Orthopaedic Surgery software system for virtual preoperative planning and simulation of hip operations. The system is applied to simulate the endoprosthetic reconstruction of the hip joint with hemipelvic replacement and supports the individual design of anatomically adaptable modular prostheses in bone tumor surgery. The virtual planning of the operation and the construction of the individual implant are supported by virtual reality techniques. The central step of the operation planning procedure the placement of the cutting plane in the hip bone depends strongly on the tumors position. Segmentation of the tumor and the bones in MR and CT data as well as fusion of MR and CT image sequences is necessary to visualize the tumors position within the hip bone." Three-dimensional planning and simulation of hip operations and computer-assisted construction of endoprostheses in bone tumor surgery.
