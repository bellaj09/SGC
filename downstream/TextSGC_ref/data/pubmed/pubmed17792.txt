Using 3D generic models to statistically analyze trends in biological structure changes is an important tool in morphometrics research. Therefore 3D generic models built for a range of populations are in high demand. However due to the complexity of biological structures and the limited views of them that medical images can offer it is still an exceptionally difficult task to quickly and accurately create 3D generic models a model is a 3D graphical representation of a biological structure based on medical image stacks a stack is an ordered collection of 2D images. We show that the creation of a generic model that captures spatial information exploitable in statistical analyses is facilitated by coupling our generalized segmentation method to existing automatic image registration algorithms. Building generic anatomical models using virtual model cutting and iterative registration.
