"\xa0\xa0This study sought to determine whether a long-term case review LTCR program helped pharmacy students develop their abilities as pharmacists and how their level of satisfaction changed. LTCRs were comprised of four elements: self-learning one-on-one bedside training with advising pharmacists daily group sessions including three members and weekly plenary sessions case conferences. This program conducted on-site training in a hospital for 21 fifth-year students. The students were divided into 7 groups. One member of each group was assigned to a ward for bedside training for three weeks while other members of the central pharmacy provided support through daily group sessions. Each week students training in the wards delivered case presentations in the case conference. All students advising pharmacists and teachers participated in these weekly case conferences. Upon conclusion of the on-site training a survey was conducted on the programs efficacy. Through information sharing during group discussions and in case conferences continuous patient follow up was possible regardless of students training schedules in wards or in the central pharmacy. After introducing the LTCR the mean satisfaction level for case conferences as scored using a 5-point Likert-type scale increased from 3.4 to 4.3. Students levels of understanding also improved. Statistically significant increases in students self-evaluation scores on professional awareness presentation skills and logical thinking were also observed. We concluded that the program helped students to gain practical experience made them more aware of clinical issues and improved their presentation skills. Through this program the students gained clinical competency through a deep understanding of the clinical courses of diseases and patient-oriented pharmaceutical care."
