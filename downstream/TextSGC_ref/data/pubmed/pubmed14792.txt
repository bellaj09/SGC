"The ability to predict the impact of cis-regulatory sequences on gene expression would facilitate discovery in fundamental and applied biology. Here we combine polysome profiling of a library of 280000 randomized 5 untranslated regions UTRs with deep learning to build a predictive model that relates human 5 UTR sequence to translation. Together with a genetic algorithm we use the model to engineer new 5 UTRs that accurately direct specified levels of ribosome loading providing the ability to tune sequences for optimal protein expression. We show that the same approach can be extended to chemically modified RNA an important feature for applications in mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology. We test 35212 truncated human 5 UTRs and 3577 naturally occurring variants and show that the model predicts ribosome loading of these sequences. Finally we provide evidence of 45 single-nucleotide variants SNVs associated with human diseases that substantially change ribosome loading and thus may represent a molecular basis for disease."
