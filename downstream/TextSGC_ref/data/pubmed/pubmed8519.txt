"Lung cancer is considered one of the deadliest diseases in the world. An early and accurate diagnosis aims to promote the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules which is of vital importance to increase the patients survival rates. The mentioned characterization is done through a segmentation process facing several challenges due to the diversity in nodular shape size and texture as well as the presence of adjacent structures. This paper tackles pulmonary nodule segmentation in computed tomography scans proposing three distinct methodologies. First a conventional approach which applies the Sliding Band Filter SBF to estimate the filters support points matching the border coordinates. The remaining approaches are Deep Learning based using the U-Net and a novel network called SegU-Net to achieve the same goal. Their performance is compared as this work aims to identify the most promising tool to improve nodule characterization. All methodologies used 2653 nodules from the LIDC database achieving a Dice score of 0.663 0.830 and 0.823 for the SBF U-Net and SegU-Net respectively. This way the U-Net based models yield more identical results to the ground truth reference annotated by specialists thus being a more reliable approach for the proposed exercise. The novel network revealed similar scores to the U-Net while at the same time reducing computational cost and improving memory efficiency. Consequently such study may contribute to the possible implementation of this model in a decision support system assisting the physicians in establishing a reliable diagnosis of lung pathologies based on this segmentation task."
