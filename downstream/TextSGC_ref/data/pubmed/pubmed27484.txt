In the field of neurorehabilitation with brain-computer interfaces BCIs technology an EEG feature event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/S caused by motor imagery MI is widely used for estimating human motor intention. However sufficient neurofeedback training is required for the use of the MI-based BCI system because the ability to generate ERD/S is highly dependent on individuals. To find an effective MI condition for the BCI system we hypothesize that having a conscious target during MI would enhance the extent of ERD/S. In the experiments we investigated the individual effect of two types of MIs: leg extension L and leg extension with a conscious target i.e. kicking a ball KB on the resultant ERD/S. We evaluated time-frequency maps of ERD/S and statistically compared these two conditions i.e. L and KB. As a result a significant difference was found in beta-ERD paired t-test p <; 0.01 while there were no significant differences in mu-ERD and beta-ERS. These results suggest that having a conscious target during lower extremity MI would strengthen the ERD in beta frequency band compared to the case without target.
