The long-term durability and safety of implanted devices is of great importance in the field of motor neuroprosthetics where systems may possibly be utilized in excess of 50 years by some individuals.

The experience with these systems shows a high level of durability of the implanted components particularly the stimulating electrodes and leads. Twenty year experience with implanted neuroprostheses.
