Scattered radiation which occurs when using a C-arm for intraoperative radiography can be better understood through interactive visualization. We developed a virtual reality VR approach for the simulation of scattered radiation SSR as part of a C-arm training system. In VR it is important to avoid cyber sickness which is often caused by increased latency between head motion and image presentation inside the head-mounted display. As the latency requirement interferes with the computational complexity of the SSR the goal has been to maintain a low latency during the simultaneous computation of the SSR on moderate-cost consumer hardware.
