Diabetes has become one of the biggest health problems in the world. In this context adherence to insulin treatment is essential in order to avoid life-threatening complications. In this pilot study a novel adherence detection algorithm using Deep Learning DL approaches was developed for type 2 diabetes T2D patients based on simulated Continuous Glucose Monitoring CGM signals. A large and diverse amount of CGM signals were simulated for T2D patients using a T2D adapted version of the Medtronic Virtual Patient MVP model for T1D. By using these signals different classification algorithms were compared using a comprehensive grid search. We contrast a standard logistic regression baseline to Multi- Layer Perceptrons MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs. The best classification performance with an average accuracy of 77:5% was achieved with CNN. Hence this indicates the potential of DL when considering adherence detection systems for T2D patients.
