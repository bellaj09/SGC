"BACKGROUNDAccurate segmentation of brain tumor depicting on magnetic resonance imaging MRI is an important step for doctors to determine optimal treatment plan of Gliomas which are the common malignant brain tumors that seriously damage patients health and life.OBJECTThis study aims to improve accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor segmentation on MRI using the advanced deep learning model.METHODIn this study an improved model based on the U-net for accurate segmentation of brain tumor MRI images called Deeper ResU-net is proposed. First a deep Deeper U-net is built which has deeper network depth compared with U-net uses Squeeze Operator to control network parameters and attempts to enhance the feature extraction ability. Then Deeper ResU-net is formed to eliminate degradation phenomenon of the deep network in which residual unit is designed and integrated into the Deeper U-net to keep the number of parameters unchanged.RESULTDeeper ResU-net makes the deep network conduct stable training without degrading. Evaluation result shows that the Deeper ResU-net has achieved competitive result with average DSC metrics of 0.9 0.82 0.88 for Complete tumor region Core tumor region and Enhanced tumor region respectively.CONCLUSIONBy extending the U-net model to a deeper layer and adding the residual structure to ensure effective and stable training of the model the experiment results demonstrate that applying the improved Deeper ResU-net can effectively eliminate the degradation phenomenon of deep network and improve segmentation performance."
