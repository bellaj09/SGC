The nature of moral action versus moral judgment has been extensively debated in numerous disciplines. We introduce Virtual Reality VR moral paradigms examining the action individuals take in a high emotionally arousing direct action-focused moral scenario. In two studies involving qualitatively different populations we found a greater endorsement of utilitarian responses-killing one in order to save many others-when action was required in moral virtual dilemmas compared to their judgment counterparts. Heart rate in virtual moral dilemmas was significantly increased when compared to both judgment counterparts and control virtual tasks. Our research suggests that moral action may be viewed as an independent construct to moral judgment with VR methods delivering new prospects for investigating and assessing moral behaviour.
