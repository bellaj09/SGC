The brain-computer interfaces BCIs for neurologic rehabilitation are based on the assumption that by retraining the brain to specific activities an ultimate improvement of function can be expected. In this chapter we review the present status key determinants and future directions of the clinical use of BCI in neurorehabilitation. The recent advancements in noninvasive BCIs as a therapeutic tool to promote functional motor recovery by inducing neuroplasticity are described focusing on stroke as it represents the major cause of long-term motor disability. The relevance of recent findings on BCI use in spinal cord injury beyond the control of neuroprosthetic devices to restore motor function is briefly discussed. In a dedicated section we examine the potential role of BCI technology in the domain of cognitive function recovery by instantiating BCIs in the long history of neurofeedback and some emerging BCI paradigms to address cognitive rehabilitation are highlighted. Despite the knowledge acquired over the last decade and the growing number of studies providing evidence for clinical efficacy of BCI in motor rehabilitation an exhaustive deployment of this technology in clinical practice is still on its way. The pipeline to translate BCI to clinical practice in neurorehabilitation is the subject of this chapter. Brain-computer interfaces in neurologic rehabilitation practice.
