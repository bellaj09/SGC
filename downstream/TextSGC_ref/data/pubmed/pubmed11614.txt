Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is the method of choice for imaging meningiomas. Volumetric assessment of meningiomas is highly relevant for therapy planning and monitoring. We used a multiparametric deep-learning model DLM on routine MRI data including images from diverse referring institutions to investigate DLM performance in automated detection and segmentation of meningiomas in comparison to manual segmentations. Fully automated detection and segmentation of meningiomas using deep learning on routine multiparametric MRI.
