Receptors for glucocorticoid GR and corticotropin-releasing hormone CRH are largely found in brain sensorimotor structures particularly in cerebellum underlining a potential role of stress hormones in the regulation of motor function. Since CRH is involved in neuroplasticity known for its trophic effect on synapses we investigated how manipulations in corticosterone serum levels can modulate the CRH system in the cerebellum and affect motor coordination. Corticosterone at doses of either 15 or 30mg/kg was injected in mice and the status of hormonal expression evaluated in cerebellum hippocampus and hypothalamus in undisturbed housing conditions or after different behavioral tests. Under both conditions metabolic activity in numerous brain regions involved in motor functions and emotion was measured by means of cytochrome oxidase COX activity labeling. After six consecutive days of corticosterone administration CRH-R1 transcription was downregulated in hypothalamic and cerebellar regions and hypometabolic changes were observed in mice treated with the higher dose for several limbic and sensorimotor circuitries notably basal ganglia deep cerebellar nuclei and red nucleus. Corticosterone did not modify motor activity anxiety and spatial orientation but decreased latencies before falling from the rotorod and prevented mice from reaching targets in the coat-hanger test. In addition COX activities were similar to control mice except in ventromedial thalamus and dorsal neostriatum possibly indicating that physical activity protected brain energy metabolism against the stress hormone. The present findings showed that the CRH/CRH-R1 system might play a role in mediating the effects of stress on cerebellar function affecting especially motor learning tasks. Repeated corticosterone injections in adult mice alter stress hormonal receptor expression in the cerebellum and motor coordination without affecting spatial learning.
