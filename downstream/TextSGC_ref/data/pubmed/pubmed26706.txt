Current brain-machine interfaces are based on the implicit assumption that information encoded by neuronal activities does not change despite some recent physiological studies indicating that information encoded by neuronal activities changes. Here we highlight the necessity for advanced decoding of neuronal activities. Especially we discuss the advantages of multilateral analyses of neuronal activities including synchronization and variability. The potential of multilateral analyses of neuronal activities in future brain-machine interface research.
