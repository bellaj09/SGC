"Mapping the relation between cortical convolution and structural/functional brain architectures could provide deep insights into the mechanisms of brain development evolution and diseases. In our previous studies we found a unique gyral folding pattern termed a 3-hinge which was defined as the conjunction of three gyral crests. The uniqueness of the 3-hinge was evidenced by its thicker cortex and stronger fiber connections than other gyral regions. However the role that 3-hinges play in cortico-cortical connective architecture remains unclear. To this end we conducted MRI studies by constructing structural cortico-cortical connective networks based on a fine-granular cortical parcellation the parcels of which were automatically labeled as 3-hinge 2-hinge ordinary gyrus or sulcus. On human brains 3-hinges possess significantly higher degrees strengths and betweennesses than 2-hinges suggesting that 3-hinges could serve more like hubs in the cortico-cortical connective network. This hypothesis gains supports from human functional network analyses in which 3-hinges are involved in more global functional networks than ordinary gyri. In addition 3-hinges could serve as connector hubs rather than provincial hubs and they account for a dominant proportion of nodes in the high-level backbone of the network. These structural results are reproduced on chimpanzee and macaque brains while the roles of 3-hinges as hubs become more pronounced in higher order primates. Our new findings could provide a new window to the relation between cortical convolution anatomical connection and brain function." Cortical 3-hinges could serve as hubs in cortico-cortical connective network.
