We analyse and compare the classification accuracies of six different classifiers for a two-class mental task mental arithmetic and rest using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS signals. The signals of the mental arithmetic and rest tasks from the prefrontal cortex region of the brain for seven healthy subjects were acquired using a multichannel continuous-wave imaging system. After removal of the physiological noises six features were extracted from the oxygenated hemoglobin HbO signals. Two- and three-dimensional combinations of those features were used for classification of mental tasks. In the classification six different modalities linear discriminant analysis LDA quadratic discriminant analysis QDA k-nearest neighbour kNN the Nave Bayes approach support vector machine SVM and artificial neural networks ANN were utilized. With these classifiers the average classification accuracies among the seven subjects for the 2- and 3-dimensional combinations of features were 71.6 90.0 69.7 89.8 89.5 and 91.4% and 79.6 95.2 64.5 94.8 95.2 and 96.3% respectively. ANN showed the maximum classification accuracies: 91.4 and 96.3%. In order to validate the results a statistical significance test was performed which confirmed that the p values were statistically significant relative to all of the other classifiers p < 0.005 using HbO signals.
