Primary motor-cortex multi-unit activity MUA and local-field potentials LFPs have both been suggested as potential control signals for brain-computer interfaces BCIs aimed at movement restoration. Some studies report that LFP-based decoding is comparable to spiking-based decoding while others offer contradicting evidence. Differences in experimental paradigms tuning models and decoding techniques make it hard to directly compare these results. Here we use regression and mutual information analyses to study how MUA and LFP encode various kinematic parameters during reaching movements. We find that in addition to previously reported directional tuning MUA also contains prominent speed tuning. LFP activity in low-frequency bands 15-40Hz LFPL is primarily speed tuned and contains more speed information than both high-frequency LFP 100-300Hz LFPH and MUA. LFPH contains more directional information compared to LFPL but less information when compared with MUA. Our results suggest that a velocity and speed encoding model is most appropriate for both MUA and LFPH whereas a speed only encoding model is adequate for LFPL.
