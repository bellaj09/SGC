"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. In some cases patients with ALS retain a normal level of consciousness but disease progression eventually results in generalized paralysis which first impedes and then prevents oral communication. This communication obstacle can generate a great deal of stress for the patient family and caregiver. Here the authors ask whether the use of an eye-tracking assistive device can improve quality of life for ALS patients and relieves burden of their primary caregivers. Subjects were divided into two groups depending on whether they used n = 10 or did not use n = 10 an eye-tracking assistive device. The authors assessed patients quality of life and severity of depression using the ALS Specific Quality of Life Instrument-Revised and the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire respectively. The Caregiver Burden Scale was used to assess the burden on caregivers. Our study shows that the eye-tracking assistive device significantly improved patients quality of life as compared with patients in the nonuser group p <.01. The assistive device also reduced the burden on caregivers p <.05. This is likely a result of the improvement of patients autonomy and more effective communication between patient and caregiver."
