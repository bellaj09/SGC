Exergames can be considered a dual task because the games are performed by a man-videogame interface requiring cognitive and motor functions simultaneously. Although the literature has shown improvements of cognitive and physical functions due to exergames the intrinsic mechanisms involved in these functional changes have still not been elucidated. The aims of the present study were 1 to demonstrate the known biological mechanisms of physical exercise regarding muscle adaptation and establish a relationship with exergames; and 2 to present a neurobiological hypothesis about the neuroplastic effects of exergames on the cognitive function of institutionalized older persons. These hypotheses are discussed. Exergames: neuroplastic hypothesis about cognitive improvement and biological effects on physical function of institutionalized older persons.
