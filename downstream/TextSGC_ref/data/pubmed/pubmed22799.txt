Video-camera systems are widely used in biomechanics and clinical fields to measure the 3D kinematic measurements of human motion. To be used they need to be calibrated that is the parameters which geometrically define the cameras have to be determined. It is shown here how this can be achieved by surveying a rigid bar in motion inside the working volume and in a very short time: less than 15 s on a Pentium III. The exterior parameters are estimated through the coplanarity constraint the camera focal lengths through the properties of epipolar geometry and the principal points with a fast evolutionary optimisation which guarantees convergence when the initial principal points cannot be adequately estimated. The method has been widely tested on simulated and real data. Results show that its accuracy is comparable with that obtained using methods based on points of known 3D coordinates DLT: 0.37 mm RMS error over a volume with a diagonal approximately 1.5 m. A preferential absolute reference system is obtained from the same bar motion data and is used to guide an intelligent decimation of the data. Finally the role that the principal points play in achieving a high accuracy which is questioned in the computer vision domain is assessed through simulations. A fast method for calibrating video-based motion analysers using only a rigid bar.
