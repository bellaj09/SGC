Compound selectivity prediction plays an important role in identifying potential compounds that bind to the target of interest with high affinity. However there is still short of efficient and accurate computational approaches to analyze and predict compound selectivity. In this paper we propose two methods to improve the compound selectivity prediction. We employ an improved multitask learning method in Neural Networks NNs which not only incorporates both activity and selectivity for other targets but also uses a probabilistic classifier with a logistic regression. We further improve the compound selectivity prediction by using the multitask learning method in Deep Belief Networks DBNs which can build a distributed representation model and improve the generalization of the shared tasks. In addition we assign different weights to the auxiliary tasks that are related to the primary selectivity prediction task. In contrast to other related work our methods greatly improve the accuracy of the compound selectivity prediction in particular using the multitask learning in DBNs with modified weights obtains the best performance.
