To develop and evaluate a patch-based convolutional neural network CNN to generate synthetic computed tomography sCT images for magnetic resonance MR-only workflow for radiotherapy of head and neck tumors. A patch-based deep learning method was chosen to improve robustness to abnormal anatomies caused by large tumors surgical excisions or dental artifacts. In this study we evaluate whether the generated sCT images enable accurate MR-based dose calculations in the head and neck region. Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT for head and neck radiotherapy generated by a patch-based three-dimensional convolutional neural network.
