The bioelectrical impedance analysis BIA method is widely used to predict percent body fat PBF. However it requires four to eight electrodes and it takes a few minutes to accurately obtain the measurement results. In this study we propose a faster and more accurate method that utilizes a small dry electrode-based wearable device which predicts whole-body impedance using only upper-body impedance values. Such a small electrode-based device typically needs a long measurement time due to increased parasitic resistance and its accuracy varies by measurement posture. To minimize these variations we designed a sensing system that only utilizes contact with the wrist and index fingers. The measurement time was also reduced to five seconds by an effective parameter calibration network. Finally we implemented a deep neural network-based algorithm to predict the PBF value by the measurement of the upper-body impedance and lower-body anthropometric data as auxiliary input features. The experiments were performed with 163 amateur athletes who exercised regularly. The performance of the proposed system was compared with those of two commercial systems that were designed to measure body composition using either a whole-body or upper-body impedance value. The results showed that the correlation coefficient  r 2  value was improved by about 9% and the standard error of estimate SEE was reduced by 28%.
