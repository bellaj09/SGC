With the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak countless tests need to be performed on potential symptomatic individuals contacts and travellers. The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR-based system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting. Rapid point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a community screening setting shows low sensitivity.
