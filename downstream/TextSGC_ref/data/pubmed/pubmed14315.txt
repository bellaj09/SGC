Precise skin lesion classification is still challenging due to two problems i.e. 1 inter-class similarity and intra-class variation of skin lesion images and 2 the weak generalization ability of single Deep Convolutional Neural Network trained with limited data. Therefore we propose a Global-Part Convolutional Neural Network GP-CNN model which treats the fine-grained local information and global context information with equal importance. The Global-Part model consists of a Global Convolutional Neural Network G-CNN and a Part Convolutional Neural Network P-CNN. Specifically the G-CNN is trained with downscaled dermoscopy images and is used to extract the global-scale information of dermoscopy images and produce the Classification Activation Map CAM. While the P-CNN is trained with the CAM guided cropped image patches and is used to capture local-scale information of skin lesion regions. Additionally we present a data-transformed ensemble learning strategy which can further boost the classification performance by integrating the different discriminant information from GP-CNNs that are trained with original images color constancy transformed images and feature saliency transformed images respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on the ISIC 2016 and ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Challenge SLC classification datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art skin lesion classification performance i.e. an AP value of 0.718 on the ISIC 2016 SLC dataset and an Average Auc value of 0.926 on the ISIC 2017 SLC dataset without any external data compared with other current methods which need to use external data.
