"Eye movement can be regarded as a pivotal real-time input medium for human-computer communication which is especially important for people with physical disability. In order to improve the reliability mobility and usability of eye tracking technique in user-computer dialogue a novel eye control system with integrating both mouse and keyboard functions is proposed in this paper. The proposed system focuses on providing a simple and convenient interactive mode by only using users eye. The usage flow of the proposed system is designed to perfectly follow human natural habits. Additionally a magnifier module is proposed to allow the accurate operation. In the experiment two interactive tasks with different difficulty searching article and browsing multimedia web were done to compare the proposed eye control tool with an existing system. The Technology Acceptance Model TAM measures are used to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of our system. It is demonstrated that the proposed system is very effective with regard to usability and interface design." Eye Tracking Based Control System for Natural Human-Computer Interaction.
