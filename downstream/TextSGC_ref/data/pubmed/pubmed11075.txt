Volumetric representation has been widely used for 3D deep learning in shape analysis due to its generalization ability and regular data format. However for fine-grained tasks like part segmentation volumetric data has not been widely adopted compared to other representations. Aiming at delivering an effective volumetric method for 3D shape part segmentation this paper proposes a novel volumetric convolutional neural network. Our method can extract discriminative features encoding detailed information from voxelized 3D data under limited resolution. To this purpose a spatial dense extraction SDE module is designed to preserve spatial resolution during feature extraction procedure alleviating the loss of details caused by sub-sampling operations such as max pooling. An attention feature aggregation AFA module is also introduced to adaptively select informative features from different abstraction levels leading to segmentation with both semantic consistency and high accuracy of details. Experimental results demonstrate that promising results can be achieved by using volumetric data with part segmentation accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art non-volumetric methods.
