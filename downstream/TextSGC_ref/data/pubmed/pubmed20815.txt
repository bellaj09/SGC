Mounting evidence suggests that practice on simulators leads to improved operative skills and patient safety. With restrictions on resident work hours resulting in less exposure to procedures simulation is the key to developing operative skills during residency and beyond. Residency programs struggle with implementing a simulation program due to timing and availability of residents. Despite having a large centralized simulation space at our institution we identified lack of dedicated gynecologic simulation curriculum and simulator accessibility as our greatest barriers to utilizing simulation training in gynecology resident education. We sought to design a space within the resident work area dedicated to gynecologic simulation training with specific curriculum and objectives for each work station based on residency year level.
