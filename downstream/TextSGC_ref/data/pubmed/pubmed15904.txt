"Debriefing following a simulation event is a conversational period for reflection and feedback aimed at sustaining or improving future performance. It is considered by many simulation educators to be a critical activity for learning in simulation-based education. Deep learning can be achieved during debriefing and often depends on the facilitation skills of the debriefer as well as the learners perceptions of a safe and supportive learning environment as created by the debriefer. On the other hand poorly facilitated debriefings may create adverse learning generate bad feelings and may lead to a degradation of clinical performance self-reflection or harm to the educator-learner relationship. The use of a structure that recognizes logical and sequential phases during debriefing can assist simulation educators to achieve a deep level of learning."
