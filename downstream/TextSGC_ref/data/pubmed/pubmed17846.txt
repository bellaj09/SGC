Mood-congruent effects have been demonstrated many times but few studies have managed to replicate the effect with natural moods. Additionally the ecological validity of mood induction and real-time observation deficiency remain unresolved. Using a newly developed virtual-reality-based eye-tracking technique the present study conducted real-time observations of mood effects on emotional face recognition with simulated "real-life" pleasant and grisly scenes. In experiment 1 participants performed an emotional face recognition task in both positive and negative virtual reality scenes. The recognition tests and gaze tracking results failed to support mood-congruent effects but did show a mood effect independent of a strong emotional face effect. In experiment 2 participants performed a neutral face recognition task in pleasant and grisly scenes that were matched for arousal levels and the mood effect disappeared. The results also revealed a robust negativity bias in emotional face recognition which was found to accompany a mood repair effect. Virtual Reality Experiments on Emotional Face Recognition Find No Evidence of Mood-Congruent Effects.
