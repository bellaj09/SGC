An eight-class SSVEP-based BCI system was designed and demonstrated in this study. To minimize the complexity of the traditional equipment and operation only one work electrode was used. The work electrode was fabricated in our laboratory and designed as a claw-like structure with a diameter of 15 mm featuring 8 small fingers of 4mm length and 2 mm diameter and the weight was only 0.1g. The structure and elasticity can help the fingers pass through the hair and contact the scalp when placed on head. The electrode was capable to collect evoked brain activities such as steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs. This study showed that although the amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs obtained from a dry claw electrode was relatively lower than that from a wet electrode the difference was not significant. This study further implemented an eight-class SSVEP-based BCI system using a dry claw-like electrode. Three subjects participated in the experiment. Using infinite impulse response IIR filtering and a simplified threshold method based on fast Fourier transform FFT the average accuracy of the three participants was 89.3% using 4 sec-long SSVEPs leading to an average information transfer rate ITR of 26.5 bits/min. The results suggested the ability of using a dry claw-like electrode to perform practical BCI applications. Developing a one-channel BCI system using a dry claw-like electrode.
