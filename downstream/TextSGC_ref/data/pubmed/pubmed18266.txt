Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment CAREN is a system that integrates a training platform motion base a virtual environment a sensor system motion capture and D-flow software. It is useful for both diagnostic and therapeutic use. The human gait pattern can be impaired due to disease trauma or natural decline. Gait analysis is a useful tool to identify impaired gait patterns. Traditional gait analysis is a very time consuming process and therefore only used in exceptional cases. With new systems a quick and extensive analysis is possible and provides useful tools for therapeutic purposes. The range of systems will be described in this paper highlighting both their diagnostic use and the therapeutic possibilities. Because wounded warriors often have an impaired gait due to amputations or other extremity trauma these systems are very useful for military rehabilitative efforts. Additionally the virtual reality environment creates a very challenging situation for the patient enhancing their rehabilitation experience. For that reason several Armed Forces have these systems already in use. The most recent experiences will be discussed; including new developments both in the extension of the range of systems and the improvement and adaptation of the software. A new and promising development the use of CAREN in a special application for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD will also be reviewed. Recent developments in computer assisted rehabilitation environments.
