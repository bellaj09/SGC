Currently the most common imagery task used in Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs is motor imagery asking a user to imagine moving a part of the body. This study investigates the possibility to build BCIs based on another kind of mental imagery namely "visual imagery". We study to what extent can we distinguish alternative mental processes of observing visual stimuli and imagining it to obtain EEG-based BCIs. Per trial we instructed each of 26 users who participated in the study to observe a visual cue of one of two predefined images a flower or a hammer and then imagine the same cue followed by rest. We investigated if we can differentiate between the different subtrial types from the EEG alone as well as detect which image was shown in the trial. We obtained the following classifier performances: i visual imagery vs. visual observation task 71% of classification accuracy ii visual observation task towards different visual stimuli classifying one observation cue versus another observation cue with an accuracy of 61% and iii resting vs. observation/imagery 77% of accuracy between imagery task versus resting state and the accuracy of 75% between observation task versus resting state. Our results show that the presence of visual imagery and specifically related alpha power changes are useful to broaden the range of BCI control strategies.
