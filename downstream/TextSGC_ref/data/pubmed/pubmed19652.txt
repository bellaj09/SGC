"Recent advancements in electronic packaging and image processing techniques have opened the possibility for optics-based portable eye tracking approaches but technical and safety hurdles limit safe implementation toward wearable applications. Here we introduce a fully wearable wireless soft electronic system that offers a portable highly sensitive tracking of eye movements vergence via the combination of skin-conformal sensors and a virtual reality system. Advancement of material processing and printing technologies based on aerosol jet printing enables reliable manufacturing of skin-like sensors while the flexible hybrid circuit based on elastomer and chip integration allows comfortable integration with a users head. Analytical and computational study of a data classification algorithm provides a highly accurate tool for real-time detection and classification of ocular motions. In vivo demonstration with 14 human subjects captures the potential of the wearable electronics as a portable therapy system whose minimized form factor facilitates seamless interplay with traditional wearable hardware." Soft wireless periocular wearable electronics for real-time detection of eye vergence in a virtual reality toward mobile eye therapies.
