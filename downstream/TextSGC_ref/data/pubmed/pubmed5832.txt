This work evaluates the accuracy and precision of the Diffusion parameter EStImation with Gibbs and NoisE Removal DESIGNER pipeline developed to identify and minimize common sources of methodological variability including: thermal noise Gibbs ringing artifacts Rician bias EPI and eddy current induced spatial distortions and motion-related artifacts. Following this processing pipeline iterative parameter estimation techniques were used to derive diffusion parameters of interest based on the diffusion tensor and kurtosis tensor. We evaluated accuracy using a software phantom based on 36 diffusion datasets from the Human Connectome project and tested the precision by analyzing data from 30 healthy volunteers scanned three times within one week. Preprocessing with both DESIGNER or a standard pipeline based on smoothing instead of noise removal improved parameter precision by up to a factor of 2 compared to preprocessing with motion correction alone. When evaluating accuracy we report average decreases in bias deviation from simulated parameters over all included regions for fractional anisotropy mean diffusivity mean kurtosis and axonal water fraction of 9.7% 8.7% 4.2% and 7.6% using DESIGNER compared to the standard pipeline demonstrating that preprocessing with DESIGNER improves accuracy compared to other processing methods. Evaluation of the accuracy and precision of the diffusion parameter EStImation with Gibbs and NoisE removal pipeline.
