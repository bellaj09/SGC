"Head-mounted displays HMDs and virtual reality VR have been frequently used in recent years and a users experience and computation efficiency could be assessed by mounting eye-trackers. However in addition to visually induced motion sickness VIMS eye fatigue has increasingly emerged during and after the viewing experience highlighting the necessity of quantitatively assessment of the detrimental effects. As no measurement method for the eye fatigue caused by HMDs has been widely accepted we detected parameters related to optometry test. We proposed a novel computational approach for estimation of eye fatigue by providing various verifiable models." Assessment of eye fatigue caused by head-mounted displays using eye-tracking.
