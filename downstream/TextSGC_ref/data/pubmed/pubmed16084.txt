Lung nodules have very diverse shapes and sizes which makes classifying them as benign/malignant a challenging problem. In this paper we propose a novel method to predict the malignancy of nodules that have the capability to analyze the shape and size of a nodule using a global feature extractor as well as the density and structure of the nodule using a local feature extractor. Lung nodule classification using deep Local-Global networks.
