Atrial fibrillation AF is a major cause of hospitalization and death in the United States. Moreover as the average age of individuals increases around the world early detection and diagnosis of AF become even more pressing. In this paper we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for the detection of normal sinus rhythm AF other abnormal rhythms and noise. A robust deep convolutional neural network for the classification of abnormal cardiac rhythm using single lead electrocardiograms of variable length.
