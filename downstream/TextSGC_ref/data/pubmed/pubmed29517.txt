In this paper we present and analyze an event distribution system for brain-computer interfaces. Events are commonly used to mark and describe incidents during an experiment and are therefore critical for later data analysis or immediate real-time processing. The presented approach called Tools for brain-computer interaction interface D TiD delivers messages in XML format via a buslike system using transmission control protocol connections or shared memory. A dedicated server dispatches TiD messages to distributed or local clients. The TiD message is designed to be flexible and contains time stamps for event synchronization whereas events describe incidents which occur during an experiment. TiD was tested extensively toward stability and latency. The effect of an occurring event jitter was analyzed and benchmarked on a reference implementation under different conditions as gigabit and 100-Mb Ethernet or Wi-Fi with a different number of event receivers. A 3-dB signal attenuation which occurs when averaging jitter influenced trials aligned by events is starting to become visible at around 1-2 kHz in the case of a gigabit connection. Mean event distribution times across operating systems are ranging from 0.3 to 0.5ms for a gigabit network connection for 106 events. Results for other environmental conditions are available in this paper. References already using TiD for event distribution are provided showing the applicability of TiD for event delivery with distributed or local clients.
