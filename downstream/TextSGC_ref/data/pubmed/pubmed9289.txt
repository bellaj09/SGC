Recently a method known as "ensemble deep learning invariant hologram classification" EDL-IHC for classifying of holograms of deformable objects with deep learning network DLN has been demonstrated. However DL-IHC requires substantial computational resources to attain near perfect success rate 99%. In practice it is always desirable to have higher success rate with a low complexity DLN. In this paper we propose a low complexity DLN known as "ensemble deep learning invariant hologram classification" EDL-IHC. In comparison with DL-IHC our proposed hologram classifier has promoted the success rate by 2.86% in the classification of holograms of handwritten numerals.
