Best practices are currently being developed for the acquisition and processing of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging data used to estimate brain functional organization-or "functional connectivity." Standards have been proposed based on test-retest reliability but open questions remain. These include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain reliability the influence of increasing runs versus sessions the spatial distribution of reliability the reliability of multivariate methods and crucially how reliability maps onto prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 extensively sampled individuals 144 min data each across 2 identically configured scanners to assess test-retest reliability of whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction. Overall the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest for subcortical connections and highest for within-network cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than univariate. Finally reliability could not be used to improve prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this distinction for functional connectivity. A comprehensive understanding of test-retest reliability including its limitations supports the development of best practices in the field.
