Movement related cortical potential MRCP a slow cortical potential from scalp electroencephalogram EEG has been the used in real-time brain-computer-interface BCI systems designed for neurorehabilitation applications. Detecting MPCPs in real time with high accuracy is essential for a reliable BCI system in these applications. In this study we investigated the effect of four spatial filters on MRCP detection during executed and imagined dorsiflexion of healthy participants. Our analysis indicated that in both executed and imagined movement datasets none of the methods investigated significantly improved trial-to-trial consistency of MRCP. However all four spatial filters significantly enhanced signal to noise ratio SNR of the MRCPs which is critical to achieve a high true-positive rate in MRCP detection. Comparison of EEG spatial filters for movement related cortical potential detection.
