Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test PASAT has utility for the detection of cognitive processing deficits. While the PASAT has demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and test-retest reliability administration of the PASAT has been known to create undue anxiety and frustration in participants. As a result degradation of performance may be found on the PASAT. The difficult nature of the PASAT may subsequently decrease the probability of their return for follow up testing.
