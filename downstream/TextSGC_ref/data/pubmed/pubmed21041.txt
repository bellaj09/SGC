This paper presents a gamified motor imagery brain-computer interface MI-BCI training in immersive virtual reality. The aim of the proposed training method is to increase engagement attention and motivation in co-adaptive event-driven MI-BCI training. This was achieved using gamification progressive increase of the training pace and virtual reality design reinforcing body ownership transfer embodiment into the avatar. From the 20 healthy participants performing 6 runs of 2-class MI-BCI training left/right hand 19 were trained for a basic level of MI-BCI operation with average peak accuracy in the session = 75.84%. This confirms the proposed training method succeeded in improvement of the MI-BCI skills; moreover participants were leaving the session in high positive affect. Although the performance was not directly correlated to the degree of embodiment subjective magnitude of the body ownership transfer illusion correlated with the ability to modulate the sensorimotor rhythm. Progressive Training for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces Using Gamification and Virtual Reality Embodiment.
