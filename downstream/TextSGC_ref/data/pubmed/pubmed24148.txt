Accidents or neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS can lead to progressing extensive and complete paralysis leaving patients aware but unable to communicate locked-in state. Brain-computer interfaces BCI based on electroencephalography represent an important approach to establish communication with these patients. The most common BCI for communication rely on the P300 a positive deflection arising in response to rare events. To foster broader application of BCIs for restoring lost function also for end-users with impaired vision we explored whether there were specific time windows during the day in which a P300 driven BCI should be preferably applied. Circadian course of the P300 ERP in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - implications for brain-computer interfaces BCI.
