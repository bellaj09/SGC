Remitted patients with major depressive disorder rMDD often report more fluctuations in mood as residual symptomatology. It is unclear how this affective instability is associated with information processing related to the default mode DMS salience/reward SRS and frontoparietal FPS subnetworks in rMDD patients at high risk of recurrence rrMDD. Sixty-two unipolar drug-free rrMDD patients 2 MDD episodes and 41 healthy controls HCs were recruited. We used experience sampling methodology to monitor mood/cognitions 10 times a day for 6 days and calculated affective instability using the mean adjusted absolute successive difference. Subsequently we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and performed graph theory to obtain network metrics of integration within local efficiency the DMS SRS and FPS and between participation coefficient these subnetworks and others. In rrMDD patients compared with HCs we found that affective instability was increased in most negative mood/cognition variables and that the DMS had less connections with other subnetworks. Furthermore we found that rrMDD patients who showed more instability in feeling down and irritated had less connections between the SRS and other subnetworks and higher local efficiency coefficients in the FPS respectively. In conclusion rrMDD patients compared with HCs are less stable in their negative mood and these dynamics are related to differences in information processing within- and between-specific functional subnetworks. These results are a first step to gain a better understanding of how mood fluctuations in real life are represented in the brain and provide insights into the vulnerability profile of MDD.
