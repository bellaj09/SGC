Computed tomography for the reconstruction of region of interest ROI has advantages in reducing the x-ray dose and the use of a small detector. However standard analytic reconstruction methods such as filtered back projection FBP suffer from severe cupping artifacts and existing model-based iterative reconstruction methods require extensive computations. Recently we proposed a deep neural network to learn the cupping artifacts but the network was not generalized well for different ROIs due to the singularities in the corrupted images. Therefore there is an increasing demand for a neural network that works well for any ROI size. One network to solve all ROIs: Deep learning CT for any ROI using differentiated backprojection.
