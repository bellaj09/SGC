Maladaptive responses to stressors can lead to poor physical and psychological health outcomes. Laboratory studies of stress induction commonly use the Trier Social Stress Test TSST. The TSST has been shown to reliably induce a stress response most commonly measured via cortisol reactivity. Recently researchers have used virtual environment versions of the TSST V-TSST in place of the traditional TSST. The V-TSST has many advantages over the traditional TSST including increased standardization and use of fewer resources but V-TSST has yet to be quantitatively reviewed and compared to the traditional TSST. This review aims to quantifying the effectiveness of V-TSST with a meta-analysis of cortisol response effects and identify potential moderating variables that are more likely to induce a cortisol response with V-TSST.
