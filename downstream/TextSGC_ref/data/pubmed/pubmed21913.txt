The tradeoff between computational complexity and speed in addition to growing demands for real-time BMI brain-machine interface systems expose the necessity of applying methods with least possible complexity. Willison amplitude WAMP and slope sign change SSC are two promising time-domain features only if the right threshold value is defined for them. To overcome the drawback of going through trial and error for the determination of a suitable threshold value modified WAMP and modified SSC are proposed in this paper. Besides a comprehensive assessment of statistical time-domain features in which their effectiveness is evaluated with a support vector machine SVM is presented. To ensure the accuracy of the results obtained by the SVM the performance of each feature is reassessed with supervised fuzzy C-means. The general assessment shows that every subject had at least one of his performances near or greater than 80%. The obtained results prove that for BMI applications in which a few errors can be tolerated these combinations of feature-classifier are suitable. Moreover features that could perform satisfactorily were selected for feature combination. Combinations of the selected features are evaluated with the SVM and they could significantly improve the results in some cases up to full accuracy.
