This study introduces a virtual life-sized perceptual-cognitive training paradigm that combines three-dimensional multiple object tracking 3D-MOT with motor Experiment 1 or perceptual Experiment 2 sport decision-making tasks. We sought to assess the impact of training on task performance and determine optimal training conditions for improvement and learning. Fifty-seven participants were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions isolated 3D-MOT 3D-MOT combined with a decision-making task consolidated 3D-MOT later combined with a decision-making task and isolated decision-making task. We evaluated task performance using speed thresholds success rate % and reaction time s. Findings were that the dual-task paradigm was associated with performance beyond chance level on both 3D-MOT and decision-making tasks despite an important dual-task cost. Interestingly the results seemed to favor consolidated 3D-MOT training over simultaneous 3D-MOT training when combined with a motor decision-making task but not when combined with a perceptual decision-making task. The number of shared attentional resources in the nature of the additional task i.e. perceptual or motor decision-making seems to be key in interpreting the dual-task interference. These findings must be considered when designing representative multitask perceptual-cognitive training.
