Obstructive sleep apnea OSA is accompanied by widespread abnormal spontaneous regional activity related to cognitive deficits. However little is known about the topological properties of the functional brain connectome of patients with OSA. This study aimed to use the graph theory approaches to investigate the topological properties and functional connectivity FC of the functional connectome in patients with OSA based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI. Aberrant brain functional connectome in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
