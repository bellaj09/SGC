Objectives Medical knowledge extraction MKE plays a key role in natural language processing NLP research in electronic medical records EMR which are the important digital carriers for recording medical activities of patients. Named entity recognition NER and medical relation extraction MRE are two basic tasks of MKE. This study aims to improve the recognition accuracy of these two tasks by exploring deep learning methods. Methods This study discussed and built two application scenes of bidirectional long short-term memory combined conditional random field BiLSTM-CRF model for NER and MRE tasks. In the data preprocessing of both tasks a GloVe word embedding model was used to vectorize words. In the NER task a sequence labeling strategy was used to classify each word tag by the joint probability distribution through the CRF layer. In the MRE task the medical entity relation category was predicted by transforming the classification problem of a single entity into a sequence classification problem and linking the feature combinations between entities also through the CRF layer. Results Through the validation on the I2B2 2010 public dataset the BiLSTM-CRF models built in this study got much better results than the baseline methods in the two tasks where the F1-measure was up to 0.88 in NER task and 0.78 in MRE task. Moreover the model converged faster and avoided problems such as overfitting. Conclusion This study proved the good performance of deep learning on medical knowledge extraction. It also verified the feasibility of the BiLSTM-CRF model in different application scenarios laying the foundation for the subsequent work in the EMR field.
