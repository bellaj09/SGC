"Virtual Reality VR has for the past two decades proven to be a useful adjunctive tool for both assessment and treatment of patients with eating disorders and obesity. VR allows an individual to enter scenarios that simulate real-life situations and to encounter food cues known to trigger his/her disordered eating behavior. As well VR enables three-dimensional figures of the patients body to be presented helping him/her to reach an awareness of body image distortion and then providing the opportunity to confront and correct distortions resulting in a more realistic body image and a decrease in body image dissatisfaction. In this paper we describe seminal studies in this research area." Virtual Reality in the Assessment and Treatment of Weight-Related Disorders.
