"As the field of neural prosthetics advances Brain Machine Interface BMI design requires the development of virtual prostheses that allow decoding algorithms to be tested for efficacy in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Using an x-ray and MRI-guided skeletal reconstruction and a graphic artists rendering of an anatomically correct macaque upper limb we created a virtual avatar capable of independent movement across 27 degrees-of-freedom DOF. Using a custom software interface we animated the avatars movements in real-time using kinematic data acquired from awake behaving macaque subjects using a 16 camera motion capture system. Using this system we demonstrate real-time closed-loop control of up to 27 DOFs in a virtual prosthetic device. Thus we describe a practical method of testing the efficacy of high-complexity BMI decoding algorithms without the expense of fabricating a physical prosthetic."
