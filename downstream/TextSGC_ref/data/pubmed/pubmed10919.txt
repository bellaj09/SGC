"Finding sensory stimuli that drive neurons optimally is central to understanding information processing in the brain. However optimizing sensory input is difficult due to the predominantly nonlinear nature of sensory processing and high dimensionality of the input. We developed inception loops a closed-loop experimental paradigm combining in vivo recordings from thousands of neurons with in silico nonlinear response modeling. Our end-to-end trained deep-learning-based model predicted thousands of neuronal responses to arbitrary new natural input with high accuracy and was used to synthesize optimal stimuli-most exciting inputs MEIs. For mouse primary visual cortex V1 MEIs exhibited complex spatial features that occurred frequently in natural scenes but deviated strikingly from the common notion that Gabor-like stimuli are optimal for V1. When presented back to the same neurons in vivo MEIs drove responses significantly better than control stimuli. Inception loops represent a widely applicable technique for dissecting the neural mechanisms of sensation." Inception loops discover what excites neurons most using deep predictive models.
