Mandibular and maxillary reconstruction using fibula free transfer is common in many tertiary referral centres. Virtual surgical planning VSP is a relatively recent adjunct that allows surgeons to plan resection and reconstruction prior to theatre. This has been shown to reduce operative times and decrease surgeon stress intraoperatively. VSP requires technicians with the appropriate skill set and required materials software and technology which is accompanied by a cost that may be prohibitive. Usually this is outsourced to an external company. We present a preliminary case series of VSP in maxillofacial reconstruction done using our own staff without external resources. Maxillofacial reconstruction using in-house virtual surgical planning.
