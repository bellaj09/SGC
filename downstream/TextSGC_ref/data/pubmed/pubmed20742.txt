Augmented reality systems can combine virtual images with a real environment to ensure accurate surgery with lower risk. This study aimed to develop a novel registration and tracking technique to establish a navigation system based on augmented reality for maxillofacial surgery. Specifically a virtual image is reconstructed from CT data using 3D software. The real environment is tracked by the augmented reality AR software. The novel registration strategy that we created uses an occlusal splint compounded with a fiducial marker OSM to establish a relationship between the virtual image and the real object. After the fiducial marker is recognized the virtual image is superimposed onto the real environment forming the "integrated image" on semi-transparent glass. Via the registration process the integral image which combines the virtual image with the real scene is successfully presented on the semi-transparent helmet. The position error of this navigation system is 0.96\u2009\u20090.51\u2009mm. This augmented reality system was applied in the clinic and good surgical outcomes were obtained. The augmented reality system that we established for maxillofacial surgery has the advantages of easy manipulation and high accuracy which can improve surgical outcomes. Thus this system exhibits significant potential in clinical applications. A novel augmented reality system for displaying inferior alveolar nerve bundles in maxillofacial surgery.
