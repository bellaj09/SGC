"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs may potentially be of significant practical value to patients in advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and locked-in syndrome for whom conventional augmentative and alternative communication AAC systems which require some measure of consistent voluntary muscle control are not satisfactory options. However BCIs have primarily been used for communication in laboratory research settings. This article discusses 4 critical issues that should be addressed as BCIs are translated out of laboratory settings to become fully functional BCI/AAC systems that may be implemented clinically. These issues include 1 identification of primary secondary and tertiary system features; 2 integrating BCI/AAC systems in the World Health Organizations International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health framework; 3 implementing language-based assessment and intervention; and 4 performance measurement. A clinical demonstration project is presented as an example of research beginning to address these critical issues."
