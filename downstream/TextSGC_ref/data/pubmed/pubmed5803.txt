Diffusion MRI dMRI is sensitive to anisotropic diffusion within bundles of nerve axons and can be used to make objective measurements of brain networks. Many brain disorders are now recognised as being caused by network dysfunction or are secondarily associated with changes in networks. There is therefore great potential in using dMRI measures that reflect network integrity as a future clinical tool to help manage these conditions. Here we used dMRI to identify replicable robust and objective markers that meaningfully reflect cognitive and emotional performance. Using diffusion kurtosis analysis and a battery of cognitive and emotional tests we demonstrated strong relationships between white matter structure across networks of anatomically and functionally specific brain regions with both emotional bias and emotional memory performance in a large healthy cohort. When the connectivity of these regions was examined using diffusion tractography the terminations of the identified tracts overlapped precisely with cortical loci relating to these domains drawn from an independent spatial meta-analysis of available functional neuroimaging literature. The association with emotional bias was then replicated using an independently acquired healthy cohort drawn from the Human Connectome Project. These results demonstrate that even in healthy individuals white matter dMRI structural features underpin important cognitive and emotional functions. Our robust cross-correlation and replication supports the potential of structural brain biomarkers from diffusion kurtosis MRI to characterise early neurological changes and risk in individuals with a reduced threshold for cognitive dysfunction with further testing required to demonstrate clinical utility.
