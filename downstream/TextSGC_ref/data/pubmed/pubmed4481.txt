Using high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI and a suite of old and new staining techniques the beginnings of a multi-scale connectome map of the squid brain is erected. The first of its kind for a cephalopod this includes the confirmation of 281 known connections with the addition of 145 previously undescribed pathways. These and other features suggest a suite of functional attributes including 1 retinotopic organization through the optic lobes and into other brain areas well beyond that previously recognized 2 a level of complexity and sub-division in the basal lobe supporting ideas of convergence with the vertebrate basal ganglia and 3 differential lobe-dependent growth rates that mirror complexity and transitions in ontogeny.
