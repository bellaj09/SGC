Gadolinium-based contrast agents GBCAs have become an integral part in daily clinical decision making in the last 3 decades. However there is a broad consensus that GBCAs should be exclusively used if no contrast-free magnetic resonance imaging MRI technique is available to reduce the amount of applied GBCAs in patients. In the current study we investigate the possibility of predicting contrast enhancement from noncontrast multiparametric brain MRI scans using a deep-learning DL architecture. Can Virtual Contrast Enhancement in Brain MRI Replace Gadolinium?: A Feasibility Study.
