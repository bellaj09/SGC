Peritonitis rates in peritoneal dialysis PD vary considerably not only across countries but also between centers in the same country. Patient education has been shown to significantly reduce infection rates but up till now training lacks standardization with patients being trained using different methods and media e.g. illustrations videos. As a result patients may be insufficiently experienced in performing PD which might be one of the causes for high peritonitis rates. To address these issues we developed a PD training program based on virtual reality VR. Virtual Reality Simulation in Peritoneal Dialysis Training: The Beginning of a New Era.
