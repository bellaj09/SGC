"The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of mental fatigue on the event related potential P300 features maximum pick minimum amplitude latency and period during virtual wheelchair navigation. For this purpose an experimental environment was set up based on customizable environmental parameters luminosity number of obstacles and obstacles velocities. A correlation study between P300 and fatigue ratings was conducted. Finally the best correlated features supplied three classification algorithms which are MLP Multi Layer Perceptron Linear Discriminate Analysis and Support Vector Machine. The results showed that the maximum feature over visual and temporal regions as well as period feature over frontal fronto-central and visual regions were correlated with mental fatigue levels. In the other hand minimum amplitude and latency features didnt show any correlation. Among classification techniques MLP showed the best performance although the differences between classification techniques are minimal. Those findings can help us in order to design suitable mental fatigue based wheelchair control." When mental fatigue maybe characterized by Event Related Potential P300 during virtual wheelchair navigation.
