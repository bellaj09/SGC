In this paper a method is proposed to predict the resting-state outcomes of participants based on their electroencephalogram EEG signals recorded before the successful /unsuccessful response inhibition. The motivation of this study is to enhance the shooter performance for shooting the target when their EEG patterns show that they are ready. This method can be used in brain-computer interface BCI system. In this study multi-channel EEG from twenty participants are collected by the electrodes placed at different scalp locations in resting-state time. The EEG trials are used to predict two possible outcomes: successful or unsuccessful stop. Four classifiers QDC KNNC PARZENDC LDC are used in this study to evaluation the accuracy of our system. Based on the collected time-domain EEG signals the phase locking value PLV from 5-pair electrodes are calculated and then used as the feature input for the classifiers. Our experimental results show that the proposed method prediction accuracy leave-one-out was obtained 95% by QDC classifier. Phase modulation-based response-inhibition outcome prediction in translational scenario of stop-signal task.
