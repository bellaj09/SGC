Objective: Community-based medical education CBME serves as a complement to university medical education and it is practiced in several urban undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums. However there are few reports on CBME learning content in rural Japanese settings. Materials and Methods: This research aimed to clarify learning content through semi-structured interviews and qualitative analysis of second-year residents who studied on a remote rural island located 400 km from the mainland of Okinawa Japan. Analysis was based on Steps for Coding and Theorization SCAT. Results: Fifteen concepts were extracted and four categories were generated: a strong connection among the islanders the necessary abilities for rural physicians islander-centered care and the differences between rural and hospital medicine. In contrast to hospital medicine various kinds of learning occurred in deep relationships with the islanders. Conclusion: Through CBME on a remote island the residents learned not only about medical aspects but also the importance of community health through the social and cultural aspects whole-person medical care in a remote location and the importance of reflection in their self-directed learning. What do medical residents learn on a rural Japanese island?
