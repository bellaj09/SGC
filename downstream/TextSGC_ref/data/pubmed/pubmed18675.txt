Keeping abreast of medical advances is an important ongoing responsibility for medical professionals one that categorises physicians as lifelong students. In the USA continuing medical education CME is the bridge that connects basic research and the practicing physician who must fulfill credit requirements for licensure and board certification. Developments in multimedia technology and the Internet have made online CME courses possible making the process of obtaining CME credits more efficient and convenient for physicians. Although first-generation courses have been criticised for the lack of interactivity new developments in multimedia technologies and broadband connectivity promise a new online learning experience where distant participants can communicate using voice or video channels. In addition future online CME generations may incorporate virtual reality modules that will enable physicians to learn and practice procedural techniques as well as gain knowledge. Continued application of sophisticated technologies and continued content-development promises to add new dimensions to traditional learning and may identify online CME courses as a major medical education paradigm.
