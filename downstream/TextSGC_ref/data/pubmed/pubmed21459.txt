Specific phobia is highly prevalent worldwide. Although the body of intervention studies is expanding there is a lack of reviews that summarise recent progress and discuss the challenges and direction of research in this area. Hence this rapid review seeks to systematically evaluate the available evidence in the last five years in the treatment of specific phobias in adults. Studies published between January 2014 to December 2019 were identified through searches on the electronic databases of Medline and PsychINFO. In total 33 studies were included. Evidence indicates that psychotherapy and in particular cognitive behaviour therapy when implemented independently or as an adjunctive is a superior intervention with large effect sizes. Technology-assisted therapies seem to have a beneficial effect on alleviating fears and are described to be more tolerable than in vivo exposure therapy. Pharmacological agents are investigated solely as adjuncts to exposure therapy but the effects are inconsistent; propranolol and glucocorticoid may be promising. A handful of cognitive-based therapies designed to alter fear arousal and activation pathways of phobias have presented preliminary positive outcomes. Challenges remain with the inherent heterogeneity of specific phobia as a disorder and the accompanying variability in outcome measures and intervention approaches to warrant a clear conclusion on efficacy.
