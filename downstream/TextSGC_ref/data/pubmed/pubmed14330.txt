The abundance of image-level labels and the lack of large scale detailed annotations e.g. bounding boxes segmentation masks promotes the development of weakly supervised learning WSL models. In this work we propose a novel framework for WSL of deep convolutional neural networks dedicated to learn localized features from global image-level annotations. The core of the approach is a new latent structured output model equipped with a pooling function which explicitly models negative evidence e.g. a cow detector should strongly penalize the prediction of the bedroom class. We show that our model can be trained end-to-end for different visual recognition tasks: multi-class and multi-label classification and also structured average precision AP ranking. Extensive experiments highlight the relevance of the proposed method: our model outperforms state-of-the art results on six datasets. We also show that our framework can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep models for large scale image classification on ImageNet. Finally we evaluate our model for weakly supervised tasks: in particular a direct adaptation for weakly supervised segmentation provides a very competitive model.
