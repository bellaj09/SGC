"The online patient question and answering Q&amp;A system attracts an increasing amount of users in China. Patient will post their questions and wait for doctors response. To avoid the lag time involved with the waiting and to reduce the workload on the doctors a better method is to automatically retrieve the semantically equivalent question from the archive. We present a Generative Adversarial Networks GAN based approach to automatically retrieve patient question. We apply supervised deep learning based approaches to determine the similarity between patient questions. Then a GAN framework is used to fine-tune the pre-trained deep learning models. The experiment results show that fine-tuning by GAN can improve the performance." Fine-Tuning Neural Patient Question Retrieval Model with Generative Adversarial Networks.
