Although relationships between networks of different scales have been observed in macroscopic brain studies relationships between structures of different scales in networks of neurons are unknown. To address this we recorded from up to 500 neurons simultaneously from slice cultures of rodent somatosensory cortex. We then measured directed effective networks with transfer entropy previously validated in simulated cortical networks. These effective networks enabled us to evaluate distinctive nonrandom structures of connectivity at 2 different scales. We have 4 main findings. First at the scale of 3-6 neurons clusters we found that high numbers of connections occurred significantly more often than expected by chance. Second the distribution of the number of connections per neuron degree distribution had a long tail indicating that the network contained distinctively high-degree neurons or hubs. Third at the scale of tens to hundreds of neurons we typically found 2-3 significantly large communities. Finally we demonstrated that communities were relatively more robust than clusters against shuffling of connections. We conclude the microconnectome of the cortex has specific organization at different scales as revealed by differences in robustness. We suggest that this information will help us to understand how the microconnectome is robust against damage. Functional Clusters Hubs and Communities in the Cortical Microconnectome.
