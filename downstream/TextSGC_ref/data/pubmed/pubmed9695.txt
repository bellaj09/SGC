This research focuses on the adaptive navigation of maritime autonomous surface ships MASSs in an uncertain environment. To achieve intelligent obstacle avoidance of MASSs in a port an autonomous navigation decision-making model based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The model is mainly composed of two layers: the scene division layer and an autonomous navigation decision-making layer. The scene division layer mainly quantifies the sub-scenarios according to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea COLREG. This research divides the navigational situation of a ship into entities and attributes based on the ontology model and Protg language. In the decision-making layer we designed a deep Q-learning algorithm utilizing the environmental model ship motion space reward function and search strategy to learn the environmental state in a quantized sub-scenario to train the navigation strategy. Finally two sets of verification experiments of the deep reinforcement learning DRL and improved DRL algorithms were designed with Rizhao port as a study case. Moreover the experimental data were analyzed in terms of the convergence trend iterative path and collision avoidance effect. The results indicate that the improved DRL algorithm could effectively improve the navigation safety and collision avoidance.
