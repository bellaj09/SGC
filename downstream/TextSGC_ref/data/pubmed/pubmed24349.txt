The societies of thoracic surgery are working to incorporate simulation and competency-based assessment into specialty training. One challenge is the development of a simulation-based test which can be used as an assessment tool. The study objective was to establish validity evidence for a virtual reality simulator test of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS lobectomy of a right upper lobe. Using virtual reality simulation to assess competence in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS lobectomy.
