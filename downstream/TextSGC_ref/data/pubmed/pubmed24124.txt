"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have the potential to restore communication for people with tetraplegia and anarthria by translating neural activity into control signals for assistive communication devices. While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept Serruya et al. 2002; Simeral et al. 2011; Bacher et al. 2015; Nuyujukian et al. 2015; Aflalo et al. 2015; Gilja et al. 2015; Jarosiewicz et al. 2015; Wolpaw et al. 1998; Hwang et al. 2012; Spler et al. 2012; Leuthardt et al. 2004; Taylor et al. 2002; Schalk et al. 2008; Moran 2010; Brunner et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2013; Townsend and Platsko 2016; Vansteensel et al. 2016; Nuyujukian et al. 2016; Carmena et al. 2003; Musallam et al. 2004; Santhanam et al. 2006; Hochberg et al. 2006; Ganguly et al. 2011; ODoherty et al. 2011; Gilja et al. 2012 the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI iBCI for communication which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies Gilja et al. 2015; Kao et al. 2016; Gilja et al. 2012. For all three participants performance exceeded previous iBCIs Bacher et al. 2015; Jarosiewicz et al. 2015 as measured by typing rate by a factor of 1.4-4.2 and information throughput by a factor of 2.2-4.0. This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function.Clinical Trial No: NCT00912041." High performance communication by people with paralysis using an intracortical brain-computer interface.
