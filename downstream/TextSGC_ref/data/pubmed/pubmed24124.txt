"This research aims to evaluate new methods for robot motion control and camera orientation control through the operators head orientation in robot teleoperation tasks. Specifically the use of head-tracking in a non-invasive way without immersive virtual reality devices was combined and compared with classical control modes for robot movements and camera control. Three control conditions were tested: 1 a condition with classical joystick control of both the movements of the robot and the robot camera 2 a condition where the robot movements were controlled by a joystick and the robot camera was controlled by the user head orientation and 3 a condition where the movements of the robot were controlled by hand gestures and the robot camera was controlled by the user head orientation. Performance workload metrics and their evolution as the participants gained experience with the system were evaluated in a series of experiments: for each participant the metrics were recorded during four successive similar trials. Results shows that the concept of robot camera control by user head orientation has the potential of improving the intuitiveness of robot teleoperation interfaces specifically for novice users. However more development is needed to reach a margin of progression comparable to a classical joystick interface."
