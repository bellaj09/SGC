"Stroke remains one of the major causes of disability worldwide. This case report illustrates the complementary use of biomechanical and kinematic in-game markers in addition to standard clinical outcomes to comprehensively assess and track a patients disabilities. A 65-year-old patient was admitted for right-sided weakness and clinically diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke. She participated in a short trial of standard stroke occupational therapy and physiotherapy with additional daily virtual reality VR-based therapy. Outcomes were tracked using kinematic data and conventional clinical assessments. Her Functional Independence Measure score improved from 87 to 113 and Fugl-Meyer motor score improved from 56 to 62 denoting clinically significant improvement. Corresponding kinematic analysis revealed improved hand path ratios and a decrease in velocity peaks. Further research is being undertaken to elucidate the optimal type timing setting and duration of VR-based therapy as well as the use of neuropharmacological adjuncts."
