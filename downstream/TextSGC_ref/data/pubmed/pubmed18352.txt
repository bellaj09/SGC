Prominent theories highlight the importance of bodily perception for self-consciousness but it is currently not known whether bodily perception is based on interoceptive or exteroceptive signals or on integrated signals from these anatomically distinct systems. In the research reported here we combined both types of signals by surreptitiously providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat: A real-time video image of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlined participants\ projected "virtual" bodies and flashed in synchrony with their heartbeats. We investigated whether these "cardio-visual" signals could modulate bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception. We report two main findings. First synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with and self-location toward the virtual body and second they altered the perception of tactile stimuli applied to participants\ backs so that touch was mislocalized toward the virtual body. We argue that the integration of signals from the inside and the outside of the human body is a fundamental neurobiological process underlying self-consciousness. Turning body and self inside out: visualized heartbeats alter bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception.
