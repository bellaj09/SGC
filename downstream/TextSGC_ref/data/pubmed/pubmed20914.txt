The use of digital three-dimensional 3D models to aid learning and teaching in anatomy education has become common place over the last decade. More recently virtual reality VR has been explored by a number of universities as a means of further engaging students with virtual models. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a pilot VR anatomy resource at the University of Dundee. Students were exposed to a collection of 3D anatomical models in VR to evaluate the potential usefulness and adoption of this technology for anatomy education. Using virtual reality to complement and enhance anatomy education.
