"We present UBO Detector a cluster-based fully automated pipeline for extracting and calculating variables for regions of white matter hyperintensities WMH available for download at https://cheba.unsw.edu.au/group/neuroimaging-pipeline. It takes T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR scans as input and SPM12 and FSL functions are utilised for pre-processing. The candidate clusters are then generated by FMRIBs Automated Segmentation Tool FAST. A supervised machine learning algorithm k-nearest neighbor k-NN is applied to determine whether the candidate clusters are WMH or non-WMH. UBO Detector generates both image and text volumes and the number of WMH clusters outputs for whole brain periventricular deep and lobar WMH as well as WMH in arterial territories. The computation time for each brain is approximately 15\u202fmin. We validated the performance of UBO Detector by showing a high segmentation similarity index SI\u202f=\u202f0.848 and volumetric intraclass correlation coefficient ICC\u202f=\u202f0.985 agreement between the UBO Detector-derived and manually traced WMH; b highly correlated r2\u202f>\u202f0.9 and a steady increase of WMH volumes over time; and c significant associations of periventricular t\u202f=\u202f22.591 p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and deep t\u202f=\u202f14.523 p\u202f<\u202f0.001 WMH volumes generated by UBO Detector with Fazekas rating scores. With parallel computing enabled in UBO Detector the processing can take advantage of multi-core CPUs that are commonly available on workstations. In conclusion UBO Detector is a reliable efficient and fully automated WMH segmentation pipeline." UBO Detector - A cluster-based fully automated pipeline for extracting white matter hyperintensities.
