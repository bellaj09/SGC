In minimally invasive surgery MIS virtual reality VR training systems have become a promising education tool. However the adoption of these systems in research and clinical settings is still limited by the high costs of dedicated haptics hardware for MIS. In this paper we present ongoing research towards an open-source low-cost haptic interface for MIS simulation. We demonstrate the basic mechanical design of the device the sensor setup as well as its software integration. Towards open-source low-cost haptics for surgery simulation.
