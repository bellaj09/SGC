Background The Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students ASSIST questionnaire assesses whether learners prefer a deep strategic or surface approach to learning. This study aimed to establish the effect of time since qualification gender and work role on ASSIST scores of General Practitioners GPs and GP Specialist Trainees GPSTs. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire with demographic questions and the ASSIST survey was completed by 1005 GPs and GPSTs from across the United Kingdom. Results Of the 544 GPs and 461 GPSTs completing the survey 96.5% preferred a deep and/or strategic approach to learning. There was a significant increase in the preference for a deep approach with time from graduation and significantly less preference for a surface approach. There was no significant change in any of the scores over the GPST years. Men had significantly higher scores for a deep approach than women. Conclusions GPs and GPSTs prefer deep and strategic approaches to a surface approach. While higher levels of GP experience are associated with a higher deep approach score and a lower surface approach score this change is not seen during progression through GP training. Men have higher scores for a deep approach than women. How preferred learning approaches change with time: a survey of GPs and GP Specialist Trainees.
