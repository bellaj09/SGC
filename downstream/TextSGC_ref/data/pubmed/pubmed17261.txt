Realistic models in virtual reality training applications are considered to positively influence presence and performance. The experimental study presented analyzed the effect of simulation fidelity static vs. animated audience on presence as a prerequisite for performance in a prototype virtual fear of public speaking application with a sample of N = 40 academic non-phobic users. Contrary to the state of research no influence was shown on virtual presence and perceived realism but an animated audience led to significantly higher effects in anxiety during giving a talk. Although these findings could be explained by an application that might not have been realistic enough they still question the role of presence as a mediating factor in virtual exposure applications.
