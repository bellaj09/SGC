Virtual reality VR bronchoscopy simulators have been available for more than a decade and have been recognized as an important aid in bronchoscopy training. The existing literature has only examined the role of VR simulators in diagnostic bronchoscopy. The aim of this study was to find out whether the simulations of both diagnostic bronchoscopies and more advanced procedures were realistic and whether clinical experience in bronchoscopy was associated with better and faster performance of basic pulmonary procedures in the simulator. Virtual reality simulation of basic pulmonary procedures.
