The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study we developed an eigen clustering EIC approach for the parcellation using precuneus-cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation.
