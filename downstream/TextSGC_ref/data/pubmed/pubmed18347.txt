Burns patients often suffer severe pain during interventions such as dressing changes even with analgesia. Virtual Reality VR can be used to distract patients and reduce pain. However more evidence is needed from the patients and staff using the technology about its use in clinical practice and the impact of different VR strategies. This small-scale qualitative study explored patient and staff perceptions of the impact and usability of active and passive VR during painful dressing changes. Five patients took part in three observed dressing changes-one with an active VR scenario developed for the study one with passive VR and one with no VR-following which they were interviewed about their experiences. Three nurses who performed the dressing changes participated in a focus group. Thematic analysis of the resulting data generated four themes: "Caution replaced by contentment" "Distraction and implications for pain and wound care" "Anxiety control and enjoyment" and "Preparation and communication concerns." Results suggested that user-informed active VR was acceptable to burn patients helped manage their perceived pain and was both usable and desirable within the clinical environment. Further testing with larger samples is now required. Reducing Pain During Wound Dressings in Burn Care Using Virtual Reality: A Study of Perceived Impact and Usability With Patients and Nurses.
