High-G MEMS accelerometers have been widely used in monitoring natural disasters and other fields. In order to improve the performance of High-G MEMS accelerometers a denoising method based on the combination of empirical mode decomposition EMD and wavelet threshold is proposed. Firstly EMD decomposition is performed on the output of the main accelerometer to obtain the intrinsic mode function IMF. Then the continuous mean square error rule is used to find energy cut-off point and then the corresponding high frequency IMF component is denoised by wavelet threshold. Finally the processed high-frequency IMF component is superposed with the low-frequency IMF component and the reconstructed signal is denoised signal. Experimental results show that this method integrates the advantages of EMD and wavelet threshold and can retain useful signals to the maximum extent. The impact peak and vibration characteristics are 0.003% and 0.135% of the original signal respectively and it reduces the noise of the original signal by 96%.
