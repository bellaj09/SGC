Deep brain stimulation DBS is a promising tool for treating drug-resistant epileptic patients. Currently the most common approach is fixed-frequency stimulation periodic pacing by means of stimulating devices that operate under open-loop control. However a drawback of this DBS strategy is the impossibility of tailoring a personalized treatment which also limits the optimization of the stimulating apparatus. Here we propose a novel DBS methodology based on a closed-loop control strategy developed by exploiting statistical machine learning techniques in which stimulation parameters are adapted to the current neural activity thus allowing for seizure suppression that is fine-tuned on the individual scale adaptive stimulation. By means of field potential recording from adult rat hippocampus-entorhinal cortex EC slices treated with the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine we determined the effectiveness of this approach compared to low-frequency periodic pacing and found that the closed-loop stimulation strategy: i has similar efficacy as low-frequency periodic pacing in suppressing ictal-like events but ii is more efficient than periodic pacing in that it requires less electrical pulses. We also provide evidence that the closed-loop stimulation strategy can alternatively be employed to tune the frequency of a periodic pacing strategy. Our findings indicate that the adaptive stimulation strategy may represent a novel promising approach to DBS for individually-tailored epilepsy treatment.
