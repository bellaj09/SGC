"The development of technological applications that allow people to control and embody external devices within social interaction settings represents a major goal for current and future brain-computer interface BCI systems. Prior research has suggested that embodied systems may ameliorate BCI end-users experience and accuracy in controlling external devices. Along these lines we developed an immersive P300-based BCI application with a head-mounted display for virtual-local and robotic-remote social interactions and explored in a group of healthy participants the role of proprioceptive feedback in the control of a virtual surrogate Study 1. Moreover we compared the performance of a small group of people with spinal cord injury SCI to a control group of healthy subjects during virtual and robotic social interactions Study 2 where both groups received a proprioceptive stimulation. Our attempt to combine immersive environments BCI technologies and neuroscience of body ownership suggests that providing realistic multisensory feedback still represents a challenge. Results have shown that healthy and people living with SCI used the BCI within the immersive scenarios with good levels of performance as indexed by task accuracy optimizations calls and Information Transfer Rate and perceived control of the surrogates. Proprioceptive feedback did not contribute to alter performance measures and body ownership sensations. Further studies are necessary to test whether sensorimotor experience represents an opportunity to improve the use of future embodied BCI applications."
