"This study was aimed at exploring links between adolescents deep and surface approaches to learning Fear of Missing Out FoMO and Problematic Internet Use PIU by using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling PLS-SEM. The analysis corroborated the postulated positive links between surface learning FoMO and PIU. Moreover the FoMO construct represented a complimentary mediation between the surface learning approach and PIU constructs. This study may lead to a plausible inference according to which both FoMO and surface learning share a common core characteristic of decreased levels of self-regulation that might lead to PIU. Having students acquire and practice skills of self-regulation might help them control their levels of FoMO and consequently their PIU at schools or out-of-school learning environments."
