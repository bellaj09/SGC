Correcting atmospheric turbulence effects in light with Adaptive Optics is necessary since it produces aberrations in the wavefront of astronomical objects observed with telescopes from Earth. These corrections are performed classically with reconstruction algorithms; between them neural networks showed good results. In the context of solar observation the usage of Adaptive Optics on solar differs from nocturnal operations bringing up a challenge to correct the image aberrations. In this work a convolutional approach is given to address this issue considering SCAO configurations. A reconstruction algorithm is presented "Shack-Hartmann reconstruction with deep learning on solar-prototype" proto-HELIOS to correct on fixed solar images achieving an average 85.39% of precision in the reconstruction. Additionally results encourage to continue working with these techniques to achieve a reconstruction technique for all the regions of the sun.
