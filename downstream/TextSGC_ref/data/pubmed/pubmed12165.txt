Atrial fibrillation AF is a type of arrhythmia with high incidence. Automatic AF detection methods have been studied in previous works. However a model cannot be used all the time without any improvement. And updating model requires adequate data and cost. Therefore this study aims at finding a low-cost way to choose learning samples and developing an incremental learning system for AF detection. An incremental learning system for atrial fibrillation detection based on transfer learning and active learning.
