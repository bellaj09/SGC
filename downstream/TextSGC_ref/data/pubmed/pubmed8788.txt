Discovery of transcription factor binding sites TFBSs is essential for understanding the underlying binding mechanisms and cellular functions. Recently Convolutional neural network CNN has succeeded in predicting TFBSs from the primary DNA sequences. In addition to DNA sequences several evidences suggest that protein-DNA binding is partly mediated by properties of DNA shape. Although many methods have been proposed to jointly account for DNA sequences and shape properties in predicting TFBSs they ignore the power of the combination of deep learning and DNA sequence + shape. Therefore we develop a deep-learning-based sequence + shape framework DLBSS in this paper which appropriately integrates DNA sequences and shape properties to better understand protein-DNA binding preference. This method uses a shared CNN to find their common patterns from DNA sequences and their corresponding shape features which are then concatenated to compute a predicted value. Using 66 in-vitro datasets derived from universal protein binding microarrays uPBMs we show that our proposed method DLBSS significantly improves the performance of predicting TFBSs. In addition we explore the performance of the proposed method when using a deep CNN and figure out which shape features are important for predicting TFBSs through a series of experiments.
