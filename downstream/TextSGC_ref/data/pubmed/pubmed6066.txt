Emerging evidence indicates that a disruption in brain network organization may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The neuroimaging fingerprint reflecting the pathophysiology of first-episode schizophrenia remains to be identified. Here we aimed at characterizing the connectome organization of first-episode medication-nave patients with schizophrenia. A cross-sectional structural and functional neuroimaging study using two independent samples principal dataset including 42 medication-nave previously untreated patients and 48 healthy controls; replication dataset including 39 first-episode patients 10 untreated patients and 66 healthy controls was performed. Brain network architecture was assessed by means of white matter fiber integrity measures derived from diffusion-weighted imaging DWI and by means of structural-functional SC-FC coupling measured by combining DWI and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Connectome rich club organization was found to be significantly disrupted in medication-nave patients as compared with healthy controls P = .012 uncorrected with rich club connection strength P = .032 uncorrected and SC-FC coupling P < .001 corrected for false discovery rate decreased in patients. Similar results were found in the replication dataset. Our findings suggest that a disruption of rich club organization and functional dynamics may reflect an early feature of schizophrenia pathophysiology. These findings add to our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms of schizophrenia and provide new insights into the early stages of the disorder.
