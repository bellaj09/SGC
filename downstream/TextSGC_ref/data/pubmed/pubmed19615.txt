This study investigated whether the use of a simulator for endoscopic surgery training improves the performance of actual operations. For the study 16 medical students were divided into three groups: a virtual reality VR simulator group n = 6 a training box TB group n = 6 and a control group n = 4. The VR and TB groups received 2 h of training per day for 5 days after which they were requested to perform intestinal dissection to close a gastric perforation and to perform cholecystectomy in pigs. Performance was assessed on the basis of the operating time and the error score. Although there were no differences between the three groups in terms of the total operating time or error score the VR and TB groups required less time for closure of the gastric perforation than the control group. In addition the operating time decreased as actual operating experience increased in the VR group. In the TB group the time for closure of a gastric perforation was shorter when the supervisor had seen the operation before training. These findings demonstrated that a simulator is useful for acquiring psychomotor skills but does not immediately enable clinical performance of an operation. More actual experience and good supervision are essential for increasing the effectiveness of training with the VR and TB simulators respectively. Usefulness of a virtual reality simulator or training box for endoscopic surgery training.
