Advances in mobile device technology combined with the implementation of surgical simulation have led to the development of novel applications apps as a potential learning tool for surgical trainees. Touch Surgery TS Kinosis Limited London United Kingdom is a mobile-based app that combines cognitive task analysis with a virtual reality medium to familiarize the user with a surgical procedure through interactive rehearsal. The purpose of this study was to compare the educational efficacy of the TS app with a traditional paper-based learning program in performing a robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Twelve participants four interns four residents four adult reconstructive fellows were randomized to a paper-based technique guide or learning modules from the Mako Partial Knee Stryker Mahwah NJ TS app. Trainees were subjected to a baseline pretest. After preparing with the allocated training tool participants completed an immediate posttest followed by a retention test administered 3 weeks later. The TS simulation group demonstrated greater improvement 22% score increase; p\u2009=\u20090.001 in posttest assessment compared with the control group 10% score increase; p\u2009=\u20090. 09. The TS simulation group demonstrated better information recall compared with the control group based on the score differential following the 3-week retention test. This randomized comparative study demonstrated that the TS app was better than traditional paper-based learning for both immediate posttest performance and long-term information recall of the Mako robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Surgical simulation apps may be an effective learning tool for surgical trainees.
