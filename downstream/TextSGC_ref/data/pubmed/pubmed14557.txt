"Spectral computed tomography CT using photon counting detectors PCDs can provide accurate tissue composition measurements by utilizing the energy dependence of x-ray attenuation in different materials. PCDs are especially suited for K-edge imaging revealing the spatial distribution of select imaging probes through quantitative material decomposition. We report on a prototype spectral micro-CT system with a CZT-based PCD DxRay Inc. that has 16  16 \u2009\u2009 pixels of 0.5  0.5 \u2009\u2009 mm 2    a thickness of 3\xa0mm and four energy thresholds. Due to the PCDs limited size  8  8 \u2009\u2009 mm 2    our system uses a translate-rotate projection acquisition strategy to cover a field of view relevant for preclinical imaging   4.5 \u2009\u2009 cm . Projection corrections were implemented to minimize artifacts associated with dead pixels and projection stitching. A sophisticated iterative algorithm was used to reconstruct both phantom and ex vivo mouse data. To achieve preclinically relevant spatial resolution we trained a convolutional neural network to perform pan-sharpening between low-resolution PCD data  247 -  m voxels and high-resolution energy-integrating detector data  82 -  m voxels recovering a high-resolution estimate of the spectral contrast suitable for material decomposition. Long-term preclinical spectral CT systems such as ours could serve in the developing field of theranostics therapy and diagnostics for cancer research."
