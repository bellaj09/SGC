Gliomas are the most common primary tumor of the brain and are classified into grades I-IV of the World Health Organization WHO based on their invasively histological appearance. Gliomas grading plays an important role to determine the treatment plan and prognosis prediction. In this study we propose two novel methods for automatic non-invasively distinguishing low-grade Grades II and III glioma LGG and high-grade grade IV glioma HGG on conventional MRI images by using deep convolutional neural networks CNNs.
