We demonstrate for the first time an electrically-tunable and physically-planar freeform optical element made up of nematic liquid crystals LCs. Continued on numerical study in previous paper Part I experimental results here show that it is possible to break the rotational symmetry of the wavefront through the use of uneven tilt angles of the LC molecules even though the electric potential is rotationally symmetric. Our optical element offers the ability to electrically tune the direction of the optical axis the wavefront deviation as well as the Zernike polynomials for general descriptions of wavefronts. Corresponding Zernike coefficients of a Zernike polynomial that are related to defocus and spherical aberration which can be adjusted individually or together. The minimum wavefront deviation is >/6. The Zernike coefficients related to coma aberration or the tilt of the optical axis are also electrically tunable. By incorporating our LC phase modulator with tunability of freeform wavefronts into a simple reflective optical system we demonstrate convincing image performance for off-axis image aberration correction. This approach will inspire further development and design of LC optical elements for applications such as hyperspectral imagers in aerospace optics augmented reality virtual reality quantum information systems innovative miniaturized reflective telescopic systems for astrophysics planetary science and earth science.
