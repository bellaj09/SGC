Phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer -OTDR based distributed optical fiber sensing system has been widely used in many fields such as long range pipeline pre-warning perimeter security and structure health monitoring. However the lack of event recognition ability is always being the bottleneck of -OTDR in field application. An event recognition method based on deep learning is proposed in this paper. This method directly uses the temporal-spatial data matrix from -OTDR as the input of a convolutional neural network CNN. Only a simple bandpass filtering and a gray scale transformation are needed as the pre-processing which achieves real-time. Besides an optimized network structure with small size high training speed and high classification accuracy is built. Experiment results based on 5644 events samples show that this network can achieve 96.67% classification accuracy in recognition of 5 kinds of events and the retraining time is only 7 min for a new sensing setup.
