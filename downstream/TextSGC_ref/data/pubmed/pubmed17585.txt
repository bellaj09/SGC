Knowledge of the anatomical organization of the auditory thalamocortical TC system is fundamental for the understanding of auditory information processing in the brain. In the Mongolian gerbil Meriones unguiculatus a valuable model species in auditory research the detailed anatomy of this system has not yet been worked out in detail. Here we investigated the projections from the three subnuclei of the medial geniculate body MGB namely its ventral MGv dorsal MGd and medial MGm divisions as well as from several of their subdivisions MGv: pars lateralis LV pars ovoidea OV rostral pole RP; MGd: deep dorsal nucleus DD to the auditory cortex AC by stereotaxic pressure injections and electrophysiologically guided iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tract tracer biocytin. Our data reveal highly specific features of the TC connections regarding their nuclear origin in the subdivisions of the MGB and their termination patterns in the auditory cortical fields and layers. In addition to tonotopically organized projections primarily of the LV OV and DD to the AC a large number of axons diverge across the tonotopic gradient. These originate mainly from the RP MGd proper and MGm. In particular neurons of the MGm project in a columnar fashion to several auditory fields forming small- and medium-sized boutons and also hitherto unknown giant terminals. The distinctive layer-specific distribution of axonal endings within the AC indicates that each of the TC connectivity systems has a specific function in auditory cortical processing.
