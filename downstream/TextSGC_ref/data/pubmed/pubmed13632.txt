Object detection in very high-resolution VHR aerial images is an essential step for a wide range of applications such as military applications urban planning and environmental management. Still it is a challenging task due to the different scales and appearances of the objects. On the other hand object detection task in VHR aerial images has improved remarkably in recent years due to the achieved advances in convolution neural networks CNN. Most of the proposed methods depend on a two-stage approach namely: a region proposal stage and a classification stage such as Faster R-CNN. Even though two-stage approaches outperform the traditional methods their optimization is not easy and they are not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper a uniform one-stage model for object detection in VHR aerial images has been proposed. In order to tackle the challenge of different scales a densely connected feature pyramid network has been proposed by which high-level multi-scale semantic feature maps with high-quality information are prepared for object detection. This work has been evaluated on two publicly available datasets and outperformed the current state-of-the-art results on both in terms of mean average precision mAP and computation time.
