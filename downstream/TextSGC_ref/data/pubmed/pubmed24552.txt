Techniques for modeling an object through observation are very important in object recognition and virtual reality. A wide variety of techniques have been developed for modeling objects with opaque surfaces whereas less attention has been paid to objects with transparent surfaces. A transparent surface has only surface reflection; it has little body reflection. We present a new method for obtaining surface orientations of transparent surfaces through analysis of the degree of polarization in surface reflection and emission in visible and far-infrared wavelengths respectively. This parameter the polarization degree of reflected light at the visible wavelengths is used for determining the surface orientation at a surface point. The polarization degree at visible wavelengths provides two possible solutions and the proposed method uses the polarization degree at far-infrared wavelengths to resolve this ambiguity. Determining surface orientations of transparent objects based on polarization degrees in visible and infrared wavelengths.
