Artificial intelligence AI enables machines to provide unparalleled value in a myriad of industries and applications. In recent years researchers have harnessed artificial intelligence to analyze large-volume unstructured medical data and perform clinical tasks such as the identification of diabetic retinopathy or the diagnosis of cutaneous malignancies. Applications of artificial intelligence techniques specifically machine learning and more recently deep learning are beginning to emerge in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The most promising of these efforts have been in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal polyps with recent systems demonstrating high sensitivity and accuracy even when compared to expert human endoscopists. AI has also been utilized to identify gastrointestinal bleeding to detect areas of inflammation and even to diagnose certain gastrointestinal infections. Future work in the field should concentrate on creating seamless integration of AI systems with current endoscopy platforms and electronic medical records developing training modules to teach clinicians how to use AI tools and determining the best means for regulation and approval of new AI technology. Artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal endoscopy: The future is almost here.
