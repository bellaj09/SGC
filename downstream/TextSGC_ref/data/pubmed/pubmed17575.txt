The paper discusses the use of immersive virtual reality systems for the cognitive rehabilitation of dysexecutive syndrome usually caused by prefrontal brain injuries. With respect to classical P&P and flat-screen computer rehabilitative tools IVR systems might prove capable of evoking a more intense and compelling sense of presence thanks to the highly naturalistic subject-environment interaction allowed. Within a constructivist framework applied to holistic rehabilitation we suggest that this difference might enhance the ecological validity of cognitive training partly overcoming the implicit limits of a lab setting which seem to affect non-immersive procedures especially when applied to dysexecutive symptoms. We tested presence in a pilot study applied to a new VR-based rehabilitation tool for executive functions V-Store; it allows patients to explore a virtual environment where they solve six series of tasks ordered for complexity and designed to stimulate executive functions programming categorical abstraction short-term memory and attention. We compared sense of presence experienced by unskilled normal subjects randomly assigned to immersive or non-immersive flat screen sessions of V-Store through four different indexes: self-report questionnaire psychophysiological GSR skin conductance neuropsychological incidental recall memory test related to auditory information coming from the "real" environment and count of breaks in presence BIPs. Preliminary results show in the immersive group a significantly higher GSR response during tasks; neuropsychological data fewer recalled elements from "reality" and less BIPs only show a congruent but yet non-significant advantage for the immersive condition; no differences were evident from the self-report questionnaire. A larger experimental group is currently under examination to evaluate significance of these data which also might prove interesting with respect to the question of objective-subjective measures of presence. Experience with V-STORE: considerations on presence in virtual environments for effective neuropsychological rehabilitation of executive functions.
