The scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction STM-BJ is used widely to create and characterize single metal-molecule-metal junctions. In this technique conductance is continuously recorded as a metal point contact is broken in a solution of molecules. Conductance plateaus are seen when stable molecular junctions are formed. Typically thousands of junctions are created and measured yielding thousands of distinct conductance versus extension traces. However such traces are rarely analyzed individually to recognize the types of junctions formed. Here we present a deep learning-based method to identify molecular junctions and show that it performs better than several commonly used and recently reported techniques. We demonstrate molecular junction identification from mixed solution measurements with accuracies as high as 97%. We also apply this model to an in situ electric field-driven isomerization reaction of a 3cumulene to follow the reaction over time. Furthermore we demonstrate that our model can remain accurate even when a key parameter the average junction conductance is eliminated from the analysis showing that our model goes beyond conventional analysis in existing methods.
