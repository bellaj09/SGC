The advent of computed tomography CT has revolutionized radiology and this revolution is still going on. Starting as a pure head scanner modern CT systems are now able to perform whole-body examinations within a couple of seconds in isotropic resolution single-rotation whole-organ perfusion and temporal resolution to fulfill the needs of cardiac CT. Because of the increasing number of CT examinations in all age groups and overall medical-driven radiation exposure dose reduction remains a hot topic. Although fast gantry rotation broad detector arrays and different dual-energy solutions were main topics in the past years new techniques such as photon counting detectors powerful x-ray tubes for low-kV scanning automated image preprocessing and machine learning algorithms have moved into focus today.The aim of this article is to give an overview of the technical specifications of up-to-date available CT systems and recent hardware and software innovations for CT systems in the near future. Recent and Upcoming Technological Developments in Computed Tomography: High Speed Low Dose Deep Learning Multienergy.
