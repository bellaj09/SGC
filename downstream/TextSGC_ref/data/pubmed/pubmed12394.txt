For many applications in the field of computer-assisted surgery such as providing the position of a tumor specifying the most probable tool required next by the surgeon or determining the remaining duration of surgery methods for surgical workflow analysis are a prerequisite. Often machine learning-based approaches serve as basis for analyzing the surgical workflow. In general machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks CNN require large amounts of labeled data. While data is often available in abundance many tasks in surgical workflow analysis need annotations by domain experts making it difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of annotations. Active learning using deep Bayesian networks for surgical workflow analysis.
