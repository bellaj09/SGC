Research on disease-disease association DDA like comorbidity and complication provides important insights into disease treatment and drug discovery and a large body of the literature has been published in the field. However using current search tools it is not easy for researchers to retrieve information on the latest DDA findings. First comorbidity and complication keywords pull up large numbers of PubMed studies. Second disease is not highlighted in search results. Finally DDA is not identified as currently no disease-disease association extraction DDAE dataset or tools are available.
