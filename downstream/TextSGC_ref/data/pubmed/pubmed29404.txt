Excessive reliance on wheelchairs in individuals with tetraplegia or paraplegia due to spinal cord injury SCI leads to many medical co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease metabolic derangements osteoporosis and pressure ulcers. Treatment of these conditions contributes to the majority of SCI health care costs. Restoring able-body-like ambulation in this patient population can potentially reduce the incidence of these medical co-morbidities in addition to increasing independence and quality of life. However no biomedical solution exists that can reverse this loss of neurological function and hence novel methods are needed. Brain-computer interface BCI controlled lower extremity prostheses may constitute one such novel approach. Brain-computer interface controlled robotic gait orthosis.
