Bone allografts supplied by University Malaya Medical Centre Bone Bank are sterilized by gamma radiation at 25 kGy in dry ice DI to minimize radiation effects. Use of cheaper and easily available cooling materials gel ice GI and ice pack IP was explored. Composites of DI and GI were also studied for the use in routine transportations and radiation process. Performance of cooling materials and their composites in maintaining freezing temperature during irradiation and transportation of bone allografts.
