"Orthographic transparency is increasingly being recognised as an important factor in determining the manifestation of dyslexic tendencies in individuals. Recent evidence has shown that normal English-speaking children have reading deficits in the range associated with same age dyslexic German-speaking children for less frequently used words and English orthography has been identified as a contributing factor. Spencer Reading 1999 332 72-77; Journal of Research in Reading 1999 223 283-292 has proposed a predictive model for English childrens reading and spelling deficits based on orthographic features. Two main factors have been identified: consistency of sound representation and inclusion of redundant letters in English words. Using new data for reading a unified model will be discussed which incorporates measures of depth of orthographic transparency and relates these to recent positron emission tomography PET research. Implications for the relative frequency and severity of dyslexia in both deep and shallow orthographies is considered in the light of such studies."
