Spike timing-dependent plasticity STDP is a form of Hebbian learning which is thought to underlie structure formation during development and learning and memory in later life. In this paper we show that the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic neuron might have a deep influence on STDP dynamics by shaping the causal correlation between the pre- and the postsynaptic spike trains. The cell-specific effect of STDP is particularly evident in the presence of an oscillatory component in a cell input. In this case the cell-specific phase response to an oscillatory modulation biases the oscillating afferents towards potentiation or depression depending upon the intrinsic dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron and the period of the modulation. Spike timing-dependent plasticity is affected by the interplay of intrinsic and network oscillations.
