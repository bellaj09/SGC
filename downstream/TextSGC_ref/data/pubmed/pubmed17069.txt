"We used a trunk-assisted prehension task to examine the effect of task reaching for stationary vs. moving targets and environmental constraints virtual reality VR vs. physical reality on the temporal control of trunk and arm motions in people with Parkinsons disease PD. Twenty-four participants with PD and 24 age-matched controls reached for and grasped a ball that was either stationary or moving along a ramp 120% of arm length away. In a similar VR task participants reached for a virtual ball that was either stationary or moving. Movement speed was measured as trunk and arm movement times MTs; trunk-arm coordination was measured as onset interval and offset interval between trunk and arm motions as well as a summarized index-desynchrony score. In both VR and physical reality the PD group had longer trunk and arm MTs than the control group when reaching for stationary balls p<.001. When reaching for moving balls in VR and physical reality however the PD group had lower trunk and arm MTs onset intervals and desynchrony scores p<.001. For the PD group VR induced shorter trunk MTs shorter offset intervals and lower desynchrony scores than did physical reality when reaching for moving balls p<.001. These findings suggest that using real moving targets in trunk-assisted prehension tasks improves the speed and synchronization of trunk and arm motions in people with PD and that using virtual moving targets may induce a movement termination strategy different from that used in physical reality."
