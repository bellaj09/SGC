Error-related potentials are considered an important neuro-correlate for monitoring human intentionality in decision-making human-human or human-machine interaction scenarios. Multiple methods have been proposed in order to improve the recognition of human intentions. Moreover current brain-computer interfaces are limited in the identification of human errors by manual tuning of parameters e.g. feature/channel selection thus selecting fronto-central channels as discriminative features within-subject. In this paper we propose the inclusion of error-related potential activity as a generalized two-dimensional feature set and a Convolutional Neural Network for classification of EEG-based human error detection. We evaluate this pipeline using the BNCI2020 - Monitoring Error-Related Potential dataset obtaining a maximum error detection accuracy of 79.8% in a within-session 10-fold cross-validation modality and outperforming current state of the art.
