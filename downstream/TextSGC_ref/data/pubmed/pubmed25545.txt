Analyzing neural signals and providing feedback in realtime is one of the core characteristics of a brain-computer interface BCI. As this feature may be employed to induce neural plasticity utilizing BCI technology for therapeutic purposes is increasingly gaining popularity in the BCI community. In this paper we discuss the state-of-the-art of research on this topic address the principles of and challenges in inducing neural plasticity by means of a BCI and delineate the problems of study design and outcome evaluation arising in this context. We conclude with a list of open questions and recommendations for future research in this field. Using brain-computer interfaces to induce neural plasticity and restore function.
