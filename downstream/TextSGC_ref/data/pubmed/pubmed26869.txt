"In most brain computer interface BCI systems some target users have significant difficulty in using BCI systems. Such target users are called BCI-illiterate. This phenomenon has been poorly investigated and a clear understanding of the BCI-illiteracy mechanism or a solution to this problem has not been reported to date. In this study we sought to demonstrate the neurophysiological differences between two groups literate illiterate with a total of 52 subjects. We investigated recordings under non-task related state NTS which is collected during subject is relaxed with eyes open. We found that high theta and low alpha waves were noticeable in the BCI-illiterate relative to the BCI-literate people. Furthermore these high theta and low alpha wave patterns were preserved across different mental states such as NTS resting before motor imagery MI and MI states even though the spatial distribution of both BCI-illiterate and BCI-literate groups did not differ. From these findings an effective strategy for pre-screening subjects for BCI illiteracy has been determined and a performance factor that reflects potential user performance has been proposed using a simple combination of band powers. Our proposed performance factor gave an r = 0.59 r2 = 0.34 in a correlation analysis with BCI performance and yielded as much as r = 0.70 r2 = 0.50 when seven outliers were rejected during the evaluation of whole data N = 61 including BCI competition datasets N = 9. These findings may be directly applicable to online BCI systems." High theta and low alpha powers may be indicative of BCI-illiteracy in motor imagery.
