Convolutional neural networks CNNs are predominantly used for several challenging computer vision tasks achieving state-of-the-art performance. However CNNs are complex models that require the use of powerful hardware both for training and deploying them. To this end a quantization-based pooling method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is inspired from the bag-of-features model and can be used for learning more lightweight deep neural networks. Trainable radial basis function neurons are used to quantize the activations of the final convolutional layer reducing the number of parameters in the network and allowing for natively classifying images of various sizes. The proposed method employs differentiable quantization and aggregation layers leading to an end-to-end trainable CNN architecture. Furthermore a fast linear variant of the proposed method is introduced and discussed providing new insight for understanding convolutional neural architectures. The ability of the proposed method to reduce the size of CNNs and increase the performance over other competitive methods is demonstrated using seven data sets and three different learning tasks classification regression and retrieval.
