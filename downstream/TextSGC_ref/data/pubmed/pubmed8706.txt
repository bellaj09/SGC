"In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of computer-aided triage system which is implemented for the health checkup of lung lesions involving tens of thousands of chest X-rays CXRs that are required for diagnosis. Therefore high accuracy of diagnosis by an automated system can reduce the radiologists workload on scrutinizing the medical images." Automated chest screening based on a hybrid model of transfer learning and convolutional sparse denoising autoencoder.
