Dimensionality reduction and feature selection is an important aspect of electroencephalography based event related potential detection systems such as brain computer interfaces. In our study a predefined sequence of letters was presented to subjects in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation RSVP paradigm. EEG data were collected and analyzed offline. A linear discriminant analysis LDA classifier was designed as the ERP Event Related Potential detector for its simplicity. Different dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods were applied and compared in a greedy wrapper framework. Experimental results showed that PCA with the first 10 principal components for each channel performed best and could be used in both online and offline systems. A comparison of different dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods for single trial ERP detection.
