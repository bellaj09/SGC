Blended learning has the potential to stimulate effective learning and to facilitate high quality education. For postgraduate health professionals blended learning is relatively new. For this group we developed implemented and evaluated two blended learning modules in a master program on quality and safety in patient care. Aiming for a better preparation compared to traditional textbook homework the course provided not only web lectures and reading but also interactive assignments and collaborative learning. Additional goal was saving time for the teachers resulting in a potential cost savings. Blended learning for postgraduates; an interactive experience.
