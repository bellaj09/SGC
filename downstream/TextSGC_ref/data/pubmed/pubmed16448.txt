University students were surveyed to learn what they know about virtual realities. The two studies were administered with a half-year interval in which the students N=90 specializing either in mathematics and science or in social science and humanities were asked to name particular examples of virtual realities. The second but not the first study was administered after the participants had the chance to see the movie "Avatar" no investigation was held into whether they really saw it. While the students in both studies widely believed that activities such as social networking and online gaming represent virtual realities some other examples provided by the students in the two studies differ: in the second study the participants expressed a better understanding of the items related to virtual realities. At the same time not a single participant reported particular psychological states either regular or altered as examples of virtual realities. Profound popularization efforts need to be done to acquaint the public including college students with virtual realities and let the public adequately understand how such systems work.
