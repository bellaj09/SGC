Kawasaki disease KD is an acute childhood disease complicated by coronary artery aneurysms intima thickening thrombi stenosis lamellar calcifications and disappearance of the media border. Automatic classification of the coronary artery layers intima media and scar features is important for analyzing optical coherence tomography OCT images recorded in pediatric patients. OCT has been known as an intracoronary imaging modality using near-infrared light which has recently been used to image the inner coronary artery tissues of pediatric patients providing high spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 20 m. This study aims to develop a robust and fully automated tissue classification method by using the convolutional neural networks CNNs as feature extractor and comparing the predictions of three state-of-the-art classifiers CNN random forest RF and support vector machine SVM. The results show the robustness of CNN as the feature extractor and random forest as the classifier with classification rate up to 96% especially to characterize the second layer of coronary arteries media which is a very thin layer and it is challenging to be recognized and specified from other tissues. Deep feature learning for automatic tissue classification of coronary artery using optical coherence tomography.
