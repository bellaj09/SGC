Information about the interactions between chemical compounds and proteins is indispensable for understanding the regulation of biological processes and the development of therapeutic drugs. Manually extracting such information from biomedical literature is very time and resource consuming. In this study we propose a computational method to automatically extract chemical-protein interactions CPIs from a given text. Our method extracts CPI pairs and CPI triplets from sentences where a CPI pair consists of a chemical compound and a protein name and a CPI triplet consists of a CPI pair along with an interaction word describing their relationship. We extracted a diverse set of features from sentences that were used to build multiple machine learning models. Our models contain both simple features which can be directly computed from sentences and more sophisticated features derived using sentence structure analysis techniques. For example one set of features was extracted based on the shortest paths between the CPI pairs or among the CPI triplets in the dependency graphs obtained from sentence parsing. We designed a three-stage approach to predict the multiple categories of CPIs. Our method performed the best among systems that use non-deep learning methods and outperformed several deep-learning-based systems in the track 5 of the BioCreative VI challenge. The features we designed in this study are informative and can be applied to other machine learning methods including deep learning.
