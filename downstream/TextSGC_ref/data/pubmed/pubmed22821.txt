This quasi-experimental study compared the effect of standard occupational therapy SOT and virtual reality using Wii gaming technology VRWii on children with Down syndrome DS. Children n = 105 were randomly assigned to intervention with either SOT or VRWii while another 50 served as controls. All children were assessed with measures of sensorimotor functions. At post-intervention the treatment groups significantly outperformed the control group on all measures. Participants in the VRWii group had a greater pre-post change on motor proficiency visual-integrative abilities and sensory integrative functioning. Virtual reality using Wii gaming technology demonstrated benefit in improving sensorimotor functions among children with DS. It could be used as adjuvant therapy to other proven successful rehabilitative interventions in treating children with DS.
