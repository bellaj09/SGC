Recent brain connectome studies have evidenced distinct and overlapping brain regions involved in processing olfactory perception. However neural correlates of hypo- or anosmia in olfactory disorder patients are poorly known. Furthermore the bottom-up and top-down processing of olfactory perception have not been well-documented resulting in difficulty in locating the disease foci of olfactory disorder patients. The primary aim of this study is to characterize the bottom-up process of the neural dynamics across peripheral and central brain regions in anesthetized mice. We particularly focused on the neural oscillations of local field potential LFP in olfactory epithelium OE olfactory blub OB prefrontal cortex PFC and hippocampus HC during an olfactory oddball paradigm in urethane anesthetized mice. Odorant presentations evoked neural oscillations across slow and fast frequency bands including delta 1-4 Hz theta 6-10 Hz beta 15-30 Hz low gamma 30-50 Hz and high gamma 70-100 Hz in both peripheral and central nervous systems and the increases were more prominent in the infrequently presented odorant. During 5 s odorant exposures the oscillatory responses in power were persistent in OE OB and PFC whereas neural oscillations of HC increased only for short time at stimulus onset. These oscillatory responses in power were insignificant in both peripheral and central regions of the ZnSO4-treated anosmia model. These results suggest that olfactory stimulation induce LFP oscillations both in the peripheral and central nervous systems and suggest the possibility of linkage of LFP oscillations in the brain to the oscillations in the peripheral olfactory system.
