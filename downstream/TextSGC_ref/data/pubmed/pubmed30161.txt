The cochlear nucleus CN is the target of the auditory brainstem implant ABI. Most ABI candidates have Neurofibromatosis Type 2 NF2 and distorted brainstem anatomy from bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The CN is difficult to characterize as routine structural MRI does not resolve detailed anatomy. We hypothesize that diffusion tensor imaging DTI enables both in vivo localization and quantitative measurements of CN morphology.
