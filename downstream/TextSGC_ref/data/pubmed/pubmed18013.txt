In general minimally invasive surgery is seen as the most difficult surgery because there is limited field of view with an endoscope and force sensation from surgical instruments such as forceps is poor. Especially in early clinical education for medical students a virtual reality surgical simulator would be an effective tool. In this paper we propose a visuohaptic surgery training system for laparoscopical techniques. We recorded a video from a first person point of view of the instructor expert. And we also recorded operation information i.e. trajectory of surgical instruments of the instructor. Then we displayed the recorded video and the guidance force to trainees. We constructed a prototype surgery training system and the effectiveness of our approach was confirmed. Laparoscopic surgery simulator using first person view and guidance force.
