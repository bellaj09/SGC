Purpose: To investigate whether a deep learning-assisted contour DLAC could provide greater accuracy inter-observer consistency and efficiency compared with a manual contour MC of the clinical target volume CTV for non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC receiving postoperative radiotherapy PORT. Materials and Methods: A deep dilated residual network was used to achieve the effective automatic contour of the CTV. Eleven junior physicians contoured CTVs on 19 patients by using both MC and DLAC methods independently. Compared with the ground truth the accuracy of the contour was evaluated by using the Dice coefficient and mean distance to agreement MDTA. The coefficient of variation CV and standard distance deviation SDD were rendered to measure the inter-observer variability or consistency. The time consumed for each of the two contouring methods was also compared. Results: A total of 418 CTV sets were generated. DLAC improved contour accuracy when compared with MC and was associated with a larger Dice coefficient mean  SD: 0.75  0.06 vs. 0.72  0.07 p < 0.001 and smaller MDTA mean  SD: 2.97  0.91 mm vs. 3.07  0.98 mm p < 0.001. The DLAC was also associated with decreased inter-observer variability with a smaller CV mean  SD: 0.129  0.040 vs. 0.183  0.043 p < 0.001 and SDD mean  SD: 0.47  0.22 mm vs. 0.72  0.41 mm p < 0.001. In addition a value of 35% of time saving was provided by the DLAC median: 14.81 min vs. 9.59 min p < 0.001. Conclusions: Compared with MC the DLAC is a promising strategy to obtain superior accuracy consistency and efficiency for the PORT-CTV in NSCLC.
