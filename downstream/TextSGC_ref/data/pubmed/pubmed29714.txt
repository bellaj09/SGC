This work presents an implementation of Error-related Potential ErrP detection to produce progressive adaptation of a motor imagery task classifier. The main contribution is in the evaluation of the effect of vibrotactile feedback on both ErrP and motor imagery detection. Results confirm the potential of self-adaptive techniques to improve motor imagery classification and support the design of vibratory and in general tactile feedback into Brain-Computer Interfaces to improve both static and adaptive performance. The Effect of Vibrotactile Feedback on ErrP-based Adaptive Classification of Motor Imagery.
