By combining behavioural analyses with intrinsic signal optical imaging we analysed visual performance and visual cortical activity in the albino mouse strain BALB/c which is increasingly being used as an animal model of neuropsychological disorders. Visual acuity as measured by a virtual-reality optomotor system was 0.12 cycles per degree cyc/deg in BALB/c mice and 0.39 cyc/deg in pigmented C57BL/6 mice. Surprisingly BALB/c mice showed reflexive head movements against the direction of the rotating stimulus. Contrast sensitivity was significantly lower in BALB/c mice 45% contrast at 0.064 cyc/deg than in C57BL/6 mice 6% contrast. In the visual water task visual acuity was 0.3 cyc/deg in BALB/c mice and 0.59 cyc/deg in C57BL/6 mice. Thus the visual performance of BALB/c mice was significantly impaired in both behavioural tests - visual acuity was  0.3 cyc/deg lower than in C57BL/6 mice and contrast sensitivity was reduced by a factor of  8. In BALB/c mice visual cortical maps induced by stimulation of the contralateral eye were normal in both activation strength and retinotopic map quality. In contrast maps induced by ipsilateral eye stimulation differed significantly between the strains - activity in a region representing 15 to 19 elevation in the visual field was significantly weaker in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. Taken together our observations show that BALB/c mice like the albino animals of other species have a significantly lower visual performance than C57BL/6 mice and a modified cortical representation of the ipsilateral eye that may impair stereopsis. Thus our results caution against disregarding vision as a confounding factor in behavioural tests of neuropsychological disorders. Visual capabilities and cortical maps in BALB/c mice.
