"A large amount of digital image material is routinely captured during esophagogastroduodenoscopies but for the most part is not used for confirming the diagnosis process of celiac disease which is primarily based on histological examination of biopsies. Recently considerable effort has been undertaken to make use of image material by developing semi- or fully-automated systems to improve the diagnostic workup. Recently focus was especially laid on developing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures exploiting the endoscopists expert knowledge and on making systems fully automated and thereby completely observer independent. In this work we summarize recent trends in the field of computer-aided celiac disease diagnosis based on upper endoscopy and discuss about recent progress remaining challenges limitations currently prohibiting a deployment in clinical practice and future efforts to tackle them." Automated classification of celiac disease during upper endoscopy: Status quo and quo vadis.
