Conventional video-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy MIE is safe and associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality but the two-dimensional monitor reduces eye-hand harmony and viewing yield. Robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy RAMIE with its virtual reality simulators offers a realistic three-dimensional environment that facilitates dissection in the narrow working space but it is expensive and requires longer operative time. Therefore the aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and feasibility of RAMIE versus MIE in patients with esophageal cancer.
