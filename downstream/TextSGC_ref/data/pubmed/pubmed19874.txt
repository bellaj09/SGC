"Key factors positively influencing rehabilitation and functional recovery after spinal cord injury SCI include training variety intensive movement repetition and motivating training tasks. Systems supporting these aspects may provide profound gains in rehabilitation independent of the subjects treatment location. In the present study we test the hypotheses that virtual reality VR-augmented training at home i.e. unsupervised is feasible with subjects with an incomplete SCI iSCI and that it improves motor functions such as lower limb muscle strength balance and functional mobility. In the study 12 chronic iSCI subjects used a home-based mobile version of a lower limb VR training system. The system included motivating training scenarios and combined action observation and execution. Virtual representations of the legs and feet were controlled via movement sensors. The subjects performed home-based training over 4\u2009weeks with 16-20 sessions of 30-45\u2009min each. The outcome measures assessed were the Lower Extremity Motor Score LEMS Berg Balance Scale BBS Timed Up and Go TUG Spinal Cord Independence Measure mobility Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II and 10\u2009m and 6\u2009min walking tests. Two pre-treatment assessment time points were chosen for outcome stability: 4\u2009weeks before treatment and immediately before treatment. At post-assessment i.e. immediately after treatment high motivation and positive changes were reported by the subjects adapted Patients Global Impression of Change. Significant improvements were shown in lower limb muscle strength LEMS P\u2009=\u20090.008 balance BBS P\u2009=\u20090.008 and functional mobility TUG P\u2009=\u20090.007. At follow-up assessment i.e. 2-3\u2009months after treatment functional mobility TUG remained significantly improved P\u2009=\u20090.005 in contrast to the other outcome measures. In summary unsupervised exercises at home with the VR training system led to beneficial functional training effects in subjects with chronic iSCI suggesting that it may be useful as a neurorehabilitation tool."
