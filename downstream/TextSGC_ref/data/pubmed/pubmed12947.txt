Traumatic brain injury TBI is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Detailed studies of the microglial response after TBI require high throughput quantification of changes in microglial count and morphology in histological sections throughout the brain. In this paper we present a fully automated end-to-end system that is capable of assessing microglial activation in white matter regions on whole slide images of Iba1 stained sections. Our approach involves the division of the full brain slides into smaller image patches that are subsequently automatically classified into white and grey matter sections. On the patches classified as white matter we jointly apply functional minimization methods and deep learning classification to identify Iba1-immunopositive microglia. Detected cells are then automatically traced to preserve their complex branching structure after which fractal analysis is applied to determine the activation states of the cells. The resulting system detects white matter regions with 84% accuracy detects microglia with a performance level of 0.70 F1 score the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity and performs binary microglia morphology classification with a 70% accuracy. This automated pipeline performs these analyses at a 20-fold increase in speed when compared to a human pathologist. Moreover we have demonstrated robustness to variations in stain intensity common for Iba1 immunostaining. A preliminary analysis was conducted that indicated that this pipeline can identify differences in microglia response due to TBI. An automated solution to microglia cell analysis can greatly increase standardized analysis of brain slides allowing pathologists and neuroscientists to focus on characterizing the associated underlying diseases and injuries.
