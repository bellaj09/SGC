Eating behavior style emotional restrictive or external has been proposed as an explanation for the differences in response to food-related cues between people who overeat and those who do not and has been also considered a target for the treatment of eating disorders EDs characterized by lack of control over eating and weight-related overweight/obesity conditions. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between eating behavior style and psychophysiological responses self-reported food craving and anxiety to food-related virtual reality VR environments in outpatients with bulimia nervosa BN and binge eating disorder BED and to compare them with healthy participants. Fifty-eight outpatients and 135 healthy participants were exposed to palatable foods in four experimental everyday real-life VR environments kitchen dining room bedroom and caf. During exposure cue-elicited food craving and anxiety were assessed. Participants also completed standardized instruments for the study purposes. ED patients reported significantly higher levels of craving and anxiety when exposed to the virtual food than healthy controls. Eating behavior styles showed strong associations with cue-elicited food craving and anxiety. In the healthy group external eating was the only predictor of cue-elicited craving and anxiety. In participants with BN and BED external and emotional eating were the best predictors of cue-elicited craving and anxiety respectively. Eating behavior style predicts craving and anxiety experienced in food-related virtual environments by patients with eating disorders and healthy controls.
