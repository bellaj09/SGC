Electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs represent novel human machine interactive technology that allows people to communicate and interact with the external world without relying on their peripheral muscles and nervous system. Among BCI systems brain-actuated wheelchairs are promising systems for the rehabilitation of severely motor disabled individuals who are unable to control a wheelchair by conventional interfaces. Previous related studies realized the easy use of brain-actuated wheelchairs that enable people to navigate the wheelchair through simple commands; however these systems rely on offline calibration of the environment. Other systems do not rely on any prior knowledge; however the control of the system is time consuming. In this paper we have proposed an improved mobile platform structure equipped with an omnidirectional wheelchair a lightweight robotic arm a target recognition module and an auto-control module. Based on the you only look once YOLO algorithm our system can in real time recognize and locate the targets in the environment and the users confirm one target through a P300-based BCI. An expert system plans a proper solution for a specific target; for example the planned solution for a door is opening the door and then passing through it and the auto-control system then jointly controls the wheelchair and robotic arm to complete the operation. During the task execution the target is also tracked by using an image tracking technique. Thus we have formed an easy-to-use system that can provide accurate services to satisfy user requirements and this system can accommodate different environments.
