The purpose of this paper is to record and analyze induced gamma-band activity GBA 30-60 Hz in cerebral motor areas during imaginary movement and to compare it quantitatively with activity recorded in the same areas during actual movement using a simplified electroencephalogram EEG. Brain activity basal activity imaginary motor task and actual motor task is obtained from 12 healthy volunteer subjects using an EEG Cz channel. GBA is analyzed using the mean power spectral density PSD value. Event-related synchronization ERS is calculated from the PSD values of the basal GBA GBAb the GBA of the imaginary movement GBAim and the GBA of the actual movement GBAac. The mean GBAim and GBAac values for the right and left hands are significantly higher than the GBAb value p = 0.007. No significant difference is detected between mean GBA values during the imaginary and actual movement p = 0.242. The mean ERS values for the imaginary movement ERSimM % = 23.52 and for the actual movement ERSacM = 27.47 do not present any significant difference p = 0.117. We demonstrated that ERS could provide a useful way of indirectly checking the function of neuronal motor circuits activated by voluntary movement both imaginary and actual. These results as a proof of concept could be applied to physiology studies brain-computer interfaces and diagnosis of cognitive or motor pathologies.
