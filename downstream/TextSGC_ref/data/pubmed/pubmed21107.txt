"Virtual reality VR in neurorehabilitation allows to reduce patients risk and allows him to learn on a faster way. Up to now VR has been used in patients with Parkinson disease PD as a research tool and none of the developed systems are used in clinical practice. The goal of this project is to develop a VR-based system for gait therapy and gait research of patients with PD designed based on published evidence. The developed system uses a digital camera to measure spatiotemporal gait parameters. The software was developed in C# using Open-Source libraries that facilitates VR programming. The system has potential uses in clinical and research settings."
