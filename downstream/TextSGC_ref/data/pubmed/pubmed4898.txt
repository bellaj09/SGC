We propose a framework for quantifying node-level community structures between groups using anatomical brain networks derived from DTI-tractography. To construct communities we computed hierarchical binary trees by maximizing two metrics: the well-known modularity metric Q and a novel metric that measures the difference between inter-community and intra-community path lengths. Changes in community structures on the nodal level were assessed between generated trees and a statistical framework was developed to detect local differences between two groups of community structures. We applied this framework to a sample of 42 subjects with major depression and 47 healthy controls. Results showed that several nodes including the bilateral precuneus which have been linked to self-awareness within the default mode network exhibited significant differences between groups. These findings are consistent with those reported in previous literature suggesting a higher degree of ruminative self-reflections in depression.
