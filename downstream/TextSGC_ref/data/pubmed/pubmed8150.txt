Mosquito control is important as mosquitoes are extremely harmful pests that spread various infectious diseases. In this research we present the preliminary results of an automated system that detects the presence of mosquitoes via image processing using multiple deep learning networks. The Fully Convolutional Network FCN and neural network-based regression demonstrated an accuracy of 84%. Meanwhile the single image classifier demonstrated an accuracy of only 52%. The overall processing time also decreased from 4.64 to 2.47 s compared to the conventional classifying network. After detection a larvicide made from toxic protein crystals of the Bacillus thuringiensis serotype israelensis bacteria was injected into static water to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes. This system demonstrates a higher efficiency than hunting adult mosquitos while avoiding damage to other insects.
