Automatic detection and classification of the masses in mammograms are still a big challenge and play a crucial role to assist radiologists for accurate diagnosis. In this paper we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis CAD system based on one of the regional deep learning techniques a ROI-based Convolutional Neural Network CNN which is called You Only Look Once YOLO. Although most previous studies only deal with classification of masses our proposed YOLO-based CAD system can handle detection and classification simultaneously in one framework. Simultaneous detection and classification of breast masses in digital mammograms via a deep learning YOLO-based CAD system.
