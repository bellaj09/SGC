Brain-machine interfaces BMIs enable humans to interact with devices by modulating their brain signals. Despite impressive technological advancements several obstacles remain. The most commonly used BMI control signals are derived from the brain areas involved in primary sensory- or motor-related processing. However these signals only reflect a limited range of human intentions. Therefore additional sources of brain activity for controlling BMIs need to be explored. In particular higher-order cognitive brain signals specifically those encoding goal-directed intentions are natural candidates for enlarging the repertoire of BMI control signals and making them more efficient and intuitive. Thus here we identify the prefrontal brain area as a key target region for future BMIs given its involvement in higher-order goal-oriented cognitive processes.
