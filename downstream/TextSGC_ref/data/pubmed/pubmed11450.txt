In computed tomography coronary angiography CTCA calcification and stent make it difficult to evaluate intravascular lumen. This is a cause of low positive-predictive value of coronary stenosis. Therefore it is expected to develop a computer-aided diagnosis CAD system that can automatically detect stenosis in coronary arteries. The purpose of this study is to automatically recognize calcifications or stents in coronary arteries and classify them from the normal coronary artery in CTCA. We used 4960 coronary-cross-sectional images which consisted of 1113 images with calcification 1353 images with a stent and 2494 normal artery images. These images were automatically classified using the deep convolutional neural network LeNet AlexNet and GoogLeNet. The classification accuracy of LeNet AlexNet and GoogLeNet were 58.4% 75.9% and 81.3% respectively. The proposed method would be a fundamental technique of CAD in CTCA.
