Topographical disorientation is frequent among patients after a stroke and can be well explored with virtual environments VEs. VEs also allow for the addition of stimuli. A previous study did not find any effect of non-contextual auditory stimuli on navigational performance in the virtual action planning-supermarket VAP-S simulating a medium-sized 3D supermarket. However the perceptual or cognitive load of the sounds used was not high. Influence of non-contextual auditory stimuli on navigation in a virtual reality context involving executive functions among patients after stroke.
