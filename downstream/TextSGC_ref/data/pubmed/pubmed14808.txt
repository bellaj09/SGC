Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI can provide detailed information of the physical characteristics of rectum tumours. Several investigations suggest that volumetric analyses on anatomical and functional MRI contain clinically valuable information. However manual delineation of tumours is a time consuming procedure as it requires a high level of expertise. Here we evaluate deep learning methods for automatic localization and segmentation of rectal cancers on multiparametric MR imaging. MRI scans 1.5T T2-weighted and DWI of 140 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were included in our analysis equally divided between discovery and validation datasets. Two expert radiologists segmented each tumor. A convolutional neural network CNN was trained on the multiparametric MRIs of the discovery set to classify each voxel into tumour or non-tumour. On the independent validation dataset the CNN showed high segmentation accuracy for reader1 Dice Similarity Coefficient DSC\u2009=\u20090.68 and reader2 DSC\u2009=\u20090.70. The area under the curve AUC of the resulting probability maps was very high for both readers AUC\u2009=\u20090.99 SD\u2009=\u20090.05. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can perform accurate localization and segmentation of rectal cancer in MR imaging in the majority of patients. Deep learning technologies have the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of MRI-based rectum segmentations.
