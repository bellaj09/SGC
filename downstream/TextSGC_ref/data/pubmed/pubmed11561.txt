Monocular depth estimation from Red-Green-Blue RGB images is a well-studied ill-posed problem in computer vision which has been investigated intensively over the past decade using Deep Learning DL approaches. The recent approaches for monocular depth estimation mostly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks CNN. Estimating depth from two-dimensional images plays an important role in various applications including scene reconstruction 3D object-detection robotics and autonomous driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this research topic including the problem representation and a short description of traditional methods for depth estimation. Relevant datasets and 13 state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches for monocular depth estimation are reviewed evaluated and discussed. We conclude this paper with a perspective towards future research work requiring further investigation in monocular depth estimation challenges.
