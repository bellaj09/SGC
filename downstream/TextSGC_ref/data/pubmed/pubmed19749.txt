"Huntingtons disease HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a triad of motor psychiatric and cognitive deficits with the latter classically attributed to disruption of frontostriatal networks. However emerging evidence from animal models of HD suggests that some of the early cognitive deficits may have a hippocampal basis. The objective of this study was to link previous rodent findings in this area to clinical practice." "Hippocampal dysfunction defines disease onset in Huntingtons disease."
