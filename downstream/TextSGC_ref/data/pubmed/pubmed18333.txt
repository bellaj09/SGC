"Illusory self-motion known as vection describes the sensation of ego-motion in the absence of physical movement. Vection typically occurs in stationary observers being exposed to visual information that suggest self-motion e.g. simulators virtual reality. In the present study we tested whether sensory integration of visual information triggers vection: participants N=13 perceived patterns of moving altered black-and-white vertical stripes on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual field. In both fields the pattern was either moving or stationary resulting in four combinations of central and peripheral motions: 1 central and peripheral stripes moved into the same direction 2 central and peripheral stripes moved in opposite directions or 3 either the central or 4 the peripheral stripes were stable while the other stripes were in motion. This stimulation induced vection: Results showed significantly higher vection ratings when the stationary center of the pattern was surrounded by a moving periphery. Event-related potentials mirrored this finding: The occipital N2 was largest with stationary central and moving peripheral stripes. Our findings suggest that sensory integration of peripheral and central visual information triggers the perception of vection. Furthermore we found evidence that neural processes precede the subjective perception of vection strength prior to the actual onset of vection. We will discuss our findings with respect to the role of stimulus eccentricity stimulus depth and neural correlates involved during the genesis of vection."
