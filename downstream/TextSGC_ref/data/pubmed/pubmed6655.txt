"Early detection of prostate cancer increases chances of patients survival. Our automated non-invasive system for computer-aided diagnosis CAD of prostate cancer segments the prostate on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images DW-MRI acquired at different b-values estimates its apparent diffusion coefficients ADC and classifies their descriptors - empirical cumulative distribution functions CDF - with a trained deep learning network. To segment the prostate an evolving geometric level-set-based deformable model is guided by a speed function depending on intensity attributes extracted from the DW-MRI with nonnegative matrix factorization NMF. For a more robust evolution the attributes are fused with a probabilistic shape prior and estimated spatial dependencies between prostate voxels. To preserve continuity the ADCs of the segmented prostate volume at different b-values are normalized and refined using a generalized Gauss-Markov random field image model. The CDFs of the refined ADCs at different b-values are considered global water diffusion features and used to distinguish between benign and malignant prostates. A deep learning network of stacked non-negativity-constrained auto-encoders SNCAE is trained to classify the benign or malignant prostates on the basis of the constructed CDFs. Our experiments on 53 clinical DW-MRI data sets resulted in 92.3% accuracy 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity indicating that the proposed CAD system could be used as a reliable non-invasive diagnostic tool."
