Academic diligence is the ability to regulate behavior in the service of goals and a predictor of educational attainment. Here we combined behavioral structural MRI functional MRI and connectivity data to investigate the neurocognitive correlates of diligence. We assessed whether individual differences in diligence are related to the interplay between frontal control and striatal reward systems as predicted by the dual-systems hypothesis of adolescent development. We obtained behavioral measures of diligence from 40 adolescent girls aged 14-15 years using the Academic Diligence Task. We collected structural imaging data for each participant as well as functional imaging data during an emotional go-no-go self-control task. As predicted by the dual-systems hypothesis we found that inferior frontal activation and gyrification correlated with academic diligence. However neither striatal activation nor structure nor fronto-striatal connectivity showed clear associations with diligence. Instead we found prominent activation of temporal areas during the go-no-go task. This suggests that academic diligence is associated with an extended network of brain regions.
