With the advent of techniques for browsing a three-dimensional object it became possible to display three-dimensional images on a personal computer via the Internet. This report describes the construction of a three-dimensional virtual model of human lower extremities that was linked with the data acquired from gait analysis in order to perform three-dimensional gait analysis. Virtual anatomy and movement of lower extremities using virtual reality modeling language.
