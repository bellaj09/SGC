"This review presents state-of-the-art knowledge about the roles of the basal ganglia BG in action-selection cognition and motivation and how this knowledge has been used to improve deep brain stimulation DBS treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Such pathological conditions include Parkinsons disease Huntingtons disease Tourette syndrome depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The first section presents evidence supporting current hypotheses of how the cortico-BG circuitry works to select motor and emotional actions and how defects in this circuitry can cause symptoms of the BG diseases. Emphasis is given to the role of striatal dopamine on motor performance motivated behaviors and learning of procedural memories. Next the use of cutting-edge electrochemical techniques in animal and human studies of BG functioning under normal and disease conditions is discussed. Finally functional neuroimaging studies are reviewed; these works have shown the relationship between cortico-BG structures activated during DBS and improvement of disease symptoms."
