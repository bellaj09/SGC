The orchestration of orienting behaviors requires the interaction of many cortical and subcortical areas for example the superior colliculus SC as well as prefrontal areas responsible for top-down control. Orienting involves different behaviors such as approach and avoidance. In the rat these behaviors are at least partially mapped onto different SC subdomains the lateral SCl and medial SCm respectively. To delineate the circuitry involved in the two types of orienting behavior in mice we injected retrograde tracer into the intermediate and deep layers of the SCm and SCl and thereby determined the main input structures to these subdomains. Overall the SCm receives larger numbers of afferents compared to the SCl. The prefrontal cingulate area Cg visual oculomotor and auditory areas provide strong input to the SCm while prefrontal motor area 2 M2 and somatosensory areas provide strong input to the SCl. The prefrontal areas Cg and M2 in turn connect to different cortical and subcortical areas as determined by anterograde tract tracing. Even though connectivity pattern often overlap our labeling approaches identified segregated neural circuits involving SCm Cg secondary visual cortices auditory areas and the dysgranular retrospenial cortex likely to be involved in avoidance behaviors. Conversely SCl M2 somatosensory cortex and the granular retrospenial cortex comprise a network likely involved in approach/appetitive behaviors.
