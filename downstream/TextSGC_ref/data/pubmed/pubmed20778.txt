Endovascular neurosurgery is a discipline strongly dependent on imaging. Therefore technology that improves how much useful information we can garner from a single image has the potential to dramatically assist decision making during endovascular procedures. Furthermore education in an image-enhanced environment especially with the incorporation of simulation can improve the safety of the procedures and give interventionalists and trainees the opportunity to study or perform simulated procedures before the intervention much like what is practiced in the field of aviation. Here we examine the use of simulators in the training of fighter pilots and discuss how similar benefits can compensate for current deficiencies in endovascular training. We describe the types of simulation used for endovascular procedures including virtual reality and discuss the relevant data on its utility in training. Finally the benefit of augmented reality during endovascular procedures is discussed along with future computerized image enhancement techniques.
