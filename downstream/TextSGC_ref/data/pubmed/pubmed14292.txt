Automation machine learning and artificial intelligence AI are changing the landscape of echocardiography providing complimentary tools to physicians to enhance patient care. Multiple vendor software programs have incorporated automation to improve accuracy and efficiency of manual tracings. Automation with longitudinal strain and 3D echocardiography has shown great accuracy and reproducibility allowing the incorporation of these techniques into daily workflow. This will give further experience to nonexpert readers and allow the integration of these essential tools into more echocardiography laboratories. The potential for machine learning in cardiovascular imaging is still being discovered as algorithms are being created with training on large data sets beyond what traditional statistical reasoning can handle. Deep learning when applied to large image repositories will recognize complex relationships and patterns integrating all properties of the image which will unlock further connections about the natural history and prognosis of cardiac disease states. The purpose of this review article was to describe the role and current use of automation machine learning and AI in echocardiography and discuss potential limitations and challenges of in the future. Automation machine learning and artificial intelligence in echocardiography: A brave new world.
