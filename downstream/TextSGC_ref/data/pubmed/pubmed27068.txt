One of the major drawbacks in mobile EEG Brain Computer Interfaces BCI is the need for subject specific training data to train a classifier. By removing the need for supervised classification and calibration phase new users could start immediate interaction with a BCI. We propose a solution to exploit the structural difference by means of canonical polyadic decomposition CPD for three-class auditory oddball data without the need for subject-specific information. We achieve this by adding average event-related-potential ERP templates to the CPD model. This constitutes a novel similarity measure between single-trial pairs and known-templates which results in a fast and interpretable classifier. These results have similar accuracy to those of the supervised and cross-validated stepwise LDA approach but without the need for having subject-dependent data. Therefore the described CPD method has a significant practical advantage over the traditional and widely used approach.
