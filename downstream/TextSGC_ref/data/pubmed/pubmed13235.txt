Acute Kidney Injury AKI is a common clinical syndrome characterized by the rapid loss of kidney excretory function which aggravates the clinical severity of other diseases in a large number of hospitalized patients. Accurate early prediction of AKI can enable in-time interventions and treatments. However AKI is highly heterogeneous thus identification of AKI sub-phenotypes can lead to an improved understanding of the disease pathophysiology and development of more targeted clinical interventions. This study used a memory network-based deep learning approach to discover AKI sub-phenotypes using structured and unstructured electronic health record EHR data of patients before AKI diagnosis. We leveraged a real world critical care EHR corpus including 37486 ICU stays. Our approach identified three distinct sub-phenotypes: sub-phenotype I is with an average age of 63.0317.25 years and is characterized by mild loss of kidney excretory function Serum Creatinine SCr 1.550.34 mg/dL estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Test eGFR 107.6554.98 mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients are more likely to develop stage I AKI. Sub-phenotype II is with average age 66.8110.43 years and was characterized by severe loss of kidney excretory function SCr 1.960.49 mg/dL eGFR 82.1955.92 mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients are more likely to develop stage III AKI. Sub-phenotype III is with average age 65.0711.32 years and was characterized moderate loss of kidney excretory function and thus more likely to develop stage II AKI SCr 1.690.32 mg/dL eGFR 93.9756.53 mL/min/1.73 m2. Both SCr and eGFR are significantly different across the three sub-phenotypes with statistical testing plus postdoc analysis and the conclusion still holds after age adjustment.
