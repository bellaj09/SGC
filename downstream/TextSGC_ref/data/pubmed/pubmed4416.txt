Human brain maturation is characterized by the prolonged development of structural and functional properties of large-scale networks that extends into adulthood. However it is not clearly understood which features change and which remain stable over time. Here we examined structural connectivity based on diffusion tensor imaging DTI in 121 participants between 4 and 40 years of age. DTI data were analyzed for small-world parameters modularity and the number of fiber tracts at the level of streamlines. First our findings showed that the number of fiber tracts small-world topology and modular organization remained largely stable despite a substantial overall decrease in the number of streamlines with age. Second this decrease mainly affected fiber tracts that had a large number of streamlines were short within modules and within hemispheres; such connections were affected significantly more often than would be expected given their number of occurrences in the network. Third streamline loss occurred earlier in females than in males. In summary our findings suggest that core properties of structural brain connectivity such as the small-world and modular organization remain stable during brain maturation by focusing streamline loss to specific types of fiber tracts.
