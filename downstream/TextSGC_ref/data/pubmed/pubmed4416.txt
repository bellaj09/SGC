Schizophrenia has long been suggested to represent a disorder with prominent neural dysconnectivity. Gamma-band oscillations are highly relevant in this context due both to their proposed involvement in neuronal synchronization and to their association with neurotransmitter systems relevant for schizophrenia. Several task-related studies have confirmed reduced power and synchronization of gamma-band oscillations in schizophrenia but it has been suggested that these findings might not apply to the resting state. The present study aimed to investigate resting-state gamma-band connectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Increased Resting-State Gamma-Band Connectivity in First-Episode Schizophrenia.
