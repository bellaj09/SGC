Hashing could significantly accelerate large-scale image search by transforming the high-dimensional features into binary Hamming space where efficient similarity search can be achieved with very fast Hamming distance computation and extremely low storage cost. As an important branch of hashing methods multi-view hashing takes advantages of multiple features from different views for binary hash learning. However existing multi-view hashing methods are either based on shallow models which fail to fully capture the intrinsic correlations of heterogeneous views or unsupervised deep models which suffer from insufficient semantics and cannot effectively exploit the complementarity of view features. In this paper we propose a novel Deep Collaborative Multi-view Hashing DCMVH method to deeply fuse multi-view features and learn multi-view hash codes collaboratively under a deep architecture. DCMVH is a new deep multi-view hash learning framework. It mainly consists of 1 multiple view-specific networks to extract hidden representations of different views and 2 a fusion network to learn multi-view fused hash code. DCMVH associates different layers with instance-wise and pair-wise semantic labels respectively. In this way the discriminative capability of representation layers can be progressively enhanced and meanwhile the complementarity of different view features can be exploited effectively. Finally we develop a fast discrete hash optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier to efficiently solve the binary hash codes. Experiments on public multi-view image search datasets demonstrate our approach achieves substantial performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
