Functional connectomes computed from fMRI provide a means to characterize individual differences in the patterns of BOLD synchronization across regions of the entire brain. Using four resting-state fMRI datasets with a wide range of ages we show that individual differences of the functional connectome are stable across 3 months to 1-2 years and even detectable at above-chance levels across 3 years. Medial frontal and frontoparietal networks appear to be both unique and stable resulting in high ID rates as did a combination of these two networks. We conduct analyses demonstrating that these results are not driven by head motion. We also show that edges contributing the most to a successful ID tend to connect nodes in the frontal and parietal cortices while edges contributing the least tend to connect cross-hemispheric homologs. Our results demonstrate that the functional connectome is stable across years and that high ID rates are not an idiosyncratic aspect of a specific dataset but rather reflect stable individual differences in the functional connectivity of the brain. The individual functional connectome is unique and stable over months to years.
