Magnetic resonance imaging MRI images can be used to diagnose brain tumors. Thanks to these images some methods have so far been proposed in order to distinguish between benign and malignant brain tumors. Many systems attempting to define these tumors are based on tissue analysis methods. However various factors such as the quality of an MRI device noisy images and low image resolution may decrease the quality of MRI images. To eliminate these problems super resolution approaches are preferred as a complementary source for brain tumor images. The proposed method benefits from single image super resolution SISR and maximum fuzzy entropy segmentation MFES for brain tumor segmentation on an MRI image. Later pre-trained ResNet architecture which is a convolutional neural network CNN architecture and support vector machine SVM are used to perform feature extraction and classification respectively. It was observed in experimental studies that SISR displayed a higher performance in terms of brain tumor segmentation. Similarly it displayed a higher performance in terms of classifying brain tumor regions as well as benign and malignant brain tumors. As a result the present study indicated that SISR yielded an accuracy rate of 95% in the diagnosis of segmented brain tumors which exceeds brain tumor segmentation using MFES without SISR by 7.5%. A new approach for brain tumor diagnosis system: Single image super resolution based maximum fuzzy entropy segmentation and convolutional neural network.
