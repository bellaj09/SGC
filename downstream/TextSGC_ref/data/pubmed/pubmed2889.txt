"ZNF804A rs1344706 A/C was the first SNP that reached genome-wide significance for schizophrenia. Recent studies have linked rs1344706 to functional connectivity among specific brain regions. However no study thus far has examined the role of this SNP in the entire functional connectome. In this study we used degree centrality to test the role of rs1344706 in the whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectome during the resting state. 52 schizophrenia patients and 128 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. In our whole-brain analysis we found a significant interaction effect of genotype\xa0\xa0diagnosis at the precuneus PCU cluster size\xa0=\xa052 voxels peak voxel MNI coordinates: x\xa0=\xa09 y\xa0=\xa0-\xa069 z\xa0=\xa063 F\xa0=\xa032.57 FWE corrected P\xa0<\xa00.001. When we subdivided the degree centrality network according to anatomical distance the whole-brain analysis also found a significant interaction effect of genotype\xa0\xa0diagnosis at the PCU with the same peak in the short-range degree centrality network cluster size\xa0=\xa072 voxels F\xa0=\xa037.29 FWE corrected P\xa0<\xa00.001. No significant result was found in the long-range degree centrality network. Our results elucidated the contribution of rs1344706 to functional connectivity within the brain network and may have important implications for our understanding of this risk genes role in functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia."
