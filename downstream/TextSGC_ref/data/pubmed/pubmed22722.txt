"Event-related desynchronization ERD of sensori-motor rhythms SMR can be used for online brain-machine interface BMI control but yields challenges related to the stability of ERD and feedback strategy to optimize BMI learning.Here we compared two approaches to this challenge in 20 right-handed healthy subjects HS five sessions each S1-S5 and four stroke patients SP 15 sessions each S1-S15. ERD was recorded from a 275-sensor MEG system. During daily trainingmotor imagery-induced ERD led to visual and proprioceptive feedback delivered through an orthotic device attached to the subjects hand and fingers. Group A trained with a heterogeneous reference value RV for ERD detection with binary feedback and Group B with a homogenous RV and graded feedback 10 HS and 2 SP in each group. HS in Group B showed better BMI performance than Group A p < 0.001 and improved BMI control from S1 to S5 p = 0.012 while Group A did not. In spite of the small n SP in Group B showed a trend for a higher BMI performance p = 0.06 and learning was significantly better p < 0.05. Using a homogeneous RV and graded feedback led to improved modulation of ipsilesional activity resulting in superior BMI learning relative to use of a heterogeneous RV and binary feedback."
