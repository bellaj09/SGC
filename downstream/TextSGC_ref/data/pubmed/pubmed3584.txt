The brain\s functional network exhibits many features facilitating functional specialization integration and robustness to attack. Using graph theory to characterize brain networks studies demonstrate their small-world modular and "rich-club" properties with deviations reported in many common neuropathological conditions. Here we estimate the heritability of five widely used graph theoretical metrics mean clustering coefficient  modularity Q rich-club coefficient norm global efficiency  small-worldness  over a range of connection densities k=5-25% in a large cohort of twins N=592 84 MZ and 89 DZ twin pairs 246 single twins age 23  2.5. We also considered the effects of global signal regression GSR. We found that the graph metrics were moderately influenced by genetic factors h2 =47-59% Q=38-59% norm=0-29% =52-64% =51-59% at lower connection densities  15% and when global signal regression was implemented heritability estimates decreased substantially h2 =0-26% Q=0-28% norm=0% =23-30% =0-27%. Distinct network features were phenotypically correlated |r|=0.15-0.81 and  Q and  were found to be influenced by overlapping genetic factors. Our findings suggest that these metrics may be potential endophenotypes for psychiatric disease and suitable for genetic association studies but that genetic effects must be interpreted with respect to methodological choices.
