Recognizing who is speaking is a cognitive ability characterized by considerable individual differences which could relate to the inter-individual variability observed in voice-elicited BOLD activity. Since voice perception is sustained by a complex brain network involving temporal voice areas TVAs and even if less consistently extra-temporal regions such as frontal cortices functional connectivity FC during an fMRI voice localizer passive listening of voices vs non-voices has been computed within twelve temporal and frontal voice-sensitive regions "voice patches" individually defined for each subject N\u202f=\u202f90 to account for inter-individual variability. Results revealed that voice patches were positively co-activated during voice listening and that they were characterized by different FC pattern depending on the location anterior/posterior and the hemisphere. Importantly FC between right frontal and temporal voice patches was behaviorally relevant: FC significantly increased with voice recognition abilities as measured in a voice recognition test performed outside the scanner. Hence this study highlights the importance of frontal regions in voice perception and it supports the idea that looking at FC between stimulus-specific and higher-order frontal regions can help understanding individual differences in processing social stimuli such as voices.
