An increasing number of projects in neuroscience require statistical analysis of high-dimensional data as for instance in the prediction of behavior from neural firing or in the operation of artificial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Although prevalent classical linear analysis techniques are often numerically fragile in high dimensions due to irrelevant redundant and noisy information. We developed a robust Bayesian linear regression algorithm that automatically detects relevant features and excludes irrelevant ones all in a computationally efficient manner. In comparison with standard linear methods the new Bayesian method regularizes against overfitting is computationally efficient unlike previously proposed variational linear regression methods is suitable for data sets with large numbers of samples and a very high number of input dimensions and is easy to use thus demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. We evaluate our technique on synthetic data sets and on several neurophysiological data sets. For these neurophysiological data sets we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed from neural activity in motor cortices. Results demonstrate the success of our newly developed method in comparison with other approaches in the literature and from the neurophysiological point of view confirms recent findings on the organization of the motor cortex. Finally an incremental real-time version of our algorithm demonstrates the suitability of our approach for real-time interfaces between brains and machines.
