Knowledge of the correct protein subcellular localization is necessary for understanding the function of a protein and revealing the mechanism of many human diseases due to protein subcellular mislocalization which is required before approaching gene therapy to treat a disease. In addition it is well-known that the gene therapy is an effective way to overcome disease by targeting a gene therapy product to a specific subcellular compartment. Deep neural networks to predict protein function have become increasingly popular due to large increases in the available genomics data due to its strong superiority in the non-linear classification ability. However they still have some drawbacks such as too many hyper-parameters and sufficient amount of labeled data. Deep Forest-based Prediction of Protein Subcellular Localization.
