Since operating urban air quality stations is not only time consuming but also costly and because air pollutants can cause serious health problems this paper presents the hourly prediction of ten air pollutant concentrations CO2 NH3 NO NO2 NOx O3 PM1 PM2.5 PM10 and PN10 in a street canyon in Mnster using an artificial neural network ANN approach. Special attention was paid to comparing three predictor options representing the traffic volume: we included acoustic sound measurements sound the total number of vehicles traffic and the hour of the day and the day of the week time as input variables and then compared their prediction powers. The models were trained validated and tested to evaluate their performance. Results showed that the predictions of the gaseous air pollutants NO NO2 NOx and O3 reveal very good agreement with observations whereas predictions for particle concentrations and NH3 were less successful indicating that these models can be improved. All three input variable options sound traffic and time proved to be suitable and showed distinct strengths for modelling various air pollutant concentrations.
