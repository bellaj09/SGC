"Virtual reality environments VREs are computer-generated 3-dimensional worlds that allow users to experience situations similar to those encountered in the real world. The purpose of this study was to investigate VREs for potential use in assessing and treating persons who stutter PWS by determining the extent to which PWSs affective behavioral and cognitive measures in a VRE correlate with those same measures in a similar live environment." Real enough: using virtual public speaking environments to evoke feelings and behaviors targeted in stuttering assessment and treatment.
