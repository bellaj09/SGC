Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding LAGB is a common surgery method used to help obese patients to lose weight. However even if LAGB is able to produce a durable and relevant weight loss it is less effective in improving body image: as demonstrated by a recent study obese patients with a body image disorder in the pre-operative stage continue to show this even 13 months after the operation. In this presentation we will discuss the possible role of virtual reality VR in addressing this problem within an integrated cognitive behavioral approach. To test this approach a case series of three LAGB patient who experienced body dissatisfaction even after a &gt;30/40% excess body weight loss is presented and discussed. At the end of the 6-week protocol the patients experienced a 15%-20% further reduction of their weight. This reduction was also matched by a general improvement of the psychological state. Both the weight loss and the level of well-being were further improved after a three-month follow-up.
