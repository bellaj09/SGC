"With the development of e-Health it plays a more and more important role in predicting whether a doctors answer can be accepted by a patient through online healthcare community. Unlike the previous work which focus mainly on the numerical feature in our framework we combine both numerical and textual information to predict the acceptance of answers. The textual information is composed of questions posted by the patients and answers posted by the doctors. To extract the textual features from them we first trained a sentence encoder to encode a pair of question and answer into a co-dependent representation on a held-out dataset. After thatwe can use it to predict the acceptance of answers by doctors." Acceptance Prediction for Answers on Online Health-care Community.
