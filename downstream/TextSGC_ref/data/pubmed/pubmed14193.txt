"The educational models currently in use in higher education aim to make students active participants in their learning process while the lecturer is seen more as a facilitator of the said process. Students learning strategies superficial approach-memorizing deep approach-looking for meaning and achievement approach-aimed at results and their good practices are gaining in importance and the aim of this study is to identify university students good practices which are related to their learning strategies. To do so our research covered 610 students from different science degree courses at the University of Extremadura who anonymously completed the University Students Good Practice Inventory IBPEU and the University students Questionnaire to Evaluate Study and Learning Processes CEPEA. The influence of context understood here as the center or scientific field was discarded. The factor Actively learning was positively associated with the deep and achievement approaches; the factor Interaction with lecturers was positively associated with the superficial approach and negatively with the deep approach; the factor Cooperative work was also associated with the deep approach; while the achievement approach was positively associated with the factor Optimizing time and negatively with respect for different capacities. These associations are promising as good practices can be learnt and evaluated." Good Practices and Learning Strategies of Undergraduate University Students.
