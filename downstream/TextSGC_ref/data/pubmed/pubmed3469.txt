"The question of whether there are biological differences between male and female brains is a fraught one and political positions and prior expectations seem to have a strong influence on the interpretation of scientific data in this field. This question is relevant to issues of gender differences in the prevalence of psychiatric conditions including autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Tourettes syndrome schizophrenia dyslexia depression and eating disorders. Understanding how gender influences vulnerability to these conditions is significant. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI provides a non-invasive method to investigate brain microstructure and the integrity of anatomical connectivity. Generalized q-sampling imaging GQI has been proposed to characterize complicated fiber patterns and distinguish fiber orientations providing an opportunity for more accurate higher-order descriptions through the water diffusion process. Therefore we aimed to investigate differences in the brains structural network between teenage males and females using GQI. This study included 59 i.e. 33 males and 26 females age- and education-matched subjects age range: 13 to 14\xa0years. The structural connectome was obtained by graph theoretical and network-based statistical NBS analyses. Our findings show that teenage male brains exhibit better intrahemispheric communication and teenage female brains exhibit better interhemispheric communication. Our results also suggest that the network organization of teenage male brains is more local more segregated and more similar to small-world networks than teenage female brains. We conclude that the use of an MRI study with a GQI-based structural connectomic approach like ours presents novel insights into network-based systems of the brain and provides a new piece of the puzzle regarding gender differences."
