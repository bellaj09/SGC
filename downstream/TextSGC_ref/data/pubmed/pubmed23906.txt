Rocking movements are known to affect human sleep. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transition from wake to sleep can be facilitated by rocking movements which might be related to relaxation. However it is not yet known which movements would have the greatest effect. Thus a 6-degree-of-freedom tendon-based robotic bed was developed for systematic evaluation of vestibular stimuli. The applicability of the device was evaluated with 25 subjects. Six movement axes were tested and analyzed for differences in promoting relaxation. Relaxation was assessed by electroencephalogram electrocardiogram respiration and a questionnaire. The developed device fulfilled all needed requirements proving the applicability of this technology. Movements had no significant effects on the electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram. Respiration frequency was significantly lower for baseline measurements without movement median 0.183-0.233\xa0Hz compared to movement conditions median 0.283-0.300\xa0Hz. Questionnaire ratings showed a trend p\xa0=\xa00.057 toward higher relaxation for movements along the vertical axis z-axis median 4.67; confidence interval 4.33-5.67 compared to the roll-axis median 4.33; confidence interval 3.67-5.00. Movements along the vertical axis z-axis therefore appear most promising in promoting relaxation though no effects were found in electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram variables. This lack of effect might be attributed to the short exposure to the movements and the large inter-individual variability and individual preferences among subjects.
