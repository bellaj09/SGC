"OBJECT The aim of this study was to examine the arcuate AF and superior longitudinal fasciculi SLF which together form the dorsal language stream using fiber dissection and diffusion imaging techniques in the human brain. METHODS Twenty-five formalin-fixed brains 50 hemispheres and 3 adult cadaveric heads prepared according to the Klingler method were examined by the fiber dissection technique. The authors findings were supported with MR tractography provided by the Human Connectome Project WU-Minn Consortium. The frequencies of gyral distributions were calculated in segments of the AF and SLF in the cadaveric specimens. RESULTS The AF has ventral and dorsal segments and the SLF has 3 segments: SLF I dorsal pathway II middle pathway and III ventral pathway. The AF ventral segment connects the middle 88%; all percentages represent the area of the named structure that is connected to the tract and posterior 100% parts of the superior temporal gyri and the middle part 92% of the middle temporal gyrus to the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus 96% in pars opercularis 40% in pars triangularis and the ventral premotor cortex 84% by passing deep to the lower part of the supramarginal gyrus 100%. The AF dorsal segment connects the posterior part of the middle 100% and inferior temporal gyri 76% to the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus 96% in pars opercularis ventral premotor cortex 72% and posterior part of the middle frontal gyrus 56% by passing deep to the lower part of the angular gyrus 100%. CONCLUSIONS This study depicts the distinct subdivision of the AF and SLF based on cadaveric fiber dissection and diffusion imaging techniques to clarify the complicated language processing pathways."
