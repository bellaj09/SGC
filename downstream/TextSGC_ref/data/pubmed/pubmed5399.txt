Formation of operational neural networks is one of the most significant accomplishments of human fetal brain growth. Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI have made it possible to obtain information about brain function during fetal development. Specifically resting-state fMRI and novel signal covariation approaches have opened up a new avenue for non-invasive assessment of neural functional connectivity FC before birth. Early studies in this area have unearthed new insights about principles of prenatal brain function. However very little is known about the emergence and maturation of neural networks during fetal life. Here we obtained cross-sectional rs-fMRI data from 39 fetuses between 24 and 38 weeks postconceptual age to examine patterns of connectivity across ten neural FC networks. We identified primitive forms of motor visual default mode thalamic and temporal networks in the human fetal brain. We discovered the first evidence of increased long-range cerebral-cerebellar cortical-subcortical and intra-hemispheric FC with advancing fetal age. Continued aggregation of data about fundamental neural connectivity systems in utero is essential to establishing principles of connectomics at the beginning of human life. Normative data provides a vital context against which to compare instances of abnormal neurobiological development. Age-related increases in long-range connectivity in fetal functional neural connectivity networks in utero.
