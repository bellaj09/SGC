To allow a routinely use of brain-computer interfaces BCI there is a need to reduce or completely eliminate the time-consuming part of the individualized training of the user. In this study we investigate the possibility of avoiding the individual training phase in the detection of movement intention in asynchronous BCIs based on movement-related cortical potential MRCP. EEG signals were recorded during ballistic ankle dorsiflexions executed ME or imagined MI by 20 healthy subjects and attempted by five stroke subjects. These recordings were used to identify a template as average over all subjects for the initial negative phase of the MRCPs after the application of an optimized spatial filtering used for pre-processing. Using this template the detection accuracy mean  SD calculated as true positive rate estimated with leave-one-out procedure for ME was 69  21 and 58  11 % on single trial basis for healthy and stroke subjects respectively. This performance was similar to that obtained using an individual template for each subject which led to accuracies of 71  6 and 55  12 % for healthy and stroke subjects respectively. The detection accuracy for the MI data was 65  22 % with the average template and 60  13 % with the individual template. These results indicate the possibility of detecting movement intention without an individual training phase and without a significant loss in performance.
