"It has been demonstrated that MMP13 enzyme is related to most cancer cell tumors. The worlds largest traditional Chinese medicine database was applied to screen for structure-based drug design and ligand-based drug design. To predict drug activity machine learning models Random Forest RF AdaBoost Regressor ABR Gradient Boosting Regressor GBR and Deep Learning models were utilized to validate the Docking results and we obtained an R2 of 0.922 on the training set and 0.804 on the test set in the RF algorithm. For the Deep Learning algorithm R2 of the training set is 0.90 and R2 of the test set is 0.810. However these TCM compounds fly away during the molecular dynamics MD simulation. We seek another method: peptide design. All peptide database were screened by the Docking process. Modification peptides were optimized the interaction modes and the affinities were assessed with ZDOCK protocol and Refine Docked protein protocol. The 300 ns MD simulation evaluated the stability of receptor-peptide complexes. The double-site effect appeared on S2 a designed peptide based on a known inhibitor when complexed with BCL2. S3 a designed peptide referred from endogenous inhibitor P16 competed against cyclin when binding with CDK6. The MDM2 inhibitors S5 and S6 were derived from the P53 structure and stable binding with MDM2. A flexible region of peptides S5 and S6 may enhance the binding ability by changing its own conformation which was unforeseen. These peptides S2 S3 S5 and S6 are potentially interesting to treat cancer; however these findings need to be affirmed by biological testing which will be conducted in the near future."
