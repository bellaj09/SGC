Brain age prediction based on imaging data and machine learning ML methods has great potential to provide insights into the development of cognition and mental disorders. Though different ML models have been proposed a systematic comparison of ML models in combination with imaging features derived from different modalities is still needed. In this study we evaluate the prediction performance of 36 combinations of imaging features and ML models including deep learning. We utilize single and multimodal brain imaging data including MRI DTI and rs-fMRI from a large data set with 839 subjects. Our study is a follow-up to the initial work Liang et al. 2019. Human Brain Mapping to investigate different analytic strategies to combine data from MRI DTI and rs-fMRI with the goal to improve brain age prediction accuracy. Additionally the traditional approach to predicting the brain age gap has been shown to have a systematic bias. The potential nonlinear relationship between the brain age gap and chronological age has not been thoroughly tested. Here we propose a new method to correct the systematic bias of brain age gap by taking gender chronological age and their interactions into consideration. As the true brain age is unknown and may deviate from chronological age we further examine whether various levels of behavioral performance across subjects predict their brain age estimated from neuroimaging data. This is an important step to quantify the practical implication of brain age prediction. Our findings are helpful to advance the practice of optimizing different analytic methodologies in brain age prediction. Improved prediction of brain age using multimodal neuroimaging data.
