Multidisciplinary studies for glial tumors has produced an enormous amount of information including imaging histology and a large cohort of molecular data i.e. genomics epigenomics metabolomics proteomics etc.. The big data resources are made possible through open access that offers great potential for new biomarker or therapeutic intervention via deep-learning and/or machine learning for integrated multi-omics analysis. An equally important effort to define the hallmarks of glial tumors will also advance precision neuro-oncology and inform patient-specific therapeutics. This review summarizes past studies regarding tumor classification hallmarks of cancer and hypothetical mechanisms. Leveraging on advanced big data approaches and ongoing cross-disciplinary endeavors this review also discusses how to integrate multiple layers of big data toward the goal of precision medicine. Advancing neuro-oncology of glial tumors from big data and multidisciplinary studies.
