The ability to handle sensory conflicts and use the most appropriate sensory information is vital for successful recovery of human postural control after injury. The objective was to determine if virtual reality VR could provide a vehicle for sensory training and determine the temporal and spatial nature of such adaptive changes. Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study 10 females. The subjects watched a 90-second VR simulation of railroad rollercoaster motion in mountainous terrain during five repeated simulations while standing on a force platform that recorded their stability. The immediate response to watching the VR movie was an increased level of postural instability. Repeatedly watching the same VR movie significantly reduced both the anteroposterior 62% p\u2009<\u20090.001 and lateral 47% p\u2009=\u20090.001 energy used. However females adapted more slowly to the VR stimuli as reflected by higher use of total p\u2009=\u20090.007 low frequency p\u2009=\u20090.027 and high frequency p\u2009=\u20090.026 energy. Healthy subjects can significantly adapt to a multidirectional provocative visual environment after 4-5 repeated sessions of VR. Consequently VR technology might be an effective tool for rehabilitation involving visual desensitisation. However some females may require more training sessions to achieve effects with VR. Postural instability in an immersive Virtual Reality adapts with repetition and includes directional and gender specific effects.
