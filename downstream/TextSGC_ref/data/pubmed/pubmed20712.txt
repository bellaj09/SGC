In this study we explore the discriminability of high gamma activities from speech production cortex during the overt articulation of two sentences. Neural activities were recorded from one intracranial electrode placed approximately over the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus. By employing a dynamic time warping DTW method to realign single-trial high gamma response during speech productions averaged temporal activation patterns corresponding to the two spoken sentences were obtained. Single-trial ECoG responses were subsequently classified according to their correlations with these two temporal activation patterns. On average 77.5% of the trials were correctly classified which was much higher than the chance-level performance of the SVM classifier without DTW. Our preliminary results shed light on the construction of cortical speech brain-computer interfaces on the sentence level.
