Rats distinguish objects differing in surface texture by actively moving their vibrissae. In this paper we characterized some aspects of texture sensing in anesthetized rats during active touch. We analyzed the multifiber discharge from a deep vibrissal nerve when the vibrissa sweeps materials wood metal acrylic sandpaper having different textures. We polished these surfaces with sandpaper P1000 to obtain close degrees of roughness and we induced vibrissal movement with two-branch facial nerve stimulation. We also consider the change in pressure against the vibrissa as a way to improve the tactile information acquisition. The signals were compared with a reference signal control--vibrissa sweeping the air--and were analyzed with the Root Mean Square RMS and the Power Spectrum Density PSD.
