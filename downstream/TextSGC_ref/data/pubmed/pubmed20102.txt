Heretofore "skill proficiency" in nursing techniques has only been developed through experience. To pass that technical proficiency down to later generations this study is intended to build a learning support system using virtual reality by reproducing finger movements used in practicing nursing techniques. For practicing blood drawing techniques we earlier developed a prototype system that uses a finger motion capture system to acquire finger position data when a syringe is grasped. It uses the acquired data to reproduce the process of the techniques three-dimensionally. This paper outlines the prototype system and reports its effectiveness for learning after examining results of a demonstration experiment for nursing students. Learning support system reproducing finger movements in practicing nursing techniques.
