With the use and adoption of computer-assisted laparoscopic technology gaining more prominence important issues pertaining to the learning process are raised. Several modalities can be incorporated into a training program for robotic surgical development. The role and utility of various methods including didactic instruction virtual reality simulators dry and wet laboratories bedside assistance mentoring as well as proctorship are still in the process of being assessed and validated. Integration of robotic training in residency and fellowship programs as well as the formation of a structured didactic robotic curriculum continues to be a challenge. Finally methods to assess competency of training and the process for credentialing robotic surgeons still require further structuring and codification.
