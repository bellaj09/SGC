"The loss of motor functions resulting from spinal cord injury can have devastating implications on the quality of ones life. Functional electrical stimulation has been used to help restore mobility however current functional electrical stimulation FES systems require residual movements to control stimulation patterns which may be unintuitive and not useful for individuals with higher level cervical injuries. Brain machine interfaces BMI offer a promising approach for controlling such systems; however they currently still require transcutaneous leads connecting indwelling electrodes to external recording devices. While several wireless BMI systems have been designed high signal bandwidth requirements limit clinical translation. Case Western Reserve University has developed an implantable modular FES system the Networked Neuroprosthesis NNP to perform combinations of myoelectric recording and neural stimulation for controlling motor functions. However currently the existing module capabilities are not sufficient for intracortical recordings." Design and testing of a 96-channel neural interface module for the Networked Neuroprosthesis system.
