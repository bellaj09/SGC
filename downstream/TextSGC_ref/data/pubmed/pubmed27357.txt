Brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI provide an important complement to other noninvasive BCIs. While fMRI has several disadvantages being nonportable methodologically challenging costly and noisy it is the only method providing high spatial resolution whole-brain coverage of brain activation. These properties allow relating mental activities to specific brain regions and networks providing a transparent scheme for BCI users to encode information and for real-time fMRI BCI systems to decode the intents of the user. Various mental activities have been used successfully in fMRI BCIs so far that can be classified into the four categories: a higher-order cognitive tasks e.g. mental calculation b covert language-related tasks e.g. mental speech and mental singing c imagery tasks motor visual auditory tactile and emotion imagery and d selective attention tasks visual auditory and tactile attention. While the ultimate spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI BCIs is limited by the physiologic properties of the hemodynamic response technical and analytical advances will likely lead to substantially improved fMRI BCIs in the future using for example decoding of imagined letter shapes at 7T as the basis for more "natural" communication BCIs. Real-time fMRI for brain-computer interfacing.
