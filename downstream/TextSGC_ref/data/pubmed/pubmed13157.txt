Reducing the exposure to X-ray radiation while maintaining a clinically acceptable image quality is desirable in various CT applications. To realize low-dose CT LdCT imaging model-based iterative reconstruction MBIR algorithms are widely adopted but they require proper prior knowledge assumptions in the sinogram and/or image domains and involve tedious manual optimization of multiple parameters. In this paper we propose a deep learning DL-based strategy for MBIR to simultaneously address prior knowledge design and MBIR parameter selection in one optimization framework. Specifically a parameterized plug-and-play alternating direction method of multipliers 3pADMM is proposed for the general penalized weighted least-squares model and then by adopting the basic idea of DL the parameterized plug-and-play 3p prior and the related parameters are optimized simultaneously in a single framework using a large number of training data. The main contribution of this paper is that the 3p prior and the related parameters in the proposed 3pADMM framework can be supervised and optimized simultaneously to achieve robust LdCT reconstruction performance. Experimental results obtained on clinical patient datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising gains over existing algorithms for LdCT image reconstruction in terms of noise-induced artifact suppression and edge detail preservation.
