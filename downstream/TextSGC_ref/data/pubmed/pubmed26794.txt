Brain-computer interfaces BCIs implemented with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging rt-fMRI use fMRI time-courses from predefined regions of interest ROIs. To reach best performances localizer experiments and on-site expert supervision are required for ROI definition. To automate this step we developed two unsupervised computational techniques based on the general linear model GLM and independent component analysis ICA of rt-fMRI data and compared their performances on a communication BCI.\u2002Approach. 3 T fMRI data of six volunteers were re-analyzed in simulated real-time. During a localizer run participants performed three mental tasks following visual cues. During two communication runs a letter-spelling display guided the subjects to freely encode letters by performing one of the mental tasks with a specific timing. GLM- and ICA-based procedures were used to decode each letter respectively using compact ROIs and whole-brain distributed spatio-temporal patterns of fMRI activity automatically defined from subject-specific or group-level maps. Automated selection of brain regions for real-time fMRI brain-computer interfaces.
