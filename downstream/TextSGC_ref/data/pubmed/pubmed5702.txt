The heart muscle pumps blood to vital organs which is indispensable for human life. Congestive heart failure CHF is characterized by the inability of the heart to pump blood adequately throughout the body without an increase in intracardiac pressure. The symptoms include lung and peripheral congestion leading to breathing difficulty and swollen limbs dizziness from reduced delivery of blood to the brain as well as arrhythmia. Coronary artery disease myocardial infarction and medical co-morbidities such as kidney disease diabetes and high blood pressure all take a toll on the heart and can impair myocardial function. CHF prevalence is growing worldwide. It afflicts millions of people globally and is a leading cause of death. Hence proper diagnosis monitoring and management are imperative. The importance of an objective CHF diagnostic tool cannot be overemphasized. Standard diagnostic tests for CHF include chest X-ray magnetic resonance imaging MRI nuclear imaging echocardiography and invasive angiography. However these methods are costly time-consuming and they can be operator-dependent. Electrocardiography ECG is inexpensive and widely accessible but ECG changes are typically not specific for CHF diagnosis. A properly designed computer-aided detection CAD system for CHF based on the ECG would potentially reduce subjectivity and provide quantitative assessment for informed decision-making. Herein we review existing CAD for automatic CHF diagnosis and highlight the development of an ECG-based CAD diagnostic system that employs deep learning algorithms to automatically detect CHF.
