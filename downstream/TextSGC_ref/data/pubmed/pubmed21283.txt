"EEG-based Brain-computer interfaces BCI are facing basic challenges in real-world applications. The technical difficulties in developing truly wearable BCI systems that are capable of making reliable real-time prediction of users cognitive states in dynamic real-life situations may seem almost insurmountable at times. Fortunately recent advances in miniature sensors wireless communication and distributed computing technologies offered promising ways to bridge these chasms. In this paper we report an attempt to develop a pervasive on-line EEG-BCI system using state-of-art technologies including multi-tier Fog and Cloud Computing semantic Linked Data search and adaptive prediction/classification models. To verify our approach we implement a pilot system by employing wireless dry-electrode EEG headsets and MEMS motion sensors as the front-end devices Android mobile phones as the personal user interfaces compact personal computers as the near-end Fog Servers and the computer clusters hosted by the Taiwan National Center for High-performance Computing NCHC as the far-end Cloud Servers. We succeeded in conducting synchronous multi-modal global data streaming in March and then running a multi-player on-line EEG-BCI game in September 2013. We are currently working with the ARL Translational Neuroscience Branch to use our system in real-life personal stress monitoring and the UCSD Movement Disorder Center to conduct in-home Parkinsons disease patient monitoring experiments. We shall proceed to develop the necessary BCI ontology and introduce automatic semantic annotation and progressive model refinement capability to our system."
