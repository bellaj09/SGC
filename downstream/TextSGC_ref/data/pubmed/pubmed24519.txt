Within the past decade there has been increasing interest in simulation-based devices for training and assessment of technical skills especially for minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions of senior and junior surgeons to virtual reality simulation within the context of current training opportunities for basic laparoscopic procedures. Training opportunities and the role of virtual reality simulation in acquisition of basic laparoscopic skills.
