The virtual reality environment can provide an immersive feeling as in the real word. So using virtual reality technology to construct realistic experimental scenarios the mechanism of cognitive processing in the human brain could be better studied. In this paper we have designed an experiment where through the presentation of traffic signs with correct or incorrect background colors in a virtual reality traffic environment and studied the cognitive processing in the human brain using event-related potential ERP method. The results showed that whether the background colors of traffic signs were correct or not the degrees of familiarity to these traffic signs in the human brain were similar and the degree of contrast between the background colors and foreground colors of traffic signs would influence the degree of difficulty in cognitive processing. The degree of complexity in contents of traffic signs appears related to the cognitive speed in the human brain. In sum simpler contents and larger contrast between the background colors and foreground colors of traffic signs would make the human brain respond faster.
