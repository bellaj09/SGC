Unilateral spatial neglect USN a highly prevalent and disabling post-stroke impairment has been shown to affect the recovery of locomotor and navigation skills needed for community mobility. We recently found that USN alters goal-directed locomotion in conditions of different cognitive/perceptual demands. However sensorimotor post-stroke dysfunction e.g. decreased walking speed could have influenced the results. Analogous to a previously used goal-directed locomotor paradigm a seated joystick-driven navigation experiment minimizing locomotor demands was employed in individuals with and without post-stroke USN USN+ and USN- respectively and healthy controls HC. Post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect: virtual reality-based navigation and detection tasks reveal lateralized and non-lateralized deficits in tasks of varying perceptual and cognitive demands.
