Unscheduled 30-day readmissions are a hallmark of Congestive Heart Failure CHF patients that pose significant health risks and escalate care cost. In order to reduce readmissions and curb the cost of care it is important to initiate targeted intervention programs for patients at risk of readmission. This requires identifying high-risk patients at the time of discharge from hospital. Here using real data from over 7500 CHF patients hospitalized between 2012 and 2016 in Sweden we built and tested a deep learning framework to predict 30-day unscheduled readmission. We present a cost-sensitive formulation of Long Short-Term Memory LSTM neural network using expert features and contextual embedding of clinical concepts. This study targets key elements of an Electronic Health Record EHR driven prediction model in a single framework: using both expert and machine derived features incorporating sequential patterns and addressing the class imbalance problem. We evaluate the contribution of each element towards prediction performance ROC-AUC F1-measure and cost-savings. We show that the model with all key elements achieves higher discrimination ability AUC: 0.77; F1: 0.51; Cost: 22% of maximum possible savings outperforming the reduced models in at least two evaluation metrics. Additionally we present a simple financial analysis to estimate annual savings if targeted interventions are offered to high risk patients.
