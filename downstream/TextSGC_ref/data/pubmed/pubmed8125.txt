Low-dose CT denoising is a challenging task that has been studied by many researchers. Some studies have used deep neural networks to improve the quality of low-dose CT images and achieved fruitful results. In this paper we propose a deep neural network that uses dilated convolutions with different dilation rates instead of standard convolution helping to capture more contextual information in fewer layers. Also we have employed residual learning by creating shortcut connections to transmit image information from the early layers to later ones. To further improve the performance of the network we have introduced a non-trainable edge detection layer that extracts edges in horizontal vertical and diagonal directions. Finally we demonstrate that optimizing the network by a combination of mean-square error loss and perceptual loss preserves many structural details in the CT image. This objective function does not suffer from over smoothing and blurring effects causing by per-pixel loss and grid-like artifacts resulting from perceptual loss. The experiments show that each modification to the network improves the outcome while changing the complexity of the network minimally.
