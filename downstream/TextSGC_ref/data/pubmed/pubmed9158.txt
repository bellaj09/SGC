Single-pixel imaging SPI has recently been intensively studied as an alternative to the traditional focal plane array FPA technology. However limited by the refresh rate of spatial light modulators SLM and inherent reconstruction mechanism SPI is inappropriate for high-speed moving targets. To break through this limitation we propose a novel SPI scheme for high-speed moving targets. In our scenario the spatial encoding for the target is done by the movement of the target relative to a static pseudo-random illumination pattern. In this process a series of single-pixel signals are generated that corresponds to the overlap between the target and certain parts of the illumination structure. This correspondence can be utilized for image reconstruction in the same way as normal SPI. In addition compressive sensing and deep learning algorithms are used for reconstruction respectively. Reasonable reconstructions can be obtained with a sampling ratio of only 6%. Experimental verification together with theoretical analysis has shown that our scheme is able to image high-speed moving targets that could be alternatively achieved by a fast FPA camera. Our scheme keeps the inherent advantages of SPI and meanwhile extend its application to moving targets. It is believed that this technology will have wide application in many situations.
