Physical motor exercise aided by an electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI is known to improve motor recovery in patients with stroke. In such a BCI paradigm event-related desynchronization ERD in the alpha and beta bands extracted from EEG recorded over the primary sensorimotor area SM1 is often used since ERD has been suggested to be associated with an increase of corticospinal excitability. Recently we demonstrated a novel online lock-in amplifier LIA algorithm to estimate the amplitude modulation of motor-related SM1 ERD. With this algorithm the delay time accuracy and stability to estimate motor-related SM1 ERD were significantly improved compared with the conventional fast Fourier transformation FFT algorithm. These technical improvements to extract an ERD trace imply a potential advantage for a better trace of the excitatory status of the SM1 in a BCI context. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the precision of LIA-based ERD tracking for estimation of corticospinal excitability using a transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS paradigm. Precise estimation of human corticospinal excitability associated with the levels of motor imagery-related EEG desynchronization extracted by a locked-in amplifier algorithm.
