We develop a biophysical model of neurosensory integration in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Building on experimental findings on the neuron conductances and their resolved connectome we posit the first full dynamic model of the neural voltage excitations that allows for a characterization of network structures which link input stimuli to neural proxies of behavioral responses. Full connectome simulations of neural responses to prescribed inputs show that robust low-dimensional bifurcation structures drive neural voltage activity modes. Comparison of these modes with experimental studies allows us to link these network structures to behavioral responses. Thus the underlying bifurcation structures discovered i.e. induced Hopf bifurcations are critical in explaining behavioral responses such as swimming and crawling.
