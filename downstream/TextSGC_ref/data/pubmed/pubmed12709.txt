Interactions between proteins and peptides influence biological functions. Predicting such bio-molecular interactions can lead to faster disease prevention and help in drug discovery. Experimental methods for determining protein-peptide binding sites are costly and time-consuming. Therefore computational methods have become prevalent. However existing models show extremely low detection rates of actual peptide binding sites in proteins. To address this problem we employed a two-stage technique - first we extracted the relevant features from protein sequences and transformed them into images applying a novel method and then we applied a convolutional neural network to identify the peptide binding sites in proteins.
