"Nursing educators engage in many practices and one of the most important is preceptorship. However evidence underpinning preceptorship is scant. Indeed some critics suggest that the planning delivery and evaluation of preceptorship programmes rarely involves the people they are designed to assist - namely students. This qualitative study part of a larger phenomenology of the experience of students and new graduates included the exploration and description of students experiences of preceptorship. Thirteen undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing students aged 20-50 years participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were collected at three intervals; prior to commencing employment as graduate nurses 1 and 6 months post-employment. Five key themes were revealed: confidence; friendship; being thrown in at the deep end; peer support; and lack of support. Application of the findings from this research may help to improve the preceptorship experience for future students and new graduates and to inform evidence-based preceptorship preparation." Lessons students and new graduates could teach: a phenomenological study that reveals insights on the essence of building a supportive learning culture through preceptorship.
