Automatic and reliable segmentation for geographic atrophy in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography SD-OCT images is a challenging task. To develop an effective segmentation method a two-stage deep learning framework based on an auto-encoder is proposed. Firstly the axial data of cross-section images were used as samples instead of the projection images of SD-OCT images. Next a two-stage learning model that includes offline-learning and self-learning was designed based on a stacked sparse auto-encoder to obtain deep discriminative representations. Finally a fusion strategy was used to refine the segmentation results based on the two-stage learning results. The proposed method was evaluated on two datasets consisting of 55 and 56 cubes respectively. For the first dataset our method obtained a mean overlap ratio OR of 89.85\u202f\u202f6.35% and an absolute area difference AAD of 4.79\u202f\u202f7.16%. For the second dataset the mean OR and AAD were 84.48\u202f\u202f11.98% 11.09\u202f\u202f13.61% respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate segmentation results on these two datasets without using retinal layer segmentation.
