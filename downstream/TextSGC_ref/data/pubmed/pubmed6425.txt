"Command-like descending neurons can induce many behaviors such as backward locomotion escape feeding courtship egg-laying or grooming we define command-like neuron as a neuron whose activation elicits or commands a specific behavior. In most animals it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here we use genetic screens intersectional genetics circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of Drosophila larval mooncrawler descending neurons MDNs with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly larval MDNs persist into adulthood where they can trigger backward walking. Thus MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals." MDN brain descending neurons coordinately activate backward and inhibit forward locomotion.
