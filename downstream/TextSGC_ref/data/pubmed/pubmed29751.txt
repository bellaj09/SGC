P300 spellers provide a means of communication for individuals with severe physical limitations especially those with locked-in syndrome such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However P300 speller use is still limited by relatively low communication rates due to the multiple data measurements that are required to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of event-related potentials for increased accuracy. Therefore the amount of data collection has competing effects on accuracy and spelling speed. Adaptively varying the amount of data collection prior to character selection has been shown to improve spelling accuracy and speed. The goal of this study was to optimize a previously developed dynamic stopping algorithm that uses a Bayesian approach to control data collection by incorporating a priori knowledge via a language model. Participants  n = 17 completed online spelling tasks using the dynamic stopping algorithm with and without a language model. The addition of the language model resulted in improved participant performance from a mean theoretical bit rate of 46.12 bits/min at 88.89% accuracy to 54.42 bits/min   at 90.36% accuracy. Utilizing a language model to improve online dynamic data collection in P300 spellers.
