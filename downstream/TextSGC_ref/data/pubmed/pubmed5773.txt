"Individual differences of brain changes of neural communication and integration in the modular architecture of the human brain network exist for the repeated migraine attack and physical or psychological stressors. However whether the interindividual variability in the migraine brain connectome predicts placebo response to placebo treatment is still unclear. Using DTI and graph theory approaches we systematically investigated the topological organization of white matter networks in 71 patients with migraine without aura MO and 50 matched healthy controls at three levels: global network measure nodal efficiency and nodal intramodule/intermodule efficiency. All patients participated in an 8-week sham acupuncture treatment to induce analgesia. In our results 30% n\u2009=\u200921 of patients had 50% change in migraine days from baseline after placebo treatment. At baseline abnormal increased network integration was found in MO patients as compared with the HC group and the increased global efficiency before starting clinical treatment was associated with their following placebo response. For nodal efficiency significantly increased within-subnetwork nodal efficiency and intersubnetwork connectivity of the hippocampus and middle frontal gyrus in patients white matter network were correlated with the responses of follow-up placebo treatment. Our findings suggested that the trait-like individual differences in pain-related maladaptive stress interfered with and diminished the capacity of chronic pain modulation differently and the placebo response for treatment could be predicted from a prior white matter network modular structure in migraineurs.
