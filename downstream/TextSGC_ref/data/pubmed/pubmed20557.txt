"Recently it has been suggested that nurses can perform diagnostic endoscopy procedures which traditionally have been a physicians responsibility. The existing studies concerning quality of sigmoidoscopy performed by nurses are small used assessment tools with insufficient validation and to date there is very little knowledge of the learning curve patterns for physicians and nurses. The aim of a present study was to assess early learning curves on a virtual-reality colonoscopy simulator of untrained residents as compared with that of nurses with and without endoscopy assistance experience." Assessment of early learning curves among nurses and physicians using a high-fidelity virtual-reality colonoscopy simulator.
