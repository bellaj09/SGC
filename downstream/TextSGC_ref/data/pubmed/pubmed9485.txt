Sample balancing includes sample selection and sample reweighting. Sample selection aims to remove some bad samples that may lead to bad local optima. Sample reweighting aims to assign optimal weights to samples to improve performance. In this article we integrate a sample selection method based on self-paced learning into deep learning frameworks and study the influence of different sample selection strategies on training deep networks. In addition most of the existing sample reweighting methods mainly take per-class sample number as a metric which does not fully consider sample qualities. To improve the performance we propose a novel metric based on the multiview semantic encoders to reweight the samples more appropriately. Then we propose an optimization mechanism to embed sample weights into loss functions of deep networks which can be trained in end-to-end manners. We conduct experiments on the CIFAR data set and the ImageNet data set. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed sample balancing method can improve the performances of deep learning methods in several visual recognition tasks.
