"For brain-computer interfaces BCIs which provide the user continuous position control there is little standardization of performance metrics or evaluative tasks. One candidate metric is Fittss law which has been used to describe aimed movements across a range of computer interfaces and has recently been applied to BCI tasks. Reviewing selected studies we identify two basic problems with Fittss law: its predictive performance is fragile and the estimation of information transfer rate from the model is unsupported. Our main contribution is the adaptation and validation of an alternative model to Fittss law in the BCI context. We show that the Shannon-Welford model outperforms Fittss law showing robust predictive power when target distance and width have disproportionate effects on difficulty. Building on a prior study of the Shannon-Welford model we show that identified model parameters offer a novel approach to quantitatively assess the role of control-display gain in speed/accuracy performance tradeoffs during brain control."
