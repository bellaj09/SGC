In this supplement we show a comprehensive anatomic atlas of the human cerebrum demonstrating all 180 distinct regions comprising the cerebral cortex. The location functional connectivity and structural connectivity of these regions are outlined and where possible a discussion is included of the functional significance of these areas. In this chapter we specifically address regions integrating to form the vertical occipital fasciculus.
