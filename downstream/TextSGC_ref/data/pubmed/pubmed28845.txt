Brain-computer interfaces BCI use electroencephalography EEG to interpret user intention and control an output device accordingly. We describe a novel BCI method to use a signal from five EEG channels comprising one primary channel with four additional channels used to calculate its Laplacian derivation to provide two-dimensional 2-D control of a cursor on a computer screen with simple threshold-based binary classification of band power readings taken over pre-defined time windows during subject hand movement. A binary method for simple and accurate two-dimensional cursor control from EEG with minimal subject training.
