This study proposes a novel adaptive mesh expansion model AMEM for liver segmentation from computed tomography images. The virtual deformable simplex model DSM is introduced to represent the mesh in which the motion of each vertex can be easily manipulated. The balloon edge and gradient forces are combined with the binary image to construct the external force of the deformable model which can rapidly drive the DSM to approach the target liver boundaries. Moreover tangential and normal forces are combined with the gradient image to control the internal force such that the DSM degree of smoothness can be precisely controlled. The triangular facet of the DSM is adaptively decomposed into smaller triangular components which can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy of the irregularly sharp corners of the liver. The proposed method is evaluated on the basis of different criteria applied to 10 clinical data sets. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AMEM algorithm is effective and robust and thus outperforms six other up-to-date algorithms. Moreover AMEM can achieve a mean overlap error of 6.8% and a mean volume difference of 2.7% whereas the average symmetric surface distance and the root mean square symmetric surface distance can reach 1.3 mm and 2.7 mm respectively.
