This project enabled novel organisational insight into the comparative utility of a portfolio of consumer health information content by measuring patterns of attrition abandonment in content use. The project used as a case study the event activity log of a fully automated digital information kiosk located in a community health facility. Direct measurements of the duration of content use were derived from the user interface activity recorded in the kiosk log thus avoiding issues in using other approaches to collecting this type of data such as sampling and observer bias. The distribution patterns of 1383 durations of observed abandonments of use for twenty-eight discrete modules of health information content were visualised using Kaplan-Meir survival plots. Clear patterns of abandonment of content use were exhibited. The method of analysis is cost-effective scalable and provides deep insight into the utility of health promotion content. The impact on the content producers platform operators and service users is to improve organisational learning and thus increase the confidence in stakeholders that the service is continuously delivering high quality health and wellbeing benefits.
