"Random forests RF have long been a widely popular method in medical image analysis. Meanwhile the closely related gradient boosted trees GBT have not become a mainstream tool in medical imaging despite their attractive performance perhaps due to their computational cost. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of an efficient open-source GBT implementation to illustrate the GBT method in a corrective learning framework in application to the segmentation of the caudate nucleus putamen and hippocampus. The size and shape of these structures are used to derive important biomarkers in many neurological and psychiatric conditions. However the large variability in deep gray matter appearance makes their automated segmentation from MRI scans a challenging task. We propose using GBT to improve existing segmentation methods. We begin with an existing host segmentation method to create an estimate surface. Based on this estimate a surface-based sampling scheme is used to construct a set of candidate locations. GBT models are trained on features derived from the candidate locations including spatial coordinates image intensity texture and gradient magnitude. The classification probabilities from the GBT models are used to calculate a final surface estimate. The method is evaluated on a public dataset with a 2-fold cross-validation. We use a multi-atlas approach and FreeSurfer as host segmentation methods. The mean reduction in surface distance error metric for FreeSurfer was 0.2 - 0.3 mm whereas for multi-atlas segmentation it was 0.1mm for each of caudate putamen and hippocampus. Importantly our approach outperformed an RF model trained on the same features p < 0.05 on all measures. Our method is readily generalizable and can be applied to a wide range of medical image segmentation problems and allows any segmentation method to be used as input."
