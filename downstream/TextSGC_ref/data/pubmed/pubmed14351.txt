Pathogenesis-based diagnosis is a key step to prevent and control lumbar neural foraminal stenosis LNFS. It conducts both early diagnosis and comprehensive assessment by drawing crucial pathological links between pathogenic factors and LNFS. Automated pathogenesis-based diagnosis would simultaneously localize and grade multiple spinal organs neural foramina vertebrae intervertebral discs to diagnose LNFS and discover pathogenic factors. The automated way facilitates planning optimal therapeutic schedules and relieving clinicians from laborious workloads. However no successful work has been achieved yet due to its extreme challenges since 1 multiple targets: each lumbar spine has at least 17 target organs 2 multiple scales: each type of target organ has structural complexity and various scales across subjects and 3 multiple tasks i.e. simultaneous localization and diagnosis of all lumbar organs are extremely difficult than individual tasks. To address these huge challenges we propose a deep multiscale multitask learning network DMML-Net integrating a multiscale multi-output learning and a multitask regression learning into a fully convolutional network. 1 DMML-Net merges semantic representations to reinforce the salience of numerous target organs. 2 DMML-Net extends multiscale convolutional layers as multiple output layers to boost the scale-invariance for various organs. 3 DMML-Net joins a multitask regression module and a multitask loss module to prompt the mutual benefit between tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DMML-Net achieves high performance 0.845 mean average precision on T1/T2-weighted MRI scans from 200 subjects. This endows our method an efficient tool for clinical LNFS diagnosis. Automated Pathogenesis-Based Diagnosis of Lumbar Neural Foraminal Stenosis via Deep Multiscale Multitask Learning.
