For each brain-computer interface system efficiency is a key issue that considers both accuracy and speed. The P300 spellers built upon oddball paradigm are usually less efficient due to the repetitive stimulation of multiple characters for reliable detection. In this paper based on the online EEG signal we propose an interactive paradigm for P300 speller to improve its efficiency primarily focusing within the single characterP300 paradigm. Specifically after each stimulation we first evaluate the posterior probability of each character in the stimuli set to be the target. The lowprobability characters are then removed fromthe stimuli set in the subsequent rounds as character flash continues until the probability of any character surpasses a predefined threshold. Then the character is selected as the target and data collection for the trial terminates. By reducing stimulus sequence characters the system efficiency can be substantially improved. The spelling accuracy is insignificantly affected as the characters being removed have low probability to be the target. The online experimental results from a total of eight subjects show that an average practical information transfer rate of 50.26 bits/min i.e. 9.07 characters/min has been achieved with 91% average spelling accuracy rate.
