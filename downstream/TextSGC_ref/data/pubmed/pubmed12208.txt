In this paper we present a new deep learning model to classify hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes normal tissues benign lesions in situ carcinomas and invasive carcinomas. Our model uses a parallel structure consist of a convolutional neural network CNN and a recurrent neural network RNN for image feature extraction which is greatly different from the common existed serial method of extracting image features by CNN and then inputting them into RNN. Then we introduce a special perceptron attention mechanism which is derived from the natural language processing NLP field to unify the features extracted by the two different neural network structures of the model. In the convolution layer general batch normalization is replaced by the new switchable normalization method. And the latest regularization technology targeted dropout is used to substitute for the general dropout in the last three fully connected layers of the model. In the testing phase we use the model fusion method and test time augmentation technology on three different datasets of hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast biopsy images. The results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
