Main tendencies in studying of human and animals auditory system with psychoacoustical and electrophysiologycal methods are considered. Concerning psychoacoustical studies some basic data are presented as well as contemporary tendencies in hearing physiology in analysis of the intensity frequency temporal characteristics of the sound signals and data related to such phenomena as masking and adaptation. Data concerning directional hearing are presented in detail as a basis of auditory virtual reality. In electrophysiological studies of the auditory system detailed analysis of mapping in auditory centers and mechanisms concerning localization of unmoved and moving auditory stimuli was performed. Special attempt was paid to consider the reflection of different types of auditory signals in human evoked potentials. Tendencies in auditory physiology.
