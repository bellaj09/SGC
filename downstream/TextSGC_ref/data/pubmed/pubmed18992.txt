Rheumatoid arthritis RA affects around 1% of the population which places a heavy burden on society and has severe consequences for the individuals affected. The early diagnosis and implementation of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs significantly increase the chance of achieving long-term sustained remission. Therefore raising awareness of RA amongst the general public is important in order to decrease the time of diagnosis of the disease. Augmented reality AR can be tremendously valuable in a teaching and learning context as the coexistence of real and virtual objects aids learners in understanding abstract ideas and complicated spatial relationships. It has also been suggested that it raises motivation in users through interactivity and novelty. In this chapter we explore the use AR in public engagement and detail the design development and evaluation of a blended learning experience utilising AR. A set of informative printed posters was produced enhanced by an accompanying interactive AR application. The main user testing was conducted with 27 participants at a science outreach event at the Glasgow Science Centre. Findings report mean positive attitudes regarding all aspects of the study highlighting the potential of AR for public engagement with topics such as RA.
