Common Spectral Pattern CSP algorithm remains predominant for feature extraction from multichannel EEG motor imagery data. However multiclass classification of from this featureset has been a challenging job. Different approaches have been proposed to be applied on featureset of different EEG subbands to achieve significant classification accuracy. Ensemble learning is very effective in this context to achieve higher accuracy in Brain-Computer Interface BCI domain. In this study we have proposed enhanced classification algorithms to achieve higher classification accuracies. The methods were evaluated against the motor imagery data from Dataset 2a of the publicly available BCI Competition IV 2008. This dataset consists of 22 channels EEG data of 9 subjects for four different movements. A tree based ensemble approach for supervised classification Extra-Trees algorithm has been proposed in this paper and also evaluated for its efficacy on this dataset to classify between left hand and right hand movement imaginations. Moreover this classifier has its inherent capability to select optimum features. Furthermore in this paper an extension of the binary classification into multiclass domain is also implemented with error correcting output codes ECOC approach using the same dataset. Subject-specific frequency bands $\\alpha$ 8-12Hz and $\\beta$ 12-30Hz along with $HG$ 70-100Hz were considered to extract CSP features. We have achieved an individual peak accuracy of 98 and 84 in binary class and multiclass classification respectively. Furthermore the results yielded a mean kappa value of 0.58 across all the subjects. This kappa value is higher than of the winner of competition and also from the most of the other approaches applied in this dataset.
