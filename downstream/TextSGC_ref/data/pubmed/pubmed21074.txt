Event-related potential ERP-based brain- computer interfacing BCI is an effective communication method. However calibration itself can be unintuitive and tedious for users. The no-calibration Subject Independent Brain Computer Interface SIBCI is a popular solution to the lengthy calibration. Researches have proved the subject independent model is efficient in some P300 spellers but it is still need to be explored whether the subject independent model works when the flash durations FDs and the inter stimulus intervals ISIs are changed in a P300 speller. This study introduces a subject independent dynamical stopping model SIDSM which based on a subject independent model to dynamically stop the data collection process. The performance of the SIDSM is studied by modifying the FDs and ISIs in online experiments for 8 subjects. Results showed the SIDSM has an average accuracy of 92.45% for different settings. This research proved that the SIDSM is very robust to different stimulus parameters as good performance is observed across all experimental sessions. Does A Subject Independent Dynamic Stopping Model for P300 Speller Work on Different Flash Durations and Inter Stimulus Intervals?
