Detecting the early signs of diabetic retinopathy DR is essential as timely treatment might reduce or even prevent vision loss. Moreover automatically localizing the regions of the retinal image that might contain lesions can favorably assist specialists in the task of detection. In this study we designed a lesion localization model using a deep network patch-based approach. Our goal was to reduce the complexity of the model while improving its performance. For this purpose we designed an efficient procedure including two convolutional neural network models for selecting the training patches such that the challenging examples would be given special attention during the training process. Using the labeling of the region a DR decision can be given to the initial image without the need for special training. The model is trained on the Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database Calibration Level 1 DIARETDB1 database and is tested on several databases including Messidor without any further adaptation. It reaches an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.912-95%CI0.897-0.928 for DR screening and a sensitivity of 0.940-95%CI0.921-0.959. These values are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches. Diabetic retinopathy detection using red lesion localization and convolutional neural networks.
