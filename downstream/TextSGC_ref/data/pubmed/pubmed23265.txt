Technologies controlled directly by the brain are being developed evolving based on insights gained from neuroscience and rehabilitative medicine. Besides neuro-controlled prosthetics aimed at restoring function lost somehow technologies controlled via brain-computer interfaces BCIs may also extend a user\s horizon of action freed from the need for bodily movement. Whilst BCI-mediated action ought to be on the whole treated as conventional action law and policy ought to be amended to accommodate BCI action by broadening the definition of action as "willed bodily movement". Moreover there are some dimensions of BCI mediated action that are significantly different to conventional cases. These relate to control. Specifically to limits in both controllability of BCIs via neural states and in foreseeability of outcomes from such actions. In some specific type of case BCI-mediated action may be due to different ethical evaluation from conventional action. When Thinking is Doing: Responsibility for BCI-Mediated Action.
