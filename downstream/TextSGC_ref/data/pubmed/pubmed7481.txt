White matter hyperintensities WMHs are foci of abnormal signal intensity in white matter regions seen with magnetic resonance imaging MRI. WMHs are associated with normal ageing and have shown prognostic value in neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury TBI. The impracticality of manually quantifying these lesions limits their clinical utility and motivates the utilization of machine learning techniques for automated segmentation workflows. Supervised learning technique for the automated identification of white matter hyperintensities in traumatic brain injury.
