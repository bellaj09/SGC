In this study the effects of virtual reality exposure therapy VRET were investigated in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. The level of presence in VRET was compared between using either a head-mounted display HMD or a computer automatic virtual environment CAVE. Results indicate that there was no relationship between the level of experienced presence and treatment outcome. Analyses indicate that VRET in general was more effective than no treatment. No differences in effectiveness were found between VRET using an HMD or CAVE.
