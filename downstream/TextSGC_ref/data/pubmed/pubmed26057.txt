Brain-computer interfaces based on steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP-BCIs achieve the highest performance due to their multiclass nature in paradigms in which different visual stimuli are shown. Studies of independent binary SSVEP-BCIs have been previously presented in which it was not necessary to gaze at the stimuli at the cost of performance. Despite that the energy of the SSVEPs is largely affected by the temporal and spatial frequencies of the stimulus there are no studies in the BCI literature about its combined impact on the final performance of SSVEP-BCIs. The objective of this study is to present an experiment that evaluates the best configuration of the visual stimulus for each subject thus minimizing the decline in performance of independent binary SSVEP-BCIs. Customized stimulation enhances performance of independent binary SSVEP-BCIs.
