Simultaneous multislice SMS imaging can be used to decrease the time between acquisition of fMRI volumes which can increase sensitivity by facilitating the removal of higher-frequency artifacts and boosting effective sample size. The technique requires an additional processing step in which the slices are separated or unaliased to recover the whole brain volume. However this may result in signal "leakage" between aliased locations i.e. slice "leakage" and lead to spurious activation decreased specificity. SMS can also lead to noise amplification which can reduce the benefits of decreased repetition time. In this study we evaluate the original slice-GRAPPA no leak block reconstruction algorithm and acceleration factor AF\u202f=\u202f8 used in the fMRI data in the young adult Human Connectome Project HCP. We also evaluate split slice-GRAPPA leak block which can reduce slice leakage. We use simulations to disentangle higher test statistics into true positives sensitivity and false positives decreased specificity. Slice leakage was greatly decreased by split slice-GRAPPA. Noise amplification was decreased by using moderate acceleration factors AF\u202f=\u202f4. We examined slice leakage in unprocessed fMRI motor task data from the HCP. When data were smoothed we found evidence of slice leakage in some but not all subjects. We also found evidence of SMS noise amplification in unprocessed task and processed resting-state HCP data.
