Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD is a common disorder that emerges in school-age children. The diagnostic model based on neuroimaging features could be beneficial for ADHD in twofold: identifying individuals with ADHD and discovering the discriminative patterns for patients. The dynamic functional connectivity of ADHD remains unclear. Towards this end 100 children with ADHD and 140 normal controls were obtained from the ADHD-200 Consortium. The raw features were derived from the temporal variability between intrinsic connectivity networks ICNs as well as the demographic and covariate variables. The diagnostic model was based on the support vector machines SVMs. The performance of diagnostic model was analyzed using leave-one-out cross-validation LOOCV and 10-folds cross-validations CVs. The diagnostic model based on inter-ICN variability outperformed that based on inter-ICN functional connectivity and inter-ICN phase synchrony. The LOOCV achieved total accuracy of 78.75% the sensitivity of 76% and the specificity of 80.71%. The 10-folds CVs achieved average prediction accuracy of 75.54%\u2009\u20091.34% average sensitivity of 70.5%\u2009\u20092.34% and average specificity of 77.44%\u2009\u20091.47%. In addition the discriminative patterns for ADHD were discovered using SVMs. The discriminative patterns confirmed with previous findings. In summary individuals with ADHD could be identified through inter-ICN variability which could be potential biomarkers for diagnostic model of ADHD. Identifying individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on temporal variability of dynamic functional connectivity.
