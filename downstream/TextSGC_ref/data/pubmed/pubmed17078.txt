"Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions EFs in Parkinsons Disease PD may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment PD-MCI with PD patients with normal cognition PD-NC and a control group CG using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test VMET a virtual reality VR-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups."
