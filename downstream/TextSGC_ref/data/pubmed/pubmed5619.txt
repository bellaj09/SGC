We aimed to extend our knowledge on the relationship between physical fitness PF and both white matter microstructure and cognition through in-depth investigation of various cognitive domains while accounting for potentially relevant nuisance covariates in a well-powered sample. To this end associations between walking endurance diffusion-tensor-imaging DTI based measures of fractional anisotropy FA within brain white matter and cognitive measures included in the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery were investigated in a sample of n\u2009=\u20091206 healthy young adults mean age\u2009=\u200928.8; 45.5% male as part of the human connectome project. Higher levels of endurance were associated with widespread higher FA pFWE\u2009<\u20090.05 as well as with enhanced global cognitive function p\u2009<\u20090.001. Significant positive relationships between endurance and cognitive performance were similarly found for almost all cognitive domains. Higher FA was significantly associated with enhanced global cognitive function p\u2009<\u20090.001 and FA was shown to significantly mediate the association between walking endurance and cognitive performance. Inclusion of potentially relevant nuisance covariates including gender age education BMI HBA1c and arterial blood pressure did not change the overall pattern of results. These findings support the notion of a beneficial and potentially protective effect of PF on brain structure and cognition. White matter microstructure mediates the association between physical fitness and cognition in healthy young adults.
