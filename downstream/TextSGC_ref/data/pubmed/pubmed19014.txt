In comparison to batteries of standard neuropsychological tests cognitive neuroscience tests may offer a more specific assessment of discrete neurobiological processes that may be aberrant in schizophrenia. However more information regarding psychometric properties and correlations with standard neuropsychological tests and functional measures is warranted to establish their validity as treatment outcome measures. The N-back and AX-Continuous Performance Task AX-CPT are two promising cognitive neuroscience tests designed to measure specific components of working memory and contextual processing respectively. In the current study we report the psychometric properties of multiple outcome measures from these two tests as well as their correlations with standard neuropsychological measures and functional capacity measures. The results suggest that while the AX-CPT and N-back display favorable psychometric properties they do not exhibit greater sensitivity or specificity with functional measures than standard neurocognitive tests.
