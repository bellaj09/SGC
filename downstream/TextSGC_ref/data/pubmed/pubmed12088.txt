Nuclear segmentation is an important step for profiling aberrant regions of histology sections. If nuclear segmentation can be resolved then new biomarkers of nuclear phenotypes and their organization can be predicted for the application of precision medicine. However segmentation is a complex problem as a result of variations in nuclear geometry e.g. size shape nuclear type e.g. epithelial fibroblast nuclear phenotypes e.g. vesicular aneuploidy and overlapping nuclei. The problem is further complicated as a result of variations in sample preparation e.g. fixation staining. Our hypothesis is that i deep learning techniques can learn complex phenotypic signatures that rise in tumor sections and ii fusion of different representations e.g. regions boundaries contributes to improved nuclear segmentation. Fusion of encoder-decoder deep networks improves delineation of multiple nuclear phenotypes.
