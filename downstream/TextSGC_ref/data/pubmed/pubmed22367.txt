"To develop subject-specific classifier to recognize mental states fast and reliably is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces BCI particularly in practical real-time applications such as wheelchair or neuroprosthetic control. In this paper a sequential decision-making strategy is explored in conjunction with an optimal wavelet analysis for EEG classification. The subject-specific wavelet parameters based on a grid-search method were first developed to determine evidence accumulative curve for the sequential classifier. Then we proposed a new method to set the two constrained thresholds in the sequential probability ratio test SPRT based on the cumulative curve and a desired expected stopping time. As a result it balanced the decision time of each class and we term it balanced threshold SPRT BTSPRT. The properties of the method were illustrated on 14 subjects recordings from offline and online tests. Results showed the average maximum accuracy of the proposed method to be 83.4% and the average decision time of 2.77Formula: see texts when compared with 79.2% accuracy and a decision time of 3.01Formula: see texts for the sequential Bayesian SB method. The BTSPRT method not only improves the classification accuracy and decision speed comparing with the other nonsequential or SB methods but also provides an explicit relationship between stopping time thresholds and error which is important for balancing the speed-accuracy tradeoff. These results suggest that BTSPRT would be useful in explicitly adjusting the tradeoff between rapid decision-making and error-free device control."
