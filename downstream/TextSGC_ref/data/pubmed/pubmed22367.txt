Around three years ago in the special issue on augmented and virtual reality in rehabilitation the topics of simulator sickness was briefly discussed in relation to vestibular rehabilitation. Simulator sickness with virtual reality applications have also been referred to as visually induced motion sickness or cybersickness. Recently study on cybersickness has been reported in entertainment training game and medical environment in several journals. Virtual stimuli can enlarge sensation of presence but they sometimes also evoke unpleasant sensation. In order to safely apply augmented and virtual reality for long-term rehabilitation treatment sensation of presence and cybersickness should be appropriately controlled. This issue presents the results of five studies conducted to evaluate visually-induced effects and speculate influences of virtual rehabilitation. In particular the influence of visual and vestibular stimuli on cardiovascular responses are reported in terms of academic contribution. Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation.
