Advances in computer technology have permitted development of virtual reality images of the tracheobronchial tree using data sets derived from helical CT of the chest. To determine the relevance of these images to actual bronchoscopic findings we compared "virtual bronchoscopy" images with videotaped bronchoscopy results in 20 patients who had undergone both helical chest CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy during clinical evaluation of their thoracic problems. Suboptimal endobronchial simulations in ten patients identified important readily-addressed technical requirements for this imaging procedure. In the ten patients with technically suitable renderings of the airway virtual bronchoscopy simulations accurately demonstrated endobronchial obstructions by tumor in five airway distortion and/or ectasia in four and accessory bronchi in another. These preliminary observations suggest that virtual bronchoscopy simulations accurately represent major endobronchial anatomic findings. This technique may have a role in prebronchoscopy planning endoscopy training and/or endobronchial therapy and merits further study. Virtual bronchoscopy.
