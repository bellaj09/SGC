Several brain regions are important for processing self-location and first-person perspective two important aspects of bodily self-consciousness. However the interplay between these regions has not been clarified. In addition while self-location and first-person perspective in healthy subjects are associated with bilateral activity in temporoparietal junction TPJ disturbed self-location and first-person perspective result from damage of only the right TPJ. Identifying the involved brain network and understanding the role of hemispheric specializations in encoding self-location and first-person perspective will provide important information on system-level interactions neurally mediating bodily self-consciousness. Here we used functional connectivity and showed that right and left TPJ are bilaterally connected to supplementary motor area ventral premotor cortex insula intraparietal sulcus and occipitotemporal cortex. Furthermore the functional connectivity between right TPJ and right insula had the highest selectivity for changes in self-location and first-person perspective. Finally functional connectivity revealed hemispheric differences showing that self-location and first-person perspective modulated the connectivity between right TPJ right posterior insula and right supplementary motor area and between left TPJ and right anterior insula. The present data extend previous evidence on healthy populations and clinical observations in neurological deficits supporting a bilateral but right-hemispheric dominant network for bodily self-consciousness.
