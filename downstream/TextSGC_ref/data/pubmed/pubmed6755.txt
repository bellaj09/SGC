Very little is known regarding whether structural hubs of human brain networks that enable efficient information communication may be classified into different categories. Using three multimodal neuroimaging data sets we construct individual structural brain networks and further identify hub regions based on eight widely used graph-nodal metrics followed by comprehensive characteristics and reproducibility analyses. We show the three categories of structural hubs in the brain network namely aggregated distributed and connector hubs. Spatially these distinct categories of hubs are primarily located in the default-mode system and additionally in the visual and limbic systems for aggregated hubs in the frontoparietal system for distributed hubs and in the sensorimotor and ventral attention systems for connector hubs. These categorized hubs exhibit various distinct characteristics to support their differentiated roles involving microstructural organization wiring costs topological vulnerability functional modular integration and cognitive flexibility; moreover these characteristics are better in the hubs than nonhubs. Finally all three categories of hubs display high across-session spatial similarities and act as structural fingerprints with high predictive rates 100% 100% and 84.2% for individual identification. Collectively we highlight three categories of brain hubs with differential microstructural functional and cognitive associations which shed light on topological mechanisms of the human connectome. Differentially categorized structural brain hubs are involved in different microstructural functional and cognitive characteristics and contribute to individual identification.
