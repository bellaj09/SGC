Accurate identification of ligand-binding pockets in a protein is important for structure-based drug design. In recent years several deep learning models were developed to learn important physical-chemical and spatial information to predict ligand-binding pockets in a protein. However ranking the native ligand binding pockets from a pool of predicted pockets is still a hard task for computational molecular biologists using a single web-based tool. Hence we believe by using closer to real application data set as training and by providing ligand information an enhanced model to identify accurate pockets can be obtained. In this article we propose a new deep learning method called DeepBindPoc for identifying and ranking ligand-binding pockets in proteins. The model is built by using information about the binding pocket and associated ligand. We take advantage of the mol2vec tool to represent both the given ligand and pocket as vectors to construct a densely fully connected layer model. During the training important features for pocket-ligand binding are automatically extracted and high-level information is preserved appropriately. DeepBindPoc demonstrated a strong complementary advantage for the detection of native-like pockets when combined with traditional popular methods such as fpocket and P2Rank. The proposed method is extensively tested and validated with standard procedures on multiple datasets including a dataset with G-protein Coupled receptors. The systematic testing and validation of our method suggest that DeepBindPoc is a valuable tool to rank near-native pockets for theoretically modeled protein with unknown experimental active site but have known ligand. The DeepBindPoc model described in this article is available at GitHub https://github.com/haiping1010/DeepBindPoc and the webserver is available at http://cbblab.siat.ac.cn/DeepBindPoc/index.php.
