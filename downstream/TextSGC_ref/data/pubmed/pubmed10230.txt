Acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusions LVOs requires emergent detection and treatment by endovascular thrombectomy. However radiologic LVO detection and treatment is subject to variable delays and human expertise resulting in morbidity. Imaging software using artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML a branch of AI may improve rapid frontline detection of LVO strokes. This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage and characterizes LVO detection software. Artificial intelligence to diagnose ischemic stroke and identify large vessel occlusions: a systematic review.
