The objective of this work is to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The presented system integrates both clinical biomarkers prostate-specific antigen and extracted features from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging collected at multiple b values. The presented system performs 3 major processing steps. First prostate delineation using a hybrid approach that combines a level-set model with nonnegative matrix factorization. Second estimation and normalization of diffusion parameters which are the apparent diffusion coefficients of the delineated prostate volumes at different b values followed by refinement of those apparent diffusion coefficients using a generalized Gaussian Markov random field model. Then construction of the cumulative distribution functions of the processed apparent diffusion coefficients at multiple b values. In parallel a K-nearest neighbor classifier is employed to transform the prostate-specific antigen results into diagnostic probabilities. Finally those prostate-specific antigen-based probabilities are integrated with the initial diagnostic probabilities obtained using stacked nonnegativity constraint sparse autoencoders that employ apparent diffusion coefficient-cumulative distribution functions for better diagnostic accuracy. Experiments conducted on 18 diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data sets achieved 94.4% diagnosis accuracy sensitivity = 88.9% and specificity = 100% which indicate the promising results of the presented computer-aided diagnostic system.
