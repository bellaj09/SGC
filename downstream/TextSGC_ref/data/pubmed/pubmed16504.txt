Virtual training environments are used when training in reality is challenging because of the high costs danger time or effort involved. In this paper we argue for a theory-driven development of such environments with the aim of connecting theory to practice and ensuring that the training provided fits the needs of the trained persons and their organisations. As an example we describe the development of VirtualPolice ViPOL a training environment for police officers in a federal state of Germany. We provided the theoretical foundation for ViPOL concerning the feeling of being present social context learning motivation and perspective-taking. We developed a framework to put theory into practice. To evaluate our framework we interviewed the stakeholders of ViPOL and surveyed current challenges and limitations of virtual training. The results led to a review of a theory-into-practice framework which is presented in the conclusion. Training in virtual environments: putting theory into practice.
