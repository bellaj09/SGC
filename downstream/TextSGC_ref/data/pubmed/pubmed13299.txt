Though Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR Automatic Target Recognition ATR via Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs has made huge progress toward deep learning some key issues still remain unsolved due to the lack of sufficient samples and robust model. In this paper we proposed an efficient transferred Max-Slice CNN MS-CNN with L2-Regularization for SAR ATR which could enrich the features and recognize the targets with superior performance. Firstly the data amplification method is presented to reduce the computational time and enrich the raw features of SAR targets. Secondly the proposed MS-CNN framework with L2-Regularization is trained to extract robust features in which the L2-Regularization is incorporated to avoid the overfitting phenomenon and further optimizing our proposed model. Thirdly transfer learning is introduced to enhance the feature representation and discrimination which could boost the performance and robustness of the proposed model on small samples. Finally various activation functions and dropout strategies are evaluated for further improving recognition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method could not only outperform other state-of-the-art methods on the public and extended MSTAR dataset but also obtain good performance on the random small datasets.
