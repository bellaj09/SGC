"Impaired self-regulation i.e. dysregulation in affective behavioral and cognitive control is commonly present in young people with autism spectrum disorder ASD. However little is known about what is happening in peoples brains when self-regulation is impaired in young people with ASD. We used a technique called functional MRI which measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow at a resting state when participants are not asked to do anything to research this in intellectually able young people with ASD. We found that brains with more connections especially between regions involved in sensorimotor processing and regions involved in the processes that enable peoples to focus their attention on the most pertinent features from the sensory environment salience processing were related to more impaired self-regulation in young people with and without ASD. We also found that impaired self-regulation was related to increased communication within the brain system involved in voluntary orienting attention to a sensory cue the dorsal attention network in young people with ASD. These results highlight how different people have different degrees of dysregulation which has been largely overlooked in the earlier brain imaging reports on ASD. This might contribute to understanding some of the inconsistencies in the existing published literature on this topic."
