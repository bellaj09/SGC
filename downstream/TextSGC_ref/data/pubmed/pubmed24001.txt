Smart homes have been an active area of research however despite considerable investment they are not yet a reality for end-users. Moreover there are still accessibility challenges for the elderly or the disabled two of the main potential targets for home automation. In this exploratory study we design a control mechanism for smart homes based on Brain Computer Interfaces BCI and apply it in the "Domus" smart home platform in order to evaluate the potential interest of users about BCIs at home. We enable users to control lighting a TV set a coffee machine and the shutters of the smart home. We evaluate the performance accuracy interaction time usability and feasibility USE questionnaire on 12 healthy subjects and 2 disabled subjects. We find that healthy subjects achieve 77% task accuracy. However disabled subjects achieved a better accuracy 81% compared to 77%. Feasibility of BCI Control in a Realistic Smart Home Environment.
