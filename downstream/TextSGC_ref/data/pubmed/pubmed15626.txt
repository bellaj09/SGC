A novel intrusion detection system IDS using a deep neural network DNN is proposed to enhance the security of in-vehicular network. The parameters building the DNN structure are trained with probability-based feature vectors that are extracted from the in-vehicular network packets. For a given packet the DNN provides the probability of each class discriminating normal and attack packets and thus the sensor can identify any malicious attack to the vehicle. As compared to the traditional artificial neural network applied to the IDS the proposed technique adopts recent advances in deep learning studies such as initializing the parameters through the unsupervised pre-training of deep belief networks DBN therefore improving the detection accuracy. It is demonstrated with experimental results that the proposed technique can provide a real-time response to the attack with a significantly improved detection ratio in controller area network CAN bus.
