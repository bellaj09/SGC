Based on the analysis of the contents and technical characteristics of different scale forest visualization modeling this paper brought forward the principles and technical systems of constructing an information management-based virtual forest landscape. With the combination of process modeling and tree geometric structure description a software method of interactively and parameterized tree modeling was developed and the corresponding renderings and geometrical elements simplification algorithms were delineated to speed up rendering run-timely. As a pilot study the geometrical model bases associated with the typical tree categories in Zhangpu County of Fujian Province southeast China were established as template files. A Virtual Forest Management System prototype was developed with GIS component ArcObject OpenGL graphics environment and Visual C++ language based on forest inventory and remote sensing data. The prototype could be used for roaming between 2D and 3D information query and analysis and virtual and interactive forest growth simulation and its reality and accuracy could meet the needs of forest resource management. Some typical interfaces of the system and the illustrative scene cross-sections of simulated masson pine growth under conditions of competition and thinning were listed. Construction of information management-based virtual forest landscape and its application.
