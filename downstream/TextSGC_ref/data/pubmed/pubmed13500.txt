Heavy bingelike patterns of exposure to ethanol during a portion of the early postnatal period in the rat a time of rodent brain development corresponding to the human third trimester has been shown to deplete cerebellar neurons and to produce deficits in cerebellar-dependent tasks. In the current study we examined the impact of more moderate ethanol exposure during an extended portion of the rat third trimester equivalent on cerebellar-dependent learning eyeblink conditioning and deep cerebellar nuclei neuron numbers. Neonatal rats received 0 1 2 or 3g/kg/day of ethanol in milk formula via a single intragastric intubation each day across postnatal days 2-11 or were left untreated. Peak BACs for ethanol-exposed rats were 50 150 and 225 mg/dl respectively. Rats underwent eyeblink conditioning as young adults 70 days of age and deep cerebellar nuclei neuron numbers were assessed at 100 days of age. In Experiment 1 all rats showed normal responsiveness to periorbital stimulation prior to conditioning. The 3-g/kg/day group was impaired in eyeblink conditioning and possessed fewer deep cerebellar nuclei neurons. A trend toward impairment was observed in the 2-g/kg/day group. However the 0-g/kg/day group was also impaired in eyeblink conditioning. In Experiment 2 the unconditioned stimulus pretest phase was eliminated the 0-g/kg/day group learned normally and both the 2- and 3-g/kg/day groups were again impaired. These results suggest that more moderate doses of ethanol during the rat third-trimester equivalent can produce long-term effects on the cerebellum.
