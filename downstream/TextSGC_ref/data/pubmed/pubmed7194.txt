With the increasing popularity of social media and smart devices the face as one of the key biometrics becomes vital for person identification. Among those face recognition algorithms video-based face recognition methods could make use of both temporal and spatial information just as humans do to achieve better classification performance. However they cannot identify individuals when certain key facial areas such as eyes or nose are disguised by heavy makeup or rubber/digital masks. To this end we propose a novel deep spiking neural network architecture in this paper. It takes dynamic facial movements the facial muscle changes induced by speaking or other activities as the sole input. An event-driven continuous spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule with adaptive thresholding is applied to train the synaptic weights. The experiments on our proposed video-based disguise face database MakeFace DB demonstrate that the proposed learning method performs very well i.e. it achieves from 95% to 100% correct classification rates under various realistic experimental scenarios.
