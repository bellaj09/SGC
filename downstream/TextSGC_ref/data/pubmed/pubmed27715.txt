Many Brain-computer Interfaces BCI use band-power estimates with more or less subject-specific optimization of the frequency bands. However a number of alternative EEG features do not need to select the frequency bands; estimators for these features have been modified for an adaptive use. The popular band power estimates were compared with Adaptive AutoRegressive parameters Hjorth Barlow Wackermann Brain-Rate and a new feature type called Time Domain Parameter. The results from 21 subjects show that several features provide an equally good or even better performance while no subject-specific optimization is needed and they are also preferable to band power when the most discriminating frequency band of a subject is not known.
