In the last years there has been an increasing interest in using Brain Computer Interfaces BCI within motor rehabilitation therapies that use robotic devices or functional electro stimulation to help or guide the efforts of the patient to move her body. A crucial step of these therapies is to provide help to the user just when she is actually trying to accomplish a certain motion or task One of the most promising applications of BCI systems in this context is its ability to measure the user intentions and actions to trigger the rehabilitation devices accordingly. This paper studies the single-trial classification based on EEG measurements of three basic states during the execution of self-initiated motion: rest motion preparation or anticipation and motion. We conducted an experiment where the participants had to reach at their will eight different locations from a fixed starting position. Results for seven healthy subjects show that it is possible to achieve good classification rates given that features are carefully selected for each subject and for each pair of states. Classification of resting anticipation and movement states in self-initiated arm movements for EEG brain computer interfaces.
