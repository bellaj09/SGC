The use of immersive virtual reality as a research tool is rapidly increasing in numerous scientific disciplines. By combining ecological validity with strict experimental control immersive virtual reality provides the potential to develop and test scientific theories in rich environments that closely resemble everyday settings. This article introduces the first standardized database of colored three-dimensional 3-D objects that can be used in virtual reality and augmented reality research and applications. The 147 objects have been normed for name agreement image agreement familiarity visual complexity and corresponding lexical characteristics of the modal object names. The availability of standardized 3-D objects for virtual reality research is important because reaching valid theoretical conclusions hinges critically on the use of well-controlled experimental stimuli. Sharing standardized 3-D objects across different virtual reality labs will allow for science to move forward more quickly. A standardized set of 3-D objects for virtual reality research and applications.
