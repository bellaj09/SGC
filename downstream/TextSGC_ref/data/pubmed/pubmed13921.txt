Deep learning is one of the subsets of machine learning that is widely used in artificial intelligence AI field such as natural language processing and machine vision. The deep convolution neural network DCNN extracts high-level concepts from low-level features and it is appropriate for large volumes of data. In fact in deep learning the high-level concepts are defined by low-level features. Previously in optimization algorithms the accuracy achieved for network training was less and high-cost function. In this regard in this study AdaptAhead optimization algorithm was developed for learning DCNN with robust architecture in relation to the high volume data. The proposed optimization algorithm was validated in multi-modality MR images of BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 data sets. Comparison of the proposed optimization algorithm with other commonly used methods represents the improvement of the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm on the relatively large dataset. Using the Dice similarity metric we report accuracy results on the BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 brain tumor segmentation challenge dataset. Results showed that our proposed algorithm is significantly more accurate than other methods as a result of its deep and hierarchical extraction.
