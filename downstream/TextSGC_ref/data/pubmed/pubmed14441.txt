Mobile edge computing MEC can augment the computation capabilities of a vehicle terminal VT through offloading the computational tasks from the VT to the mobile edge computing-enabled base station MEC-BS covering them. However due to the limited mobility of the vehicle and the capacity of the MEC-BS the connection between the vehicle and the MEC-BS may be intermittent. If we can expect the availability of MEC-BS through cognitive computing we can significantly improve the performance in a mobile environment. Based on this idea we propose a offloading optimization algorithm based on availability prediction. We examine the admission control decision of MEC-BS and the mobility problem in which we improve the accuracy of availability prediction based on Empirical Mode DecompositionEMD and LSTM in deep learning. Firstly we calculate the availability of MEC completion time and energy consumption together to minimize the overall cost. Then we use a game method to obtain the optimal offloading decision. Finally the experimental results show that the algorithm can save energy and shorten the completion time more effectively than other existing algorithms in the mobile environment.
