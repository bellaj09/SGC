"This paper describes the latest developments at the Institute for Energy Technology IFE in Norway in the field of real-time 3D three-dimensional radiation risk assessment for the support of work simulation in nuclear environments. 3D computer simulation can greatly facilitate efficient work planning briefing and training of workers. It can also support communication within and between work teams and with advisors regulators the media and public at all the stages of a nuclear installations lifecycle. Furthermore it is also a beneficial tool for reviewing current work practices in order to identify possible gaps in procedures as well as to support the updating of international recommendations dissemination of experience and education of the current and future generation of workers.IFE has been involved in research and development into the application of 3D computer simulation and virtual reality VR technology to support work in radiological environments in the nuclear sector since the mid 1990s. During this process two significant software tools have been developed the VRdose system and the Halden Planner and a number of publications have been produced to contribute to improving the safety culture in the nuclear industry.This paper describes the radiation risk assessment techniques applied in earlier versions of the VRdose system and the Halden Planner for visualising radiation fields and calculating dose and presents new developments towards implementing a flexible and up-to-date dosimetric package in these 3D software tools based on new developments in the field of radiation protection. The latest versions of these 3D tools are capable of more accurate risk estimation permit more flexibility via a range of user choices and are applicable to a wider range of irradiation situations than their predecessors."
