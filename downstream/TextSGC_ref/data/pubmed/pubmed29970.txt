Damage to the cerebellum can affect neural structures involved in locomotion causing gait and balance disorders. However the integrity of cerebellum does not seem to be critical in managing sudden and unexpected environmental changes such as disturbances during walking. The cerebellum also plays a functional role in motor learning. Only a few effective therapies exist for individuals with cerebellar ataxia. With these in mind we aimed at investigating: 1 corrective response of participants with cerebellar ataxia CA to unexpected gait perturbations; and 2 the effectiveness of a perturbation-based training to improve their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady walking. Specifically we hypothesized that: 1 CA group can show a corrective behavior similar to that of a healthy control group; 2 the exposure to a perturbation-based treatment can exploit residual learning capability thus improving their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady locomotion. Effects of repeated waist-pull perturbations on gait stability in subjects with cerebellar ataxia.
