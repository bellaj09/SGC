Brain-computer interface technology has been applied to stroke patients to improve their motor function. Event-related desynchronization during motor imagery which is used as a brain-computer interface trigger is sometimes difficult to detect in stroke patients. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS is known to increase event-related desynchronization. This study investigated the adjunctive effect of anodal tDCS for brain-computer interface training in patients with severe hemiparesis. Brain-computer interface training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with chronic severe hemiparesis: Proof of concept study.
