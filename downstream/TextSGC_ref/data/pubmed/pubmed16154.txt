This study investigated effects of test format on use of different learning strategies and their perceived utility. It was conducted in a classroom setting. Sixty seven 67 eighth grade students participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: fill-in test or essay test conditions. They took a history class for five days and at the end of each session took a test about the lecture with the format of their conditions. Results showed that in comparison with fill-in format essay format facilitated use of deep-processing learning strategy and decreased use of such strategies as rote memory. No significant effect was found for perceived utility of learning strategies suggesting that it did not mediate the format effect. Underlying mechanism of the format effect and practical value of the current research were discussed. Effects of test format on learning strategy and perceived utility.
