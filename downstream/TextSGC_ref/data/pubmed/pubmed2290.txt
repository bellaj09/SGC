"Alzheimers disease AD alters the functional connectivity of the default mode network DMN but also the topological properties of the functional connectome. Cognitive training CT is a tool to slow down AD progression and is likely to impact on functional connectivity. In this pilot study we aimed at investigating brain functional changes after a period of CT and active control AC in a group of 26 subjects with mild AD mAD 26 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI and a control group of 29 healthy elderly HE people. They all underwent a CT and AC in a counterbalanced order following a crossover design. Resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing were acquired before and after each period. We tested post-CT and post-AC changes of cognitive abilities of the functional connectivity of the DMN and of topological network properties derived from graph theory and network-based statistics. Only CT produced functional changes increasing the functional connectivity of the posterior DMN in all three groups. mAD also showed functional changes in the medial temporal lobe and topological changes in the anterior cingulum whereas aMCI showed more widespread topological changes involving the frontal lobes the cerebellum and the thalamus. Our results suggest specific functional connectivity changes after CT for aMCI and mAD."
