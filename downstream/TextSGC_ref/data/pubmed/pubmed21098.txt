The authors describe the first surgical case adopting the combination of real-time augmented reality and wearable computing devices such as Google Glass Google Inc Mountain View California. A 66-year-old man presented to their institution for a total shoulder replacement after 5 years of progressive right shoulder pain and decreased range of motion. Throughout the surgical procedure Google Glass was integrated with the Virtual Interactive Presence and Augmented Reality system University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham Alabama enabling the local surgeon to interact with the remote surgeon within the local surgical field. Surgery was well tolerated by the patient and early surgical results were encouraging with an improvement of shoulder pain and greater range of motion. The combination of real-time augmented reality and wearable computing devices such as Google Glass holds much promise in the field of surgery.
