Locomotor malfunction represents a major problem in some neurological disorders like stroke and spinal cord injury. Robot-assisted walking devices have been used during rehabilitation of patients with these ailments for regaining and improving walking ability. Previous studies showed the advantage of brain-computer interface BCI based robot-assisted training combined with physical therapy in the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. Therefore stroke patients with walking disorders might also benefit from using BCI robot-assisted training protocols. In order to develop such BCI it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility to decode walking intention from cortical patterns during robot-assisted gait training. Spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram EEG related to robot-assisted active and passive walking were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers mean age 32.310.8 six female and in three acute stroke patients all male mean age 46.716.9 Berg Balance Scale 2012.8. A logistic regression classifier was used to distinguish walking from baseline in these spectral EEG patterns. Mean classification accuracies of 94.05.4% and 93.17.9% respectively were reached when active and passive walking were compared against baseline. The classification performance between passive and active walking was 83.47.4%. A classification accuracy of 89.95.7% was achieved in the stroke patients when comparing walking and baseline. Furthermore in the healthy volunteers modulation of low gamma activity in central midline areas was found to be associated with the gait cycle phases but not in the stroke patients. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of BCI-based robotic-assisted training devices for gait rehabilitation.
