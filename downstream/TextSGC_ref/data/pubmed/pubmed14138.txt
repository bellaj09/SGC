Precision cancer medicine is dependent on accurate prediction of disease and treatment outcome requiring integration of clinical imaging and interventional knowledge. User controlled pipelines are capable of feature integration with varied levels of human interaction. In this work we present two pipelines designed to combine clinical radiomic quantified imaging and RTx-omic quantified radiation therapy RT plan information for prediction of locoregional failure LRF in head and neck cancer H&N. User-controlled pipelines for feature integration and head and neck radiation therapy outcome predictions.
