High spatiotemporal resolution dynamic magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a powerful clinical tool for imaging moving structures as well as to reveal and quantify other physical and physiological dynamics. The low speed of MRI necessitates acceleration methods such as deep learning reconstruction from under-sampled data. However the massive size of many dynamic MRI problems prevents deep learning networks from directly exploiting global temporal relationships. In this work we show that by applying deep neural networks inside a priori calculated temporal feature spaces we enable deep learning reconstruction with global temporal modeling even for image sequences with >40000 frames. One proposed variation of our approach using dilated multi-level Densely Connected Network mDCN speeds up feature space coordinate calculation by 3000x compared to conventional iterative methods from 20 minutes to 0.39 seconds. Thus the combination of low-rank tensor and deep learning models not only makes large-scale dynamic MRI feasible but also practical for routine clinical application.
