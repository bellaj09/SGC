Despite the availability of a series of tests detection of chronic traumatic osteomyelitis is still exhausting in clinical practice. We hypothesized that machine learning based on computed-tomography CT images would provide better diagnostic performance for extremity traumatic chronic osteomyelitis than the serological biomarker alone. A retrospective study was carried out to collect medical data from patients with extremity traumatic osteomyelitis according to the criteria of musculoskeletal infection society. In each patient serum levels of C-reactive protein CRP erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and D-dimer were measured and CT scan of the extremity was conducted 7 days after admission preoperatively. A deep residual network ResNet machine learning model was established for recognition of bone lesion on the CT image. A total of 28718 CT images from 163 adult patients were included. Then we randomly extracted 80% of all CT images from each patient for training 10% for validation and 10% for testing. Our results showed that machine learning 83.4% outperformed CRP 53.2% ESR 68.8% and D-dimer 68.1% separately in accuracy. Meanwhile machine learning 88.0% demonstrated highest sensitivity when compared with CRP 50.6% ESR 73.0% and D-dimer 51.7%. Considering the specificity machine learning 77.0% is better than CRP 59.4% and ESR 62.2% but not D-dimer 83.8%. Our findings indicated that machine learning based on CT images is an effective and promising avenue for detection of chronic traumatic osteomyelitis in the extremity.
