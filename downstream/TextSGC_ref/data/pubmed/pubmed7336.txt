Electroencephalography EEG is a complex signal and can require several years of training as well as advanced signal processing and feature extraction methodologies to be correctly interpreted. Recently deep learning DL has shown great promise in helping make sense of EEG signals due to its capacity to learn good feature representations from raw data. Whether DL truly presents advantages as compared to more traditional EEG processing approaches however remains an open question.
