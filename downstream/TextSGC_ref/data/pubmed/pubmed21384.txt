We explored visuomotor adaptation and spatial generalization of three-dimensional reaching movements performed in a virtual reality environment. We used a multiphase learning paradigm. First subjects performed reaching movements to six targets without visual feedback VF pre-exposure phase. Next participants aimed at one target with veridical VF baseline phase. Immediately after they were required to adapt their movements to a triaxial visuomotor perturbation horizontal vertical and sagittal translations between actual hand motion and VF of hand motion in the virtual environment learning phase. Finally subjects aimed at the same targets as in the baseline aftereffect and pre-exposure phases generalization without VF post-exposure phase. The results revealed spatial axis-dependent visuomotor adaptation capacities. First subjects showed smaller intertrial variability along the horizontal compared to the sagittal and vertical axes during the baseline and learning phases. Second although subjects were unaware of the visual distortion they adapted their movements to each component of the triaxial perturbation. However they showed reduced learning rate and less persistent adaptation aftereffect along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Similarly subjects transferred the newly learned visuomotor association to untrained regions of the workspace but their average level of generalization was smaller along the vertical than the horizontal and sagittal axes. Collectively our results suggest that adapting three-dimensional movements to a visual distortion involves distinct processes according to the specific sensorimotor integration demands of moving along each spatial axis. This finding supports the idea that the brain employs a modular decomposition strategy to simplify complex multidimensional visuomotor tasks.
