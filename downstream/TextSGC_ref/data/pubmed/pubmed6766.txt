The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System BI-RADS lexicon was developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall but within the BI-RADS 4 category it is greater than 70%. Therefore we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator BRISK to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup BI-RADS 4 rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk.
