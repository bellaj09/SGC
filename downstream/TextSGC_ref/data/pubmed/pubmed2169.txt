Converging lines of evidence implicate the thalamocortical network in schizophrenia. In particular the onset of the illness is associated with aberrant functional integration between the medio-dorsal thalamic nucleus MDN and widespread prefrontal temporal and parietal cortical regions. Because the thalamus is also implicated in other psychiatric illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD and major depressive disorder MDD the diagnostic specificity of these alterations is unclear. Here we determined whether aberrant functional integration between the MDN and the cortex is a specific feature of schizophrenia or a trans-diagnostic feature of psychiatric illness. Effective connectivity EC between the MDN and rest of the cortex was measured by applying psychophysiological interaction analysis to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 50 patients with first episode schizophrenia FES 50 patients with MDD 50 patients with PTSD and 122 healthy controls. All participants were medication-nave. The only significant schizophrenia-specific effect was increased EC between the right MDN and the right pallidum p\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected. In contrast there were a number of significant trans-diagnostic alterations with both right and left MDN displaying trans-diagnostic increased EC with several prefrontal and parietal regions bilaterally p\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected. EC alterations between the MDN and the cortex are not specific to schizophrenia but are a trans-diagnostic feature of psychiatric disorders consistent with emerging conceptualizations of mental illness based on a single general psychopathology factor. Therefore dysconnectivity of the MDN could potentially be used to assess the presence of general psychopathology above and beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries.
