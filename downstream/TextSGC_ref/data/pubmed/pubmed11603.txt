Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they are typically limited by low sample size and are abstracted by their own complexity the "black box problem". In this paper we train a convolutional neural network CNN with the largest multi-source functional MRI fMRI connectomic dataset ever compiled consisting of 43858 datapoints. We apply this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism spectrum disorder ASD versus typically developing TD controls that has proved difficult to characterize with inferential statistics. To contextualize these findings we additionally perform classifications of gender and task versus rest. Employing class-balancing to build a training set we trained 3  300 modified CNNs in an ensemble model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774 0.7680 and 0.9222 for ASD versus TD gender and task versus rest respectively. Additionally we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two visualization methods. First class activation maps show which functional connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification. Second by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers we were also able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-center dataset finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing different covariates of data depending on the independent variable analyzed and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal and cerebellar connections with a particularly high focus on the right caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus.
