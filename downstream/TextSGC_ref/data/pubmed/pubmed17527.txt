The main objective of this work is to determine the most appropriate high dynamic range picture calibration procedure for measuring luminance and color in the context of architecture. Three professional digital single-lens reflex cameras fitted with fisheye lenses were tested. Photometric and colorimetric accuracy was assessed in comparison with spectroradiometer measurements of 57 color samples Macbeth chart and additional Munsell samples. The results demonstrate that using a calibration model specific to the camera-lens association rather than the standardized RGB to XYZ color transform matrix is necessary to achieve an acceptable colorimetric accuracy. Moreover using a specific color transform matrix reduces the error in luminance especially for colorful elements. The study also shows the opportunity to share the same color transform matrix between similar photographic materials same brand and model. Finally among the three tested devices one camera-lens association has higher performance and produces better quality QuickTime Virtual Reality panoramas. Calibration of high dynamic range images for applied color and lighting research.
