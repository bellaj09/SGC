Brain-computer interface BCI system is a system that achieves communication and control among humans and computers and other electronic equipment with the electroencephalogram EEG signals. This paper describes the working theory of the wireless smart home system based on the BCI technology. We started to get the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP using the single chip microcomputer and the visual stimulation which composed by LED lamp to stimulate human eyes. Then through building the power spectral transformation on the LabVIEW platform we processed timely those EEG signals under different frequency stimulation so as to transfer them to different instructions. Those instructions could be received by the wireless transceiver equipment to control the household appliances and to achieve the intelligent control towards the specified devices. The experimental results showed that the correct rate for the 10 subjects reached 100% and the control time of average single device was 4 seconds thus this design could totally achieve the original purpose of smart home system. A wireless smart home system based on brain-computer interface of steady state visual evoked potential.
