Landmark agnosia is a rare type of navigation impairment for which various definitions have been presented. From a clinical as well as theoretical perspective consensus on the characteristics of landmark agnosia would be valuable. In the current study we review the literature concerning landmark agnosia and present a new case study. Existing literature highlights the importance of examining familiar as well as novel landmark processing and substantial variation in performance patterns of individual patients.
