Hemiparesis is the primary physical impairment underlying functional disability after stroke. A goal of rehabilitation is to enhance motor skill acquisition which is a direct result of practice. However frequency and duration of practice are limited in rehabilitation. Virtual reality VR is a computer technology that simulates real-life learning while providing augmented feedback and increased frequency duration and intensity of practiced tasks. The rate and extent of relearning of motor tasks could affect the duration effectiveness and cost of patient care. The purpose of this article is to review the use of VR training for motor rehabilitation after stroke. Virtual reality applications for motor rehabilitation after stroke.
