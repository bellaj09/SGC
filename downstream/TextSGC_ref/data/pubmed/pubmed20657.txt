In the present study we investigated the effects of upper alpha based neurofeedback NF training on electrical brain activity and cognitive functions in stroke survivors. Therefore two single chronic stroke patients with memory deficits subject A with a bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage; subject B with an ischemic stroke in the left arteria cerebri media and a healthy elderly control group N\u2009=\u200924 received up to ten NF training sessions. To evaluate NF training effects all participants performed multichannel electroencephalogram EEG resting measurements and a neuropsychological test battery assessing different cognitive functions before and after NF training. Stroke patients showed improvements in memory functions after successful NF training compared to the pre-assessment. Subject B had a pathological delta 0.5-4\xa0Hz and upper alpha 10-12\xa0Hz power maximum over the unaffected hemisphere before NF training. After NF training he showed a more bilateral and "normalized" topographical distribution of these EEG frequencies. Healthy participants as well as subject A did not show any abnormalities in EEG topography before the start of NF training. Consequently no changes in the topographical distribution of EEG activity were observed in these participants when comparing the pre- and post-assessment. Hence our results show that upper alpha based NF training had on the one hand positive effects on memory functions and on the other hand led to cortical "normalization" in a stroke patient with pathological brain activation patterns which underlines the potential usefulness of NF as neurological rehabilitation tool.
