"Research has shown that moving targets help Parkinsons disease PD patients improve their arm movement while sitting. We examined whether increasing the speed of a moving ball would also improve standing postural control in PD patients during a virtual reality VR ball-catching task. Twenty-one PD patients and 21 controls bilaterally reached to catch slow-moving and then fast-moving virtual balls while standing. A projection-based VR system connected to a motion-tracking system and a force platform was used. Dependent measures included the kinematics of arm movement movement time peak velocity duration of anticipatory postural adjustments APA and center of pressure COP movement movement time maximum amplitude and average velocity. When catching a fast ball both PD and control groups made arm movements with shorter movement time and higher peak velocity longer APA as well as COP movements with shorter movement time and smaller amplitude than when catching a slow ball. The change in performance from slow- to fast-ball conditions was not different between the PD and control groups. The results suggest that raising the speed of virtual moving targets should increase the speed of arm and COP movements for PD patients. Therapists however should also be aware that a fast virtual moving target causes the patient to confine the COP excursion to a smaller amplitude. Future research should examine the effect of other task parameters e.g. target distance direction on COP movement and examine the long-term effect of VR training."
