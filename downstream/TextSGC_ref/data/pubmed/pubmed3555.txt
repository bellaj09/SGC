The human functional connectome is a graphical representation consisting of nodes connected by edges of the inter-relationships of blood oxygenation-level dependent BOLD time-series measured by MRI from regions encompassing the cerebral cortices and often the cerebellum. Semi-metric analysis of the weighted undirected connectome distinguishes an edge as either direct metric such that there is no alternative path that is accumulatively stronger or indirect semi-metric where one or more alternative paths exist that have greater strength than the direct edge. The sensitivity and specificity of this method of analysis is illustrated by two case-control analyses with independent matched groups of adolescents with autism spectrum conditions ASC and major depressive disorder MDD.
