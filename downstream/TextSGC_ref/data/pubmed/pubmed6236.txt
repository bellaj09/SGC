"Investigations of the human connectome have elucidated core features of adult structural networks particularly the crucial role of hub-regions. However little is known regarding network organisation of the healthy elderly connectome a crucial prelude to the systematic study of neurodegenerative disorders. Here whole-brain probabilistic tractography was performed on high-angular diffusion-weighted images acquired from 115 healthy elderly subjects age 76-94 years; 65 females. Structural networks were reconstructed between 512 cortical and subcortical brain regions. We sought to investigate the architectural features of hub-regions as well as left-right asymmetries and sexual dimorphisms. We observed that the topology of hub-regions is consistent with a young adult population and previously published adult connectomic data. More importantly the architectural features of hub connections reflect their ongoing vital role in network communication. We also found substantial sexual dimorphisms with females exhibiting stronger inter-hemispheric connections between cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Lastly we demonstrate intriguing left-lateralized subnetworks consistent with the neural circuitry specialised for language and executive functions whilst rightward subnetworks were dominant in visual and visuospatial streams. These findings provide insights into healthy brain ageing and provide a benchmark for the study of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease AD and frontotemporal dementia FTD."
