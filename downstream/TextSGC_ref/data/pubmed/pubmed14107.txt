"OBJECTIVE. Dense breast tissue is an established risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Methods for reliable and reproducible identification of breast density have been developed and are increasingly being adopted into clinical practice allowing enhanced identification of patients who will benefit from supplemental screening. Breast density is being used for patient risk stratification through incorporation into risk models leading to more precise management and improved decision making regarding personalized screening strategies. CONCLUSION. This review provides an update on breast density assessment evaluation of patients risk status and the use of supplemental screening."
