Conventional cell handling and sorting methods require manual labor which decreases both cell quality and quantity. To purify adherent cultured cells cell purification technologies that are high throughput without dissociation and can be utilized in an on-demand manner are expected. Here we developed a Laser-induced Light-responsive-polymer-Activated Cell Killing LiLACK system that enables high-speed and on-demand adherent cell sectioning and purification. This system employs a visible laser beam which does not kill cells directly but induces local heat production through the trans-cis-trans photo-isomerization of azobenzene moieties. Using this system in each passage for sectioning human induced pluripotent stem cells hiPSCs maintained their pluripotency and self-renewal during long-term culture. Furthermore combined with deep machine-learning analysis on fluorescent and phase contrast images a label-free and automatic cell processing system has been developed by eliminating unwanted spontaneously differentiated cells in undifferentiated hiPSC culture conditions.
