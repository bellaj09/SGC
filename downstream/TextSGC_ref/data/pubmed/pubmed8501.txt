"The evolution of a cooperative strategy on multilayer networks is arousing increasing concern. Most of the previous studies assumed that agents can only choose cooperation or defection when interacting with their partners whereas the actual provisions in real world scenarios might not be discrete but rather continuous. Furthermore in evolutionary game agents often make use of their memory which keeps the most successful strategy in the past as well as the best current strategy gained by their directed neighbors to find the best available strategies. Inspired by these observations we study the impact of the particle swarm optimization PSO algorithm on the evolution of cooperation on interdependent networks in the continuous version of spatial prisoners dilemma games. Following extensive simulations of this setup we can observe that the introduction of the PSO mechanism on the interdependent networks can promote cooperation strongly regardless of the network coupling strength. In addition we find that the increment of coupling strength is more suitable for the propagation of cooperation. More interestingly we find that when the coupling strength is relatively large a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon of cooperation occurs between the interdependent networks. To interpret the symmetry breaking phenomenon we investigate the asynchronous expansion of heterogeneous strategy couples between different networks. Since this work takes cooperation from a more elaborate perspective we believe that it may provide a deep understanding of the evolution of cooperation in social networks."
