Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy improves spatial resolution but this comes at a loss of image throughput and presents unique challenges in identifying optimal acquisition parameters. Microscope automation routines can offset these drawbacks but thus far have required user inputs that presume a priori knowledge about the sample. Here we develop a flexible illumination control system for localization microscopy comprised of two interacting components that require no sample-specific inputs: a self-tuning controller and a deep learning-based molecule density estimator that is accurate over an extended range of densities. This system obviates the need to fine-tune parameters and enables robust autonomous illumination control for localization microscopy. Autonomous illumination control for localization microscopy.
