A brain-computer interface BCI usually requires a time-consuming training phase during which data are collected and used to generate a classifier. Because brain signals vary dynamically over time and even over sessions this training phase may be necessary each time the BCI system is used which is impractical. However the variability in background noise which is less dependent on a control signal may dominate the dynamics of brain signals. Therefore we hypothesized that an understanding of variations in background noise may allow existing data to be reused by incorporating the noise characteristics into the feature extraction framework; in this way new session data are not required each time and this increases the feasibility of the BCI systems.
