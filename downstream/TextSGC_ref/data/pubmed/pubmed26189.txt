Over the past several years steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have attracted wide attention in the field of BCIs research due to high information transfer rate little user training and applicability to the majority. In conventional recognition methods for training-free SSVEP-based BCIs the energy difference between the frequencies of electroencephalogram EEG background noise is usually ignored therefore there is a significant variance among the recognition accuracy of different stimulus frequencies. In order to improve the performance of training-free SSVEP-based BCIs system and balance the accuracy of recognition between different stimulus frequencies a recognition method based on multitaper spectral analysis and signal-to-noise ratio estimation MTSA-SNR is proposed in this paper. A 40-class SSVEP public benchmark SSVEP dataset recorded from 35 subjects was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Under the condition of 2.25s data length the accuracy of the three methods were 81.1% MTSA-SNR 74.5% canonical correlation analysis CCA and 73.4% multivariate synchronization index MSI and the corresponding ITRs were 101 bits/min MTSA-SNR 89 bits/min CCA 87 bits/min MSI. In the low frequency range 8-9.8Hz the average recognition accuracy of the three methods is 82.9% MTSA-SNR 82.0% CCA 83.3% MSI. The average accuracy of the three methods was 78.6% MTSA-SNR 64.9% CCA and 61.8% MSI in the high frequency range 14-15.8Hz. According to the results the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of training-free SSVEP-based BCI system and balance the recognition accuracy between different stimulation frequencies. A frequency recognition method based on multitaper spectral analysis and SNR estimation for SSVEP-based brain-computer interface.
