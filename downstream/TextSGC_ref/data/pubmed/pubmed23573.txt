Brain-Computer Interface BCI is an alternative communication and control channel between brain and computer which finds applications in neuroprosthetics brain wave controlled computer games etc. This paper proposes an Electroencephalogram EEG based neurofeedback computer game that allows the player to control the game with the help of attention based brain signals. The proposed game protocol requires the player to memorize a set of numbers in a matrix and to correctly fill the matrix using his attention. The attention level of the player is quantified using sample entropy features of EEG. The statistically significant performance improvement of five healthy subjects after playing a number of game sessions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed game in enhancing their concentration and memory skills. Design of an online EEG based neurofeedback game for enhancing attention and memory.
