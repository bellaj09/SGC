To systematically review the available evidence on the efficacy of walking training associated with virtual reality-based training in patients with stroke. The specific questions were: Is walking training associated with virtual reality-based training effective in increasing walking speed after stroke? Is this type of intervention more effective in increasing walking speed than non-virtual reality-based walking interventions? Walking training associated with virtual reality-based training increases walking speed of individuals with chronic stroke: systematic review with meta-analysis.
