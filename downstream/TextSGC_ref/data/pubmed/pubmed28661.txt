"Long-term electrode implant is a challenge for successful brain-computer interfaces BCIs. It is well known that electrocorticography ECoG using flexible planar electrodes is more suitable for long-term implants than intracortical neural recordings using penetrative electrodes. In this study we propose a convex-shaped PDMS-parylene hybrid multi-electrode array for long-term stable ECoG recording on the brain or the spinal cord. The electrode array consists of 10 gold recording sites which show impedance values between 50 and 70 kOhm at 1 kHz with a diameter of 100 m. It is designed like octopuss leg to tightly adhere to the ellipsoidal brain. To assess its performance epidural ECoG recordings were performed from the main olfactory bulb MOB of an anesthetized rat during odor stimulation. The odor-evoked response was shown with an increase of the power in the beta band." A convex-shaped PDMS-parylene hybrid multichannel ECoG-electrode array.
