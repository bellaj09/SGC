Urban land cover and land use mapping plays an important role in urban planning and management. In this paper novel multi-scale deep learning models namely ASPP-Unet and ResASPP-Unet are proposed for urban land cover classification based on very high resolution VHR satellite imagery. The proposed ASPP-Unet model consists of a contracting path which extracts the high-level features and an expansive path which up-samples the features to create a high-resolution output. The atrous spatial pyramid pooling ASPP technique is utilized in the bottom layer in order to incorporate multi-scale deep features into a discriminative feature. The ResASPP-Unet model further improves the architecture by replacing each layer with residual unit. The models were trained and tested based on WorldView-2 WV2 and WorldView-3 WV3 imageries over the city of Beijing. Model parameters including layer depth and the number of initial feature maps IFMs as well as the input image bands were evaluated in terms of their impact on the model performances. It is shown that the ResASPP-Unet model with 11 layers and 64 IFMs based on 8-band WV2 imagery produced the highest classification accuracy 87.1% for WV2 imagery and 84.0% for WV3 imagery. The ASPP-Unet model with the same parameter setting produced slightly lower accuracy with overall accuracy of 85.2% for WV2 imagery and 83.2% for WV3 imagery. Overall the proposed models outperformed the state-of-the-art models e.g. U-Net convolutional neural network CNN and Support Vector Machine SVM model over both WV2 and WV3 images and yielded robust and efficient urban land cover classification results.
