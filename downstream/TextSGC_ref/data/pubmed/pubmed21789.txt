This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical properties of anterior cruciate ligament ACL; tibial femoral articular cartilage; and meniscus in knee joints receiving computer-aided or conventional ACL reconstruction. Three-dimensional 3D knee joint finite element models were established for healthy volunteers normal group and patients receiving computer-aided surgery CAS or conventional traditional surgery TS ACL reconstruction. The stress and stress distribution on the ACL tibial femoral articular cartilage and meniscus were examined after force was applied on the 3D knee joint finite element models. No significant differences were observed in the stress on ACL among normal group CAS group and TS group when a femoral backward force was loaded. However when a vertical force of 350\u2009N was loaded on the knee joints TS group had significant higher stress on the articular cartilage and meniscus than the other two groups at any flexion angle of 0 30 60 and 90 degrees. However no significant differences were observed between CAS group and normal group. In conclusion computer-aided ACL reconstruction has advantages over conventional surgery approach in restoring the biomechanical properties of knee joints thus reducing the risk of damage to the knee joint cartilage and meniscus after ACL reconstruction.
