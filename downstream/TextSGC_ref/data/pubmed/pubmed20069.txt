Trial-to-trial variability is a well-known issue in brain signals measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. We aimed to investigate whether trial-to-trial variability does provide information about individual performance. Seventeen subjects observed a virtual reality grasping task in first-person view while either imagining motor imagery during observation MIO or imitating motor execution ME the movements. Each condition was performed with the display in one of two positions a conventional vertical position and a mirrored horizontal position which placed the virtual arm in the correct position relative to the viewpoint. Averaged oxy-hemoglobin concentration O2Hb showed that the responses could be differentiated into two distinct groups: low responders LR and high responders HR. Within groups two main sources of trial-to-trial variability were identified: a the O2Hb amplitude with largest amplitudes in ME conditions group HR and smallest amplitudes in MIO conditions group LR and b the sign of O2Hb with positive responses occurring most frequently during ME group HR and negative responses most frequently during MIO group LR. Furthermore the trial-to-trial dynamics differed between groups and could be described in group LR as inverted polynomial U-shaped curve in the mirror conditions ME-mirror MIO-mirror. Last trial-to-trial variability was significantly dependent on task modality i.e. ME group HR versus MIO group LR and/or the mirrored display positions group LR. Our results show a relationship of trial-to-trial variability to individual MI performance which may be of significance for neurorehabilitation applications. Although the sources of trial-to-trial variability remain unknown we suggest that they may contribute to future neurofeedback applications. Trial-to-trial variability differentiates motor imagery during observation between low versus high responders: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.
