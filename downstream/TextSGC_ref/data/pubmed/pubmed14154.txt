Deep Learning DL is the state-of-the-art machine learning technology which shows superior performance in computer vision bioinformatics natural language processing and other areas. Especially as a modern image processing technology DL has been successfully applied in various tasks such as object detection semantic segmentation and scene analysis. However with the increase of dense scenes in reality due to severe occlusions and small size of objects the analysis of dense scenes becomes particularly challenging. To overcome these problems DL recently has been increasingly applied to dense scenes and has begun to be used in dense agricultural scenes. The purpose of this review is to explore the applications of DL for dense scenes analysis in agriculture. In order to better elaborate the topic we first describe the types of dense scenes in agriculture as well as the challenges. Next we introduce various popular deep neural networks used in these dense scenes. Then the applications of these structures in various agricultural tasks are comprehensively introduced in this review including recognition and classification detection counting and yield estimation. Finally the surveyed DL applications limitations and the future work for analysis of dense images in agriculture are summarized.
