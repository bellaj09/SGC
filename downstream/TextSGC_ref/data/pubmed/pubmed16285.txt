Cardiac arrest is the most serious death-related event in intensive care units ICUs but it is not easily predicted because of the complex and time-dependent data characteristics of intensive care patients. Given the complexity and time dependence of ICU data deep learning-based methods are expected to provide a good foundation for developing risk prediction models based on large clinical records. Development of a Real-Time Risk Prediction Model for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Critically Ill Patients Using Deep Learning: Retrospective Study.
