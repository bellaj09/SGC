Exposure therapy is an established learning-based intervention for the treatment of anxiety disorders with an average response rate of nearly 50% leaving room for improvement. Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. Effects of acute exercise on fear extinction in rats and exposure therapy in humans: Null findings from five experiments.
