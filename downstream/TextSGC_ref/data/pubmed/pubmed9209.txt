"The resident admit notes RANs in electronic medical records EMRs is first-hand information to study the patients condition. Medical entity extraction of RANs is an important task to get disease information for medical decision-making. For Chinese electronic medical records each medical entity contains not only word information but also rich character information. Effective combination of words and characters is very important for medical entity extraction. We propose a medical entity recognition model based on a character and word attention-enhanced CWAE neural network for Chinese RANs. In our model word embeddings and character-based embeddings are obtained through character-enhanced word embedding CWE model and Convolutional Neural Network CNN model. Then attention mechanism combines the character-based embeddings and word embeddings together which significantly improves the expression ability of words. The new word embeddings obtained by the attention mechanism are taken as the input to bidirectional long short-term memory BI-LSTM and conditional random field CRF to extract entities. We extracted nine types of key medical entities from Chinese RANs and evaluated our model. The proposed method was compared with two traditional machine learning methods CRF support vector machine SVM and the related deep learning models. The result shows that our model has better performance and the result of our model reaches 94.44% in the F1-score."
