Protein secondary structure prediction PSSP is an important research field in bioinformatics. The representation of protein sequence features could be treated as a matrix which includes the amino-acid residue time-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Common approaches to predict secondary structures only focus on the amino-acid residue dimension. However the feature vector dimension may also contain useful information for PSSP. To integrate the information on both dimensions of the matrix we propose a hybrid deep learning framework two-dimensional convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network 2C-BRNN for improving the accuracy of 8-class secondary structure prediction. The proposed hybrid framework is to extract the discriminative local interactions between amino-acid residues by two-dimensional convolutional neural networks 2DCNNs and then further capture long-range interactions between amino-acid residues by bidirectional gated recurrent units BGRUs or bidirectional long short-term memory BLSTM. Specifically our proposed 2C-BRNNs framework consists of four models: 2DConv-BGRUs 2DCNN-BGRUs 2DConv-BLSTM and 2DCNN-BLSTM. Among these four models the 2DConv- models only contain two-dimensional 2D convolution operations. Moreover the 2DCNN- models contain 2D convolutional and pooling operations. Experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed 2DConv-BLSTM model performs significantly better than the benchmark models. Furthermore the experiments also demonstrate that the proposed models can extract more meaningful features from the matrix of proteins and the feature vector dimension is also useful for PSSP.
