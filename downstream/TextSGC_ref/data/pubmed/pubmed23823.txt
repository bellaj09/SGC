Frontal asymmetry has been investigated over the past 30 years and several theories have been developed about its meaning. The original theory of Davidson and its diversification by Harmon-Jones & Allen allocated approach motivation to relative left frontal brain activity and withdrawal motivation to relative right frontal brain activity. Hewig and colleagues extended this theory by adding bilateral frontal activation representing a biological correlate of the behavioral activation system if actual behavior is shown. Wacker and colleagues formulated a theory related to the revised reinforcement sensitivity theory by Gray & McNaughton. Here relative left frontal brain activation represents the revised behavioral activation system and behavior while relative right frontal brain activation represents the revised behavioral inhibition system representing the experience of conflict. These theories were investigated with a newly developed paradigm where participants were able to move around freely in a virtual T maze via joystick while having their EEG recorded. Analyzing the influence of frontal brain activation during this virtual reality task on observable behavior for 30 participants we found more relative left frontal brain activation during approach behavior and more relative right brain activation for withdrawal behavior of any kind. Additionally there was more bilateral frontal brain activation when participants were engaged in behavior compared to doing nothing. Hence this study provides evidence for the idea that frontal asymmetry stands for behavioral approach or avoidance motivation and bilateral frontal activation stands for behavior. Additionally observable behavior is not only determined by frontal asymmetry but also by relevant traits. Mind the movement: Frontal asymmetry stands for behavioral motivation bilateral frontal activation for behavior.
