Virtual reality is an adjuvant technique to rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy CP. It has been gaining prominence in this field because of its accessibility and great levels of motivation it promotes in treatment. However there is a lack of studies addressing the effects of virtual reality-based therapy on activity levels regarding postural stability especially considering the level of evidence presented by studies addressing this issue. Therefore we aim to evaluate the effects of intervention in body sway and gross motor function of children with CP using an active video game. Effects of virtual reality in body oscillation and motor performance of children with cerebral palsy: A preliminary randomized controlled clinical trial.
