Endoscopic sinus surgery ESS is a technically challenging procedure associated with a significant risk of complications. Virtual reality simulation has demonstrated benefit in many disciplines as an important educational tool for surgical training. Within the field of rhinology there is a lack of ESS simulators with appropriate validity evidence supporting their integration into residency education. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the acceptability perceived realism and benefit of the McGill Simulator for Endoscopic Sinus Surgery MSESS among medical students otolaryngology residents and faculty and to present evidence supporting its ability to differentiate users based on their level of training through the performance metrics. The McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery MSESS: a validation study.
