Virtual reality environments provide highly interactive natural control of the visualization process significantly enhancing the scientific value of the data produced by medical imaging systems. Due to the computational and real time display update requirements of virtual reality interfaces however the complexity of organ and tissue surfaces which can be displayed is limited. In this paper we present a new algorithm for the production of a polygonal surface containing a pre-specified number of polygons from patient or subject specific volumetric image data. The advantage of this new algorithm is that it effectively tiles complex structures with a specified number of polygons selected to optimize the trade-off between surface detail and real-time display rates. 3-D surface reconstruction of patient specific anatomic data using a pre-specified number of polygons.
