"Studies have shown that statistically there are differences in theta alpha and beta band powers when people look at blue and red colors. In this paper a game has been developed to test whether these statistical differences are good enough for online Brain Computer Interface BCI application. We implemented a two-choice BCI game in which the subject makes the choice by looking at a color option and our system decodes the subjects intention by analyzing the EEG signal. In our system band power features of the EEG data were used to train a support vector machine SVM classification model. An online mechanism was adopted to update the classification model during the training stage to account for individual differences. Our results showed that an accuracy of 70%-80% could be achieved and it provided evidence for the possibility in applying color stimuli to BCI applications."
