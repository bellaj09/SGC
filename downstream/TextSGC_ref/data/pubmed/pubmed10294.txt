"The advent of metasurfaces in recent years has ushered in a revolutionary means to manipulate the behavior of light on the nanoscale. The design of such structures to date has relied on the expertise of an optical scientist to guide a progression of electromagnetic simulations that iteratively solve Maxwells equations until a locally optimized solution can be attained. In this work we identify a solution to circumvent this conventional design procedure by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of customer-defined optical spectra the constructed generative network generates candidate patterns that match the on-demand spectra with high fidelity. This approach reveals an opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored optical responses in a systematic inverse-design manner."
