The high cost of virtual reality simulators has posed a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of simulators for medical training. HT Medical broke through this cost barrier by developing the PreOp Flexible Bronchoscopy simulator a realistic training simulation system that integrates force feedback multimedia and 3D graphics on a PC. We are currently extending the PreOp platform so that it can simulate other endoscopic procedures. This paper discusses our efforts to extend the platform to simulate flexible sigmoidoscopy and ureteroscopy. PreOp endoscopy simulator: from bronchoscopy to ureteroscopy.
