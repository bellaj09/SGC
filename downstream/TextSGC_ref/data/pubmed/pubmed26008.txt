Stimulation of the nervous system with the aid of electrical active implants has changed the therapy of neurological diseases and rehabilitation of lost functions and has expanded clinical practice within the last few years. Alleviation of effects of neurodegenerative diseases therapy of psychiatric diseases the functional restoration of hearing as well as other applications have been transferred successfully into clinical practice. Other approaches are still under development in preclinical and clinical trials. The restoration of sight by implantable electronic systems that interface with the retina in the eye is an example how technological progress promotes novel medical devices. The idea of using the electrical signal of the brain to control technical devices and neural prostheses is driving current research in the field of brain-computer interfaces. The benefit for the patient always has to be balanced with the risks and side effects of those implants in comparison to medicinal and surgical treatments. How these and other developments become established in practice depends finally on their acceptance by the patients and the reimbursement of their costs.
