Accurately counting maize tassels is important for monitoring the growth status of maize plants. This tedious task however is still mainly done by manual efforts. In the context of modern plant phenotyping automating this task is required to meet the need of large-scale analysis of genotype and phenotype. In recent years computer vision technologies have experienced a significant breakthrough due to the emergence of large-scale datasets and increased computational resources. Naturally image-based approaches have also received much attention in plant-related studies. Yet a fact is that most image-based systems for plant phenotyping are deployed under controlled laboratory environment. When transferring the application scenario to unconstrained in-field conditions intrinsic and extrinsic variations in the wild pose great challenges for accurate counting of maize tassels which goes beyond the ability of conventional image processing techniques. This calls for further robust computer vision approaches to address in-field variations. TasselNet: counting maize tassels in the wild via local counts regression network.
