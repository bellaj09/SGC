Distinguishing between meningeal-based and intra-axial lesions by means of magnetic resonance MR imaging findings may occasionally be challenging. Meningiomas and gliomas account for most of the total primary brain neoplasms in dogs and differentiating between these two forms is mandatory in choosing the correct therapy. The aims of the present study are: 1 to determine the accuracy of a deep convolutional neural network CNN GoogleNet in discriminating between meningiomas and gliomas in pre- and post-contrast T1 images and T2 images; 2 to develop an image classifier based on the combination of CNN and MRI sequence displaying the highest accuracy to predict whether a lesion is a meningioma or a glioma. A methodological approach for deep learning to distinguish between meningiomas and gliomas on canine MR-images.
