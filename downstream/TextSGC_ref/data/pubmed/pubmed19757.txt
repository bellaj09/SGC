Computer assisted operation planning systems are gaining increasing recognition in the field of surgery. These systems offer new possibilities for preparing an intervention with the goal of reducing the amount of expensive operating-room time required for the intervention. The safest and most effective surgical approach should always be selected but it is often difficult to transfer the output of the planning system to the intra-operative situation so that the planning results can be considered during the actual intervention. At the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics IGD in Darmstadt and the Centre for Advanced Media Technology CAMTech in Singapore methods are being developed to bridge the gap between the external planning session and the intra-operative case: Augmented Reality AR techniques are used to overlay preoperative scanned image data as well as results of the planning session on the operation field.
