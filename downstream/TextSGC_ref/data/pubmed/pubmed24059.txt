"Resistance to antisocial peer pressure consistently relates to adolescent adjustment. However it is typically measured via a mono-method self-report approach. The current study introduces a virtual reality VR protocol to create an observational measure of adolescents responses to peer pressure to engage in antisocial activities. Data on the reliability and validity of the assessment procedure are presented. Participants N\xa0=\xa0264 46% male Mage =\xa018.17\xa0years 81% White provided self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure antisocial behavior dating violence perpetration and depressive symptoms. Participants also engaged in 9 VR simulations 4 of which involved antisocial peer pressure. Participant behavior in the VR simulations was coded for resistance to antisocial peer pressure. Approximately half the sample repeated the VR simulations at a 2-month follow-up. Resistance to antisocial peer pressure in 4 VR simulations evidenced item/simulation-level convergent validity with one another and discriminant validity against scores in 5 VR bystander behavior simulations. When scores from the 4 antisocial peer pressure VR simulations were summed into a total scale score they demonstrated acceptable internal consistency 2-month test-retest correlations convergent validity with self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure and criterion validity with self-reports of antisocial behavior and dating violence perpetration. Associations with antisocial behavior and dating violence perpetration held after accounting for self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure and participant gender. Results provide evidence that VR simulations may offer a psychometrically sound addition to self-report measures as a method for assessing responses to antisocial peer pressure."
