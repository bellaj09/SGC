"This study aimed to investigate the effects of speed-interactive pedaling training SIPT using a smartphone virtual reality application to improve lower limb motor function trunk sitting balance and gait in stroke patients. Forty-two patients who had previously experienced a stroke and could sit independently participated in the study. The subjects were assigned to the SIPT group n = 21 and the control group n = 21. The SIPT group had cycle training with SIPT for 40 min a day five days a week in a six-week period in addition to conventional therapy. The control group had cycle training without SIPT and conventional therapy. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment postural sway modified functional reach test trunk impairment scale and spatiotemporal parameters of gait were used to assess the changes in lower extremity function the static balance of sitting the dynamic balance of sitting and gait ability after the intervention. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment postural sway modified functional reach test trunk impairment scale and gait ability in the SIPT group were significantly better compared to that of the control group p < 0.05. Based on this result we propose that SIPT which improves function balance and gait could be used as an effective training method to improve patients functional activities in the clinical setting. The results of this study suggest that SIPT could be used as an effective training method to restore a patients function by improving trunk balance and motor function."
