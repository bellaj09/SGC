Stroke is one of the main causes of long-term disability worldwide placing a large burden on individuals and society. Rehabilitation after stroke consists of an iterative process involving assessments and specialized training aspects often constrained by limited resources of healthcare centers. Wearable technology has the potential to objectively assess and monitor patients inside and outside clinical environments enabling a more detailed evaluation of the impairment and allowing the individualization of rehabilitation therapies. The present review aims to provide an overview of wearable sensors used in stroke rehabilitation research with a particular focus on the upper extremity. We summarize results obtained by current research using a variety of wearable sensors and use them to critically discuss challenges and opportunities in the ongoing effort towards reliable and accessible tools for stroke rehabilitation. Finally suggestions concerning data acquisition and processing to guide future studies performed by clinicians and engineers alike are provided. Wearable technology in stroke rehabilitation: towards improved diagnosis and treatment of upper-limb motor impairment.
