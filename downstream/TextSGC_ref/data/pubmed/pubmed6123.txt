Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is vulnerable to virus diseases which threaten to destabilize food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New deep learning models offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage or lack thereof. The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot BLS 96% for red mite damage RMD 95% for green mite damage GMD 98% for cassava brown streak disease CBSD and 96% for cassava mosaic disease CMD. The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast affordable and easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.
