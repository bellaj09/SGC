"Neuropsychiatric disorders are increasingly conceptualized as disconnection syndromes that are associated with abnormal network integrity in the brain. However whether different neuropsychiatric disorders show commonly dysfunctional connectivity architectures in large-scale brain networks remains largely unknown. Here we performed a meta-connectomic study to identify disorder-related functional modules and brain regions by combining meta-analyses of 182 published resting-state functional MRI studies in 11 neuropsychiatric disorders and graph-theoretical analyses of 3 independent resting-state functional MRI datasets with healthy and diseased populations Alzheimers disease and major depressive disorder MDD. Three major functional modules the default mode frontoparietal and sensorimotor networks were commonly abnormal across disorders. Moreover most of the disorders preferred to target the network connector nodes that were primarily involved in intermodule communications and multiple cognitive components. Apart from these common dysfunctions different brain disorders were associated with specific alterations in network modules and connector regions. Finally these meta-connectomic findings were confirmed by two empirical example cases of Alzheimers disease and MDD. Collectively our findings shed light on the shared biological mechanisms of network dysfunctions of diverse disorders and have implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment from a network perspective."
