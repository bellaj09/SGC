The aim of this review is to provide readers with an update on the state of the art pitfalls solutions for those pitfalls future perspectives and challenges in the quickly evolving field of radiomics in nuclear medicine imaging and associated oncology applications. The main pitfalls were identified in study design data acquisition segmentation feature calculation and modeling; however in most cases potential solutions are available and existing recommendations should be followed to improve the overall quality and reproducibility of published radiomics studies. The techniques from the field of deep learning have some potential to provide solutions especially in terms of automation. Some important challenges remain to be addressed but overall striking advances have been made in the field in the last 5 y. Radiomics: Data Are Also Images.
