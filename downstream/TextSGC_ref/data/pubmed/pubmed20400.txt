Testing of the vestibular system requires a vestibular stimulus motion and/or a visual stimulus. We have developed a versatile low cost stereoscopic visual display system using "virtual reality" VR technology. The display system can produce images for each eye that correspond to targets at any virtual distance relative to the subject and so require the appropriate ocular vergence. We elicited smooth pursuit "stare" optokinetic nystagmus OKN and after-nystagmus OKAN vergence for targets at various distances and short-term adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex VOR using both conventional methods and the stereoscopic display. Pursuit OKN and OKAN were comparable with both methods. When used with a vestibular stimulus VR induced appropriate adaptive changes of the phase and gain of the angular VOR. In addition using the VR display system and a human linear acceleration sled we adapted the phase of the linear VOR. The VR-based stimulus system not only offers an alternative to more cumbersome means of stimulating the visual system in vestibular experiments it also can produce visual stimuli that would otherwise be impractical or impossible. Our techniques provide images without the latencies encountered in most VR systems. Its inherent versatility allows it to be useful in several different types of experiments and because it is software driven it can be quickly adapted to provide a new stimulus. These two factors allow VR to provide considerable savings in time and money as well as flexibility in developing experimental paradigms.
