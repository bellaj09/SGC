Augmented reality AR has been successfully providing surgeons an extensive visual information of surgical anatomy to assist them throughout the procedure. AR allows surgeons to view surgical field through the superimposed 3D virtual model of anatomical details. However open surgery presents new challenges. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the available literature regarding the use of AR in open surgery both in clinical and simulated settings. In this way we aim to analyze the current trends and solutions to help developers and end/users discuss and understand benefits and shortcomings of these systems in open surgery. We performed a PubMed search of the available literature updated to January 2018 using the terms 1 "augmented reality" AND "open surgery" 2 "augmented reality" AND "surgery" NOT "laparoscopic" NOT "laparoscope" NOT "robotic" 3 "mixed reality" AND "open surgery" 4 "mixed reality" AND "surgery" NOT "laparoscopic" NOT "laparoscope" NOT "robotic". The aspects evaluated were the following: real data source virtual data source visualization processing modality tracking modality registration technique and AR display type. The initial search yielded 502 studies. After removing the duplicates and by reading abstracts a total of 13 relevant studies were chosen. In 1 out of 13 studies in vitro experiments were performed while the rest of the studies were carried out in a clinical setting including pancreatic hepatobiliary and urogenital surgeries. AR system in open surgery appears as a versatile and reliable tool in the operating room. However some technological limitations need to be addressed before implementing it into the routine practice.
