Convolutional neural networks CNNs play an important role in the field of medical image segmentation. Among many kinds of CNNs the U-net architecture is one of the most famous fully convolutional network architectures for medical semantic segmentation tasks. Recent work shows that the U-net network can be substantially deeper thus resulting in improved performance on segmentation tasks. Though adding more layers directly into network is a popular way to make a network deeper it may lead to gradient vanishing or redundant computation during training.
