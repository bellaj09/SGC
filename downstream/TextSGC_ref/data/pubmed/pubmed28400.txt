Intracortical brain-machine interfaces BMIs harness movement information by sensing neuronal activities using chronic microelectrode implants to restore lost functions to patients with paralysis. However neuronal signals often vary over time even within a day forcing one to rebuild a BMI every time they operate it. The term "rebuild" means overall procedures for operating a BMI such as decoder selection decoder training and decoder testing. It gives rise to a practical issue of what decoder should be built for a given neuronal ensemble. This study aims to address it by exploring how decoders\ performance varies with the neuronal properties. To extensively explore a range of neuronal properties we conduct a simulation study. A simulation study on the effects of neuronal ensemble properties on decoding algorithms for intracortical brain-machine interfaces.
