The present study investigated depth perception in virtual environments. Twenty-three participants verbally estimated ten distances between 40 cm and 500 cm in three different virtual environments in two conditions: 1 only one target was presented or 2 ten targets were presented at the same time. Additionally the presence of a metric aid was varied. A questionnaire assessed subjective ratings about physical complaints e.g. headache the experience in the virtual world e.g. presence and the experiment itself self-evaluation of the estimations. Results show that participants underestimate the virtual distances but are able to perceive the distances in the right metric order even when only very simple virtual environments are presented. Furthermore interindividual differences and intraindividual stabilities can be found among participants and neither the three different virtual environments nor the metric aid improved depth estimations. Estimation performance is better in peripersonal than in extrapersonal space. In contrast subjective ratings provide a preferred space: a closed room with visible floor ceiling and walls. Depth perception in virtual reality: distance estimations in peri- and extrapersonal space.
