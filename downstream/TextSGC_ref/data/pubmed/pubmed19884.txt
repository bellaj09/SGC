"Previous research has associated mens physical features such as height and Shoulder-to-Hip Ratio SHR with dominance. Proxemics literature has suggested that the interpersonal space comfort distance increases in threatening and uncomfortable situations and decreases in unthreatening and comfortable situations. In the current study we aimed to investigate the effect of different heights and SHRs on comfortable interpersonal distance by systematic manipulation of virtual confederates bodily features. More specifically participants determined their comfort distances from virtual male confederates with different heights and SHRs\xa0in a virtual environment. We hypothesized that a virtual confederates height and SHR influences the perception of interpersonal dominance; and consequently interpersonal space increases for taller and broader confederates as a result of increased interpersonal dominance. Results showed that comfortable interpersonal distance was positively associated with height for male participants but not for female participants. No effect was found for shoulder width neither for male nor female participants. Results were discussed in terms of the importance of height as a signal of dominance and fighting ability."
