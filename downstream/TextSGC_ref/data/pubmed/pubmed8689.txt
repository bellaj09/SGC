Hierarchical variants of so-called deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs have facilitated breakthrough results for numerous pattern recognition tasks in recent years. We assess the potential of these novel whole-image classifiers for Raman-microscopy-based cytopathology. Conceptually DCNNs facilitate a flexible combination of spectral and spatial information for classifying cellular images as healthy or cancer-affected cells. As we demonstrate this conceptual advantage translates into practice where DCNNs exceed the accuracy of both conventional classifiers based on pixel spectra as well as classifiers based on morphological features extracted from Raman microscopic images. Remarkably accuracies exceeding those of all previously proposed classifiers are obtained while using only a small fraction of the spectral information provided by the dataset. Overall our results indicate a high potential for DCNNs in medical applications of not just Raman but also infrared microscopy. Hierarchical deep convolutional neural networks combine spectral and spatial information for highly accurate Raman-microscopy-based cytopathology.
