"Many biological and cognitive systems do not operate deep within one or other regime of activity. Instead they are poised at critical points located at\xa0phase transitions in their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality suggests that there may be general principles inducing this behaviour yet there is no well-founded theory for understanding how criticality is generated at a wide span of levels and contexts. In order to explore how criticality might emerge from general adaptive mechanisms we propose a simple learning rule that maintains an internal organizational structure from a specific family of systems at criticality. We implement the mechanism in artificial embodied agents controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation structure randomly sampled from an Ising model at critical temperature. Agents are evaluated in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the Mountain Car and the Acrobot double pendulum. In both cases the neural controller appears to reach a point of criticality which coincides with a transition point between two regimes of the agents behaviour. These results suggest that adaptation to criticality could be used as a general adaptive mechanism in some circumstances providing an alternative explanation for the pervasive presence of criticality in biological and cognitive systems."
