Research suggests that disruption of brain networks might explain cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis MS. The reliability and effectiveness of graph theoretic network metrics as measures of cognitive performance were tested in 37 people with MS and 23 controls. Specifically relationships with cognitive performance linear regression against the paced auditory serial addition test-3 seconds PASAT-3 symbol digit modalities test SDMT and attention network test and 1-month reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC of network metrics were measured using both resting-state functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data. Cognitive impairment was directly related to measures of brain network segregation and inversely related to network integration prediction of PASAT-3 by small worldness modularity characteristic path length R2\u2009=\u20090.55; prediction of SDMT by small worldness global efficiency and characteristic path length R2\u2009=\u20090.60. Reliability of the measures for 1 month in a subset of nine participants was mostly rated as good ICC >0.6 for both controls and MS patients in both functional and diffusion data but was highly dependent on the chosen parcellation and graph density with the 0.2-0.5 density range being the most reliable. This suggests that disrupted network organization predicts cognitive impairment in MS and its measurement is reliable for a 1-month period. These new findings support the hypothesis of network disruption as a major determinant of cognitive deficits in MS and the future possibility of the application of derived metrics as surrogate outcomes in trials of therapies for cognitive impairment.
