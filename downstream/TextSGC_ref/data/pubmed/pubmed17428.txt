The results indicated that a the LPQ was a valid instrument to assess the learning approaches of non-low-achieving Filipino college students; b the Deep and Achieving subscale scores of the LPQ were positively related to academic achievement even when the effects of school ability and prior academic achievement were controlled; and c with some slight exceptions the relationship between the LPQ scale scores and academic achievement were generally similar between male and female Filipino students. Implications for the study of student approaches to learning in different cultures and educational systems are discussed. Approaches to learning and academic achievement of Filipino students.
