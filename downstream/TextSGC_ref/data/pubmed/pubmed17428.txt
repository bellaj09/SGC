This report presents a VR system for evaluation of treatment plans used in radiotherapy RT developed to improve the understanding of the spatial relationships between the patient anatomy and the calculated dose distribution. The VR system offers visualization through interactive volume rendering of RT dose distribution and computed tomography CT and surface and line rendering of RT structures such as target volumes and organs at risk. The VR system has been installed and networked in a hospital room used for the daily RT conferences making stereoscopic viewing of treatment planning data for clinical cases possible. A virtual reality solution for evaluation of radiotherapy plans.
