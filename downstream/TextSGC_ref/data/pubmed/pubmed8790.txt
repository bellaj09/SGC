Left atrium segmentation and visualization serve as a fundamental and crucial role in clinical analysis and understanding of atrial fibrillation. However most of the existing methods are directly transmitting information which may cause redundant information to be passed to affect segmentation performance. Moreover they did not further consider atrial visualization after segmentation which leads to a lack of understanding of the essential atrial anatomy. Segmentation and visualization of left atrium through a unified deep learning framework.
