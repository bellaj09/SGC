To estimate epithermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression level in glioblastoma GBM patients using radiogenomic analysis of magnetic resonance images MRI. A comparative study using a deep convolutional neural network CNN-based regression deep neural network least absolute shrinkage and selection operator LASSO regression elastic net regression and linear regression with no regularization was carried out to estimate EGFR expression of 166 GBM patients. Except for the deep CNN case overfitting was prevented by using feature selection and loss values for each method were compared. The loss values in the training phase for deep CNN deep neural network Elastic net LASSO and the linear regression with no regularization were 2.90 8.69 7.13 14.63 and 21.76 respectively while in the test phase the loss values were 5.94 10.28 13.61 17.32 and 24.19 respectively. These results illustrate that the efficiency of the deep CNN approach is better than that of the other methods including Lasso regression which is a regression method known for its advantage in high-dimension cases. A comparison between deep CNN deep neural network and three other common regression methods was carried out and the efficiency of the CNN deep learning approach in comparison with other regression models was demonstrated.
