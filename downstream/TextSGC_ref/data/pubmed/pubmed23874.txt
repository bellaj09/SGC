"Microelectronic devices employ electrons for signaling whereas the nervous system signals using ions and chemicals. Bridging these signaling differences would benefit applications that range from biosensing to neuroprosthetics. Here we report the use of localized electrical signals to perform an operation common to chemical signaling in the nervous system. Specifically we employ electrical signals to restrain vesicles reversibly. We perform this operation using the stimuli-responsive aminopolysaccharide chitosan that is able to electrodeposit onto cathode surfaces in response to localized electrical stimuli. We show that surfactant-vesicles and liposomes can be co-deposited with chitosan and are entrapped i.e. restrained within the deposited films matrix. Vesicle co-deposition could be controlled spatially and temporally using microfabricated wafers with independent electrode addresses. Finally we show that vesicles restrained within the deposited chitosan matrix can be mobilized under mildly acidic conditions pH <6.5 that resolubilize chitosan. Potentially the ability to restrain and mobilize chemical signals that are segregated within vesicles may allow microfluidic systems to access the rich diversity offered by chemical signaling."
