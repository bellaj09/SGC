"Purpose: Neural network image reconstruction directly from measurement data is a relatively new field of research which until now has been limited to producing small single-slice images e.g. 1  128  128 . We proposed a more efficient network design for positron emission tomography called DirectPET which is capable of reconstructing multislice image volumes i.e. 16  400  400  from sinograms. Approach: Large-scale direct neural network reconstruction is accomplished by addressing the associated memory space challenge through the introduction of a specially designed Radon inversion layer. Using patient data we compare the proposed method to the benchmark ordered subsets expectation maximization OSEM algorithm using signal-to-noise ratio bias mean absolute error and structural similarity measures. In addition line profiles and full-width half-maximum measurements are provided for a sample of lesions. Results: DirectPET is shown capable of producing images that are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the OSEM target images in a fraction of the time. We also report on an experiment where DirectPET is trained to map low-count raw data to normal count target images demonstrating the methods ability to maintain image quality under a low-dose scenario. Conclusion: The ability of DirectPET to quickly reconstruct high-quality multislice image volumes suggests potential clinical viability of the method. However design parameters and performance boundaries need to be fully established before adoption can be considered." DirectPET: full-size neural network PET reconstruction from sinogram data.
