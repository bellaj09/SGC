Brain-machine interfaces BMIs have the potential to improve quality of life for thousands of motor-impaired individuals. Many different signal sources have been investigated for use in controlling a BMI including scalp EEG field potentials from inside and the surface of the cerebral cortex and single-neuron action potentials. A relatively unexplored region for recording signals is the epidural space. This study attempts to help determine the optimal spatial resolution of epidural and subdural electrode arrays using both a mathematical model and spatial spectral analysis. For rats optimal spacing for both epidural and subdural electrodes was approximately 0.7 mm. Optimal spatial resolution of epidural and subdural electrode arrays for brain-machine interface applications.
