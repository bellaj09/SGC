Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta REBOA is an adjunct technique for salvaging patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. Current REBOA training paradigms require large animals virtual reality simulators or human cadavers for acquisition of skills. These training strategies are expensive and resource intensive which may prevent widespread dissemination of REBOA. We have developed a low-cost near-physiologic pulsatile REBOA simulator by connecting an anatomic vascular circuit constructed out of latex and polyvinyl chloride tubing to a commercially available pump. This pulsatile simulator is capable of generating cardiac outputs ranging from 1.7 to 6.8 L/min with corresponding arterial blood pressures of 54 to 226/14 to 121 mmHg. The simulator accommodates a 12 French introducer sheath and a CODA balloon catheter. Upon balloon inflation the arterial waveform distal to the occlusion flattens distal pulsation within the simulator is lost and systolic blood pressures proximal to the balloon catheter increase by up to 62 mmHg. Further development and validation of this simulator will allow for refinement reduction and replacement of large animal models costly virtual reality simulators and perfused cadavers for training purposes. This will ultimately facilitate the low-cost high-fidelity REBOA simulation needed for the widespread dissemination of this life-saving technique.
