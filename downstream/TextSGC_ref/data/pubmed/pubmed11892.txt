Pulse feeling  representing the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine TCM to diagnose various diseases. The quantitative relationship between the pulse wave and health conditions however has not been investigated in modern medicine. In this paper we explored the correlation between pulse pressure wave PPW rather than the pulse key features in TCM and pregnancy by using deep learning technology. This computational approach shows that the accuracy of pregnancy detection by the PPW is 84% with an area under the curve AUC of 91%. Our study is a proof of concept of pulse diagnosis and will also motivate further sophisticated investigations on pulse waves. A machine learning method correlating pulse pressure wave data with pregnancy.
