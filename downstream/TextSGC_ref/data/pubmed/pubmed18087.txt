Spatial augmented reality is especially interesting for the design process of a car because a lot of virtual content and corresponding real objects are used. One important issue in such a process is that the designer can trust the visualized colors on the real object because design decisions are made on basis of the projection. In this paper we present an interactive visualization technique which is able to exactly compute the RGB values for the projected image so that the resulting colors on the real object are equally perceived as the real desired colors. Our approach computes the influences of the ambient light the material the pose and the color model of the projector to the resulting colors of the projected RGB values by using a physically based computation. This information allows us to compute the adjustment for the RGB values for varying projector positions at interactive rates. Since the amount of projectable colors does not only depend on the material and the ambient light but also on the pose of the projector our method can be used to interactively adjust the range of projectable colors by moving the projector to arbitrary positions around the real object. We further extend the mentioned method so that it is applicable to multiple projectors. All methods are evaluated in a number of experiments.
