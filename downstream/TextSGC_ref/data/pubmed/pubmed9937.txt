Ballistocardiography BCG is a revamped technology for cardiac function monitoring. Detecting individual heart beats in BCG remains a challenging task due to various artifacts and low signal-to-noise ratio which are not well addressed by conventional approaches based on intuitive observations of BCG waveforms. In this paper we propose to employ deep learning networks to capture the characteristics of the variations of BCG waveforms within and across individual subjects. Particularly we design a neural network that combines Convolutional-Neural-Network CNN and Extreme Learning Machine ELM. We test the new learning method on a real BCG data set and show better detection result compared with a state-of-the-art method. We demonstrate how the advanced machine learning technology can learn and detect BCG waveforms robustly. A Novel Deep Learning based Neural Network for Heartbeat Detection in Ballistocardiograph.
