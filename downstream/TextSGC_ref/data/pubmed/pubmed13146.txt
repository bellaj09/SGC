In the paper we propose a new deep learning-based method for segmenting nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC in the nasopharynx from three orthogonal CT images. The proposed method introduces a cascade strategy composed of two-phase manners. In CT images there are organs called non-target organs which NPC never invades. Therefore the first phase is to detect and eliminate non-target organ regions from the CT images. In the second phase NPC is extracted from the remained regions in the CT images. Convolutional neural networks CNNs are applied to detect non-target organs and NPCs. The proposed system determines the final NPC segmentation by integrating three results obtained from coronal axial and sagittal images. Moreover we construct two CNN-based NPC detection systems using one kind of overlapping patches with a fixed size and various overlapping patches with different sizes. From the experiments using CT images of 70 NPC patients our proposed systems especially the system using various patches achieves the best performance for detecting NPC compared with conventional NPC detection methods. 3D segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from CT images using cascade deep learning.
