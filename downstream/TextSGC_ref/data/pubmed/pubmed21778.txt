Although post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD is well treatable many people do not get the desired treatment due to barriers to care such as stigma and cost. This paper presents a system that bridges this gap by enabling patients to follow therapy at home. A therapist is only involved remotely to monitor progress and serve as a safety net. With this system patients can recollect their memories in a digital diary and recreate them in a 3D WorldBuilder. Throughout the therapy a virtual agent is present to inform and guide patients through the sessions employing an ontology-based question module for recollecting traumatic memories to further elicit a detailed memory recollection. In a usability study with former PTSD patients n\xa0=\xa04 these questions were found useful for memory recollection. Moreover the usability of the whole system was rated positively. This system has the potential to be a valuable addition to the spectrum of PTSD treatments offering a novel type of home therapy assisted by a virtual agent.
