We present a complicated case of spontaneous cerebrospinal otorrhea which had not been cured despite undergoing 5 surgical interventions in the past. The disability to identify the location of the fistula was the main crux of the past failures. On this occasion stereoscopic virtual reality presurgical planning was applied to identify the exact location of the fistula and a surgical simulation was performed and was later confirmed during the actual operation. Interactive manipulation in a stereoscopic virtual environment makes the decision making process easier in the treatment of cerebrospinal otorrhea. Stereoscopic virtual reality presurgical planning for cerebrospinal otorrhea.
