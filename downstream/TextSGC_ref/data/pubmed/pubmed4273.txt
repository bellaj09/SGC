One of the most fundamental features of the human brain is its ability to detect and attend to salient goal-relevant events in a flexible manner. The salience network SN anchored in the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex plays a crucial role in this process through rapid detection of goal-relevant events and facilitation of access to appropriate cognitive resources. Here we leverage the subsecond resolution of large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and apply novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We show that the large-scale brain dynamics of the SN are characterized by several distinctive and robust properties. First the SN demonstrated the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks including the frontoparietal network FPN the cingulate-opercular network CON and the ventral and dorsal attention networks VAN and DAN. Second dynamic functional interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain. Third SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions. Fourth time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems. Fifth temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. Importantly each of these results was also observed in a second retest dataset demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our study provides fundamental new insights into the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN and demonstrates how this network is uniquely positioned to facilitate interactions with multiple functional systems and thereby support a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
