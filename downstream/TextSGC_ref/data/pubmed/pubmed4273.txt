The human brain is functionally organized into large-scale neural networks that are dynamically interconnected. Multiple short-lived states of resting-state functional connectivity rsFC identified transiently synchronized networks and cross-network integration. However little is known about the way brain couplings covary as rsFC states wax and wane. In this magnetoencephalography study we explore the synchronization structure among the spontaneous interactions of well-known resting-state networks RSNs. To do so we extracted modes of dynamic coupling that reflect rsFC synchrony and analyzed their spatio-temporal features. These modes identified transient sporadic rsFC changes characterized by the widespread integration of RSNs across the brain most prominently in the  band. This is in line with the metastable rsFC state model of resting-state dynamics wherein our modes fit as state transition processes. Furthermore the default-mode network DMN stood out as being structured into competitive cross-network couplings with widespread DMN-RSN interactions especially among the -band modes. These results substantiate the theory that the DMN is a core network enabling dynamic global brain integration in the  band. Synchrony metastability dynamic integration and competition in the spontaneous functional connectivity of the human brain.
