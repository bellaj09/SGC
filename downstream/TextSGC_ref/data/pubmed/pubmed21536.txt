Transcranial direct stimulation tDCS is a technique for modulating brain excitability that has potential to be used in motor neurorehabilitation by enhancing motor activity such as motor imagery MI. tDCS effects depend on different factors like current density and the position of the stimulating electrodes. This study presents preliminary results of the evaluation of the effect of current density on MI performance by measuring right-hand/feet MI accuracy of classification from electroencephalographic EEG measurements after anodal tDCS is applied with a 41 ring montage over the right-hand or feet motor cortex. Results suggest that there might be an enhancement of feet MI when tDCS is applied over the right-hand motor cortex but further evaluation is required. If results are confirmed with a larger sample the montage could be used to optimize feet MI performance and improve the outcome of MI-based brain-computer interfaces which are used during motor neurorehabilitation.
