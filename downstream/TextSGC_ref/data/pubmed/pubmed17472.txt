Objectives: The Biopsym simulator a virtual-reality simulator for prostate biopsies was designed to offer enhanced teaching of the biopsy procedure. The objectives of the present article are to describe the new version of the simulator and report the results of a new validation study. Material and methods: A prospective validation study was conducted between January and March 2017. The new version of the simulator with improved physical realism ultrasound image deformation and a new scoring system was evaluated by novice and confirmed users. Results: Twenty-one users evaluated the simulator including ten novices and 11 confirmed users. The overall realism of the biopsy procedure was rated at 7.7/10 IQR 5.7-9. The differences between the rates given by confirmed users and novices were not statistically significant. The median overall score obtained for the performance of 12 systematic ultrasound-guided biopsies was 43% IQR 33-55. The median score obtained by confirmed users was 54% IQR 46-62 and the median score obtained by novices was 31% IQR 20-35. The difference between the scores was statistically significant p\u2009=\u20090.005. Conclusions: This study allowed us to gather evidence towards the validation and particularly towards the construct validation of the new version of the Biopsym simulator. Simulation-based training for prostate biopsies: towards the validation of the Biopsym simulator.
