Rumination is a perseverative thinking style that is associated with adverse mental and physical health. Stressful situations have been considered as a trigger for this kind of thinking. Until today there are mixed findings with respect to the relations of functional connectivity FC and rumination. The study at hand aimed to investigate in how far high and low ruminators would show elevated levels of state rumination after a stress induction and if these changes would show corresponding changes in FC in the cognitive control network CCN and dorsal attention network DAN. 23 high and 22 low trait ruminators underwent resting-state measurements before and after a stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test TSST. Changes in rsFC through the TSST were measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy within and between regions of the CCN. Stress successfully induced state\xa0rumination in both groups but stronger in the high trait ruminators. High trait ruminators showed elevated FC within the CCN at baseline but attenuated increase in FC following the TSST. Increases in FC correlated negatively with state rumination. A lack of FC reactivity within the CCN in high ruminators might reflect reduced network integration between brain regions necessary for emotion regulation and cognitive control. Disrupted prefrontal functional connectivity during post-stress adaption in high ruminators.
