"Deciphering the massive volume of complex electronic data that has been compiled by hospital systems over the past decades has the potential to revolutionize modern medicine as well as present significant challenges. Deep learning is uniquely suited to address these challenges and recent advances in techniques and hardware have poised the field of medical machine learning for transformational growth. The clinical neurosciences are particularly well positioned to benefit from these advances given the subtle presentation of symptoms typical of neurologic disease. Here we review the various domains in which deep learning algorithms have already provided impetus for change-areas such as medical image analysis for the improved diagnosis of Alzheimers disease and the early detection of acute neurologic events; medical image segmentation for quantitative evaluation of neuroanatomy and vasculature; connectome mapping for the diagnosis of Alzheimers autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and mining of microscopic electroencephalogram signals and granular genetic signatures. We additionally note important challenges in the integration of deep learning tools in the clinical setting and discuss the barriers to tackling the challenges that currently exist."
