We evaluated the ability of a virtual reality VR system to reliably detect the reaching frequency midline position of a user; the distinguishing plane between free-choice use of the left and right hand. The paradigm utilized the Leap Motion Hand Tracker along with a custom script written in C# and was realized through a Unity3D application. Stimuli appeared in random locations on the computer screen and required the participant to reach with the hand of their choice to contact them with a virtually coupled hand inside the virtual space. We investigated the effects of two manipulations of effort on the free-choice reaching of either the left or right hand. We varied the height of target positions and applied an additional weight to the non-dominant left hand. We observed main effects of height and weight on reaching frequency midline positions across the group. We found increased use of the dominant hand as stimuli height increased as well as a significant increase in overall use of the dominant right hand when a weighted-glove was worn by the non-dominant left hand. Our results are in line with previously published research on hand selection from similar paradigms supporting the use of our VR paradigm in future experiments and applications.
