"Most deaths 80% from cervical cancer occur in regions lacking adequate screening infrastructures or ready access to them. In contrast most developed countries now embrace human papillomavirus HPV analyses as standalone screening; this transition threatens to further widen the resource gap. Methods: We describe the development of a DNA-focused digital microholography platform for point-of-care HPV screening with automated readouts driven by customized deep-learning algorithms. In the presence of high-risk HPV 16 or 18 DNA microbeads were designed to bind the DNA targets and form microbead dimers. The resulting holographic signature of the microbeads was recorded and analyzed. Results: The HPV DNA assay showed excellent sensitivity down to a single cell and specificity 100% concordance in detecting HPV 16 and 18 DNA from cell lines. Our deep learning approach was 120-folder faster than the traditional reconstruction method and completed the analysis in < 2 min using a single CPU. In a blinded clinical study using patient cervical brushings we successfully benchmarked our platforms performance to an FDA-approved HPV assay. Conclusions: Reliable and decentralized HPV testing will facilitate cataloguing the high-risk HPV landscape in underserved populations revealing HPV coverage gaps in existing vaccination strategies and informing future iterations."
