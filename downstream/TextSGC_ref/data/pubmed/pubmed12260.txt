Detection of dysmorphic cells in peripheral blood PB smears is essential in diagnostic screening of hematological diseases. Myelodysplastic syndromes MDS are hematopoietic neoplasms characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis which diagnosis is mainly based on morphological findings of PB and bone marrow. We developed an automated diagnostic support system of MDS by combining an automated blood cell image-recognition system using a deep learning system DLS powered by convolutional neural networks CNNs with a decision-making system using extreme gradient boosting XGBoost. The DLS of blood cell image-recognition has been trained using datasets consisting of 695030 blood cell images taken from 3261 PB smears including hematopoietic malignancies. The DLS simultaneously classified 17 blood cell types and 97 morphological features of such cells with >93.5% sensitivity and >96.0% specificity. The automated MDS diagnostic system successfully differentiated MDS from aplastic anemia AA with high accuracy; 96.2% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity AUC 0.990. This is the first CNN-based automated initial diagnostic system for MDS using PB smears which is applicable to develop new automated diagnostic systems for various hematological disorders. A novel automated image analysis system using deep convolutional neural networks can assist to differentiate MDS and AA.
