Ultrasound US imaging offers advantages over other imaging modalities and has become the most widespread modality for many diagnostic and interventional procedures. However traditional 2D US requires a long training period especially to learn how to manipulate the probe. A hybrid interactive system based on mixed reality was designed implemented and tested for hand-eye coordination training in diagnostic and interventional US. Hybrid simulation using mixed reality for interventional ultrasound imaging training.
