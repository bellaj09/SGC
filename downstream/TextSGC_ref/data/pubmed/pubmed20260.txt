"Recently auralizations have become more prevalent in architectural acoustics and virtual reality. However there have been few studies examining the perceptual quality achievable by room acoustic simulations and auralizations. Such studies have highlighted potential problems in creating perceptually equivalent simulations when compared to measured auralizations in terms of parameter estimation. In order to accomplish realistic auralizations calibration of the geometrical acoustics model can be considered a necessary step. In situations where the studied space exists well-calibrated auralizations can be employed for multiple purposes such as multi-modal virtual reality explorations studies of the acoustical influence of renovations and historic research. Using this case type as a base a perceptual study evaluating state-of-the-art binaural auralizations has been carried out. Three test sites of different complexity and acoustics were selected: the abbey church Saint-Germain-des-Prs the cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris and the Thtre de lAthne. Models were calibrated according to omni-directional source-receiver measurements for reverberation and clarity parameters. In the subjective listening test measured and simulated binaural auralizations were compared according to eight acoustic perceptual attributes. Results showed that the methodical calibration procedure employed in combination with attention to control factors led to ecologically/perceptually valid auralizations."
