Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder yet the search for definite genetic etiologies remains elusive. Delineating ASD endophenotypes can boost the statistical power to identify the genetic etiologies and pathophysiology of ASD. We aimed to test for endophenotypes of neuroanatomy and associated intrinsic functional connectivity iFC via contrasting male youth with ASD their unaffected brothers and typically developing TD males. Shared atypical brain anatomy and intrinsic functional architecture in male youth with autism spectrum disorder and their unaffected brothers.
