Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy pCLE enables in vivo in situ tissue characterisation without changes in the surgical setting and simplifies the oncological surgical workflow. The potential of this technique in identifying residual cancer tissue and improving resection rates of brain tumours has been recently verified in pilot studies. The interpretation of endomicroscopic information is challenging particularly for surgeons who do not themselves routinely review histopathology. Also the diagnosis can be examiner-dependent leading to considerable inter-observer variability. Therefore automatic tissue characterisation with pCLE would support the surgeon in establishing diagnosis as well as guide robot-assisted intervention procedures.
