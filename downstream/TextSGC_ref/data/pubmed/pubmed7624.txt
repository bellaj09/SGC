Deep Neural Networks DNNs have achieved extraordinary success in numerous areas. However DNNs often carry a large number of weight parameters leading to the challenge of heavy memory and computation costs. Overfitting is another challenge for DNNs when the training data are insufficient. These challenges severely hinder the application of DNNs in resource-constrained platforms. In fact many network weights are redundant and can be removed from the network without much loss of performance. In this paper we introduce a new non-convex integrated transformed 1 regularizer to promote sparsity for DNNs which removes redundant connections and unnecessary neurons simultaneously. Specifically we apply the transformed 1 regularizer to the matrix space of network weights and utilize it to remove redundant connections. Besides group sparsity is integrated to remove unnecessary neurons. An efficient stochastic proximal gradient algorithm is presented to solve the new model. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to develop a non-convex regularizer in sparse optimization based method to simultaneously promote connection-level and neuron-level sparsity for DNNs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Transformed 1 regularization for learning sparse deep neural networks.
