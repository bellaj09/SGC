Normal aging is associated with changes in cognitive function that are non-pathological and are not necessarily indicative of future neurocognitive disease. Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that subtle cognitive changes detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive impairment are met may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention and reduction in disease risk research also suggests that engaging in stimulating mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces dementia risk. Therefore midlife defined here as 40 to 65 years may be a suitable time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and in the longer term possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia. Computerised cognitive training for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife.
