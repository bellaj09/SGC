"Metagenomics is an approach for characterizing environmental microbial communities in situ it allows their functional and taxonomic characterization and to recover sequences from uncultured taxa. This is often achieved by a combination of sequence assembly and binning where sequences are grouped into bins representing taxa of the underlying microbial community. Assignment to low-ranking taxonomic bins is an important challenge for binning methods as is scalability to Gb-sized datasets generated with deep sequencing techniques. One of the best available methods for species bins recovery from deep-branching phyla is the expert-trained PhyloPythiaS package where a human expert decides on the taxa to incorporate in the model and identifies training sequences based on marker genes directly from the sample. Due to the manual effort involved this approach does not scale to multiple metagenome samples and requires substantial expertise which researchers who are new to the area do not have."
