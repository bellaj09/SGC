Bone sawing is widely used in orthognathic surgery to correct maxillary deformities. Successful execution of bone sawing requires a high level of dexterity and experience. A virtual reality VR surgical simulator can provide a safe cost-effective and repeatable training method. In this study we developed a VR training simulator with haptic functions to simulate bone-sawing force which was generated by the experimental force model. Ten human skulls were obtained in this study for the determination of surgical bone-sawing force. Using a 5-DOF machining center and a micro-reciprocating saw bone specimens with different bone density were sawed at different feed rates 20 40 and 60\u2009mm/min and spindle speeds 9800 11200 and 12600 cycles per minute. The sawing forces were recorded with a piezoelectric dynamometer and a signal acquisition system. Linear correlation analysis of all experimental data indicates that there were significant positive linear correlations between bone-sawing force and bone density and tool feed rate and a moderate negative linear correlation with tool spindle rate. By performing multiple regression analysis the prediction models for the bone-sawing procedure were determined. By employing Omega.6 as a haptic device a medical simulator for the Lefort I osteotomy was developed based on an experimental force model. Comparison of the force-time curve acquired through experiments and the curve computed from the simulator indicate that the obtained forces based on the experimental force model and the acquired data had the same trend for the bone-sawing procedure of orthognathic surgery.
