Resistance to drought stress is one of the most favorable traits in breeding programs yet drought stress is one of the most poorly addressed biological processes for both phenomics and genetics. In this study we investigated the potential of using a time-series chlorophyll fluorescence ChlF analysis to dissect the ChlF fingerprints of salt overly sensitive SOS mutants under drought stress. Principle component analysis PCA was used to identify a shifting pattern of different genotypes including sos mutants and wild type WT Col-0. A time-series deep-learning algorithm sparse auto encoders SAEs neural network was applied to extract time-series ChlF features which were used in four classification models including linear discriminant analysis LDA k-nearest neighbor classifier KNN Gaussian naive Bayes NB and support vector machine SVM. The results showed that the discrimination accuracy of sos mutants SOS1-1 SOS2-3 and wild type Col-0 reached 95% with LDA classification model. Sequential forward selection SFS algorithm was used to obtain ChlF fingerprints of the shifting pattern which could address the response of sos mutants and Col-0 to drought stress over time. Parameters including QY NPQ and Fm etc. were significantly different between sos mutants and WT. This research proved the potential of ChlF imaging for gene function analysis and the study of drought stress using ChlF in a time-series manner.
