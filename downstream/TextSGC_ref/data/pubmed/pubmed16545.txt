"The FDA has approved a multicenter double-blind Phase III pivotal trial testing deep brain stimulation DBS in 280 people with very early stage Parkinsons disease PD; IDE#G050016. In partnership with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research we conducted a survey to investigate motivating factors barriers and gender differences among potentially eligible patients for participation in a trial testing DBS in early PD compared to standard medical treatment. The majority of survey respondents 72% indicated they would consider learning more about participating. Early PD patients are therefore likely to consider enrolling in trials of invasive therapies that may slow symptom progression and help future patients."
