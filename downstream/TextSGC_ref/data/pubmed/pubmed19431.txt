"Since the first French flight in space in 1982 the CNES has developed a wide range of instruments especially in the field of Neurosciences. The design of these instruments has considerably evolved from rather simple equipment up to much more sophisticated tools that are being specially tailored for these missions. Four major phases can be identified: -a simple adaptation of an echographe leading to the first neurosciences experiments the ARAGATZ88 mission -the ILLUSIONS and VIMINAL instruments used during the ANTARES92 and ALTAIR93 missions -the COGNILAB instrument developed for the CASSIOPEE96 mission to be re-used in 1997 and in 1999 -a preliminary design of the 1999 mission payload including virtual reality concepts in a modular design to adapt to the European COF. Aside from the evolution of scientific requirements the experience gained during the flights led to progressive improvements in the different technical parts including visual system body restraint systems accessories such as a force feedback joystick computer and software etc. This paper describes the technical evolutions in the CNES Neurosciences program."
