Convolutional neural networks CNNs are extensively used in cardiac image analysis. However heart localization has become a prerequisite to these networks since it decreases the size of input images. Accordingly recent CNNs benefit from deeper architectures in gaining abstract semantic information. In the present study a deep learning-based method was developed for heart localization in cardiac MR images. Further Network in Network NIN was used as the region proposal network RPN of the faster R-CNN and then NIN Faster-RCNN NF-RCNN was proposed. NIN architecture is formed based on "MLPCONV" layer a combination of convolutional network and multilayer perceptron MLP. Therefore it could deal with the complicated structures of MR images. Furthermore two sets of cardiac MRI dataset were used to evaluate the network and all the evaluation metrics indicated an absolute superiority of the proposed network over all related networks. In addition FROC curve precision-recall PR analysis and mean localization error were employed to evaluate the proposed network. In brief the results included an AUC value of 0.98 for FROC curve a mean average precision of 0.96 for precision-recall curve and a mean localization error of 6.17\xa0mm. Moreover a deep learning-based approach for the right ventricle wall motion analysis WMA was performed on the first dataset and the effect of the heart localization on this algorithm was studied. The results revealed that NF-RCNN increased the speed and decreased the required memory significantly. NF-RCNN: Heart localization and right ventricle wall motion abnormality detection in cardiac MRI.
