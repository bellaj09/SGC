Tracking scientific research publications on the evaluation utility and implementation of genomic applications is critical for the translation of basic research to impact clinical and population health. In this work we utilize state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to identify translational research in genomics beyond bench to bedside from the biomedical literature. We apply the convolutional neural networks CNNs and support vector machines SVMs to the bench/bedside article classification on the weekly manual annotation data of the Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base database. Both classifiers employ salient features to determine the probability of curation-eligible publications which can effectively reduce the workload of manual triage and curation process. We applied the CNNs and SVMs to an independent test set n\xa0=\xa0400 and the models achieved the F-measure of 0.80 and 0.74 respectively. We further tested the CNNs which perform better results on the routine annotation pipeline for 2\xa0weeks and significantly reduced the effort and retrieved more appropriate research articles. Our approaches provide direct insight into the automated curation of genomic translational research beyond bench to bedside. The machine learning classifiers are found to be helpful for annotators to enhance the efficiency of manual curation.
