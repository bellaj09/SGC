In recent years research on Brain-Computer Interface BCI technology for healthy users has attracted considerable interest and BCI games are especially popular. This study reviews the current status of and describes future directions in the field of BCI games. To this end we conducted a literature search and found that BCI control paradigms using electroencephalographic signals motor imagery P300 steady state visual evoked potential and passive approach reading mental state have been the primary focus of research. We also conducted a survey of nearly three hundred participants that included researchers game developers and users around the world. From this survey we found that all three groups researchers developers and users agreed on the significant influence and applicability of BCI and BCI games and they all selected prostheses rehabilitation and games as the most promising BCI applications. User and developer groups tended to give low priority to passive BCI and the whole head sensor array. Developers gave higher priorities to "the easiness of playing" and the "development platform" as important elements for BCI games and the market. Based on our assessment we discuss the critical point at which BCI games will be able to progress from their current stage to widespread marketing to consumers. In conclusion we propose three critical elements important for expansion of the BCI game market: standards gameplay and appropriate integration. A review of brain-computer interface games and an opinion survey from researchers developers and users.
