Surgical workflow recognition and context-aware systems could allow better decision making and surgical planning by providing the focused information which may eventually enhance surgical outcomes. While current developments in computer-assisted surgical systems are mostly focused on recognizing surgical phases they lack recognition of surgical workflow sequence and other contextual element e.g. "Instruments." Our study proposes a hybrid approach i.e. using deep learning and knowledge representation to facilitate recognition of the surgical workflow. "Deep-Onto" network for surgical workflow and context recognition.
