"The function of a neural circuit is determined by the details of its synaptic connections. At present the only available method for determining a neural wiring diagram with single synapse precision-a connectome-is based on imaging methods that are slow labor-intensive and expensive. Here we present SYNseq a method for converting the connectome into a form that can exploit the speed and low cost of modern high-throughput DNA sequencing. In SYNseq each neuron is labeled with a unique random nucleotide sequence-an RNA barcode-which is targeted to the synapse using engineered proteins. Barcodes in pre- and postsynaptic neurons are then associated through protein-protein crosslinking across the synapse extracted from the tissue and joined into a form suitable for sequencing. Although our failure to develop an efficient barcode joining scheme precludes the widespread application of this approach we expect that with further development SYNseq will enable tracing of complex circuits at high speed and low cost."
