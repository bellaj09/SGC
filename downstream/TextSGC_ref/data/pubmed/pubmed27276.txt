"As we move through an environment we are constantly making assessments judgments and decisions about the things we encounter. Some are acted upon immediately but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions-our implicit labeling of the world. In this paper we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain-computer interface hBCI system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment." Neurally and ocularly informed graph-based models for searching 3D environments.
