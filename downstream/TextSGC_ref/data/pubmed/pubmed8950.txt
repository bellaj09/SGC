After a brief outline of Catha edulis F. khat and the cannabinoid systems the interactions between the pharmacological effects of khat and cannabinoids will be reviewed. Khat chewing is a widespread habit that has a deep-rooted sociocultural tradition in Africa and the Middle East. Experimental studies conducted to investigate khat\s central and peripheral effects have revealed an amphetamine-like mechanism of action mediated through the dopaminergic system. The endocannabinoid system comprises the receptors the endogenous agonists and the related biochemical machinery responsible for synthesizing these substances and terminating their actions. Endocannabinoids are synthesized "on demand" from membrane phospholipids and then rapidly cleared by cellular uptake and enzymatic degradation. Khat and cannabinoids produce a body of parallel and contrasting behavioral effects. Concurrent consumption of khat and cannabinoids may increase the risk of getting or precipitating psychosis has rewarding and motivational effect increases the threshold of pain perception and impairs learning and memory. On the other hand the action of cannabis to enhance food intake is likely to reduce khat\s appetite suppressant effects.
