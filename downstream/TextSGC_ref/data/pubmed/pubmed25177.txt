Aiming at a better specification of the concept of "control" in brain-computer-interfaces BCIs and neurofeedback NF research we propose to distinguish "self-control of brain activity" from the broader concept of "BCI control" since the first describes a neurocognitive phenomenon and is only one of the many components of "BCI control". Based on this distinction we developed a framework based on dual-processes theory that describes the cognitive determinants of self-control of brain activity as the interplay of automatic vs. controlled information processing. Further we distinguish between cognitive processes that are necessary and sufficient to achieve a given level of self-control of brain activity and those which are not. We discuss that those cognitive processes which are not necessary for the learning process can hamper self-control because they cannot be completely turned-off at any time. This framework aims at a comprehensive description of the cognitive determinants of the acquisition of self-control of brain activity underlying those classes of BCI which require the user to achieve regulation of brain activity as well as NF learning. On the need to better specify the concept of "control" in brain-computer-interfaces/neurofeedback research.
