Meningioma is the second most commonly encountered tumor type in the brain. There are three grades of meningioma by the standards of the World Health Organization. Preoperative grade prediction of meningioma is extraordinarily important for clinical treatment planning and prognosis evaluation. In this paper we present a new deep learning model for assisting automatic prediction of meningioma grades to reduce the recurrence of meningioma. Our model is based on an improved LeNet-5 model of convolutional neural network CNN and does not require the extraction of the diseased tissue which can greatly enhance the efficiency. To address the issue of insufficient and unbalanced clinical data of meningioma images we use an oversampling technique which allows us to considerably improve the accuracy of classification. Experiments on large clinical datasets show that our model can achieve quite high accuracy i.e. as high as 83.33% for the classification of meningioma images.
