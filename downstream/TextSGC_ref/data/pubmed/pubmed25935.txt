"Neurofeedback NF is a form of biofeedback based on the self-modulation of brain activity; it aims to enhance mental and behavioral performances. The user modifies his brain functions thanks to EEG-mediated self-regulation and therapists guidance. Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI have provided new evidence on the effectiveness of NF in reinforcing cognitive functions expecially in children with ADHD. The applications on adults with cognitive deficits are still few. The study aims to investigate the possible effect of NF techniques on cognitive performance of patients with Parkinsons disease PD in terms of changes in scores at the neurocognitive assessment. Ten PD patients staged according to Hoehn & Yahr scale and cognitively evaluated were recruited." "Neurofeedback in Parkinsons disease: technologies in speech and language therapy."
