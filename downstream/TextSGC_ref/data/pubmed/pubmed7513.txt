Selecting particles from digital micrographs is an essential step in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy cryo-EM. As manual selection of complete datasets-typically comprising thousands of particles-is a tedious and time-consuming process numerous\xa0automatic particle pickers have been developed. However non-ideal datasets pose a challenge to particle picking. Here we present the\xa0particle picking software crYOLO which is based on the deep-learning object detection system You Only Look Once YOLO. After training the network with 200-2500 particles per dataset it automatically recognizes particles with high recall and precision while\xa0reaching a speed of up to five micrographs per second. Further we present a general\xa0crYOLO network able\xa0to pick from previously unseen datasets allowing for completely automated on-the-fly cryo-EM data preprocessing during data acquisition. crYOLO is available as a standalone program under http://sphire.mpg.de/ and is distributed as\xa0part of the image processing workflow in SPHIRE. SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM.
