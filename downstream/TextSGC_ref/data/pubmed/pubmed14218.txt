Human motion analysis can be applied to the diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases rehabilitation therapies fall detection and estimation of energy expenditure. To analyze human motion with micro-Doppler signatures measured by radar a deep learning algorithm is one of the most effective approaches. Because deep learning requires a large data set the high cost involved in measuring large amounts of human data is an intrinsic problem. The objective of this study is to augment human motion micro-Doppler data employing generative adversarial networks GANs to improve the accuracy of human motion classification.
