Regular mindfulness practice has been demonstrated to be beneficial for mental health but mindfulness can be challenging to adopt with environmental and personal distractors often cited as challenges. Virtual reality VR may address these challenges by providing an immersive environment for practicing mindfulness and by supporting the user to orient attention to the present moment within a tailored virtual setting.
