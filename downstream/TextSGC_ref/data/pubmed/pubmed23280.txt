"This paper proposed a novel bionic selective visual attention mechanism to quickly select regions that contain salient objects to reduce calculations. Firstly lateral inhibition filtering inspired by the limulus ommateum is applied to filter low-frequency noises. After the filtering operation we use Artificial Bee Colony ABC algorithm based selective visual attention mechanism to obtain the interested object to carry through the following recognition operation. In order to eliminate the camera motion influence this paper adopted ABC algorithm a new optimization method inspired by swarm intelligence to calculate the motion salience map to integrate with conventional visual attention. To prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our method several experiments were conducted. First the filtering results of lateral inhibition filter were shown to illustrate its noise reducing effect then we applied the ABC algorithm to obtain the motion features of the image sequence. The ABC algorithm is proved to be more robust and effective through the comparison between ABC algorithm and popular Particle Swarm Optimization PSO algorithm. Except for the above results we also compared the classic visual attention mechanism and our ABC algorithm based visual attention mechanism and the experimental results of which further verified the effectiveness of our method."
