"In his biography of Isaac Newton which forms the most recent production in this flourishing genre Niccol Guicciardini states as his first point of departure that Newtons work arose not from attempts to answer questions that came to him spontaneously but from addressing those posed by his contemporaries p. 20. Right he is to communicate to the larger audience for which he is writing this principal fruit of by now almost a century of professional history-of-science writing\xa0-\xa0a deep-seated awareness that every scientific view or finding even if looking timeless in retrospect has emerged from some given historical context that shows us where the scientist in question started and that helps explain how and in what direction they managed to venture beyond the original context. Indeed the same truth or rather truism applies to every genuine\xa0-\xa0that is in some way innovative and also worthwhile\xa0-\xa0contribution to scholarship. And so it is therefore with the three books here under review which I intend to examine with the following leading question in mind: what in each of them is new and what in what turns out to be new indeed has been worth learning?"
