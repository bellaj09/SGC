Near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is an optical imaging technology that has recently been investigated for use in a safe non-invasive brain-computer interface BCI for individuals with severe motor impairments. To date most NIRS-BCI studies have attempted to discriminate two mental states e.g. a mental task and rest which could potentially lead to a two-choice BCI system. In this study we attempted to automatically differentiate three mental states - specifically intentional activity due to 1 a mental arithmetic MA task and 2 a mental singing MS task and 3 an unconstrained "no-control NC" state - to investigate the feasibility of a three-choice system-paced NIRS-BCI. Automatic single-trial discrimination of mental arithmetic mental singing and the no-control state from prefrontal activity: toward a three-state NIRS-BCI.
