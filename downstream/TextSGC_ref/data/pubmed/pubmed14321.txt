"Automated detection and quantification of plant diseases would enable more rapid gains in plant breeding and faster scouting of farmers fields. However it is difficult for a simple algorithm to distinguish between the target disease and other sources of dead plant tissue in a typical field especially given the many variations in lighting and orientation. Training a machine learning algorithm to accurately detect a given disease from images taken in the field requires a massive amount of human-generated training data."
