The use of optical coherence tomography OCT images is increasing in the medical treatment of age-related macular degeneration AMD and thus the amount of data requiring analysis is increasing. Advances in machine-learning techniques may facilitate processing of large amounts of medical image data. Among deep-learning methods convolution neural networks CNNs show superior image recognition ability. This study aimed to build deep-learning models that could distinguish AMD from healthy OCT scans and to distinguish AMD with and without exudative changes without using a segmentation algorithm. Optical Coherence Tomography-Based Deep-Learning Models for Classifying Normal and Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Exudative and Non-Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration Changes.
