We developed a high-speed two-photon optical ribbon imaging system which combines galvo-mirrors for an arbitrary curve scan on a lateral plane and a tunable acoustic gradient-index lens for a 100\xa0kHz-1\xa0MHz axial scan. The system provides micrometer/millisecond spatiotemporal resolutions which enable continuous readout of functional dynamics from small and densely packed neurons in a living adult Drosophila brain. Compared to sparse sampling techniques the ribbon imaging modality avoids motion artifacts. Combined with a Drosophila anatomical connectome database which is the most complete among all model animals this technique paves the way toward establishing whole-brain functional connectome.
