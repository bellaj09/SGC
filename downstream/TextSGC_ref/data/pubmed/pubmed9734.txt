This paper describes the design training and evaluation of a deep neural network for removing noise from medical fluoroscopy videos. The method described in this work unlike the current standard techniques for video denoising is able to deliver a result quickly enough to be used in real-time scenarios. Furthermore this method is able to produce results of a similar quality to the existing industry-standard denoising techniques.
