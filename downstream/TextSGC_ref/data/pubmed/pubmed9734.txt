Compressive sensing CS spectroscopy is well known for developing a compact spectrometer which consists of two parts: compressively measuring an input spectrum and recovering the spectrum using reconstruction techniques. Our goal here is to propose a novel residual convolutional neural network ResCNN for reconstructing the spectrum from the compressed measurements. The proposed ResCNN comprises learnable layers and a residual connection between the input and the output of these learnable layers. The ResCNN is trained using both synthetic and measured spectral datasets. The results demonstrate that ResCNN shows better spectral recovery performance in terms of average root mean squared errors RMSEs and peak signal to noise ratios PSNRs than existing approaches such as the sparse recovery methods and the spectral recovery using CNN. Unlike sparse recovery methods ResCNN does not require a priori knowledge of a sparsifying basis nor prior information on the spectral features of the dataset. Moreover ResCNN produces stable reconstructions under noisy conditions. Finally ResCNN is converged faster than CNN. Compressive Sensing Spectroscopy Using a Residual Convolutional Neural Network.
