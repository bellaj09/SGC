In biomedical text mining named entity recognition NER is an important task used to extract information from biomedical articles. Previously proposed methods for NER are dictionary- or rule-based methods and machine learning approaches. However these traditional approaches are heavily reliant on large-scale dictionaries target-specific rules or well-constructed corpora. These methods to NER have been superseded by the deep learning-based approach that is independent of hand-crafted features. However although such methods of NER employ additional conditional random fields CRF to capture important correlations between neighboring labels they often do not incorporate all the contextual information from text into the deep learning layers.
