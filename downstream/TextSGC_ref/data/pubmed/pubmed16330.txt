We have developed the Universal Cardiac Introducer UCI with the aim of modernizing the off-pump closed beating intracardiac approach. This paper reports our ongoing experience with positioning of a prosthetic MV under image-guidance substituting for direct vision. The UCI is comprised of two detachable parts: an attachment-cuff and an airlock-introductory chamber for bulky tools. A prosthetic MV was introduced into the left atrium in 12 pigs via the UCI LA appendage. Transesophageal and 4D epicardial ultrasound were used for guidance. Limitations of ultrasound imaging prompted the development of a multimodality virtual reality VR system introduced in the last three animals. There were no complications associated with cardiac access while achieving proper valve positioning. TEE contributed to navigating while 4D epicardial ultrasound was adequate for positioning the prosthesis into the MV orifice. VR provided a 3D context for real-time US imaging with precise navigation and positioning using augmented reality representation of the valve. We demonstrated the feasibility of positioning MV prostheses via the UCI. These results suggest the tremendous potential of virtual reality in making access safe and effective for many intracardiac targets with the ultimate goal of a safe versatile clinical application. Mitral valve implantation using off-pump closed beating intracardiac surgery: a feasibility study.
