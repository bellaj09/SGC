"Target identification and contact selection are known contributors to variability in efficacy across different clinical indications of deep brain stimulation surgery. A retrospective analysis of responders to subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation SCC DBS for depression demonstrated the common impact of the electrical stimulation on a stereotypic connectome of converging white matter bundles forceps minor uncinate fasciculus cingulum and fronto-striatal fibers. To test the utility of a prospective connectomic approach for SCC DBS surgery this pilot study used the four-bundle tractography connectome blueprint to plan surgical targeting in 11 participants with treatment-resistant depression. Before surgery targets were selected individually using deterministic tractography. Selection of contacts for chronic stimulation was made by matching the post-operative probabilistic tractography map to the pre-surgical deterministic tractography map for each subject. Intraoperative behavioral responses were used as a secondary verification of location. A probabilistic tract map of all participants demonstrated inclusion of the four bundles as intended matching the connectome blueprint previously defined. Eight of 11 patients 72.7% were responders and 5 were remitters after 6 months of open-label stimulation. At one year 9 of 11 patients 81.8% were responders with 6 of them in remission. These results support the utility of a group probabilistic tractography map as a connectome blueprint for individualized patient-specific deterministic tractography targeting confirming retrospective findings previously published. This new method represents a connectomic approach to guide future SCC DBS studies."
