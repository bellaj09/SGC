To achieve more realistic simulations meteorologists develop and use models with increasing spatial and temporal resolution. The analyzing comparing and visualizing of resulting simulations becomes more and more challenging due to the growing amounts and multifaceted character of the data. Various data sources numerous variables and multiple simulations lead to a complex database. Although a variety of software exists suited for the visualization of meteorological data none of them fulfills all of the typical domain-specific requirements: support for quasi-standard data formats and different grid types standard visualization techniques for scalar and vector data visualization of the context e.g. topography and other static data support for multiple presentation devices used in modern sciences e.g. virtual reality a user-friendly interface and suitability for cooperative work.
