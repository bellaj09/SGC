Metacognitive learning strategies are based on instructional learning theory which promotes deep meaningful learning. Educators in a baccalaureate-level nuclear medicine technology program demonstrated that students enrolled in an online distance learning section of an introductory radiation protection and radiobiology course performed better when traditional instruction was supplemented with nontraditional metacognitive learning strategies. Empirical evidence of the effectiveness of concept mapping as a learning intervention for nuclear medicine technology students in a distance learning radiation protection and biology course.
