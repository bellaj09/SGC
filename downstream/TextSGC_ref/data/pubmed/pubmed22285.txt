This article reports on a study to identify electroencephalography EEG signals with potential to provide new BCI channels through mental motor imagery MMI. Leg motion was assessed to see if left and right leg MMI could be discriminated in the EEG. The study also explored simultaneous observation of leg movement as a means to enhance MMI evoked EEG signals. The results demonstrate that MMI of the left and right leg produce a contralateral preponderance of EEG alpha band desynchronization which can be spatially discriminated. This suggests that lower extremity MMI could provide signals for additional BCI channels. The study also shows that movement imitation enhances alpha band desynchronization during MMI and might provide a useful aid in the identification and training of BCI signals.
