An established deep neural network DNN based on transfer learning and a newly designed DNN were tested to predict the grade of meningiomas from magnetic resonance MR images in dogs and to determine the accuracy of classification of using pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted T1W and T2-weighted T2W MR images. The images were randomly assigned to a training set a validation set and a test set comprising 60% 10% and 30% of images respectively. The combination of DNN and MR sequence displaying the highest discriminating accuracy was used to develop an image classifier to predict the grading of new cases. The algorithm based on transfer learning using the established DNN did not provide satisfactory results whereas the newly designed DNN had high classification accuracy. On the basis of classification accuracy an image classifier built on the newly designed DNN using post-contrast T1W images was developed. This image classifier correctly predicted the grading of 8 out of 10 images not included in the data set.
