"In theory a safe approach to an intersection implies that drivers can simultaneously manage two scenarios: they either choose to cross or to give way to an oncoming vehicle. In this article we formalize the critical time for safe crossing CT cross  and the critical time for safe stopping CT stop  to represent crossing and stopping possibilities respectively. We describe these critical times in terms of affordances and empirically test their respective contribution to the drivers decision-making process. Using a driving simulator three groups of participants drove cars with identical acceleration capabilities and different braking capabilities. They were asked to try to cross an intersection where there was an oncoming vehicle if they deemed the maneuver to be safe. If not they could decide to stop or as a last resort make an emergency exit. The intersections were identical among groups. Results showed that although the crossing possibilities CT cross  were the same for all groups there were between-group differences in crossing frequency. This suggests that stopping possibilities CT stop  play a role in the drivers decision-making process in addition to the crossing possibilities. These results can be accounted for by a behavioral model of decision making and provide support for the hypothesis of choice between affordances." "Drivers decision-making when attempting to cross an intersection results from choice between affordances."
