The tracking of densely packed plant cells across microscopy image sequences is very challenging because their appearance change greatly over time. A local graph matching algorithm was proposed to track such cells by exploiting the tight spatial topology of neighboring cells and then an iterative searching strategy was used to grow the correspondence from a seed cell pair. Thus the performance of the existing tracking approach heavily relies on the robustness of finding seed cell pair. However the existing local graph matching algorithm cannot guarantee the correctness of the seed cell pair especially in unregistered image sequences or image sequences with large time intervals. In this paper we propose a DeepSeed local graph matching model to find seed cell pair robustly by combining local graph matching and CNN-based similarity learning which uses cells spatial-temporal contextual information and cell pairs similarity information. The CNN-based similarity learning is designed to learn cells deep feature and measure cell pairs similarity. Compared with the existing plant cell matching method the experimental results show that the DeepSeed local graph matching method can track most cells in unregistered image sequences. Moreover the DeepSeed tracking algorithm can accurately track cells across image sequences with large time intervals. DeepSeed Local Graph Matching for Densely Packed Cells Tracking.
