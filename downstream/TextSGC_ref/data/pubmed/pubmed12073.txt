Phalloplasty often requires free tissue transfer. There is ample literature describing flap-related outcomes but the microsurgical techniques including choice of recipient vessels have been an overlooked yet important topic. In this study we review the outcomes of our experience with the deep inferior epigastric artery DIEA and loco-regional veins and outline technical modifications that occurred during the study period METHODS:: A retrospective chart analysis of patients who underwent microsurgical phalloplasty between September 2016 and July 2019 was performed. Variables included flap design donor site and recipient vessels. The outcome measures were return to the operating room for flap compromise and partial or complete flap loss.
