"Stroke remains a leading cause of disability limiting independent ambulation in survivors and consequently affecting quality of life QOL. Recent technological advances in neural interfacing with robotic rehabilitation devices are promising in the context of gait rehabilitation. Here the X1 NASAs powered robotic lower limb exoskeleton is introduced as a potential diagnostic assistive and therapeutic tool for stroke rehabilitation. Additionally the feasibility of decoding lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during walking with the X1 from scalp electroencephalographic EEG signals--the first step towards the development of a brain-machine interface BMI system to the X1 exoskeleton--is demonstrated."
