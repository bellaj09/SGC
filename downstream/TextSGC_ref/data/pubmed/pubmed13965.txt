Convolutional neural networks have begun to surpass classical statistical- and atlas based machine learning techniques in medical image segmentation in recent years proving to be superior in performance and speed. However a major challenge that the community faces are mismatch between variability within training and evaluation datasets and therefore a dependency on proper data pre-processing. Intensity normalization is a widely applied technique for reducing the variance of the data for which there are several methods available ranging from uniformity transformation to histogram equalization. The current study analyses the influence of intensity normalization on cerebellum segmentation performance of a convolutional neural network CNN. Analysis of intensity normalization for optimal segmentation performance of a fully convolutional neural network.
