This study evaluated the effect of an extension ladder "walk-through" top design on kinetic and kinematic behaviors and the outward destabilizing forces induced on the ladder during transitioning at elevation. Thirty-two male participants performed stepping tasks between a ladder top and a roof at simulated elevation in a surround-screen virtual-reality system. The experimental conditions included a "walk-through" and a standard ladder top section supported on flat and sloped roof surfaces. Three force platforms were placed under the ladder section and in the roof to measure propulsion forces during transitions. A motion measurement system was used to record trunk kinematics. The frictional demand at the virtual ladder base was also calculated. The results indicate that under optimal ladder setup angle 75.5\xa0 the frictional demand at the ladder base remains relatively small for all experimental conditions. Also the "walk through" ladder top eased the ladder-to-roof transitions but not the roof-to-ladder transitions. Evaluation of a "walk-through" ladder top design during ladder-roof transitioning tasks.
