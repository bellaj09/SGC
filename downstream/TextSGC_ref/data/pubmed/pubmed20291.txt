Sometimes these clinical syndromes which are characterized by an altered eating behavior can have dramatic consequences. In eating disorders one of the more critical situations in addition to other of equal or more importance is the patients confrontation with food: the visual confrontation the eating process and the repercussion on his weight. Virtual Reality VR technology has been used in psychology as a therapeutic help tool for the treatment of different psychological problems for several years now. Their helpfulness is increasingly being recognized. Some developed virtual environments VE and their corresponding published studies endorse the efficiency of this tool. Nevertheless in order to increase the possibilities of success it is very important to obtain a complete patient immersion in the VE: visual auditory and interactive. Sometimes there are processes or actions of reality which are difficult to simulate virtually and simulating them coarsely would result in the patient lack of immersion in the VE thus seriously decreasing the possibilities of success. The eating process is an example since it consists of several steps some of which biting chewing etc. dont have an evident virtual solution. This article shows how food and eating process have been simulated virtually in the development of a virtual environment for the treatment of eating disorders."
