"Even with emerging technologies such as Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI systems understanding how our brains work is a very difficult challenge. So we propose to use a data mining technique to help us in this task. As a case of study we analyzed the brains behaviour of blind people and sighted people in a spatial activity. There is a common belief that blind people compensate their lack of vision using the other senses. If an object is given to sighted people and we asked them to identify this object probably the sense of vision will be the most determinant one. If the same experiment was repeated with blind people they will have to use other senses to identify the object. In this work we propose a methodology that uses decision trees DT to investigate the difference of how the brains of blind people and people with vision react against a spatial problem. We choose the DT algorithm because it can discover patterns in the brain signal and its presentation is human interpretable. Our results show that using DT to analyze brain signals can help us to understand the brains behaviour." Discovering Patterns in Brain Signals Using Decision Trees.
