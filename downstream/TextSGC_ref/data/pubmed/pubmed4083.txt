The second iteration of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE II aims to enhance the scope of brain connectomics research in Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD. Consistent with the initial ABIDE effort ABIDE I that released 1112 datasets in 2012 this new multisite open-data resource is an aggregate of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI and corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic datasets. ABIDE II includes datasets from an additional 487 individuals with ASD and 557 controls previously collected across 16 international institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD. Additionally ABIDE II includes a range of psychiatric variables to inform our understanding of the neural correlates of co-occurring psychopathology; 284 diffusion imaging datasets are also included. It is anticipated that these enhancements will contribute to unraveling key sources of ASD heterogeneity. Enhancing studies of the connectome in autism using the autism brain imaging data exchange II.
