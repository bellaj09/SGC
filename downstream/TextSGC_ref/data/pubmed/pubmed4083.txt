Age-related changes in functional brain network have been well documented. However recent studies have suggested the nonstationary properties of the functional connectivity of the brain and little is known about the changes of functional connectivity dynamics during aging. In this study a two-step singular value decomposition was introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of the time-varying functional connectivity in different frequency intervals and the whole-brain and regional brain diversity were quantified by using Shannon entropy. The relationships between age and functional connectivity dynamics were investigated in a relatively large sample cohort of cognitively healthy elderly N\u2009=\u2009188 ages 65-80. The results showed an age-related decreased diversity in the whole brain as well as in the right inferior frontal gyrus right amygdala right hippocampus left parahippocampal and left inferior parietal gyrus in the frequency interval of 0.06-0.12\u2009Hz. In addition the whole-brain diversity during resting state could also reflect the general mental flexibility. This study provided the first evidence of frequency-specific age effects on the functional connectivity dynamics in cognitively healthy elderly and may shed new light on the dynamic functional connectivity analysis of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
