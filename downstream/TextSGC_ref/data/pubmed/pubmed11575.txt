We introduce a model-based deep learning architecture termed MoDL-MUSSELS for the correction of phase errors in multishot diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR images. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of the existing MUSSELS algorithm with similar performance but significantly reduced computational complexity. In this work we show that an iterative re-weighted least-squares implementation of MUSSELS alternates between a multichannel filter bank and the enforcement of data consistency. The multichannel filter bank projects the data to the signal subspace thus exploiting the annihilation relations between shots. Due to the high computational complexity of the self-learned filter bank we propose replacing it with a convolutional neural network CNN whose parameters are learned from exemplary data. The proposed CNN is a hybrid model involving a multichannel CNN in the k-space and another CNN in the image space. The k-space CNN exploits the annihilation relations between the shot images while the image domain network is used to project the data to an image manifold. The experiments show that the proposed scheme can yield reconstructions that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering several orders of magnitude reduction in run-time.
