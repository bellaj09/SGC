The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in macaques and humans; here we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on similar mechanisms despite strong differences in hand morphology and grip diversity. We recorded electrocorticographic activity over the sensorimotor cortex of two common marmosets during the execution of different grip types which allowed us to study cortical activity power spectrum and physiologically inferred connectivity phase-slope index. Analyses were performed in beta 16-35\xa0Hz and gamma 75-100\xa0Hz frequency bands and our results showed that beta power varied depending on grip type whereas gamma power displayed clear epoch-related modulation. Strength and direction of inter-area connectivity varied depending on grip type and epoch. These findings suggest that fundamental control mechanisms are conserved across primates and in future research marmosets could represent an adequate model to investigate primate brain mechanisms. Cortical control of object-specific grasp relies on adjustments of both activity and effective connectivity: a common marmoset study.
