Purpose. We analyzed the literature to determine 1 the surgically relevant applications for which head-mounted display HMD use is reported; 2 the types of HMD most commonly reported; and 3 the surgical specialties in which HMD use is reported. Methods. The PubMed Embase Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched through August 27 2017 for publications describing HMD use during surgically relevant applications. We identified 120 relevant English-language non-opinion publications for inclusion. HMD types were categorized as "heads-up" nontransparent HMD display and direct visualization of the real environment "see-through" visualization of the HMD display overlaid on the real environment or "non-see-through" visualization of only the nontransparent HMD display. Results. HMDs were used for image guidance and augmented reality 70 publications data display 63 publications communication 34 publications and education/training 18 publications. See-through HMDs were described in 55 publications heads-up HMDs in 41 publications and non-see-through HMDs in 27 publications. Google Glass a see-through HMD was the most frequently used model reported in 32 publications. The specialties with the highest frequency of published HMD use were urology 20 publications neurosurgery 17 publications and unspecified surgical specialty 20 publications. Conclusion. Image guidance and augmented reality were the most commonly reported applications for which HMDs were used. See-through HMDs were the most commonly reported type used in surgically relevant applications. Urology and neurosurgery were the specialties with greatest published HMD use.
