Effective motor imagery performance seen as strong suppression of the sensorimotor rhythm is the key element in motor imagery therapy. Therefore optimization of methods to classify whether the subject is performing the imagery task is a prerequisite. An optimal classification method should have high performance accuracy and use a small number of channels. We investigated the additional benefit of the common spatial pattern filtering CSP to a linear discriminant analysis LDA classifier for different channel configurations. Classification of motor imagery performance in acute stroke.
