Continuous performance tasks CPTs embedded in a virtual reality VR classroom environment have been shown to be a sensitive and user-friendly assessment tool to detect cognitive deficits related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD. The aim of the current study was to compare the performance of children with ADHD on a VR-CPT while on and off treatment with methylphenidate MPH and to compare the VR-CPT to a currently used CPT Test of Variables of Attention TOVA. Methylphenidate effect in children with ADHD can be measured by an ecologically valid continuous performance test embedded in virtual reality.
