"A novel technique of quantitative EEG for differentiating patients with early-stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD from other forms of rapidly progressive dementia RPD is proposed. The discrimination is based on the extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency representation of the EEG signals through continuous wavelet transform CWT. An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy PE is also included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning DL concept. The DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder trained by unsupervised learning techniques and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either support vector machines SVM or multilayer neural networks MLP-NN. A subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimers Disease AD and healthy controls HC is considered for differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a supervised learning procedure the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 89% an average sensitivity of 92% and an average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC."
