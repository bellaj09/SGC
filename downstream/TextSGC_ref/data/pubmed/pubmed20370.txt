"A group of worldwide virtual reality and health-care researchers have decided to combine their efforts in a multidisciplinary project titled VETERAN-virtual environments in the diagnosis prevention and intervention of age-related diseases. The main goal of the VETERAN project is the tuning and testing of different virtual environments designed to address the cognitive/functional impairments that may occur due to the aging process and age-related disorders. In particular the developed modules will address the problems commonly found in the following pathologies that have a strong impact on the elderly health care policy: Alzheimers disease and other senile dementias; stroke and unilateral spatial neglect; mobility-related accidents within specific environments e.g. falls shocks. The project will focus on research into clinical aspects of age-related diseases and disorders of high morbidity and specifically target goals of prevention treatment or delay in onset. Another goal of the VETERAN project is to define and develop new protocols and tools to be used for general rehabilitation purposes. These tools will aim to provide systematic restorative training within the context of functionally relevant ecologically valid simulated environments. This approach is hoped to optimise the degree of transfer of training and/or generalisation of learning to the persons real world environment."
