Sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity: Males have better motor and spatial abilities whereas females have superior memory and social cognition skills. Studies also show sex differences in human brains but do not explain this complementarity. In this work we modeled the structural connectome using diffusion tensor imaging in a sample of 949 youths aged 8-22 y 428 males and 521 females and discovered unique sex differences in brain connectivity during the course of development. Connection-wise statistical analysis as well as analysis of regional and global network measures presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females. However this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.
