Social Anxiety Disorder SAD is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders in Europe and comprises the fear of public speaking as its typical sub-type. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy CBT is the intervention of choice for SAD and it includes exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli to induce systematic desensitization and reduce anxiety. Similarly exposure therapy per se has been used and found effective although it is not as specific as CBT for the treatment of SAD. Interestingly exposure to anxiety-provoking situations can be achieved in Virtual Environments VEs through the simulation of social situations allowing individuals with public speaking anxiety to live and develop real exposure-like reactions. The Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy VRET is the treatment of anxiety disorders based on such VEs. A survey on virtual environment applications to fear of public speaking.
