The introduction of "metamaterials" has had a profound impact on several fields including electromagnetics. Designing a metamaterial\s structure on demand however is still an extremely time-consuming process. As an efficient machine learning method deep learning has been widely used for data classification and regression in recent years and in fact shown good generalization performance. We have built a deep neural network for on-demand design. With the required reflectance as input the parameters of the structure are automatically calculated and then output to achieve the purpose of designing on demand. Our network has achieved low mean square errors MSE with MSE of 0.005 on both the training and test sets. The results indicate that using deep learning to train the data the trained model can more accurately guide the design of the structure thereby speeding up the design process. Compared with the traditional design process using deep learning to guide the design of metamaterials can achieve faster more accurate and more convenient purposes.
