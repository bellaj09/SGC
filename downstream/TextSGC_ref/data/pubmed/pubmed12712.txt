The improved soft tissue contrast of magnetic resonance imaging\xa0MRI compared to computed tomography CT makes it a useful imaging modality for radiotherapy treatment planning. Even when MR images are acquired for treatment planning the standard clinical practice currently also requires a CT for dose calculation and x-ray-based patient positioning. This increases workloads introduces uncertainty due to the required inter-modality image registrations and involves unnecessary irradiation. While it would be beneficial to use exclusively MR images a method needs to be employed to estimate a synthetic CT sCT for generating electron density maps and patient positioning reference images. We investigated 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks CNNs to generate a male pelvic sCT using a T1-weighted MR image and compare their performance. Deep learning approaches using 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for generating male pelvic synthetic computed tomography from magnetic resonance imaging.
