For successful occlusal reconstruction the prosthodontists must take several points into consideration such as those involving issues with functional and morphological findings and aesthetics. They then must unify this information into a coherent treatment plan. In this present study we focused on prosthodontic treatment and investigated how treatment planning and simulation could be applied to two cases. The personal occlusion condition can be reproduced on the virtual articulator in VR space. In addition various simulations can be performed that involve prosthetesis design. Virtual reality image applications for treatment planning in prosthodontic dentistry.
