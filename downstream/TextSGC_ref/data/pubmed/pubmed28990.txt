As the computational complexities of neural decoding algorithms for brain machine interfaces BMI increase their implementation through sequential processors becomes prohibitive for real-time applications. This work presents the field programmable gate array FPGA as an alternative to sequential processors for BMIs. The reprogrammable hardware architecture of the FPGA provides a near optimal platform for performing parallel computations in real-time. The scalability and reconfigurability of the FPGA accommodates diverse sets of neural ensembles and a variety of decoding algorithms. Throughput is significantly increased by decomposing computations into independent parallel hardware modules on the FPGA. This increase in throughput is demonstrated through a parallel hardware implementation of the auxiliary particle filtering signal processing algorithm. Modular particle filtering FPGA hardware architecture for brain machine interfaces.
