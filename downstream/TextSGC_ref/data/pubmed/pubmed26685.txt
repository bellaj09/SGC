We report a fabrication process for coating neural probes with an ultrafast degrading polymer to create consistent and reproducible devices for neural tissue insertion. The rigid polymer coating acts as a probe insertion aid but resorbs within hours post-implantation. Despite the feasibility for short term neural recordings from currently available neural prosthetic devices most of these devices suffer from long term gliosis which isolates the probes from adjacent neurons increasing the recording impedance and stimulation threshold. The size and stiffness of implanted probes have been identified as critical factors that lead to this long term gliosis. Smaller more flexible probes that match the mechanical properties of brain tissue could allow better long term integration by limiting the mechanical disruption of the surrounding tissue during and after probe insertion while being flexible enough to deform with the tissue during brain movement. However these small flexible probes inherently lack the mechanical strength to penetrate the brain on their own. In this work we have developed a micromolding method for coating a non-functional miniaturized SU-8 probe with an ultrafast degrading tyrosine-derived polycarbonate E50052K. Coated non-functionalized probes of varying dimensions were reproducibly fabricated with high yields. The polymer erosion/degradation profiles of the probes were characterized in vitro. The probes were also mechanically characterized in ex vivo brain tissue models by measuring buckling and insertion forces during probe insertion. The results demonstrate the ability to produce polymer coated probes of consistent quality for future in vivo use for example to study the effects of different design parameters that may affect tissue response during long term chronic intra-cortical microelectrode neural recordings.
