The diagnostic imaging field has undergone considerable growth both in terms of technological development and market expansion; with the following increasing production of a considerable amount of data that potentially fully poses diagnostic imaging in the Big data in the context of healthcare. Nevertheless the mere production of a large amount of data does not automatically permit the real exploitation of their intrinsic value. Therefore it is necessary to develop digital platforms and applications that favor the correct and advantageous management of diagnostic images such as Big data. This work aims to frame the role of diagnostic imaging in this new scenario emphasizing the open challenges in exploiting such intense data generation for decision making with Big data analytics. The Challenges of Diagnostic Imaging in the Era of Big Data.
