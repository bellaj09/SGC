Free space optics is an interesting alternative for telemetry with medical implants due to the high data bandwidths available at optical frequencies. Especially implanted brain-computer interfaces gives rise to large data sets that needs to be transmitted transcutaneous. In this paper we show that it is possible to establish such a link at near-IR wavelengths using a modulated reflector in the implant thus keeping the laser and the detector on the outside. In addition we show that it will not only work on short i.e. touch distances but also at larger distances in the range of a meter. We have used an electro absorption modulator to modulate the reflection of an external laser source back towards an external detector. The only part of this system that needs to be implanted is the modulator and drive electronics. The study has been done both by Monte-Carlo simulations of a multi-layer model of a rat skull and with an experiment demonstrating the feasibility of the link when transmitted through biological tissue. The results show that it is possible to establish a transcutaneous link with an external laser source and light detector and an internal modulated reflector.
