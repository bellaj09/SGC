"Introduction Virtual reality VR is gaining recognition as a valuable tool for training dental students and its use by dental schools around the world is growing. It is timely to review the literature relating to the use of VR in dental education in order to ensure that educators are well-informed of current areas of inquiry and those requiring further investigation to enable appropriate decisions about whether to employ VR as a teaching tool. Method A scoping review using the method outlined by Arksey and OMalley was conducted. Both Web of Science and ERIC databases were searched. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to filter results. The data were collected and categorised using a custom data collection spreadsheet. Results The review identified 68 relevant articles. Following review four educational thematic areas relating to the simulation hardware the realism of the simulation scoring systems and validation of the systems emerged. Conclusion This paper summarises and draws out themes from the current areas of inquiry in the literature uncovering a number of weaknesses and assumptions. It recommends areas where additional investigation is required in order to form a better evidence base for the utility of VR in dental education as well as to inform its future development."
