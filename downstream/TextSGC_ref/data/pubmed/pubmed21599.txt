This paper proposes an efficient data compression technique dedicated to implantable intra-cortical neural recording devices. The proposed technique benefits from processing neural signals in the Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform space a new spike extraction approach and a novel data framing scheme to telemeter the recorded neural information to the outside world. Based on the proposed technique a 64-channel neural signal processor was designed and prototyped as a part of a wireless implantable extra-cellular neural recording microsystem. Designed in a 0.13-  m standard CMOS process the 64-channel neural signal processor reported in this paper occupies  0.206 mm2 of silicon area and consumes 94.18 W when operating under a 1.2-V supply voltage at a master clock frequency of 1.28 MHz. A method for compression of intra-cortically-recorded neural signals dedicated to implantable brain-machine interfaces.
