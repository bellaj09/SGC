We propose a method designed to push the frontiers of unconstrained face recognition in the wild with an emphasis on extreme out-of-plane pose variations. Existing methods either expect a single model to learn pose invariance by training on massive amounts of data or else normalize images by aligning faces to a single frontal pose. Contrary to these our method is designed to explicitly tackle pose variations. Our proposed Pose-Aware Models PAM process a face image using several pose-specific deep convolutional neural networks CNN. 3D rendering is used to synthesize multiple face poses from input images to both train these models and to provide additional robustness to pose variations at test time. Our paper presents an extensive analysis of the IARPA Janus Benchmark A IJB-A evaluating the effects that landmark detection accuracy CNN layer selection and pose model selection all have on the performance of the recognition pipeline. It further provides comparative evaluations on IJB-A and the PIPA dataset. These tests show that our approach outperforms existing methods even surprisingly matching the accuracy of methods that were specifically fine-tuned to the target dataset.
