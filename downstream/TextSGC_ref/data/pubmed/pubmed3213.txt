Diffusion tractography in brain connectomics often involves tracing axonal trajectories across gray-white matter boundaries in gyral blades of complex cortical convolutions. To date gyral bias is observed in most tractography algorithms with streamlines predominantly terminating at gyral crowns instead of sulcal banks. This work demonstrates that asymmetric fiber orientation distribution functions AFODFs computed via a multi-tissue global estimation framework can mitigate the effects of gyral bias enabling fiber streamlines at gyral blades to make sharper turns into the cortical gray matter. We use ex-vivo data of an adult rhesus macaque and in-vivo data from the Human Connectome Project HCP to show that the fiber streamlines given by AFODFs bend more naturally into the cortex than the conventional symmetric FODFs in typical gyral blades. We demonstrate that AFODF tractography improves cortico-cortical connectivity and provides highly consistent outcomes between two different field strengths 3T and 7T.
