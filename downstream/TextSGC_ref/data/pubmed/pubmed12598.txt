Named Entity Recognition NER in the healthcare domain involves identifying and categorizing disease drugs and symptoms for biosurveillance extracting their related properties and activities and identifying adverse drug events appearing in texts. These tasks are important challenges in healthcare. Analyzing user messages in social media networks such as Twitter can provide opportunities to detect and manage public health events. Twitter provides a broad range of short messages that contain interesting information for information extraction. In this paper we present a Health-Related Named Entity Recognition HNER task using healthcare-domain ontology that can recognize health-related entities from large numbers of user messages from Twitter. For this task we employ a deep learning architecture which is based on a recurrent neural network RNN with little feature engineering. To achieve our goal we collected a large number of Twitter messages containing health-related information and detected biomedical entities from the Unified Medical Language System UMLS. A bidirectional long short-term memory BiLSTM model learned rich context information and a convolutional neural network CNN was used to produce character-level features. The conditional random field CRF model predicted a sequence of labels that corresponded to a sequence of inputs and the Viterbi algorithm was used to detect health-related entities from Twitter messages. We provide comprehensive results giving valuable insights for identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications. The BiLSTM-CRF model achieved a precision of 93.99% recall of 73.31% and F1-score of 81.77% for disease or syndrome HNER; a precision of 90.83% recall of 81.98% and F1-score of 87.52% for sign or symptom HNER; and a precision of 94.85% recall of 73.47% and F1-score of 84.51% for pharmacologic substance named entities. The ontology-based manual annotation results show that it is possible to perform high-quality annotation despite the complexity of medical terminology and the lack of context in tweets.
