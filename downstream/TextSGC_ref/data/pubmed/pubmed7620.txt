A multiuser detection MUD algorithm based on deep learning network is proposed for the satellite mobile communication system. Due to relative motion between the satellite and users multiple access interference MUI introduced by multipath fading channel reduces system performance. The proposed MUD algorithm based on deep learning network firstly establishes the CINR optimal loss function according to the multiuser access mode and then obtains the best multiuser detection weight through the steepest gradient iteration. Multilayer nonlinear learning obtains interference cancellation sharing weights to achieve maximum signal-to-noise ratio through gradient iteration which is superior than the traditional serial interference cancellation algorithm and parallel interference cancellation algorithm. Then the weights with multiuser detection through multilayer network forward learning iteration are obtained with traditional multiuser detecting quality characteristics. The proposed multiuser access detection based on deep learning network algorithm improves the MUD accuracy and reduces the number of traditional multiusers. The performance of the satellite multifading uplink system shows that the proposed deep learning network can provide high precision and better iteration times.
