"Conventional therapies do not provide paralyzed patients with closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. Paired associative stimulation PAS uses brain-computer interface BCI technology to monitor patients movement imagery in real-time and utilizes the information to control functional electrical stimulation FES and bar feedback for complete sensorimotor closed loop. To realize this approach we introduce the recoveriX system a hardware and software platform for PAS. After 10 sessions of recoveriX training one stroke patient partially regained control of dorsiflexion in her paretic wrist. A controlled group study is planned with a new version of the recoveriX system which will use a new FES system and an avatar instead of bar feedback."
