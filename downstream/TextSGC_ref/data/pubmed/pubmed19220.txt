Laparoscopy is considered today the highlight of modern surgery the forerunner of the fascinating world of video and robotic surgery both of them derived from the sophisticated areas of aeronautic industry. Remarkably Romanian specialists keep up with the pace of worldwide technological developments assimilating one by one each and every video endoscopic procedure. In the early 90s the Romanian laparos-copic school was founded with the contribution of many important personalities; their activities and achievements have been an inspiration for the following generation of laparoscopic surgeons.

The purpose of this article is to encourage and promote minimally invasive video endoscopic surgery training emphasizing its crucial role in the education and professional development of the next generation of pediatric surgeons and not only. The modem concept of laparoscopic training includes experimental scientific practices as well as the newest technical acquisitions such as virtual reality video-electronic simulation. Laparoscopic training--the guarantee of a future in pediatric surgery.
