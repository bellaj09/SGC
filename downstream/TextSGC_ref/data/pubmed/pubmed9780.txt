"We examined the relations among students perceptions of classroom goal structures mastery and performance goal structures students achievement goal orientations mastery performance and work-avoidance goals and learning strategies deep processing surface processing and self-handicapping strategies. Participants were 323 5th and 6th grade students in elementary schools. The results from structural equation modeling indicated that perceptions of classroom mastery goal structures were associated with students mastery goal orientations which were in turn related positively to the deep processing strategies and academic achievement. Perceptions of classroom performance goal stractures proved associated with work avoidance-goal orientations which were positively related to the surface processing and self-handicapping strategies. Two types of goal structures had a positive relation with students performance goal orientations which had significant positive effects on academic achievement. The results of this study suggest that elementary school students perceptions of mastery goal structures are related to adaptive patterns of learning more than perceptions of performance goal structures are. The role of perceptions of classroom goal structure in promoting students goal orientations and learning strategies is discussed."
