In a recent systematic review Claessen and van der Ham 2017 have analyzed the types of navigation impairment in the single-case study literature. Three dissociable types related to landmarks locations and paths were identified. This recent model as well as previous models of navigation impairment have never been verified in a systematic manner. The aim of the current study was thus to investigate the prevalence of landmark-based location-based and path-based navigation impairment in a large sample of stroke patients.
