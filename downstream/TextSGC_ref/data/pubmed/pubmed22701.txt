Confocal microscopes deliver detailed three-dimensional data and are instrumental in biological analysis and research. Usually this three-dimensional data is rendered as a projection onto a two-dimensional display. We describe a system for rendering such data using a modern virtual reality VR headset. Sample manipulation is possible by fully-immersive hand-tracking and also by means of a conventional gamepad. We apply this system to the specific task of colocalization analysis an important analysis tool in biological microscopy. We evaluate our system by means of a set of user trials. Virtual reality assisted microscopy data visualization and colocalization analysis.
