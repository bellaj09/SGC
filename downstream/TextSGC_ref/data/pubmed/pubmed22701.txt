Since the discovery of X-rays medical imaging has played a major role in the guidance of surgical procedures. While medical imaging began with simple X-ray plates to indicate the presence of foreign objects within the human body the advent of the computer has been a major factor in the recent development of this field. Imaging techniques have grown greatly in their sophistication and can now provide the surgeon with high quality three-dimensional images depicting not only the normal anatomy and pathology but also vascularity and function. One key factor in the advances in Image-Guided Surgery IGS is the ability not only to register images derived from the various imaging modalities amongst themselves but also to register them to the patient. The other crucial aspect of IGS is the ability to track instruments in real time during the procedure and to portray them as part of a realistic model of the operative volume. Stereoscopic and virtual-reality techniques can usefully enhance the visualization process. IGS nevertheless relies heavily on the assumption that the images acquired prior to surgery and upon which the surgical guidance is based accurately represent the morphology of the tissue during the surgical procedure. In many instances this assumption is invalid and intra-operative real-time imaging using interventional MRI Ultrasound and electrophysiological recordings are often employed to overcome this limitation. Although now in extensive clinical use IGS is often currently perceived as an intrusion into the operating room. It must evolve towards becoming a routine surgical tool but this will only happen if natural and intuitive human interfaces are developed for these systems.
