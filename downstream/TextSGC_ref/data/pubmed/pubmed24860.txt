"The accuracy of brain-computer interfaces BCIs is important for effective communication and control. The mu-based BCI is one of the most widely used systems of which the related methods to improve users accuracy are still poorly studied especially for the BCI illiteracy. Here we examined a way to enhance mu-based BCI performance by electrically stimulating the ulnar nerve of the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency 10 Hz during left-and right-hand motor imagination in two BCI groups literate and illiterate. We demonstrate that this alpha frequency intervention enhances the classification accuracy between left-and right-hand motor imagery from 66.41% to 81.57% immediately after intervention and to 75.28% two days after intervention in the BCI illiteracy group while classification accuracy improves from 82.12% to 91.84% immediately after intervention and to 89.03% two days after intervention in the BCI literacy group. However the classification accuracy did not change before and after the sham intervention no electrical stimulation. Furthermore the ERD on the primary sensorimotor cortex during left-or right-hand motor imagery tasks was more visible at the mu-rhythm 8-13 Hz after alpha frequency intervention. Alpha frequency intervention increases the mu-rhythm power difference between left-and right-hand motor imagery tasks. These results provide evidence that alpha frequency intervention is an effective way to improve BCI performance by regulating the mu-rhythm which might provide a way to reduce BCI illiteracy."
