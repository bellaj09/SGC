Brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on sensorimotor rhythms use a variety of motor tasks such as imagining moving the right or left hand the feet or the tongue. Finding the tasks that yield best performance specifically to each user is a time-consuming preliminary phase to a BCI experiment. This study presents a new adaptive procedure to automatically select online the most promising motor task for an asynchronous brain-controlled button. Automatic motor task selection via a bandit algorithm for a brain-controlled button.
