Computed tomographic CT is a fundamental imaging modality to generate cross-sectional views of internal anatomy in a living subject or interrogate material composition of an object and it has been routinely used in clinical applications and nondestructive testing. In a standard CT image pixels having the same Hounsfield Units HU can correspond to different materials and it is therefore challenging to differentiate and quantify materials. Dual-energy CT DECT is desirable to differentiate multiple materials but the costly DECT scanners are not widely available as single-energy CT SECT scanners. Recent advancement in deep learning provides an enabling tool to map images between different modalities with incorporated prior knowledge. Here we develop a deep learning approach to perform DECT imaging by using the standard SECT data. The end point of the approach is a model capable of providing the high-energy CT image for a given input low-energy CT image. The feasibility of the deep learning-based DECT imaging method using a SECT data is demonstrated using contrast-enhanced DECT images and evaluated using clinical relevant indexes. This work opens new opportunities for numerous DECT clinical applications with a standard SECT data and may enable significantly simplified hardware design scanning dose and image cost reduction for future DECT systems.
