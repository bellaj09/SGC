Electrical stimulation of the human brain is commonly used for eliciting and inhibiting neural activity for clinical diagnostics modifying abnormal neural circuit function for therapeutics and interrogating cortical connectivity. However recording electrical signals with concurrent stimulation results in dominant electrical artifacts that mask the neural signals of interest. Here we develop a method to reproducibly and robustly recover neural activity during concurrent stimulation. We concentrate on signal recovery across an array of electrodes without channel-wise fine-tuning of the algorithm. Our goal includes signal recovery with trains of stimulation pulses since repeated high-frequency pulses are often required to induce desired effects in both therapeutic and research domains. We have made all of our code and data publicly available. Signal recovery from stimulation artifacts in intracranial recordings with dictionary learning.
