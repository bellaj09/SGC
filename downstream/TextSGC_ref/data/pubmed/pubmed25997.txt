The main aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of goal-directed arm movements in 15 children with cerebral palsy CP following four weeks of home-based training with motion interactive video games. A further aim was to investigate the applicability and characteristics of kinematic parameters in a virtual context in comparison to a physical context. Training of goal directed arm movements with motion interactive video games in children with cerebral palsy - a kinematic evaluation.
