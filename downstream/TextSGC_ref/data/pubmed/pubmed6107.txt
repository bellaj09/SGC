Deep learning is gaining importance in the prediction of cognitive states and brain pathology based on neuroimaging data. Including multiple hidden layers in artificial neural networks enables unprecedented predictive power; however the proper training of deep neural networks requires thousands of exemplars. Collecting this amount of data is not feasible in typical neuroimaging experiments. A handy solution to this problem which has largely fallen outside the scope of deep learning applications in neuroimaging is to repurpose deep networks that have already been trained on large datasets by fine-tuning them to target datasets/tasks with fewer exemplars. Here we investigated how this method called transfer learning can aid age category classification and regression based on brain functional connectivity patterns derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We trained a connectome-convolutional neural network on a larger public dataset and then examined how the knowledge learned can be used effectively to perform these tasks on smaller target datasets collected with a different type of scanner and/or imaging protocol and pre-processing pipeline. Transfer learning improves resting-state functional connectivity pattern analysis using convolutional neural networks.
