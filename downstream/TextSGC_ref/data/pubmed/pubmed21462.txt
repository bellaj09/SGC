Purpose The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of conventional neurological treatment and a virtual reality training program on eye-hand coordination in children with cerebral palsy. Subjects Sixteen children 9 males 7 females with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were recruited and randomly assigned to the conventional neurological physical therapy group CG and virtual reality training group VRG. Methods Eight children in the control group performed 45 minutes of therapeutic exercise twice a week for eight weeks. In the experimental group the other eight children performed 30 minutes of therapeutic exercise and 15 minutes of a training program using virtual reality twice a week during the experimental period. Results After eight weeks of the training program there were significant differences in eye-hand coordination and visual motor speed in the comparison of the virtual reality training group with the conventional neurological physical therapy group. Conclusion We conclude that a well-designed training program using virtual reality can improve eye-hand coordination in children with cerebral palsy.
