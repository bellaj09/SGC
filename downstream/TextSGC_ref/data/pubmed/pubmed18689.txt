Non-anatomic bone tunnel placement is the most common cause of a failed ACL reconstruction. Accurate and reproducible methods to visualize and document bone tunnel placement are therefore important. We evaluated the reliability of standard radiographs CT scans and a 3-dimensional 3D virtual reality VR approach in visualizing and measuring ACL reconstruction bone tunnel placement. Visualization of postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction bone tunnels: reliability of standard radiographs CT scans and 3D virtual reality images.
