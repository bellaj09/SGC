"Research indicates that virtual reality is effective in the treatment of many psychological difficulties and is being used more frequently. However little is known about therapists perception of the benefits and costs related to the use of virtual therapy in treatment delivery. In the present study 271 therapists completed an online questionnaire that assessed their perceptions about the potential benefits and costs of using virtual reality in psychotherapy. Results indicated that therapists perceived the potential benefits as outweighing the potential costs. Therapists self-reported knowledge of virtual reality theoretical orientation and interest in using virtual reality were found to be associated with perceptual measures. These findings contribute to the current knowledge of the perception of virtual reality amongst psychotherapists." "Therapists perception of benefits and costs of using virtual reality treatments."
