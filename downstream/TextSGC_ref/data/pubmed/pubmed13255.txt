"Next-generation sequencing NGS technologies have changed the landscape of genetic testing in rare diseases. However the rapid evolution of NGS technologies has outpaced its clinical adoption. Here we re-evaluate the critical steps in the clinical application of NGS-based genetic testing from an informatics perspective. We suggest a fit-for-purpose triage of current NGS technologies. We also point out potential shortcomings in the clinical management of genetic variants and offer ideas for potential improvement. We specifically emphasize the importance of ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of NGS-based genetic testing in the context of rare disease diagnosis. We highlight the role of artificial intelligence AI in enhancing understanding and prioritization of variance in the clinical setting and propose deep learning frameworks for further investigation."
