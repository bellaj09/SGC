Xenomelia is a rare condition characterized by the persistent desire for the amputation of physically healthy limbs. Prior studies highlighted the importance of superior and inferior parietal lobuli SPL/IPL and other sensorimotor regions as key brain structures associated with xenomelia. We expected activity differences in these areas in response to pictures showing the desired body state i.e. that of an amputee in xenomelia. Brain activity elicited by viewing pictures of the own virtually amputated body predicts xenomelia.
