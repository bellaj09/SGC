Rationale: Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs is a major concern for clinicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Objective: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Methods and Results: This retrospective multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 including 188 taking ACEI/ARB ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 IQR 55-68 years; 53.2% men and 940 without using ACEI/ARB non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 IQR 57-69; 53.5% men who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province China from December 31 2019 to February 20 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group 3.7% vs. 9.8%; P = 0.01. In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect after adjusting for age gender comorbidities and in-hospital medications the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group adjusted HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19-0.92; P =0.03. In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB adjusted HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03. Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality adjusted HR 0.30; 95%CI 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01 in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.
