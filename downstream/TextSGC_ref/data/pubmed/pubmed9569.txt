Modern sequences for Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI trade off scan time with computational challenges resulting in ill-posed inverse problems and the requirement to account for more elaborated signal models. Various deep learning techniques have shown potential for image reconstruction from reduced data outperforming compressed sensing dictionary learning and other advanced techniques based on regularization by characterization of the image manifold. In this work we suggest a framework for reducing a "neural" network to the bare minimum required by the MR physics reducing the network depth and removing all non-linearities. The networks performed well both on benchmark simulated data and on arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging showing clear images while preserving sensitivity to the minute signal changes. The results indicate that the deep learning framework plays a major role in MR image reconstruction and suggest a concrete approach for probing into the contribution of additional elements.
