The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of immersive three-dimensional 3D interactive virtual reality VR on anatomy training in undergraduate physical therapy students. A total of 72 students were included in the study. The students were randomized into control n\xa0=\xa036 and VR n\xa0=\xa036 group according to the Kolb Learning Style Inventory sex and Purdue Spatial Visualization Test Rotations PSVT-R. Each student completed a pre-intervention and post-intervention test consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age sex Kolb Learning Style Inventory distribution and the PSVT-R P\xa0>\xa00.05. The post-test scores were significantly higher compared to pre-test scores in both the VR group P\xa0<\xa00.001 and the control group P\xa0<\xa00.001. The difference between the pre-test and post-test results was found to be significantly higher in favor of the VR group P\xa0<\xa00.001. In this study anatomy training with a 3D immersive VR system was found to be beneficial. These results suggest that VR systems can be used as an alternative method to the conventional anatomy training approach for health students.
