"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 LRRK2 is important in various cellular processes including mitochondrial homeostasis and mutations in this gene lead to Parkinsons disease PD. However the full spectrum of LRRK2s functions remain to be elucidated. The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane TOM complex is essential for the import of almost all nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and is fundamental for cellular survival. Using co-immunoprecipitation super-resolution structured illumination microscopy SR-SIM and 3D virtual reality VR assisted co-localization analysis techniques we show that wild-type and mutant G2019S LRRK2 associate and co-localize with subunits of the TOM complex either under basal dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO or stress-induced carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine CCCP conditions. Interestingly LRRK2 interacted with TOM40 under both DMSO and CCCP conditions and when the PD causing mutation G2019S was introduced the association was not altered. Moreover overexpression of G2019S LRRK2 resulted in the formation of large perinuclear aggregates that co-localized with the TOM complex. Taken together this is the first study to show that both WT and mutant LRRK2 associate with the TOM complex subunits. These findings provide additional evidence for LRRK2s role in mitochondrial function which has important implications for its role in PD pathogenesis." Wild-type and mutant G2019S leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 LRRK2 associate with subunits of the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane TOM complex.
