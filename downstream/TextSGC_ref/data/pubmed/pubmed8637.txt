Image sensors are widely used for detecting cracks on concrete surfaces to help proactive and timely management of concrete structures. However it is a challenging task to reliably detect cracks on damaged surfaces in the real world due to noise and undesired artifacts. In this paper we propose an autonomous crack detection algorithm based on convolutional neural network CNN to solve the problem. To this aim the proposed algorithm uses a two-branched CNN architecture consisting of sub-networks named a crack-component-aware CCA network and a crack-region-aware CRA network. The CCA network is to learn gradient component regarding cracks and the CRA network is to learn a region-of-interest by distinguishing critical cracks and noise such as scratches. Specifically the two sub-networks are built on convolution-deconvolution CNN architectures but also they are comprised of different functional components to achieve their own goals efficiently. The two sub-networks are trained in an end-to-end to jointly optimize parameters and produce the final output of localizing important cracks. Various crack image samples and learning methods are used for efficiently training the proposed network. In the experimental results the proposed algorithm provides better performance in the crack detection than the conventional algorithms.
