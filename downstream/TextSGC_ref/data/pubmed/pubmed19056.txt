\Mashup\ was originally used to describe the mixing together of musical tracks to create a new piece of music. The term now refers to Web sites or services that weave data from different sources into a new data source or service. Using a musical metaphor that builds on the origin of the word \mashup\ this paper presents a demonstration "playlist" of four geo-mashup vignettes that make use of a range of Web 2.0 Semantic Web and 3-D Internet methods with outputs/end-user interfaces spanning the flat Web two-dimensional - 2-D maps a three-dimensional - 3-D mirror world Google Earth and a 3-D virtual world Second Life. The four geo-mashup "songs" in this "playlist" are: \Web 2.0 and GIS Geographic Information Systems for infectious disease surveillance\ \Web 2.0 and GIS for molecular epidemiology\ \Semantic Web for GIS mashup\ and \From Yahoo! Pipes to 3-D avatar-inhabited geo-mashups\. It is hoped that this showcase of examples and ideas and the pointers we are providing to the many online tools that are freely available today for creating sharing and reusing geo-mashups with minimal or no coding will ultimately spark the imagination of many public health practitioners and stimulate them to start exploring the use of these methods and tools in their day-to-day practice. The paper also discusses how today\s Web is rapidly evolving into a much more intensely immersive mixed-reality and ubiquitous socio-experiential Metaverse that is heavily interconnected through various kinds of user-created mashups.
