"Recognition of different genomic signals and regions GSRs in DNA is crucial for understanding genome organization gene regulation and gene function which in turn generate better genome and gene annotations. Although many methods have been developed to recognize GSRs their pure computational identification remains challenging. Moreover various GSRs usually require a specialized set of features for developing robust recognition models. Recently deep-learning DL methods have been shown to generate more accurate prediction models than shallow methods without the need to develop specialized features for the problems in question. Here we explore the potential use of DL for the recognition of GSRs." DeepGSR: an optimized deep-learning structure for the recognition of genomic signals and regions.
