"Following its success in the treatment of refractory movement disorders deep brain stimulation DBS is currently under clinical investigation as a possible treatment for several neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimers disease AD. DBSs mechanism of action delivery regimen optimal brain target and timeline of behavioural and neuroanatomical outcomes are all open fields of investigation. There is a critical need to develop methodologies that allow us to examine the time course of both behavioural changes and neuroanatomical remodelling in response to DBS. Here we present a proof-of-concept methodology for DBS experiments which incorporates both brain imaging and behaviour in a longitudinal fashion. We implanted triple transgenic AD mouse models expressing mutations for both amyloid and tau with custom magnetic resonance imaging MRI-compatible carbon based electrodes. Mice received DBS or sham stimulation to the fornix a critical white matter node in the brains memory circuit for 1\u202fh 100\u202fHz 100\u202fs pulses 100\u202fA. Treatment was followed with an adapted Morris water maze to test learning and memory; performed weekly and structural MRI to assess neuroanatomy; 3\u202fdays before and 3\u202fdays after DBS with a 6\u202fweek follow-up. The acute DBS treatment improved learning and long term memory in a delayed sex specific and transient manner relative to sham-stimulated controls. Significant persistent volumetric changes were seen in diverse brains structures also heavily mediated by sex. We believe this methodology may be used as a template for DBS-related experimentation and will encourage preclinical studies to use longitudinal designs."
