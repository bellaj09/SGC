"We present a virtual reality simulator to realize interventional radiology IR procedures remotely. The simulator contains two subsystems: one at the local site and the other at the remote site. At the local site the interventional radiologist interacts with a three-dimensional 3-D vascular model extracted from the patients data and inserts IR devices through the Motion Tracking Box MTB which converts physical motion translation and rotation of IR devices into digital signal. This signal is transferred to the Actuator Box AB at the remote site that drives the IR devices in the patient. The status of the IR devices is subsequently fed back to the local site and displayed on the vascular model. To prove the concept the prototype developed employs a physical angiography phantom mimicking the patient and its corresponding 3-D digital model. A magnetic tracking system provides information about positioning of the IR devices in the phantom. The initial results are encouraging. The AB controlled remotely drives IR devices with resolution of 0.00288 mm/step in translation and 0.079 deg/step in rotation."
