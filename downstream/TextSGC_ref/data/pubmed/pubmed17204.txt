"This study compared faculty perceptions and expectations of dental students abilities using virtual reality simulation VRS to those who did not use virtual reality simulation non-VRS in an operative dentistry preclinical course. A sixteen-item survey with a ten-point rating scale and three open-ended questions asked about students abilities in ergonomics confidence level performance preparation and self-assessment. The surveys were administered three times to a small group of preclinical faculty members. First faculty members n=12 92 percent response rate gave their perceptions of non-VRS students abilities at the end of their traditional course. Secondly faculty members n=13 100 percent response rate gave their expectations of the next incoming classs abilities VRS students prior to the start of the course with traditional and VRS components. Finally faculty members n=13 100 percent response rate gave their perceptions of VRS students abilities after completion of the course. A Tukeys test for multiple comparisons measured significance among survey items. Faculty perceptions of VRS students abilities were higher than for non-VRS students for most abilities examined. However the faculty members expectations of VRS training were higher than their perceptions of the students abilities after VRS training for most abilities examined. Since ergonomic development and technical performance were positively impacted by VRS training these results support the use of VRS in a preclinical dental curriculum."
