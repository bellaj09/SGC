"Cervical tumor segmentation on 3D 18FDG PET images is a challenging task because of the proximity between cervix and bladder both of which can uptake 18FDG tracers. This problem makes traditional segmentation based on intensity variation methods ineffective and reduces overall accuracy. Based on anatomy knowledge including roundness of the cervical tumor and relative positioning between the bladder and cervix we propose a supervised machine learning method that integrates convolutional neural network CNN with this prior information to segment cervical tumors. First we constructed a spatial information embedded CNN model S-CNN that maps the PET image to its corresponding label map in which bladder other normal tissue and cervical tumor pixels are labeled as\u2009\u2009-1 0 and 1 respectively. Then we obtained the final segmentation from the output of the network by a prior information constrained PIC thresholding method. We evaluated the performance of the PIC-S-CNN method on PET images from 50 cervical cancer patients. The PIC-S-CNN method achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient DSC of 0.84 while region-growing Chan-Vese graph-cut fully convolutional neural networks FCN based FCN-8 stride and FCN-2 stride and U-net achieved 0.55 0.64 0.67 0.71 0.77 and 0.80 mean DSC respectively. The proposed PIC-S-CNN provides a more accurate way for segmenting cervical tumors on 3D PET images. Our results suggest that combining deep learning and anatomic prior information may improve segmentation accuracy for cervical tumors."
