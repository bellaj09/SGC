Although small-bowel angioectasia is reported as the most common cause of bleeding in patients and frequently diagnosed by capsule endoscopy CE in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding a computer-aided detection method has not been established. We developed an artificial intelligence system with deep learning that can automatically detect small-bowel angioectasia in CE images. Artificial intelligence using a convolutional neural network for automatic detection of small-bowel angioectasia in capsule endoscopy images.
