Humans anticipate the effects of gravity during visually simulated self-motion in the vertical direction. Here we report that an artificial vestibular stimulation consisting of short-tone bursts STB suppresses this anticipation. Participants pressed a button upon entering a tunnel during virtual-reality roller coaster rides in downward or forward directions. In different trials we delivered STB pulsed white noise WN or no sound NO. In the control conditions WN NO participants responded earlier during downward than forward motion irrespective of true kinematics consistent with the a priori expectation that downward but not forward motion is accelerated by gravity. STB canceled the difference in response timing between the two directions without affecting overall task performance. Thus we argue that vestibular signals play a role in the anticipation of visible gravity effects during self-motion. Sound-evoked vestibular stimulation affects the anticipation of gravity effects during visual self-motion.
