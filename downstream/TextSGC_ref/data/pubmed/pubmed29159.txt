In this study a brain-computer interface BCI framework for hybrid functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS and electroencephalography EEG for locked-in syndrome LIS patients is investigated. Brain tasks channel selection methods and feature extraction and classification algorithms available in the literature are reviewed. First we categorize various types of patients with cognitive and motor impairments to assess the suitability of BCI for each of them. The prefrontal cortex is identified as a suitable brain region for imaging. Second the brain activity that contributes to the generation of hemodynamic signals is reviewed. Mental arithmetic and word formation tasks are found to be suitable for use with LIS patients. Third since a specific targeted brain region is needed for BCI methods for determining the region of interest are reviewed. The combination of a bundled-optode configuration and threshold-integrated vector phase analysis turns out to be a promising solution. Fourth the usable fNIRS features and EEG features are reviewed. For hybrid BCI a combination of the signal peak and mean fNIRS signals and the highest band powers of EEG signals is promising. For classification linear discriminant analysis has been most widely used. However further research on vector phase analysis as a classifier for multiple commands is desirable. Overall proper brain region identification and proper selection of features will improve classification accuracy. In conclusion five future research issues are identified and a new BCI scheme including brain therapy for LIS patients and using the framework of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCI is provided.
