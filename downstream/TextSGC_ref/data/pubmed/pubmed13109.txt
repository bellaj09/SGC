The mechanism of action of empagliflozin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction HFrEF was deciphered using deep learning in silico analyses together with in\xa0vivo validation. The most robust mechanism of action involved the sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE-1 co-transporter with 94.7% accuracy which was similar for diabetics and nondiabetics. Notably direct NHE1 blockade by empagliflozin ameliorated cardiomyocyte cell death by restoring expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis XIAP and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 BIRC5. These results were independent of diabetes mellitus comorbidity suggesting that empagliflozin may emerge as a new treatment in HFrEF. Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of Action of Empagliflozin in Heart\xa0Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction With\xa0or\xa0Without Diabetes.
