Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI have demonstrated great promise for neuroprosthetics and assistive devices. Here we aim to investigate methods to combine Electroencephalography EEG and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy fNIRS in an asynchronous Sensory Motor rhythm SMR-based BCI. We attempted to classify 4 different executed movements namely Right-Arm-Left-Arm-Right-Hand-Left-Hand tasks. Previous studies demonstrated the benefit of EEG-fNIRS combination. However since normally fNIRS hemodynamic response shows a long delay we investigated new features involving slope indicators in order to immediately detect changes in the signals. Moreover Common Spatial Patterns CSPs have been applied to both EEG and fNIRS signals. 15 healthy subjects took part in the experiments and since 25 trials per class were available CSPs have been regularized with information from the entire population of participants and optimized using genetic algorithms. The different features have been compared in terms of performance and the dynamic accuracy over trials shows that the introduced methods diminish the fNIRS delay in the detection of changes.
