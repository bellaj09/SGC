"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs can translate the neuronal activity underlying a users movement intention into movements of an artificial effector. In spite of continuous improvements errors in movement decoding are still a major problem of current BMI systems. If the difference between the decoded and intended movements becomes noticeable it may lead to an execution error. Outcome errors where subjects fail to reach a certain movement goal are also present during online BMI operation. Detecting such errors can be beneficial for BMI operation: i errors can be corrected online after being detected and ii adaptive BMI decoding algorithm can be updated to make fewer errors in the future." Detection of error related neuronal responses recorded by electrocorticography in humans during continuous movements.
