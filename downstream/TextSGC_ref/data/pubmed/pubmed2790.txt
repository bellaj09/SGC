Autism spectrum disorder ASD is mainly characterized by functional and communication impairments as well as restrictive and repetitive behavior. The leading hypothesis for the neural basis of autism postulates globally abnormal brain connectivity which can be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. Even in the absence of a task the brain exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity known as intrinsic or resting-state connectivity. Global default connectivity in individuals with autism versus controls is not well characterized especially for a high-functioning young population. The aim of this study is to test whether high-functioning adolescents with ASD HFA have an abnormal resting-state functional connectivity.
