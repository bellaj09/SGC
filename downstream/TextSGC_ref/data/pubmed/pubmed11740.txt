With the emerging electric vehicle EV and fast charging technologies EV load forecasting has become a concern for planners and operators of EV charging stations CSs. Due to the nonstationary feature of the traffic flow TF and the erratic nature of the charging procedures EV charging load is difficult to accurately forecast. In this article TF is first predicted using a deep-learning-based convolutional neural network CNN and different forecast uncertainties are evaluated to formulate the TF prediction intervals PIs. Then the EV arrival rates are calculated according to the historical data and the proposed mixture model. Based on TF forecasting and arrival rate results the EV charging process is studied to convert the TF to the charging load using a novel probabilistic queuing model that takes into consideration charging service limitations and driver behaviors. The proposed models are assessed using the actual TF data and the results show that the uncertainties of the EV charging load can be learned comprehensively indicating significant potential for practical applications.
