"Real walking is the most natural way to locomote in virtual reality VR but a confined physical walking space limits its applicability. Redirected walking RDW is a collection of techniques to solve this problem. One of these techniques aims to imperceptibly rotate the users view of the virtual scene in order to steer her along a confined path whilst giving the impression of walking in a straight line in a large virtual space. Measurement of perceptual thresholds for the detection of such a modified curvature gain have indicated a radius that is still larger than most room sizes. Since the brain is an adaptive system and thresholds usually depend on previous stimulations we tested if prolonged exposure to an immersive virtual environment IVE with increased curvature gain produces adaptation to that gain and modifies thresholds such that over time larger curvature gains can be applied for RDW. Therefore participants first completed a measurement of their perceptual threshold for curvature gain. In a second session the same participants were exposed to an IVE with a constant curvature gain in which they walked between two targets for about 20 minutes. Afterwards their perceptual thresholds were measured again. The results show that the psychometric curves shifted after the exposure session and perceptual thresholds for increased curvature gain further increased. The increase of the detection threshold suggests that participants adapt to the manipulation and stronger curvature gains can be applied in RDW and therefore improves its applicability in such situations."
