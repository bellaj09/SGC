Common spatial patterns CSP is a prominent feature extraction algorithm in motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. However CSP is computed using sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence its performance deteriorates if the number of training trials is small. To address this problem this paper proposes a novel regularized covariance matrix estimation framework for CSP i.e. DTW-RCSP based on dynamic time warping DTW and transfer learning. Dynamic time warping-based transfer learning for improving common spatial patterns in brain-computer interface.
