In the study of the human connectome the vertices and the edges of the network of the human brain are analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal fibers connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the very same labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs novel robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes computed from the Human Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs each with 463 nodes. We show that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets than women; therefore in a sense the connections of the hippocampi are more regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus where it was shown that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women. The Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping of the human hippocampus shows much more frequent neighbor sets in males than in females.
