"Recent evidence for abnormal thalamic connectivity in autism spectrum disorders ASD and sensory processing disorders suggests the thalamus may play a role in sensory over-responsivity SOR an extreme negative response to sensory stimuli which is common in ASD. However there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention regulation and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth age 9-17; 19 ASD 19 IQ-matched typically developing TD. Parents rated childrens SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.
