Several cognitive behavioral therapeutic approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD symptoms Foa Keane Friedman & Cohen 2008. The bulk of PTSD treatment research has relied on pre-post designs which are limited in their ability to investigate the therapeutic process over time. The present study investigated the relations between PTSD symptom clusters using symptom assessment at pretreatment midtreatment and posttreatment using cross-lagged panel design over the course of Virtual Reality Exposure VRE treatment. Participants were 156 Iraq and/or Afghanistan veterans who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD due to military trauma. Using structural equation modeling the final reexperiencing model demonstrated good fit 234=39.95 p=.22; RMSEA=.034 90% CI: 0.00 0.07 CFI=.993 and results suggested that reexperiencing at pretreatment demonstrated a significant effect on numbing avoidance hyperarousal at midtreatment and reexperiencing symptoms at midtreatment demonstrate a significant effect on each of the three symptom clusters at posttreatment. These findings suggest that reexperiencing symptoms are indeed a key aspect of the therapeutic process within exposure therapy for PTSD. Additional research examining the impact of reexperiencing-focused intervention strategies on treatment outcomes is warranted.
