On behalf of the Journal of Cell Communication and Signaling Editorial board it is my great pleasure to present through this message of peace and love our warmest wishes of health happiness and professional success. We sincerely hope that 2017 will be a peaceful year worldwide and that solutions will be brought to resolve the great tensions that crystalized last year into terrible acts of violence which reflected the inability of the political powers to bring satisfactory solutions to human dispair and fear. The year 2017 will be the time for celebration of the 10th JCCS anniversary and 9th International Workshop on the CCN family of Genes. Both events should allow us to meet in a productive interactive way. I have had the opportunity to express several times in these columns my deep belief in the power of communication at all levels of human biological and social interactions. Indeed  Communication is the key  at large. Neuroscience and psychological studies sustain the cognitive benefits of print reading.
