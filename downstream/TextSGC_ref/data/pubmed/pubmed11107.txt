The Bacteria Biotope BB task is a biomedical relation extraction RE that aims to study the interaction between bacteria and their locations. This task is considered to pertain to fundamental knowledge in applied microbiology. Some previous investigations conducted the study by applying feature-based models; others have presented deep-learning-based models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks used with the shortest dependency paths SDPs. Although SDPs contain valuable and concise information some parts of crucial information that is required to define bacterial location relationships are often neglected. Moreover the traditional word-embedding used in previous studies may suffer from word ambiguation across linguistic contexts. Relation extraction between bacteria and biotopes from biomedical texts with attention mechanisms and domain-specific contextual representations.
