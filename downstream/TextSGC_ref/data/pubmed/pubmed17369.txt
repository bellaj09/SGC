This paper considers a problem of landmark point detection in clothes which is important and valuable for clothing industry. A novel method for landmark localization has been proposed which is based on a deep end-to-end architecture using prior of key point associations. With the estimated landmark points as input a deep network has been proposed to predict clothing categories and attributes. A systematic design of the proposed detecting system is implemented by using deep learning techniques and a large-scale clothes dataset containing 145 000 upper-body clothing images with landmark annotations. Experimental results indicate that clothing categories and attributes can be well classified by using the detected landmark points which are associated with regions of interest in clothes e.g. the sleeves and the collars and share robust learning representation property with respect to large variances of human poses nonfrontal views or occlusion. A comprehensive performance evaluation over two newly released datasets is carried out in this paper showing that the proposed system with deep architecture for clothing landmark detection outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
