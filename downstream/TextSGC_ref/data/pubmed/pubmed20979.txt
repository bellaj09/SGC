Informational density and relative accessibility of the peripheral nervous system make it an attractive site for therapeutic intervention. Electrode-based electrophysiological interfaces with peripheral nerves have been under development since the 1960s and for several applications have seen widespread clinical implementation. However many applications require a combination of neural target resolution and stability which has thus far eluded existing peripheral nerve interfaces PNIs. With the goal of aiding PNI designers in development of devices that meet the demands of next-generation applications this review seeks to collect and present practical considerations and best practices which emerge from the literature including both lessons learned during early PNI development and recent ideas. Fundamental and practical principles guiding PNI design are reviewed followed by an updated and critical account of existing PNI designs and strategies. Finally a brief survey of in vitro and in vivo PNI characterization methods is presented. A review for the peripheral nerve interface designer.
