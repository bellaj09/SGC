We investigated how the properties of interactive virtual reality systems affect user behavior in full-body embodied interactions. Our experiment compared four interactive virtual reality systems using different display types CAVE vs. HMD and modes of locomotion walking vs. joystick. Participants performed a perceptual-motor coordination task in which they had to choose among a series of opportunities to pass through a gate that cycled open and closed and then board a moving train. Mode of locomotion but not type of display affected how participants chose opportunities for action. Both mode of locomotion and display affected performance when participants acted on their choices. We conclude that technological properties of virtual reality system both display and mode of locomotion significantly affected opportunities for action available in the environment affordances and discuss implications for design and practical applications of immersive interactive systems. Dynamic affordances in embodied interactive systems: the role of display and mode of locomotion.
