Adjustment disorder AD and complicated grief CG are serious mental conditions that have a high prevalence and are associated with significant impairments in social and work functioning. Recently these categories have been better specified in the new ICD-11 proposal. Empirical research on the efficacy of treatments for these problems is scarce. This study aims to offer long-term efficacy data from a between-groups controlled study that compares two treatment conditions AD-protocol applied in a traditional way: N\xa0=\xa018 and the same protocol supported by virtual reality VR; VR-protocol applied in a traditional way: N\xa0=\xa018 and a waiting list WL control group N\xa0=\xa018. Both treatment conditions resulted in statistically significant improvements on both primary and secondary outcome measures with large effect sizes and this improvement did not occur in the WL. These changes were maintained in both treatment conditions in the medium 6-month and long-term 12-month follow-up. Larger effect sizes were achieved in the VR condition in the long term. Furthermore clinically significant change estimations on the primary outcome measures showed an advantage for the VR condition This is the first controlled study to compare a traditional face-to-face protocol for the treatment of stress-related disorders with the same protocol supported by VR and a WL control group. An adaptive virtual reality system for the treatment of adjustment disorder and complicated grief: 1-year follow-up efficacy data.
