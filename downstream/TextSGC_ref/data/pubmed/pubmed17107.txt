Sleep has proven to support the memory consolidation in many tasks including learning of perceptual skills. Explicit conscious types of memory have been demonstrated to benefit particularly from slow-wave sleep SWS implicit non-conscious types particularly from rapid eye movement REM sleep. By comparing the effects of early-night sleep rich in SWS and late-night sleep rich in REM sleep we aimed to separate the contribution of these two sleep stages in a metacontrast masking paradigm in which explicit and implicit aspects in perceptual learning could be assessed separately by stimulus identification and priming respectively. We assumed that early sleep intervening between two sessions of task performance would specifically support stimulus identification while late sleep would specifically support priming. Apart from overt behavior event-related EEG potentials ERPs were measured to record the cortical mechanisms associated with behavioral changes across sleep. In contrast to our hypothesis late-night sleep appeared to be more important for changes of behavior both for stimulus identification which tended to improve across late-night sleep and for priming with the increase of errors induced by masked stimuli correlating with the duration of REM sleep. ERP components proved sensitive to presence of target shapes in the masked stimuli and to their priming effects. Of these components the N2 component indicating processing of conflict became larger across early-night sleep and was related to the duration of S4 sleep the deepest substage of SWS containing particularly high portions of EEG slow waves. These findings suggest that sleep promotes perceptual learning primarily by its REM sleep portion but indirectly also by way of improved action monitoring supported by deep slow-wave sleep.
