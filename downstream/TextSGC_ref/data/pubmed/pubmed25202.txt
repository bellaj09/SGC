Virtual colonoscopy involves a helical CT or MR scan of the abdomen and pelvis to detect colorectal polyps and cancer. Both modalities have shown promising sensitivity in revealing larger polyps in comparison with colonoscopy. Caution should be exercised in its clinical implementation due to significant interobserver variation and individual learning curves. A Danish study indicates that CT colonography CTC can be performed cost-effectively compared to colonoscopy. CTC is recommended in preference to double-contrast barium enema after incomplete colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is now reality.
