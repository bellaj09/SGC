"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs independent of the brains normal output pathways are attracting an increasing amount of attention as devices that extract neural information. As a typical type of BCI system the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCIs possess a high signal-to-noise ratio and information transfer rate. However the current high speed SSVEP-BCIs were implemented with subjects concentrating on stimuli and intentionally avoided additional tasks as distractors. This paper aimed to investigate how a distracting simultaneous task a verbal n-back task with different mental workload would affect the performance of SSVEP-BCI. The results from fifteen subjects revealed that the recognition accuracy of SSVEP-BCI was significantly impaired by the distracting task especially under a high mental workload. The average classification accuracy across all subjects dropped by 8.67% at most from 1- to 4-back and there was a significant negative correlation maximum r = -0.48 p < 0.001 between accuracy and subjective mental workload evaluation of the distracting task. This study suggests a potential hindrance for the SSVEP-BCI daily use and then improvements should be investigated in the future studies."
