"We explored the impact of an interactive VR environment on pain cognitions in vivo catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy and pain-related measures: pain threshold pain tolerance Pain Sensitivity Range PSR pain intensity and time estimation in a sample of healthy students. Sense of presence is essential to conduct a psychological treatment; if patients are not able to involve themselves in a virtual world they cannot experience relevant emotions and the desired processes that are necessary for most psychological treatments will not occur. However some authors argue that presence must be distinguished from the degree of engagement involvement in the portrayed environment. The results obtained in our study are consistent with this view since the Involvement scale of the IPQ did not correlate with any of the measures related with the treatments efficacy."
