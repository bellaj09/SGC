"In modern society natural objects like spiders or snakes have a primary role as the loci of specific phobias. Drawing on interviews with members of the UK National Phobics Society NPS and associated service providers this paper explores the implications of the increasingly significant role played by new media particularly Virtual Reality technologies in the treatment of these bio-phobias. While advanced technological approaches provide new possibilities for individual sufferers to experiment with and control their phobic responses they also exemplify certain aspects of those specifically modern social relations that are the media within which bio-phobic behaviours develop. From a critical sociological perspective the techno-philic move to the medium of cyber-space may actually exaggerate characteristically modern social relations that seek but never convincingly manage to assert complete cultural control over the unpredictable natural elements threatening our cultural integrity."
