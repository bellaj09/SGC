"Stroke is one of the leading causes for disability worldwide. Motor function deficits due to stroke affect the patients mobility their limitation in daily life activities their participation in society and their odds of returning to professional activities. All of these factors contribute to a low overall quality of life. Rehabilitation training is the most effective way to reduce motor impairments in stroke patients. This multiple systematic review focuses both on standard treatment methods and on innovating rehabilitation techniques used to promote upper extremity motor function in stroke patients. A total number of 5712 publications on stroke rehabilitation was systematically reviewed for relevance and quality with regards to upper extremity motor outcome. This procedure yielded 270 publications corresponding to the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. Recent technology-based interventions in stroke rehabilitation including non-invasive brain stimulation robot-assisted training and virtual reality immersion are addressed. Finally a decisional tree based on evidence from the literature and characteristics of stroke patients is proposed. At present the stroke rehabilitation field faces the challenge to tailor evidence-based treatment strategies to the needs of the individual stroke patient. Interventions can be combined in order to achieve the maximal motor function recovery for each patient. Though the efficacy of some interventions may be under debate motor skill learning and some new technological approaches give promising outcome prognosis in stroke motor rehabilitation."
