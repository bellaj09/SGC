We have all witnessed the devastation of strokes on friends and family especially the profound impact on the quality of life for people post-stroke. Over the past few years remarkable progress has been made for first responders to identify and reduce the impact of strokes. Yet people post-stroke often experience the direct and indirect effects of the brain injury including loss of motor function. Judith Deutsch and her multidisciplinary team at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey are researching how virtual reality and videogames can improve balance mobility coordination and stamina of stroke victims. I had the pleasure of meeting personally with Judy and her team in their impressive research center in Newark NJ. Judith Deutsch PT PhD FAPTA: Stroke Therapy Innovator.
