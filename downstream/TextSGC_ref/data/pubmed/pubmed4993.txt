Major depressive disorder MDD is a serious mental illness characterized by dysfunctional connectivity among distributed brain regions. Previous connectome studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI have focused primarily on undirected functional connectivity and existing directed effective connectivity EC studies concerned mostly task-based fMRI and incorporated only a few brain regions. To overcome these limitations and understand whether MDD is mediated by within-network or between-network connectivities we applied spectral dynamic causal modeling to estimate EC of a large-scale network with 27 regions of interests from four distributed functional brain networks default mode executive control salience and limbic networks based on large sample-size resting-state fMRI consisting of 100 healthy subjects and 100 individuals with first-episode drug-naive MDD. We applied a newly developed parametric empirical Bayes PEB framework to test specific hypotheses. We showed that MDD altered EC both within and between high-order functional networks. Specifically MDD is associated with reduced excitatory connectivity mainly within the default mode network DMN and between the default mode and salience networks. In addition the network-averaged inhibitory EC within the DMN was found to be significantly elevated in the MDD. The coexistence of the reduced excitatory but increased inhibitory causal connections within the DMNs may underlie disrupted self-recognition and emotional control in MDD. Overall this study emphasizes that MDD could be associated with altered causal interactions among high-order brain functional networks.
