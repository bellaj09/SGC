"Virtual microscopy has an established role in medical practice and education across all medical disciplines. It provides economical and pedagogical advantages albeit with some shortcomings. We randomly assigned two groups of second-year medical students from the University of Tabuk in KSA to use either conventional light or virtual microscopy practical sessions. The students perceptions were assessed by written and practical exams. Students in the virtual microscopy group performed better than those in the light microscopy group in both practical and written exams as reflected by their more-uniform performance and less-scattered grades. The virtual microscopy group had the advantage of optional online off-campus access to study materials which they spent an average of 2.5\xa0h reviewing. Virtual microscopy is a valid educational tool that can augment conventional microscopy in pathology practical sessions and its application is convenient for both students and staff."
