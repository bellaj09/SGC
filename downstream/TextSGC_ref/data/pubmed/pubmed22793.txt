A dual adaptation paradigm was used in order to study the adaptation to two conditions of conflicting visual and kinesthetic and vestibular information. Adaptation was induced in humans by modifying visual information during whole-body rotations with the help of a virtual reality set-up. Real rotations\ amplitudes were factored by a gain of 0.5 or 1.5. The two conditions were associated to a visual context cue. The aim of the experiment was to provide support for either the feedback or the feedforward model of adaptive states switch. Results show that subjects could adapt to the two conditions of conflict during whole-body rotations. However the two conflict situations have been found to differ both in their motor dynamics and in their susceptibility to adaptation as it seems that the adaptation is more complete in the condition of gain 1.5 i.e. faster and more precise. Subjects could be divided into two groups according to their ability to use contextual information to switch between adaptive gains. The visual cues were sufficient for some subjects to switch adaptive state which corresponds to a context-dependent dual adaptation or feedforward model of switching. Other subjects showed a switch cost maintained across the experiment corresponding with a stimulus-dependent adaptation or feedback model of switching. We are suggesting that the process enabling switching between adaptive states depends on subjects\ abilities to use contextual cues of certain types and thus on their "perceptive styles". This could explain the variability of results obtained in the literature. Dual adaptation to sensory conflicts during whole-body rotations.
