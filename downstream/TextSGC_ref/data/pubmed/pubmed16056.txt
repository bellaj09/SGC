Mobile cellular communications are experiencing an exponential growth in traffic load on Long Term Evolution LTE eNode B eNB components. Such load can be significantly contained by directly sharing content among nearby users through device-to-device D2D communications so that repeated downloads of the same data can be avoided as much as possible. Accordingly for the purpose of improving the efficiency of content sharing and decreasing the load on the eNB it is important to maximize the number of simultaneous D2D transmissions. Specially maximizing the number of D2D links can not only improve spectrum and energy efficiency but can also reduce transmission delay. However enabling maximum D2D links in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First the interference between the D2D and cellular communications could critically affect their performance. Second the minimum quality of service QoS requirement of cellular and D2D communication must be guaranteed. Therefore a selection of active links is critical to gain the maximum number of D2D links. This can be formulated as a classical integer linear programming problem link scheduling that is known to be NP-hard. This paper proposes to obtain a set of network features via deep learning for solving this challenging problem. The idea is to optimize the D2D link schedule problem with a deep neural network DNN. This makes a significant time reduction for delay-sensitive operations since the computational overhead is mainly spent in the training process of the model. The simulation performed on a randomly generated link schedule problem showed that our algorithm is capable of finding satisfactory D2D link scheduling solutions by reducing computation time up to 90% without significantly affecting their accuracy.
