The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD using the Kinect system during stationary rehabilitation. The study included 68 patients with COPD 35 men 33 women mean age 61.3  3.7. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups described below. Group I included 34 patients - non-participants in Kinect training. Group II included 34 patients - participants in Kinect training. In all patients before and after rehabilitation physical fitness was assessed using the Senior Fitness Test SFT. The Xbox 360 and Kinect motion sensor were used to carry out virtual reality training. In group I statistically significant improvements in SFT performance were observed. Patients in group II also showed statistically significant improvement in physical fitness in all attempts of the SFT. Virtual rehabilitation training in patients with COPD seems to be a practical and beneficial intervention capable of enhancing mobility and physical fitness.
