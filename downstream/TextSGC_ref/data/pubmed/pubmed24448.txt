"The main goal of this study was to develop a hybrid mental spelling system combining a steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI technology and a webcam-based eye-tracker which utilizes information from the brain electrical activity and eye gaze direction at the same time. In the hybrid mental spelling system a character decoded using SSVEP was not typed if the position of the selected character was not matched with the eye direction information left or right obtained from the eye-tracker. Thus the users did not need to correct a misspelled character using a BACKSPACE key. To verify the feasibility of the developed hybrid mental spelling system we conducted online experiments with ten healthy participants. Each participant was asked to type 15 English words consisting of 68 characters. As a result 16.6 typing errors could be prevented on average demonstrating that the implemented hybrid mental spelling system could enhance the practicality of our mental spelling system."
