The operations of current robotics systems in low-earth orbit could benefit from the use of virtual reality VR systems to improve their performance. This paper presents an example of the type of contribution such a system could provide to assist the space robot operators in their operations by using the increased situational awareness and the ease of use associated with VR systems. Using VR to improve the performance of low-earth orbit space robot operations.
