Building and testing novel prosthetic limbs and control algorithms for functional electrical stimulation FES is expensive and risky. Here we describe a virtual reality environment VRE to facilitate and accelerate the development of novel systems. In the VRE subjects/patients can operate a simulated limb to interact with virtual objects. Realistic models of all relevant musculoskeletal and mechatronic components allow the development of entire prosthetic systems in VR before introducing them to the patient. The system is used both by engineers as a development tool and by clinicians to fit prosthetic devices to patients. A virtual reality environment for designing and fitting neural prosthetic limbs.
