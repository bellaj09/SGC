"In this paper we put forward a real-time multiple GPUs multi-GPU accelerated virtual-reality interaction simulation framework where the reconstructed objects from camera images interact with virtual deformable objects. Firstly based on an extended voxel-based visual hull VbVH algorithm we design an image-based 3D reconstruction platform for real objects. Then an improved hybrid deformation model which couples the geometry constrained fast lattice shape matching method FLSM and total Lagrangian explicit dynamics TLED algorithm is proposed to achieve efficient and stable simulation of the virtual objects elastic deformations. Finally one-way virtual-reality interactions including soft tissues virtual cutting with bleeding effects are successfully simulated. Moreover with the purpose of significantly improving the computational efficiency of each time step we propose an entire multi-GPU implementation method of the framework using compute unified device architecture CUDA. The experiment results demonstrate that our multi-GPU accelerated virtual-reality interaction framework achieves real-time performance under the moderate calculation scale which is a new effective 3D interaction technique for virtual reality applications."
