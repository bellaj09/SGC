The bedside detection of potential awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness DOC currently relies only on behavioral observations and tests; however the misdiagnosis rates in this patient group are historically relatively high. In this study we proposed a visual hybrid brain-computer interface BCI combining P300 and steady-state evoked potential SSVEP responses to detect awareness in severely brain injured patients.
