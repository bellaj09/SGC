"During mechanical ventilation patient-ventilator disharmony is frequently observed and may result in increased breathing effort compromising the patients comfort and recovery. This circumstance requires clinical intervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In this study we propose a brain-computer interface BCI to automatically and noninvasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from electroencephalographic EEG signals: a brain-ventilator interface BVI."
