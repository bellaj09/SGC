Brain structure has been proposed to facilitate as well as constrain functional interactions within brain networks. Simulation models suggest that integrity of white matter WM microstructure should be positively related to the complexity of BOLD signal - a measure of network interactions. Using 121 young adults from the Human Connectome Project we empirically tested whether greater WM integrity would be associated with greater complexity of the BOLD signal during rest via multiscale entropy. Multiscale entropy measures the lack of predictability within a given time series across varying time scales thus being able to estimate fluctuating signal dynamics within brain networks. Using multivariate analysis techniques Partial Least Squares we found that greater WM integrity was associated with greater network complexity at fast time scales but less network complexity at slower time scales. These findings implicate two separate pathways through which WM integrity affects brain function in the prefrontal cortex - an executive-prefrontal pathway and a perceptuo-occipital pathway. In two additional samples the main patterns of WM and network complexity were replicated. These findings support simulation models of WM integrity and network complexity and provide new insights into brain structure-function relationships.
