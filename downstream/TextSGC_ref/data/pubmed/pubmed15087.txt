"Circular RNAs circRNAs are a new class of endogenous RNAs in animals and plants. During pre-RNA splicing the 5 and 3 termini of exons can be covalently ligated to form circRNAs through back-splicing head-to-tail splicing. CircRNAs can be conserved across species show tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns and may be associated with human disease. However the mechanism of circRNA formation is still unclear although some sequence features have been shown to affect back-splicing."
