The temperature-dependent oocyte membrane permeability plays a significant role in oocyte cryopreservation such as optimizing the addition/removal of cryoprotective agents and the rate of cooling/rewarming. However the systems for studying the temperature dependence of oocyte membrane permeability are either too complicated or unable to achieve wide-range precise temperature control. In addition these systems cannot achieve the simultaneous observation of multiple oocytes. Here we report a novel microfluidic platform that combines a precise local temperature heater/detector and a simple global water bath to achieve wide-range accurate temperature control without increasing the difficulty of fabrication and it also realizes non-interfering position-controllable and non-missing capture of multiple oocytes for parallel experiments to increase throughput. The permeability coefficients Lp Ps of the mouse oocyte membrane exposed to cryoprotective agents 1.5 M EG and 1.5 M PG at four temperatures 4 15 25 and 37 C are consistent with those reported in previous works which proves the feasibility and practicality of the microfluidic platform in this study. A microfluidic platform with cell-scale precise temperature control for simultaneous investigation of the osmotic responses of multiple oocytes.
