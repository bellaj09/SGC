Purpose: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder UCB is the most common urinary cancer. White-light cystoscopy WLC forms the corner stone for the diagnosis of UCB. However histopathological assessment is required for adjuvant treatment selection. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy pCLE enables visualization of the microarchitecture of bladder lesions during WLC which allows for real-time tissue differentiation and grading of UCB. To improve the diagnostic process of UCB computer-aided classification of pCLE videos of in vivo bladder lesions were evaluated in this study. Materials and Methods: We implemented preprocessing methods to optimize contrast and to reduce striping artifacts in each individual pCLE frame. Subsequently a semiautomatic frame selection was performed. The selected frames were used to train a feature extractor based on pretrained ImageNet networks. A recurrent neural network in specific long short-term memory LSTM was used to predict the grade of bladder lesions. Differentiation of lesions was performed at two levels namely i healthy and benign vs malignant tissue and ii low-grade vs high-grade papillary UCB. A total of 53 patients with 72 lesions were included in this study resulting in 140000 pCLE frames. Results: The semiautomated frame selection reduced the number of frames to 66500 informative frames. The accuracy for differentiation of i healthy and benign vs malignant urothelium was 79% and ii high-grade and low-grade papillary UCB was 82%. Conclusions: A feature extractor in combination with LSTM results in proper stratification of pCLE videos of in vivo bladder lesions.
