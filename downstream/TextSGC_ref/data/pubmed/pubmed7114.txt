Plankton including phytoplankton and zooplankton are the main source of food for organisms in the ocean and form the base of marine food chain. As the fundamental components of marine ecosystems plankton is very sensitive to environment changes and the study of plankton abundance and distribution is crucial in order to understand environment changes and protect marine ecosystems. This study was carried out to develop an extensive applicable plankton classification system with high accuracy for the increasing number of various imaging devices. Literature shows that most plankton image classification systems were limited to only one specific imaging device and a relatively narrow taxonomic scope. The real practical system for automatic plankton classification is even non-existent and this study is partly to fill this gap. Automatic plankton image classification combining multiple view features via multiple kernel learning.
