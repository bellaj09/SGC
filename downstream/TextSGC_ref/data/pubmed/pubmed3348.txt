"Increasing evidence has suggested that central plasticity plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of chronic nonspecific low back pain. However it is unclear how local or short-distance functional interactions contribute to persisting low back-related leg pain LBLP due to a specific condition i.e. lumbar disc herniation. In particular the multiscale nature of local connectivity properties in various brain regions is still unclear. Here we used voxelwise Kendalls coefficient of concordance KCC and coherence Cohe regional homogeneity ReHo in the typical 0.01-0.1\u202fHz and five specific frequency slow-6 to slow-2 bands to analyze individual whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 25 persistent LBLP patients duration: 36.7\u202f\u202f9.6\u202fmonths and 26 healthy control subjects. Between-group differences demonstrated significant alterations in the KCC- and Cohe- ReHo of the right cerebellum posterior lobe brainstem left medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral precuneus in LBLP patients in the typical and five specific frequency bands respectively along with interactions between disease status and the five specific frequency bands in several regions of the pain matrix and the default-mode network P\u202f<\u202f.01 Gaussian random field theory correction. The altered ReHo in the five specific frequency bands was correlated with the duration of pain and two-point discrimination which were assessed using partial correlational analysis. These results linked the course of disease to the local connectivity properties in specific frequency bands in persisting LBLP. In future studies exploring local connectome association in pain conditions integrated frequency bands and analytical methods should be considered."
