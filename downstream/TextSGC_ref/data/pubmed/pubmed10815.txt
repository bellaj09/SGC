"The health and function of tissue rely on its vasculature network to provide reliable blood perfusion. Volumetric imaging approaches such as multiphoton microscopy are able to generate detailed 3D images of blood vessels that could contribute to our understanding of the role of vascular structure in normal physiology and in disease mechanisms. The segmentation of vessels a core image analysis problem is a bottleneck that has prevented the systematic comparison of 3D vascular architecture across experimental populations. We explored the use of convolutional neural networks to segment 3D vessels within volumetric in vivo images acquired by multiphoton microscopy. We evaluated different network architectures and machine learning techniques in the context of this segmentation problem. We show that our optimized convolutional neural network architecture with a customized loss function which we call DeepVess yielded a segmentation accuracy that was better than state-of-the-art methods while also being orders of magnitude faster than the manual annotation. To explore the effects of aging and Alzheimers disease on capillaries we applied DeepVess to 3D images of cortical blood vessels in young and old mouse models of Alzheimers disease and wild type littermates. We found little difference in the distribution of capillary diameter or tortuosity between these groups but did note a decrease in the number of longer capillary segments >75m in aged animals as compared to young in both wild type and Alzheimers disease mouse models."
