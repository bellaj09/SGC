Significant changes in extrafusal fiber type composition take place in the human masseter muscle from young age 3-7 years to adulthood in parallel with jaw-face skeleton growth changes of dentitions and improvement of jaw functions. As motor and sensory control systems of muscles are interlinked also the intrafusal fiber population that is muscle spindles should undergo age-related changes in fiber type appearance. To test this hypothesis we examined muscle spindles in the young masseter muscle and compared the result with previous data on adult masseter spindles. Also muscle spindles in the young biceps brachii muscle were examined. The result showed that muscle spindle composition and distribution were alike in young and adult masseter. As for the adult masseter young masseter contained exceptionally large muscle spindles and with the highest spindle density and most complex spindles found in the deep masseter portion. Hence contrary to our hypothesis masseter spindles do not undergo major morphological changes between young age and adulthood. Also in the biceps young spindles were alike adult spindles. Taken together the results showed that human masseter and biceps muscle spindles are morphologically mature already at young age. We conclude that muscle spindles in the human young masseter and biceps precede the extrafusal fiber population in growth and maturation. This in turn suggests early reflex control and proprioceptive demands in learning and maturation of jaw motor skills. Similarly well-developed muscle spindles in young biceps reflect early need of reflex control in learning and performing arm motor behavior. Muscle spindle composition and distribution in human young masseter and biceps brachii muscles reveal early growth and maturation.
