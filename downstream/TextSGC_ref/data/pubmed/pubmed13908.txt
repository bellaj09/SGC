Gestational age estimation at time of birth is critical for determining the degree of prematurity of the infant and for administering appropriate postnatal treatment. We present a fully automated algorithm for estimating gestational age of premature infants through smartphone lens imaging of the anterior lens capsule vasculature ALCV. Our algorithm uses a fully convolutional network and blind image quality analyzers to segment usable anterior capsule regions. Then it extracts ALCV features using a residual neural network architecture and trains on these features using a support vector machine-based classifier. The classification algorithm is validated using leave-one-out cross-validation on videos captured from 124 neonates. The algorithm is expected to be an influential tool for remote and point-of-care gestational age estimation of premature neonates in low-income countries. To this end we have made the software open source. Open-source machine and deep learning-based automated algorithm for gestational age estimation through smartphone lens imaging.
