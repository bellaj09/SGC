"For two decades EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI systems have been widely studied in research labs. Now researchers want to consider out-of-the-lab applications and make this technology available to everybody. However medical-grade EEG recording devices are still much too expensive for end-users especially disabled people. Therefore several low-cost alternatives have appeared on the market. The Emotiv Epoc headset is one of them. Although some previous work showed this device could suit the customers needs in terms of performance no quantitative classification-based assessments compared to a medical system are available."
