Healthcare faculty members have come to depend on the advantages of teaching with clinical simulation but not all faculty are competent in their ability to manage students during the simulation experience. This federally funded proposal provided the opportunity for nursing faculty to participate in a synchronous learning event using the virtual reality world of Second Life SL. Based on competencies faculty participants were guided through the simulation process by a "Master Teacher." Participants then became the teacher and chose the settings objectives and clinical data to manage their own simulation using avatar role assignments. Feedback populated the participant informatics dashboard so that progress towards their competencies was recorded. Another unique informatics application was the use of the Synthetic Derivative project to use de-identified patient data to promote better clinical realism. Additional evaluation activities regarding content appropriate use of the technology and design features were assessed. The development of the SL environment for this educational study provides the setting in which to pilot test the provision of actual clinical care that does not require "hands-on" interventions.
