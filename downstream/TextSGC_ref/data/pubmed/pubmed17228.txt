"We present an augmented reality system for oral and maxillofacial surgery in this paper. Instead of being displayed on a separated screen three-dimensional 3D virtual presentations of osseous structures and soft tissues are projected onto the patients body providing surgeons with exact knowledge of depth information of high risk tissues inside the bone. We employ a 3D integral imaging technique which produce motion parallax in both horizontal and vertical direction over a wide viewing area in this study. In addition surgeons are able to check the progress of the operation in real-time through an intuitive 3D based interface which is content-rich hardware accelerated. These features prevent surgeons from penetrating into high risk areas and thus help improve the quality of the operation. Operational tasks such as hole drilling screw fixation were performed using our system and showed an overall positional error of less than 1 mm. Feasibility of our system was also verified with a human volunteer experiment." Augmented reality system for oral surgery using 3D auto stereoscopic visualization.
