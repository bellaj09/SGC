"BackgroundThe performance of a deep learning DL algorithm should be validated in actual clinical situations before its clinical implementation.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a DL algorithm for identifying chest radiographs with clinically relevant abnormalities in the emergency department ED setting.Materials and MethodsThis single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients who visited the ED and underwent initial chest radiography between January 1 and March 31 2017. Chest radiographs were analyzed with a commercially available DL algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC sensitivity and specificity at predefined operating cutoffs high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs. The sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm were compared with those of the on-call radiology residents who interpreted the chest radiographs in the actual practice by using McNemar tests. If there were discordant findings between the algorithm and resident the residents reinterpreted the chest radiographs by using the algorithms output.ResultsA total of 1135 patients mean age 53 years  18; 582 men were evaluated. In the identification of abnormal chest radiographs the algorithm showed an AUC of 0.95 95% confidence interval CI: 0.93 0.96 a sensitivity of 88.7% 227 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 84.1% 92.3% and a specificity of 69.6% 612 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 66.5% 72.7% at the high-sensitivity cutoff and a sensitivity of 81.6% 209 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 76.3% 86.2% and specificity of 90.3% 794 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 88.2% 92.2% at the high-specificity cutoff. Radiology residents showed lower sensitivity 65.6% 168 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 59.5% 71.4% P < .001 and higher specificity 98.1% 862 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 96.9% 98.9% P < .001 compared with the algorithm. After reinterpretation of chest radiographs with use of the algorithms outputs the sensitivity of the residents improved 73.4% 188 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 68.0% 78.8% P = .003 whereas specificity was reduced 94.3% 829 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 92.8% 95.8% P < .001.ConclusionA deep learning algorithm used with emergency department chest radiographs showed diagnostic performance for identifying clinically relevant abnormalities and helped improve the sensitivity of radiology residents evaluation.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Munera and Infante in this issue."
