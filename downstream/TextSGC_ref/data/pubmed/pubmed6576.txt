"Accurate grading of non-muscle invasive urothelial cell carcinoma UCC is of major importance however high inter-observer variability exists. A fully-automated detection and grading network based on deep learning is proposed to enhance reproducibility. A total of 328 transurethral resection specimens from 232 patients were included. A consensus reading by three specialized pathologists was utilized. The slides were digitized and the urothelium was annotated by expert observers. The U-Net based segmentation network was trained to automatically detect urothelium in the sections. This detection was used as input for the classification network. The classification network aimed to grade the tumors according to the WHO04 grading system. The automated grading was compared with the consensus and individual grading. The segmentation network resulted in an accurate detection of urothelium. False positive urothelium detection was mostly found in regions with extensive color loss or inflammation and occurred in 13% of the sections. The automated grading shows moderate agreement =0.48  0.14 se with the consensus reading. The agreement among pathologists ranges between fair =0.35  0.13 se & =0.38  0.11 se and moderate =0.52  0.13 se. The automated classification correctly grades 76% of the low-grade and 71% of the high-grade cancers according to the consensus reading. These results indicate that deep learning can be used for the fully-automated detection and grading of UCC."
