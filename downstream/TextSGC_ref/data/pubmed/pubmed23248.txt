A Brain-Computer Interface in motion control application requires high system responsiveness and accuracy. SSVEP interface consisted of 2-8 stimuli and 2 channel EEG amplifier was presented in this paper. The observed stimulus is recognized based on a canonical correlation calculated in 1 second window ensuring high interface responsiveness. A threshold classifier with hysteresis T-H was proposed for recognition purposes. Obtained results suggest that T-H classifier enables to significantly increase classifier performance resulting in accuracy of 76% while maintaining average false positive detection rate of stimulus different then observed one between 2-13% depending on stimulus frequency. It was shown that the parameters of T-H classifier maximizing true positive rate can be estimated by gradient-based search since the single maximum was observed. Moreover the preliminary results performed on a test group N=4 suggest that for T-H classifier exists a certain set of parameters for which the system accuracy is similar to accuracy obtained for user-trained classifier.
