Considering the relative motion of the moving virtual object and human operator a new multi-DOF passivity condition is derived in the joint space to easily cover the rotational motion in the task space. This approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous static approaches which could not display the interaction force with moving virtual objects because they only considered the motion of the operator in their controllers. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach various dynamic scenarios are tested. The experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures stability and direction transparency of the haptic interaction with any passive or slightly active dynamic multi-DOF system.
