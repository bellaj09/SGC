We report a patient with pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis induced by cancer chemotherapy who received successful anticoagulation using a single-drug approach with rivaroxaban. Cancer-associated thrombosis CAT is a leading cause of non-cancer death in patients with cancer which is induced by cancer itself and/or chemotherapy agents including cisplatin and gemcitabine. By contrast hemorrhagic state is another feature of advanced cancer. In these opposite conditions of cancer patients CAT have to be controlled by appropriate anticoagulation. This case shows potential for single-drug approach with rivaroxaban and direct oral anticoagulants being effective and safety strategy against CAT. <Learning objective: Single-drug approach of direct oral anticoagulants DOACs against CAT induced by cisplatin and gemcitabine showed satisfactory anticoagulation without heparin and warfarin. CAT has been important issue in oncology field and single-drug approach of DOACs could be an effective and safety strategy for anticoagulation against CAT.>.
