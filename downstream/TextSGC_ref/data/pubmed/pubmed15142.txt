Automatic segmentation of prostate magnetic resonance MR images has great significance for the diagnosis and clinical application of prostate diseases. It faces enormous challenges because of the low contrast of the tissue boundary and the small effective area of the prostate MR images. In order to solve these problems we propose a novel end-to-end professional network which consists of an Encoder-Decoder structure with dense dilated spatial pyramid pooling DDSPP for prostate segmentation based on deep learning. First the DDSPP module is used to extract the multi-scale convolution features in the prostate MR images and then the decoder is used to capture the clear boundary of prostate. Competitive results are produced over state of the art on 130 MR images which key metrics Dice similarity coefficient DSC and Hausdorff distance HD are 0.954 and 1.752\u2009mm respectively. Experimental results show that our method has high accuracy and robustness. Encoder-decoder with dense dilated spatial pyramid pooling for prostate MR images segmentation.
