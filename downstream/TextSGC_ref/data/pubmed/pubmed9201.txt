Smart agricultural sensing has enabled great advantages in practical applications recently making it one of the most important and valuable systems. For outdoor plantation farms the prediction of climate data such as temperature wind speed and humidity enables the planning and control of agricultural production to improve the yield and quality of crops. However it is not easy to accurately predict climate trends because the sensing data are complex nonlinear and contain multiple components. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning predictor in which an empirical mode decomposition EMD method is used to decompose the climate data into fixed component groups with different frequency characteristics then a gated recurrent unit GRU network is trained for each group as the sub-predictor and finally the results from the GRU are added to obtain the prediction result. Experiments based on climate data from an agricultural Internet of Things IoT system verify the development of the proposed model. The prediction results show that the proposed predictor can obtain more accurate predictions of temperature wind speed and humidity data to meet the needs of precision agricultural production.
