Concussion is associated with significant adverse effects within the first week post-injury including physical complaints and altered cognition sleep and mood. It is currently unknown whether these subjective disturbances have reliable functional brain correlates. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI has been used to measure functional connectivity of individuals after traumatic brain injury but less is known about the relationship between functional connectivity and symptom assessments after a sport concussion. In this study rs-fMRI was used to evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity for seventy 70 university-level athletes including 35 with acute concussion and 35 healthy matched controls. Univariate analyses showed that greater symptom severity was mainly associated with lower pairwise connectivity in frontal temporal and insular regions along with higher connectivity in a sparser set of cerebellar regions. A novel multivariate approach also extracted two components that showed reliable covariation with symptom severity: 1 a network of frontal temporal and insular regions where connectivity was negatively correlated with symptom severity replicating the univariate findings; and 2 a network with anti-correlated elements of the default-mode network and sensorimotor system where connectivity was positively correlated with symptom severity. These findings support the presence of connectomic signatures of symptom complaints following a sport-related concussion including both increased and decreased functional connectivity within distinct functional brain networks.
