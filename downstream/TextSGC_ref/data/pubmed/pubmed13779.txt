Automatic biomedical named entity recognition BioNER is a key task in biomedical information extraction. For some time state-of-the-art BioNER has been dominated by machine learning methods particularly conditional random fields CRFs with a recent focus on deep learning. However recent work has suggested that the high performance of CRFs for BioNER may not generalize to corpora other than the one it was trained on. In our analysis we find that a popular deep learning-based approach to BioNER known as bidirectional long short-term memory network-conditional random field BiLSTM-CRF is correspondingly poor at generalizing. To address this we evaluate three modifications of BiLSTM-CRF for BioNER to improve generalization: improved regularization via variational dropout transfer learning and multi-task learning.
