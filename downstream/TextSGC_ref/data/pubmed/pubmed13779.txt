"Standard of care diagnostic procedure for suspected skin cancer is microscopic examination of hematoxylin & eosin stained tissue by a pathologist. Areas of high inter-pathologist discordance and rising biopsy rates necessitate higher efficiency and diagnostic reproducibility. We present and validate a deep learning system which classifies digitized dermatopathology slides into 4 categories. The system is developed using 5070 images from a single lab and tested on an uncurated set of 13537 images from 3 test labs using whole slide scanners manufactured by 3 different vendors. The systems use of deep-learning-based confidence scoring as a criterion to consider the result as accurate yields an accuracy of up to 98% and makes it adoptable in a real-world setting. Without confidence scoring the system achieved an accuracy of 78%. We anticipate that our deep learning system will serve as a foundation enabling faster diagnosis of skin cancer identification of cases for specialist review and targeted diagnostic classifications."
