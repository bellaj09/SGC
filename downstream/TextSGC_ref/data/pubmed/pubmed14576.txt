The purpose of this study is to introduce and evaluate the mixed structure regularization MSR approach for a deep sparse autoencoder aimed at unsupervised abnormality detection in medical images. Unsupervised abnormality detection based on identifying outliers using deep sparse autoencoders is a very appealing approach for computer-aided detection systems as it requires only healthy data for training rather than expert annotated abnormality. However regularization is required to avoid overfitting of the network to the training data. Unsupervised abnormality detection through mixed structure regularization MSR in deep sparse autoencoders.
