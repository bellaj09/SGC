Pain is known to have a disruptive effect on cognitive performance but prior studies have used highly constrained laboratory tasks that lack ecological validity. In everyday life people are required to complete more complex sets of tasks prioritising task completion and recalling lists of tasks which need to be completed and these tasks continue to be attempted during episodes or states of pain. The present study therefore examined the impact of thermal induced pain on a simulated errand task. The disruptive effects of pain on multitasking in a virtual errands task.
