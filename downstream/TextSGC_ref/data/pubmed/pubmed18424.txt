Children with autism spectrum condition ASC suffer from deficits or developmental delays in symbolic thinking. In particular they are often found lacking in pretend play during early childhood. Researchers believe that they encounter difficulty in generating and maintaining mental representation of pretense coupled with the immediate reality. We have developed an interactive system that explores the potential of Augmented Reality AR technology to visually conceptualize the representation of pretense within an open-ended play environment. Results from an empirical study involving children with ASC aged 4 to 7 demonstrated a significant improvement of pretend play in terms of frequency duration and relevance using the AR system in comparison to a non computer-assisted situation. We investigated individual differences skill transfer system usability and limitations of the proposed AR system. We discuss design guidelines for future AR systems for children with ASC and other pervasive developmental disorders. Using Augmented Reality to Elicit Pretend Play for Children with Autism.
