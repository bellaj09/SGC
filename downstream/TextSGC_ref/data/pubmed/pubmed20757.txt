Flexible bronchoscopy is a widely used medical procedure performed by a variety of specialists. Learning flexible bronchoscopy in a clinical setting is associated with increased learner anxiety introduces significant variability into the learning experience and increases complications placing the burden of learning on the patients. Bronchoscopy simulation involves the use of inanimate models wet lab models or computerized virtual reality simulators to teach and evaluate bronchoscopy skills with the advantage of standardization of the teaching and assessment techniques without risk to the patient. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the major evidence supporting the use of bronchoscopy simulation to date and to identify limitations in the literature to stimulate further research incorporating these exciting teaching modalities. Simulation in flexible bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound: a review.
