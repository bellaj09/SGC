"Aiming at the implementation of brain-machine interfaces BMI for the aid of disabled people this paper presents a system design for real-time communication between the BMI and programmable logic controllers PLCs to control an electrical actuator that could be used in devices to help the disabled. Motor imaginary signals extracted from the brains motor cortex using an electroencephalogram EEG were used as a control signal. The EEG signals were pre-processed by means of adaptive recursive band-pass filtrations ARBF and classified using simplified fuzzy adaptive resonance theory mapping ARTMAP in which the classified signals are then translated into control signals used for machine control via the PLC. A real-time test system was designed using MATLAB for signal processing KEP-Ware V4 OLE for process control OPC a wireless local area network router an Omron Sysmac CPM1 PLC and a 5 V/0.3A motor. This paper explains the signal processing techniques the PLCs hardware configuration OPC configuration and real-time data exchange between MATLAB and PLC using the MATLAB OPC toolbox. The test results indicate that the function of exchanging real-time data can be attained between the BMI and PLC through OPC server and proves that it is an effective and feasible method to be applied to devices such as wheelchairs or electronic equipment."
