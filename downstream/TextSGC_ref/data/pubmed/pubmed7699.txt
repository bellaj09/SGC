A novel deep learning based model called Multi-Planar Spatial Convolutional Neural Network MPS-CNN is proposed for effective automated segmentation of different sub-regions viz. peritumoral edema ED necrotic core NCR enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core ET/NET from multi-modal MR images of the brain. An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes axial sagittal and coronal at the slice level. These are then combined by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field CRF based post-refinement to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge BraTS 2018 dataset. The Dice scores obtained for the validation set for whole tumor WT :NCR/NE +ET +ED tumor core TC:NCR/NET +ET and enhancing tumor ET are 0.90216 0.87247 and 0.82445. The proposed MPS-CNN is found to perform the best based on leaderboard scores for ET and TC segmentation tasks in terms of both the quantitative measures viz. Dice and Hausdorff. In case of the WT segmentation it also achieved the second highest accuracy with a score which was only 1% less than that of the best performing method.
