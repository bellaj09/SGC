"Purpose This study evaluated the acute cardiovascular responses during a session of Zumba Fitness in a virtual reality environment. Subjects Eighteen healthy volunteers were recruited. Methods The following cardiovascular variables: heart rate systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and double product were assessed before and after the practice of virtual Zumba which was performed as a continuous sequence of five choreographed movements lasting for 22\u2005min. The game Zumba Fitness Core with the Kinect-based virtual reality system for the XBOX 360 was used to create the virtual environment. Comparisons were made among mean delta values delta=post-Zumba minus pre-Zumba values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure heart rate and double product using Students t-test for paired samples. Results After a single session a significant increase was noted in all the analyzed parameters Systolic blood pressure=18%; Diastolic blood pressure=13%; Heart rate=67%; and Double product=97%. Conclusion The results support the feasibility of the use of Zumba Fitness Core with the Kinect-based virtual reality system for the XBOX 360 in physical activity programs and further favor its indication for this purpose."
