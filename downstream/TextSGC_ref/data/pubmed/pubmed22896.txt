In the context of medicine cutting is one of the most important operations. Many surgical tasks start with an incision allowing the surgeon to access the region of interest using either conventional or minimal invasive surgery techniques. The work presented herein should be seen in the context of surgical training and preoperative planning using computer assisted medical simulation systems. The main result of this work is the proposed cutting algorithm based on predefined templates. To integrate this approach in the existing surgical training simulator and to handle additional tasks like soft tissue deformation needed by the medical environment a generic simulation framework was developed. This framework is able to utilize given multiprocessor- and network-environments to achieve the desired realtime interactivity. Virtual cutting of anatomical structures.
