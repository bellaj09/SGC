"Cardiovascular disease CVD is an important cause of death in breast cancer survivors. Some breast cancer treatments including anthracyclines trastuzumab and radiotherapy can increase the risk of CVD especially for patients with pre-existing CVD risk factors. Early identification of patients at increased CVD risk may allow switching to less cardiotoxic treatments active surveillance or treatment of CVD risk factors. One of the strongest independent CVD risk factors is the presence and extent of coronary artery calcifications CAC. In clinical practice CAC are generally quantified on ECG-triggered cardiac CT scans. Patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy routinely undergo radiotherapy planning CT scans of the chest and those scans could provide the opportunity to routinely assess CAC before a potentially cardiotoxic treatment. The Bragatston study aims to investigate the association between calcifications in the coronary arteries aorta and heart valves hereinafter called cardiovascular calcifications measured automatically on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer and CVD risk." Bragatston study protocol: a multicentre cohort study on automated quantification of cardiovascular calcifications on radiotherapy planning CT scans for cardiovascular risk prediction in patients with breast cancer.
