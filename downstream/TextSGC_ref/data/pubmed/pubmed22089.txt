Purpose Researchers imported games and virtual reality training to help participants train their shoulders in a relaxed environment. Subjects and Methods This study included the use of Kinect somatosensory device with Unity software to develop 3-dimensional situational games. The data collected from this training process can be uploaded via the Internet to a cloud or server for participants to perform self-inspection. The data can be a reference for the medical staff to assess training effectiveness for those with impairments and plan patient rehabilitation courses. Results In the training activities 8 subjects with normal shoulder function demonstrated that the system has good stability and reproducibility. Six subjects with impaired shoulder underwent 6 weeks of training. During the third week of training average performance stabilized. The t-test comparing 1-2 weeks to 3-4 weeks and 5-6 weeks showed significant differences. Conclusion Using games as training methods improved patient concentration interest in participation and allowed patients to forget about their body discomfort. The equipment utilized in this study is inexpensive easy to obtain and the system is easy to install. People can perform simple self-training both at home or in the office.
