"Solving the supply-demand imbalance is the most crucial issue for stable implementation of a public bike-sharing system. This gap can be reduced by increasing the accuracy of demand prediction by considering spatial and temporal properties of bike demand. However only a few attempts have been made to account for both features simultaneously. Therefore we propose a prediction framework based on graph convolutional networks. Our framework reflects not only spatial dependencies among stations but also various temporal patterns over different periods. Additionally we consider the influence of global variables such as weather and weekday/weekend to reflect non-station-level changes. We compare our framework to other baseline models using the data from Seouls bike-sharing system. Results show that our approach has better performance than existing prediction models."
