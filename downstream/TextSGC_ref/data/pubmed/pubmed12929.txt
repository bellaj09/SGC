"Given a protein of unknown function fast identification of similar protein structures from the Protein Data Bank PDB is a critical step for inferring its biological function. Such structural neighbors can provide evolutionary insights into protein conformation interfaces and binding sites that are not detectable from sequence similarity. However the computational cost of performing pairwise structural alignment against all structures in PDB is prohibitively expensive. Alignment-free approaches have been introduced to enable fast but coarse comparisons by representing each protein as a vector of structure features or fingerprints and only computing similarity between vectors. As a notable example FragBag represents each protein by a bag of fragments which is a vector of frequencies of contiguous short backbone fragments from a predetermined library. Despite being efficient the accuracy of FragBag is unsatisfactory because its backbone fragment library may not be optimally constructed and long-range interacting patterns are omitted."
