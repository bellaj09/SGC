Various biological factors have been implicated in convulsive seizures involving side effects of drugs. For the preclinical safety assessment of drug development it is difficult to predict seizure-inducing side effects. Here we introduced a machine learning-based in\xa0vitro system designed to detect seizure-inducing side effects. We recorded local field potentials from the CA1 alveus in acute mouse neocortico-hippocampal slices while 14 drugs were bath-perfused at 5 different concentrations each. For each experimental condition we collected seizure-like neuronal activity and merged their waveforms as one graphic image which was further converted into a feature vector using Caffe an open framework for deep learning. In the space of the first two principal components the support vector machine completely separated the vectors i.e. doses of individual drugs that induced seizure-like events and identified diphenhydramine enoxacin strychnine and theophylline as "seizure-inducing" drugs which indeed were reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus this artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to detect the seizure-inducing side effects of preclinical drugs.
