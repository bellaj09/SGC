"Motion-onset visually evoked potentials mVEPs are neural potentials that are time-locked to the onset of motion of evoking stimuli. Due to their visually elegant properties mVEP stimuli may be suited to video game control given gamings inherent demand on the users visual attention and the requirement to process rapidly changing visual information. Here we investigate mVEPs associated with five different stimuli to control the position of a car in a visually rich 3D racing game in a group of 15 BCI nave teenagers and compared with 19 BCI naive adults. Results from an additional 14 BCI experienced adults were compared with BCI nave adults. Our results demonstrate that the game control accuracy is related to the number of trials used to make a decision on the users chosen button/stimulus 76% 62% and 35% for 5 3 and 1 trials respectively and information transfer rate ITR 13.4 13.9 and 6.6 bits per minute BPM although even though accuracy decreases when using three compared to the commonly used five trial repetitions ITR is maintained. A Kruskal-Wallis test suggests that BCI nave adults do not outperform BCI nave teenagers in the 3D racing game in the first and seconds laps p > 0.05 but do outperform in the third lap p < 0.05. A comparison between BCI nave and BCI experienced adults indicates BCI experienced adults do not perform better than BCI nave adults p > 0.05."
