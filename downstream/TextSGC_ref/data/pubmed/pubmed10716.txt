Stereo vision is a flourishing field attracting the attention of many researchers. Recently leveraging on the development of deep learning stereo matching algorithms have achieved remarkable performance far exceeding traditional approaches. This review presents an overview of different stereo matching algorithms based on deep learning. For convenience we classified the algorithms into three categories: 1 non-end-to-end learning algorithms 2 end-to-end learning algorithms and 3 unsupervised learning algorithms. We have provided a comprehensive coverage of the remarkable approaches in each category and summarized the strengths weaknesses and major challenges respectively. The speed accuracy and time consumption were adopted to compare the different algorithms. Review of Stereo Matching Algorithms Based on Deep Learning.
