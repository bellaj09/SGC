Analysis of various parameters related to the patient the disease and the needed surgical maneuvers to develop guidance for preoperative selection of the appropriate and the best approach for a given patient. Rapid advances in minimally invasive surgical technology are fascinating and challenging alike. It can be difficult for surgeons to keep up with new modalities that come on to the market place and to assess their true value i.e. distinguish between fashionable trends versus scientific evidence. Laparoscopy established minimally invasive surgery and has revolutionized surgical concepts and approaches to diseases since its advent in the early 1990s. Now with robotic surgery rapidly gaining traction in this high-tech surgical landscape it remains to be seen how the long-term surgical landscape will be affected. Robotic versus laparoscopic versus open colorectal surgery: towards defining criteria to the right choice.
