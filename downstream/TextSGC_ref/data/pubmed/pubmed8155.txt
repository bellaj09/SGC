Resting-state functional MRI data from a total of 144 subjects 72 patients with schizophrenia and 72 healthy controls was obtained from a publicly available dataset using a three-dimensional convolution neural network 3D-CNN based deep learning classification framework and ICA based features. 3D-CNN based discrimination of schizophrenia using resting-state fMRI.
