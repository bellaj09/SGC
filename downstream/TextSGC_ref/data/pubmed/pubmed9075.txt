Face verification is the task of checking if two provided images contain the face of the same person or not. In this work we propose a fully-convolutional Siamese architecture to tackle this task achieving state-of-the-art results on three publicly-released datasets namely Pandora High-Resolution Range-based Face Database HRRFaceD and CurtinFaces. The proposed method takes depth maps as the input since depth cameras have been proven to be more reliable in different illumination conditions. Thus the system is able to work even in the case of the total or partial absence of external light sources which is a key feature for automotive applications. From the algorithmic point of view we propose a fully-convolutional architecture with a limited number of parameters capable of dealing with the small amount of depth data available for training and able to run in real time even on a CPU and embedded boards. The experimental results show acceptable accuracy to allow exploitation in real-world applications with in-board cameras. Finally exploiting the presence of faces occluded by various head garments and extreme head poses available in the Pandora dataset we successfully test the proposed system also during strong visual occlusions. The excellent results obtained confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Driver Face Verification with Depth Maps.
