We developed a hybrid deep learning model HDLM algorithm that quantitatively predicts macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer mGCIPL thickness from red-free retinal nerve fiber layer photographs RNFLPs. A total of 789 pairs of RNFLPs and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography SD-OCT scans for 431 eyes of 259 participants 183 eyes of 114 healthy controls 68 eyes of 46 glaucoma suspects and 180 eyes of 99 glaucoma patients were enrolled. An HDLM was built by combining a pre-trained deep learning network and support vector machine. The correlation coefficient and mean absolute error MAE between the predicted and measured mGCIPL thicknesses were calculated. The measured OCT-based and predicted HDLM-based average mGCIPL thicknesses were 73.96\u2009\u20098.81\u2009m and 73.92\u2009\u20097.36\u2009m respectively P\u2009=\u20090.844. The predicted mGCIPL thickness showed a strong correlation and good agreement with the measured mGCIPL thickness Correlation coefficient r\u2009=\u20090.739; P\u2009<\u20090.001; MAE\u2009=\u20094.76\u2009m. Even when the peripapillary area diameter: 1.5 disc diameters was masked the correlation r\u2009=\u20090.713; P\u2009<\u20090.001 and agreement MAE\u2009=\u20094.87\u2009m were not changed significantly P\u2009=\u20090.378 and 0.724 respectively. The trained HDLM algorithm showed a great capability for mGCIPL thickness prediction from RNFLPs.
