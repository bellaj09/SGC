The analysis of cell mitotic behavior plays important role in many biomedical research and medical diagnostic applications. To improve the accuracy of mitosis detection in automated analysis systems this paper proposes the sequential saliency guided deep neural network SSG-DNN to jointly identify and localize mitotic events in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy images. It consists of three key modules. First the module of visual context learning extracts static visual feature and dynamic visual transition within individual volumetric cell regions. Secondly with these information the module of sequential saliency modeling aims to discover the saliency distribution over all successive frames in each volumetric region. Finally the module of sequence structure modeling can leverage both visual context and saliency distribution for mitosis identification and localization. SSG-DNN can jointly realize visual feature learning and sequential structure modeling in the end-to-end framework. Moreover the proposed method is independent of complicated preconditioning methods for mitotic candidate extraction and can be applied for mitosis detection in one-shot manner. To our knowledge it is the first weakly supervised work to realize joint mitosis identification and localization only with sequence-wise labels. In our experiments we evaluate its performances of both tasks on the popular C3H10 dataset and a novel and large-scale dataset C2C12-16 which contains much more mitotic events and is more challenging owing to diverse cell culture conditions. Experimental results can demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
