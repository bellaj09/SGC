Intravascular optical coherence tomography IV-OCT is a light-based imaging modality with high resolution which employs near-infrared light to provide tomographic intracoronary images. Morbidity caused by coronary heart disease is a substantial cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The most common intracoronay complications caused by coronary artery disease are intimal hyperplasia calcification fibrosis neovascularization and macrophage accumulation which require efficient prevention strategies. OCT can provide discriminative information of the intracoronary tissues which can be used to train a robust fully automatic tissue characterization model based on deep learning. In this study we aimed to design a diagnostic model of coronary artery lesions. Particularly we trained a random forest using convolutional neural network features to distinguish between normal and diseased arterial wall structure. Then based on the arterial wall structure fully convolutional network is designed to extract the tissue layers in normal cases and pathological tissues regardless of lesion type in pathological cases. Then the type of the lesions can be characterized with high precision using our previous model. The results demonstrate the robustness of the model with the approximate overall accuracy up to 90%.
