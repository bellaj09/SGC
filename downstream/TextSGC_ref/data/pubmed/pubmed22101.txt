"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD symptoms can be difficult to treat. We previously reported that a 20-session brain-computer interface BCI attention training programme improved ADHD symptoms. Here we investigated a new more intensive BCI-based attention training game system on 20 unmedicated ADHD children 16 males 4 females with significant inattentive symptoms combined and inattentive ADHD subtypes. This new system monitored attention through a head band with dry EEG sensors which was used to drive a feed forward game. The system was calibrated for each user by measuring the EEG parameters during a Stroop task. Treatment consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 sessions followed by 3 once-monthly booster training sessions. Following intervention both parent-rated inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale showed significant improvement. At week 8 the mean improvement was -4.6 5.9 and -4.7 5.6 respectively for inattentive symptoms and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms both p<0.01. Cohens d effect size for inattentive symptoms was large at 0.78 at week 8 and 0.84 at week 24 post-boosters. Further analysis showed that the change in the EEG based BCI ADHD severity measure correlated with the change ADHD Rating Scale scores. The BCI-based attention training game system is a potential new treatment for ADHD." A brain-computer interface based attention training program for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
