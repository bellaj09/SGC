"Nothing provides as strong a sense of self as seeing ones face. Nevertheless it remains unknown how the brain processes the sense of self during the multisensory experience of looking at ones face in a mirror. Synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation on ones own and anothers face an experience that is akin to looking in the mirror but seeing anothers face causes the illusory experience of ownership over the other persons face and changes in self-recognition. Here we investigate the neural correlates of this enfacement illusion using fMRI. We examine activity in the human brain as participants experience tactile stimulation delivered to their face while observing either temporally synchronous or asynchronous tactile stimulation delivered to anothers face on either a specularly congruent or incongruent location. Activity in the multisensory right temporo-parietal junction intraparietal sulcus and the unimodal inferior occipital gyrus showed an interaction between the synchronicity and the congruency of the stimulation and varied with the self-reported strength of the illusory experience which was recorded after each stimulation block. Our results highlight the important interplay between unimodal and multimodal information processing for self-face recognition and elucidate the neurobiological basis for the plasticity required for identifying with our continuously changing visual appearance." Plasticity in unimodal and multimodal brain areas reflects multisensory changes in self-face identification.
