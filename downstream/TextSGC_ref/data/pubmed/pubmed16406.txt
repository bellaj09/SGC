It is widely believed that substance use disorder SUD results from both pre-alterations vulnerability and/or post-alterations drug effects on cortico-striatal circuits. These circuits are essential for cognitive control motivation reward dependent learning and emotional processing. As such dysfunctions in cortico-striatal circuits are thought to relate to the core features of SUD which include compulsive drug use loss of the ability to control drug intake and the emergence of negative emotional states Koob and Volkow 2010. Neuropsychopharmacology 351 217-238. While the brain circuits underlying SUD have been studied in human patients largely through imaging studies experiments in animals have allowed researchers to examine the specific cell-types within these circuits to reveal their role in behavior relevant to SUD. Here we will review imaging studies on cortico-striatal systems that are altered in SUD and describe animal experiments that relate SUD to specific neural projections and cell types within this circuitry. We will end with a discussion of novel clinical approaches such as deep brain stimulation DBS repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS and pharmacological targeting of G protein-coupled receptor GPCR heteromers that may provide promising avenues for modulating these circuits to combat SUD in humans.
