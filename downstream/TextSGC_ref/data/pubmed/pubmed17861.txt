"Deep brain stimulation DBS is an efficient therapy to control movement disorders of Parkinsons tremor. Stimulation of one area of basal ganglia BG by DBS with no feedback is the prevalent opinion. Reduction of additional stimulatory signal delivered to the brain is the advantage of using feedback. This results in reduction of side effects caused by the excessive stimulation intensity. In fact the stimulatory intensity of controllers is decreased proportional to reduction of hand tremor. The objective of this study is to design a new controller structure to decrease three indicators: i the hand tremor; ii the level of delivered stimulation in disease condition; and iii the ratio of the level of delivered stimulation in health condition to disease condition. For this purpose the authors offer a new closed-loop control structure to stimulate two areas of BG simultaneously. One area STN: subthalamic nucleus is stimulated by an adaptive controller with feedback error learning. The other area GPi: globus pallidus internal is stimulated by a partial state feedback PSF controller. Considering the three indicators the results show that stimulating two areas simultaneously leads to better performance compared with stimulating one area only. It is shown that both PSF and adaptive controllers are robust regarding system parameter uncertainties. In addition a method is proposed to update the parameters of the BG model in real time. As a result the parameters of the controllers can be updated based on the new parameters of the BG model."
