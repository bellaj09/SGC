"Motor imagery has been suggested as an efficient alternative to improve the rehabilitation process of affected limbs. In this study a low-cost robotic guide is implemented so that linear position can be controlled via the users motor imagination of movement intention. The patient can use this device to move the arm attached to the guide according to their own intentions. The first objective of this study was to check the feasibility and safety of the designed robotic guide controlled via a motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interface MI-BCI in healthy individuals with the ultimate aim to apply it to rehabilitation patients. The second objective was to determine which are the most convenient MI strategies to control the different assisted rehabilitation arm movements. The results of this study show a better performance when the BCI task is controlled with an action-action MI strategy versus an action-relaxation one. No statistically significant difference was found between the two action-action MI strategies."
