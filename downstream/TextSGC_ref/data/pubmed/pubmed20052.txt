Dextroscope three-dimensional 3D imaging has been extensively applied for generation of virtual reality VR workspaces for in neurosurgery and laparoscopy though few applications in orthopedic surgery have been reported. Patients undergoing surgery for periarticular tumors n = 10 from Oct. 2008 to Jun. 2010 were enrolled and presurgically subjected to computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI and MRI angiography MRI-A. Imaging data was transferred and integrated in Dextroscope producing a VR simulation. Resultant presurgical 3D anatomical reconstructions and intraoperative anatomical characteristics virtual vs. actual data and surgical approach virtual vs. actual situation measurement and subjective appearance were compared. Anatomical characteristics in the area of interest and tumor diameters were consistent between virtual and actual data. However the virtual surgical situations remained inconsistent with the actual intraoperative situation in many cases leading to complications. The resolution of original CT MRI and MRI-A images directly correlated with the quality of 3D simulations with soft tissues most poorly represented. Tumor tissue imaging quality in 3D varied extensively by tumor type. Three-dimensional virtual reality simulation of periarticular tumors using Dextroscope reconstruction and simulated surgery: a preliminary 10 case study.
