"Research into the use of haptic and virtual reality technologies has increased greatly over the past decade in terms of both quality and quantity. Methods to utilise haptic and virtual technologies with currently existing techniques for assessing impairment are underway and due to the commercially available equipment has found some success in the use of these methods for individuals who suffer upper limb impairment. This paper uses the clinically validated assessment technique for measuring motor impairment: the Nine Hole Peg Test and creates three tasks with different levels of realism. The efficacy of these tasks is discussed with particular attention paid to analysis in terms of removing factors that limit a virtual environments use in a clinical setting such as inter-subject variation."
