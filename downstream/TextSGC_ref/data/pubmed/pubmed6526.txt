For stage-I lung adenocarcinoma the 5-years disease-free survival DFS rates of non-invasive adenocarcinoma non-IA is different with invasive adenocarcinoma IA. This study aims to develop CT image based artificial intelligence AI schemes to classify between non-IA and IA nodules and incorporate deep learning DL and radiomics features to improve the classification performance. We collect 373 surgical pathological confirmed ground-glass nodules GGNs from 323 patients in two centers. It involves 205 non-IA including 107 adenocarcinoma in situ and 98 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma and 168 IA. We first propose a recurrent residual convolutional neural network based on U-Net to segment the GGNs. Then we build two schemes to classify between non-IA and IA namely DL scheme and radiomics scheme respectively. Third to improve the classification performance we fuse the prediction scores of two schemes by applying an information fusion method. Finally we conduct an observer study to compare our scheme performance with two radiologists by testing on an independent dataset. Comparing with DL scheme and radiomics scheme the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve AUC: 0.83  0.05 0.87  0.04 our new fusion scheme AUC: 0.90  0.03 significant improves the risk classification performance p < 0.05. In a comparison with two radiologists our new model yields higher accuracy of 80.3%. The kappa value for inter-radiologist agreement is 0.6. It demonstrates that applying AI method is an effective way to improve the invasiveness risk prediction performance of GGNs. In future fusion of DL and radiomics features may have a potential to handle the classification task with limited dataset in medical imaging.
