"The possibility of applying Virtual Reality VR techniques to the mental care of patients is discussed in this chapter. VR technology holds much promise for providing supportive activities and promoting cooperation among caregivers. Interactivity with media may give the feeling of control to patients and thus provide a greater joy than passively watching television. Immersion in VR is expected to reduce pain and relieve anxieties for a while. Some kinds of VR content would make patients relaxed or encourage them in their fight against disease. Moreover networked VR could offer a virtual space where patients meet communicate organize activities and share experiences with other people--other patients friends family members medical doctors social workers and so on. A basic study and trials to evaluate our developed VR system called the Bedside Wellness System provide evidence for the effectiveness of this approach. Future research tasks are also discussed."
