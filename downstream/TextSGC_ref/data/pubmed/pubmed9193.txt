Experimental investigation of sleep-wake dynamics in animals is an important part of pharmaceutical development. Typically it involves recording of electroencephalogram electromyogram locomotor activity and electrooculogram. Visual identification or scoring of the sleep-wake states from these recordings is time-consuming. We sought to develop software for automated sleep-wake scoring capable of processing large databases of multi-channel signal recordings in a range of species.
