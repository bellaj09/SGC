Tridimensional representations stimulate cognitive processes that are the core and foundation of human-computer interaction HCI. Those cognitive processes take place while a user navigates and explores a virtual environment VE and are mainly related to spatial memory storage attention and perception. VEs have many distinctive features e.g. involvement immersion and presence that can significantly improve HCI in highly demanding and interactive systems such as brain-computer interfaces BCI. BCI is as a nonmuscular communication channel that attempts to reestablish the interaction between an individual and his/her environment. Although BCI research started in the sixties this technology is not efficient or reliable yet for everyone at any time. Over the past few years researchers have argued that main BCI flaws could be associated with HCI issues. The evidence presented thus far shows that VEs can 1 set out working environmental conditions 2 maximize the efficiency of BCI control panels 3 implement navigation systems based not only on user intentions but also on user emotions and 4 regulate user mental state to increase the differentiation between control and noncontrol modalities.
