The fruit fly Drosophila suzukii or spotted wing drosophila SWD is a serious pest worldwide attacking many soft-skinned fruits. An efficient monitoring system that identifies and counts SWD in crops and their surroundings is therefore essential for integrated pest management IPM strategies. Existing methods such as catching flies in liquid bait traps and counting them manually are costly time-consuming and labour-intensive. To overcome these limitations we studied insect trap monitoring using image-based object detection with deep learning. Deep learning for automated detection of Drosophila suzukii: potential for UAV-based monitoring.
