"Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant unmet medical need in our aging society. There are no effective treatments for most of these diseases and we know comparatively little regarding pathogenic mechanisms. Among the challenges faced by those involved in developing therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases the syndromes are often complex and small animal models do not fully recapitulate the unique features of the human nervous system. Human induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs are a novel technology that ideally would permit us to generate neuronal cells from individual patients thereby eliminating the problem of species-specificity inherent when using animal models. Specific phenotypes of iPSC-derived cells may permit researchers to identify sub-types and to distinguish among unique clusters and groups. Recently iPSCs were used for drug screening and testing for neurologic disorders including Alzheimers disease AD amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS spinocerebellar atrophy SCA and Zika virus infection. However there remain many challenges still ahead including how one might effectively recapitulate sporadic disease phenotypes and the selection of ideal phenotypes and for large-scale drug screening. Fortunately quite a few novel strategies have been developed that might be combined with an iPSC-based model to solve these challenges including organoid technology single-cell RNA sequencing genome editing and deep learning artificial intelligence. Here we will review current applications and potential future directions for iPSC-based neurodegenerative disease models for critical drug screening."
