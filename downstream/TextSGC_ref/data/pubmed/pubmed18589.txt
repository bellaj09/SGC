Assessment can improve the effectiveness of surgical training and enable valid judgments of competence. Laparoscopic colon resection surgery is now taught within surgical residency programs and assessment tools are increasingly used to stimulate formative feedback and enhance learning. Formal assessment of technical performance in laparoscopic colon resection has been successfully applied at the specialist level in the English "LAPCO" National Training Program. Objective assessment tools need to be developed for training and assessment in laparoscopic rectal cancer resection surgery. Simulation may have a future role in assessment and accreditation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery; however existing virtual reality models are not ready to be used for assessment of this advanced surgery. Objective assessment of technique in laparoscopic colorectal surgery: what are the existing tools?
