"Virtual reality VR is a relatively new technology that enables individuals to immerse themselves in a virtual world. This multisensory technology has been used in a variety of fields and most recently has been applied clinically as a method of distraction for pain management during medical procedures. Investigators have posited that VR creates a nonpharmacologic form of analgesia by changing the activity of the bodys intricate pain modulation system. However the efficacy of VR has not been proven and the exact mechanisms behind VRs action remain unknown. This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature to date exploring the clinical and experimental applications of VR for pain control. The review details specific research methodologies and popular virtual environments. Limitations of the research recommendations for improvement of future studies and clinical experiences with VR are also discussed." The use of virtual reality for pain control: a review.
