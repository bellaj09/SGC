"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are promising technologies for rehabilitation of upper limb functions in patients with severe paralysis. We previously developed a BMI prosthetic arm for a monkey implanted with electrocorticography ECoG electrodes and trained it in a reaching task. The stability of the BMI prevented incorrect movements due to misclassification of ECoG patterns. As a trade-off for the stability however the latency the time gap between the monkeys actual motion and the prosthetic arm movement was about 200 ms. Therefore in this study we aimed to improve the response time of the BMI prosthetic arm. We focused on the generation of a trigger event by decoding muscle activity in order to predict integrated electromyograms iEMGs from the ECoGs. We verified the achievability of our method by conducting a performance test of the proposed method with actual achieved iEMGs instead of predicted iEMGs. Our results confirmed that the proposed method with predicted iEMGs eliminated the time delay. In addition we found that motor intention is better reflected by muscle activity estimated from brain activity rather than actual muscle activity. Therefore we propose that using predicted iEMGs to guide prosthetic arm movement results in minimal delay and excellent performance."
