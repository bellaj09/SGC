Severe temper outbursts STO in children are associated with impaired school and family functioning and may contribute to negative outcomes. These outbursts can be conceptualized as excessive frustration responses reflecting reduced emotion regulation capacity. The anterior cingulate cortex ACC has been implicated in negative affect as well as emotional control and exhibits disrupted function in children with elevated irritability and outbursts. This study examined the intrinsic functional connectivity iFC of a region of the ACC the anterior midcingulate cortex aMCC in 5- to 9-year-old children with STO n = 20 comparing them to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD without outbursts ADHD; n = 18. Additional analyses compared results to a sample of healthy children HC; n = 18 and examined specific associations with behavioral and emotional dysregulation. Compared to the ADHD group STO children exhibited reduced iFC between the aMCC and surrounding regions of the ACC and increased iFC between the aMCC and precuneus. These differences were also seen between the STO and HC groups; ADHD and HC groups did not differ. Specificity analyses found associations between aMCC-ACC connectivity and hyperactivity and between aMCC-precuneus iFC and emotion dysregulation. Disruption in aMCC networks may underlie the behavioral and emotional dysregulation characteristic of children with STO.
