Connections of the living human brain on a macroscopic scale can be mapped by a diffusion MR imaging based workflow. Since the same anatomic regions can be corresponded between distinct brains one can compare the presence or the absence of the edges connecting the very same two anatomic regions among multiple cortices. Previously we have constructed the consensus braingraphs on 1015 vertices first in five then in 96 subjects in the Budapest Reference Connectome Server v1.0 and v2.0 respectively. Here we report the construction of the version 3.0 of the server generating the common edges of the connectomes of variously parameterizable subsets of the 1015-vertex connectomes of 477 subjects of the Human Connectome Project\s 500-subject release. The consensus connectomes are downloadable in CSV and GraphML formats and they are also visualized on the server\s page. The consensus connectomes of the server can be considered as the "average healthy" human connectome since all of their connections are present in at least k subjects where the default value of Formula: see text but it can also be modified freely at the web server. The webserver is available at http://connectome.pitgroup.org. Parameterizable consensus connectomes from the Human Connectome Project: the Budapest Reference Connectome Server v3.0.
