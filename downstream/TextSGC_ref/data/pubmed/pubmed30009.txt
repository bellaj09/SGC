"Episodic memories EMs are recollections of contextually rich and personally relevant past events. EM has been linked to the sense of self allowing one to mentally travel back in subjective time and re-experience past events. However the sense of self has recently been linked to online multisensory processing and bodily self-consciousness BSC. It is currently unknown whether EM depends on BSC mechanisms. Here we used a new immersive virtual reality VR system that maintained the perceptual richness of life episodes and fully controlled the experimental stimuli during encoding and retrieval including the participants body. Our data reveal a classical EM finding which shows that memory for complex real-life like scenes decays over time. However here we also report a novel finding that delayed retrieval performance can be enhanced when participants view their body as part of the virtual scene during encoding. This body effect was not observed when no virtual body or a moving control object was shown thereby linking the sense of self and BSC in particular to EMs. The present VR methodology and the present behavioral findings will enable to study key aspects of EM in healthy participants and may be especially beneficial for the restoration of self-relevant memories in future experiments."
