This study investigated the effectiveness of using a high-density multi-distance source-detector SD separations in near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS for enhancing the performance of a functional NIRS fNIRS-based brain-computer interface BCI. The NIRS system that was used for the experiment was capable of measuring signals from four SD separations: 15 21.2 30 and 33.5\u2009mm and this allowed the measurement of hemodynamic response alterations at various depths. Fifteen participants were asked to perform mental arithmetic and word chain tasks to induce task-related hemodynamic response variations or they were asked to stay relaxed to acquire a baseline signal. To evaluate the degree of BCI performance enhancement by high-density channel configuration the classification accuracy obtained using a typical low-density lattice SD arrangement was compared to that obtained using the high-density SD arrangement while maintaining the SD separation at 30\u2009mm. The analysis results demonstrated that the use of a high-density channel configuration did not result in a noticeable enhancement of classification accuracy. However the combination of hemodynamic variations measured by two multi-distance SD separations resulted in the significant enhancement of overall classification accuracy. The results of this study indicated that the use of high-density multi-distance SD separations can likely provide a new method for enhancing the performance of an fNIRS-BCI.
