The aim of this study was to establish a 3D digitized model of pelvic vasculature for anatomic study preoperative planning and virtual reality. Three adult fresh cadavers were perfused with carboxymethyl cellulose/lead oxide mixture to mark blood vessels and subjected to multilayer spiral computed tomography scanning to obtain a series of thin sections. Then the 2D images of the pelvis and pelvic blood vessels were transformed into 3D digitized models using Mimics 11.0. The 2D images of carboxymethyl cellulose/lead oxide filled arteries had the features of entire outline and few constructed defects. The 3D digitized models of the pelvis and pelvic artery system displayed spatial location and the adjacent relationship of arteries with the pelvis. Not only the well-known arteries but also the tiny blood vessels in the reconstructed structures were well demonstrated and observed interactively. The reconstructed tissue flaps including a lobulated skin flap with the pedicle of superficial epigastric artery and an iliac flap with the pedicle of deep iliac circumflex artery demonstrated their blood supply area. This indicated that the modified technique of vascular perfusion with carboxymethyl cellulose/lead oxide and reconstitution with Mimics 11.0 software contributed to 3D digitized model of pelvic vasculature. Three-dimensional visualization of pelvic vascularity.
