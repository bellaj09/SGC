There is growing interest in estimating quantum observables while circumventing expensive computational overhead for facile in silico materials screening. Machine learning ML methods are implemented to perform such calculations in shorter times. Here we introduce a multistep method based on machine learning algorithms to estimate total energy on the basis of spatial coordinates and charges for various chemical structures including organic molecules inorganic molecules and ions. This method quickly calculates total energy with 0.76 au in root-mean-square error RMSE and 1.5% in mean absolute percent error MAPE when tested on a database of optimized and unoptimized structures. Using similar molecular representations experimental thermochemical properties were estimated with MAPE as low as 6% and RMSE of 8 cal/molK for heat capacity in a 10-fold cross-validation.
