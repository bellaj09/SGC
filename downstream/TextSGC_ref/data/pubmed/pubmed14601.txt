Medication doses one of the determining factors in medication safety and effectiveness are present in the literature but only in free-text form. We set out to determine if the systems developed for extracting drug prescription information from clinical text would yield comparable results on scientific literature and if sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks could improve over the current state-of-the-art. We developed a collection of 694 PubMed Central documents annotated with drug dose information using the i2b2 schema. We found that less than half of the drug doses are present in the MEDLINE/PubMed abstracts and full-text is needed to identify the other half. We identified the differences in the scope and formatting of drug dose information in the literature and clinical text which require developing new dose extraction approaches. Finally we achieved 83.9% recall 87.2% precision and 85.5% F1 score in extracting complete drug prescription information from the literature. Finding medication doses in the liteature.
