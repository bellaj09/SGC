In recent years terahertz imaging systems and techniques have been developed and have gradually become a leading frontier field. With the advantages of low radiation and clothing-penetrable terahertz imaging technology has been widely used for the detection of concealed weapons or other contraband carried on personnel at airports and other secure locations. This paper aims to detect these concealed items with deep learning method for its well detection performance and real-time detection speed. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of terahertz images an effective detection system is proposed in this paper. First a lots of terahertz images are collected and labeled as the standard data format. Secondly this paper establishes the terahertz classification dataset and proposes a classification method based on transfer learning. Then considering the special distribution of terahertz image an improved faster region-based convolutional neural network Faster R-CNN method based on threshold segmentation is proposed for detecting human body and other objects independently. Finally experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for terahertz image detection.
