"Recommendation has provoked vast amount of attention and research in recent decades. Most previous works employ matrix factorization techniques to learn the latent factors of users and items. And many subsequent works consider external information e.g. social relationships of users and items attributions to improve the recommendation performance under the matrix factorization framework. However matrix factorization methods may not make full use of the limited information from rating or check-in matrices and achieve unsatisfying results. Recently deep learning has proven able to learn good representation in natural language processing image classification and so on. Along this line we propose a new representation learning framework called Recommendation via Dual-Autoencoder ReDa. In this framework we simultaneously learn the new hidden representations of users and items using autoencoders and minimize the deviations of training data by the learnt representations of users and items. Based on this framework we develop a gradient descent method to learn hidden representations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art matrix factorization based methods."
