Navigation crucially depends on the capability to estimate time elapsed and distance covered during movement. From adults it is known that magnitude estimation is subject to characteristic biases. Most intriguing is the regression effect central tendency whose strength depends on the stimulus distribution i.e. stimulus range a second characteristic of magnitude estimation known as range effect. We examined regression and range effects for time and distance estimation in eleven-year-olds and young adults using an egocentric virtual navigation task. Regression effects were stronger for distance compared to time and depended on stimulus range. These effects were more pronounced in children compared to adults due to a more heterogeneous performance among the children. Few children showed veridical estimations similar to adults; most children however performed less accurate displaying stronger regression effects. Our findings suggest that children use magnitude processing strategies similar to adults but it seems that these are not yet fully developed in all eleven-year-olds and are further refined throughout adolescence.
