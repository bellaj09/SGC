Here we present a state-of-the-art review of the research performed on the brain-computer interface BCI technologies with a focus on signal processing approaches. BCI can be divided into three main components: signal acquisition signal processing and effector device. The signal acquisition component is generally divided into two categories: noninvasive and invasive. For noninvasive this review focuses on electroencephalogram. For the invasive the review includes electrocorticography local field potentials multiple-unit activity and single-unit action potentials. Signal processing techniques reviewed are divided into time-frequency methods such as Fourier transform autoregressive models wavelets and Kalman filter and spatiotemporal techniques such as Laplacian filter and common spatial patterns. Additionally various signal feature classification algorithms are discussed such as linear discriminant analysis support vector machines artificial neural networks and Bayesian classifiers. The article ends with a discussion of challenges facing BCI and concluding remarks on the future of the technology. Brain-computer interface technologies: from signal to action.
