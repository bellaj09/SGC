Accompanying the advent of wireless networking and the Internet of Things IoT traditional augmented reality AR systems to visualize virtual 3D models of the real world are evolving into smart and interactive AR related to the context of things for physical objects. We propose the integration of AR and IoT in a complementary way making AR scalable to cover objects everywhere with an acceptable level of performance and interacting with IoT in a more intuitive manner. We identify three key components for realizing such a synergistic integration: 1 distributed and object-centric data management including for AR services; 2 IoT object-guided tracking; 3 seamless interaction and content interoperability. We survey the current state of these respective areas and herein discuss research on issues about realizing a future smart and interactive living environment. AR Enabled IoT for a Smart and Interactive Environment: A Survey and Future Directions.
