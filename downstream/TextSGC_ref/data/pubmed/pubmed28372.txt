Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments may have concomitant visual acuity impairments VAI or ocular motility impairments OMI impacting visual BCI use. We report on the use of the Shuffle Speller typing interface for an SSVEP BCI copy-spelling task under three conditions: simulated VAI simulated OMI and unimpaired vision. To mitigate the effect of visual impairments we introduce a method that adaptively selects a user-specific trial length to maximize expected information transfer rate ITR; expected ITR is shown to closely approximate the rate of correct letter selections. All participants could type under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions with no significant differences in typing accuracy or speed. Most participants 31 of 37 could not type under the simulated OMI condition; some achieved high accuracy but with slower typing speeds. Reported workload and discomfort were low and satisfaction high under the unimpaired and simulated VAI conditions. Implications and future directions to examine effect of visual impairment on BCI use is discussed.
