The N2pc event-related potential ERP appears on the opposite side of the scalp with respect to the visual hemisphere where an object of interest is located. We explored the feasibility of using it to extract information on the spatial location of targets in aerial images shown by means of a rapid serial visual presentation RSVP protocol using single-trial classification.
