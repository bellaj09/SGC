In this study we aimed to investigate the intrinsic hippocampal functional connectivity FC network and its relationship with prospective memory in patients with breast cancer suffering from chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment CICI. Thirty-four breast cancer patients before and after adjuvant chemotherapy CB and CC respectively and 31 age- and education-matched cognitively normal CN women were recruited and subjected to a prospective memory task and a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used to compare the hippocampal FC networks between CC and CN groups. Partial correction analysis was used to examine the association between the hippocampal FC network and prospective memory in the CC group. The cancer group that underwent chemotherapy obtained significantly poorer scores than the CN group on mini-mental state examination verbal fluency test digit span and prospective memory examination. Compared to the CN group CC group showed increased hippocampal connectivity in the frontal and parietal cortex precuneus posterior cingulate cortex and the cerebellum. In addition the increasing hippocampal FC networks were negatively correlated with prospective memory performance in the CC group. These findings suggest maladaptive hippocampal functioning as a mechanism underlying the impairment of prospective memory in patients experiencing CICI. Altered resting-state hippocampal functional networks associated with chemotherapy-induced prospective memory impairment in breast cancer survivors.
