In this paper we define a new problem related to social media namely the data-driven engineering of social dynamics. More precisely given a set of observations from the past we aim at finding the best short-term intervention that can lead to predefined long-term outcomes. Toward this end we propose a general formulation that covers two useful engineering tasks as special cases namely pattern matching and profit maximization. By incorporating a deep learning model we derive a solution using convex relaxation and quadratic-programming transformation. Moreover we propose a data-driven evaluation method in place of the expensive field experiments. Using a Twitter dataset we demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamics engineering approach for both pattern matching and profit maximization and study the multifaceted interplay among several important factors of dynamics engineering such as solution validity pattern-matching accuracy and intervention cost. Finally the method we propose is general enough to work with multi-dimensional time series so it can potentially be used in many other applications.
