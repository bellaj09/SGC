Virtual reality is a novel method of visualizing ultrasound data with the perception of depth and offers possibilities for measuring non-planar structures. The levator ani hiatus has both convex and concave aspects. The aim of this study was to compare levator ani hiatus volume measurements obtained with conventional three-dimensional 3D ultrasound and with a virtual reality measurement technique and to establish their reliability and agreement. Agreement and reliability of pelvic floor measurements during contraction using three-dimensional pelvic floor ultrasound and virtual reality.
