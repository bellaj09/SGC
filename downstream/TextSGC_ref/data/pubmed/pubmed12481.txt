"Economic decision-making is disrupted in individuals with gambling disorder an addictive behavior observed in Parkinsons disease PD patients receiving dopaminergic therapy. The subthalamic nucleus STN is involved in the inhibition of impulsive behaviors; however its role in impulse control disorders and addiction is still unclear. Here we recorded STN local field potentials LFPs in PD patients with and without gambling disorder during an economic decision-making task. Reaction times analysis showed that for all patients the decision whether to risk preceded task onset. We compared then for both groups the STN LFP preceding high- and low-risk economic decisions. We found that risk avoidance in gamblers correlated with larger STN LFP low-frequency <12-Hz fluctuations preceding task onset. In particular the amplitude of low-frequency LFP fluctuations carried significant information about future decisions. Decisions of patients not affected by gambling disorder were instead not correlated with pretask STN LFP. Our results suggest that STN activity preceding task onset affects risk decisions by preemptively inhibiting attraction to high but unlikely rewards in favor of a long-term payoff."
