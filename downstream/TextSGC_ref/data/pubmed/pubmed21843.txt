There is increasing evidence that simulation provides high-quality time-effective training in an era of resident duty-hour restrictions. Simulation may also permit trainees to acquire key skills in a safe environment important in a specialty such as neurosurgery where technical error can result in devastating consequences. The authors systematically reviewed the application of simulation within neurosurgical training and explored the state of the art in simulation within this specialty. To their knowledge this is the first systematic review published on this topic to date. The use of simulation in neurosurgical education and training. A systematic review.
