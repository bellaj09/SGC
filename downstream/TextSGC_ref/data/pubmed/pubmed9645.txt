Artificial neural networks had their first heyday in molecular informatics and drug discovery approximately two decades ago. Currently we are witnessing renewed interest in adapting advanced neural network architectures for pharmaceutical research by borrowing from the field of "deep learning". Compared with some of the other life sciences their application in drug discovery is still limited. Here we provide an overview of this emerging field of molecular informatics present the basic concepts of prominent deep learning methods and offer motivation to explore these techniques for their usefulness in computer-assisted drug discovery and design. We specifically emphasize deep neural networks restricted Boltzmann machine networks and convolutional networks. Deep Learning in Drug Discovery.
