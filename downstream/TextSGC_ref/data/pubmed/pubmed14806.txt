The computational fluid dynamics CFD approach has been frequently applied to compute the fractional flow reserve FFR using computed tomography angiography CTA. This technique is efficient. We developed the DEEPVESSEL-FFR platform using the emerging deep learning technique to calculate the FFR value out of CTA images in five minutes. This study is to evaluate the DEEPVESSEL-FFR platform using the emerging deep learning technique to calculate the FFR value from CTA images as an efficient method. Diagnostic accuracy of a deep learning approach to calculate FFR from coronary CT angiography.
