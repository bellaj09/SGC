"The Human Connectome Project HCP has developed protocols standard operating and quality control procedures and a suite of informatics tools to enable high throughput data collection data sharing automated data processing and analysis and data mining and visualization. Quality control procedures include methods to maintain data collection consistency over time to measure head motion and to establish quantitative modality-specific overall quality assessments. Database services developed as customizations of the XNAT imaging informatics platform support both internal daily operations and open access data sharing. The Connectome Workbench visualization environment enables user interaction with HCP data and is increasingly integrated with the HCPs database services. Here we describe the current state of these procedures and tools and their application in the ongoing HCP study."
