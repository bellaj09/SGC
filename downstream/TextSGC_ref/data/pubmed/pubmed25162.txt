"Falls are frequent in Parkinsons disease and aging. Impairments in the cholinergic-mediated attentional supervision of gait may contribute to increased fall risk especially when obstacles challenge gait. Interventions combining motor-cognitive approaches have been shown to improve motor performance cognitive skills and falls number. Here we hypothesized that an intervention simulating an attention-demanding walking condition could affect not only complex gait performance and fall risk but also short-latency afferent inhibition SAI as a marker of cholinergic activity."
