The field of Alzheimer\s disease AD research has grown exponentially over the past few decades especially since the isolation and identification of amyloid- from postmortem examination of the brains of AD patients. Recently the Journal of Alzheimer\s Disease JAD put forth approximately 300 research reports which were deemed to be the most influential research reports in the field of AD since 2010. JAD readers were asked to vote on these most influential reports. In this 3-part review we review the results of the 300 most influential AD research reports to provide JAD readers with a readily accessible yet comprehensive review of the state of contemporary research. Notably this multi-part review identifies the "hottest" fields of AD research providing guidance for both senior investigators as well as investigators new to the field on what is the most pressing fields within AD research. Part 1 of this review covers pathogenesis both on a molecular and macro scale. Part 2 review genetics and epidemiology and part 3 covers diagnosis and treatment. This part of the review pathology reviews amyloid- tau prions brain structure and functional changes with AD and the neuroimmune response of AD.
