Recently microRNAs miRNAs are confirmed to be important molecules within many crucial biological processes and therefore related to various complex human diseases. However previous methods of predicting miRNA-disease associations have their own deficiencies. Under this circumstance we developed a prediction method called deep representations-based miRNA-disease association DRMDA prediction. The original miRNA-disease association data were extracted from HDMM database. Meanwhile stacked auto-encoder greedy layer-wise unsupervised pre-training algorithm and support vector machine were implemented to predict potential associations. We compared DRMDA with five previous classical prediction models HGIMDA RLSMDA HDMP WBSMDA and RWRMDA in global leave-one-out cross-validation LOOCV local LOOCV and fivefold cross-validation respectively. The AUCs achieved by DRMDA were 0.9177 08339 and 0.9156  0.0006 in the three tests above respectively. In further case studies we predicted the top 50 potential miRNAs for colon neoplasms lymphoma and prostate neoplasms and 88% 90% and 86% of the predicted miRNA can be verified by experimental evidence respectively. In conclusion DRMDA is a promising prediction method which could identify potential and novel miRNA-disease associations. DRMDA: deep representations-based miRNA-disease association prediction.
