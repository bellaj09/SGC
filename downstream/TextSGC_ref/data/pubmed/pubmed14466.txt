The production of banana-one of the highly consumed fruits-is highly affected due to loss of certain number of banana plants in an early phase of vegetation. This affects the ability of farmers to forecast and estimate the production of banana. In this paper we propose a deep learning DL based method to precisely detect and count banana plants on a farm exclusive of other plants using high resolution RGB aerial images collected from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV. An attempt to detect the plants on the normal RGB images resulted less than 78.8% recall for our sample images of a commercial banana farm in Thailand. To improve this result we use three image processing methods-Linear Contrast Stretch Synthetic Color Transform and Triangular Greenness Index-to enhance the vegetative properties of orthomosaic generating multiple variants of orthomosaic. Then we separately train a parameter-optimized Convolutional Neural Network CNN on manually interpreted banana plant samples seen on each image variants to produce multiple results of detection on our region of interest. 96.4% 85.1% and 75.8% of plants were correctly detected on three of our dataset collected from multiple altitude of 40 50 and 60 meters of same farm. Further discussion on results obtained from combination of multiple altitude variants are also discussed later in the research in an attempt to find better altitude combination for data collection from UAV for the detection of banana plants. The results showed that merging the detection results of 40 and 50 meter dataset could detect the plants missed by each other increasing recall upto 99%.
