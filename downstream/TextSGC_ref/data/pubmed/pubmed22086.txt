"This article examines the material culture of neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandrans research into phantom limbs. In the 1990s Ramachandran used a mirror box to resurrect phantom limbs and thus to treat the pain that often accompanied them. The experimental success of his mirror therapy led Ramachandran to see mirrors as a useful model of brain function a tendency that explains his attraction to work on mirror neurons. I argue that Ramachandrans fascination with and repeated appeal to the mirror can be explained by the way it allowed him to confront a perennial problem in the mind and brain sciences that of the relationship between a supposedly immaterial mind and a material brain. By producing what Ramachandran called a virtual reality relating in varied and complex ways to the material world the mirror reproduced a form of psycho-physical parallelism and dualistic ontology while conforming to the materialist norms of neuroscience today."
