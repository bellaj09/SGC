"The use of projector-based augmented reality AR in surgery may enable surgeons to directly view anatomical models and surgical data from the patients surface skin. It has the advantages of a consistent viewing focus on the patient an extended field of view and augmented interaction. This paper presents an AR guidance mechanism with a projector-camera system to provide the surgeon with direct visual feedback for supervision of robotic needle insertion in radiofrequency RF ablation treatment." Projection-based visual guidance for robot-aided RF needle insertion.
