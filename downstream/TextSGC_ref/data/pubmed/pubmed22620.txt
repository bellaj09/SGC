Multi-channel EEG data are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification in motor imagery MI-based brain computer interfaces BCIs. To some extent signals from some channels containing redundant information and noise may degrade BCI performance. We assume that the channels related to MI should contain common information when participants are executing the MI tasks. Based on this hypothesis a correlation-based channel selection CCS method is proposed to select the channels that contained more correlated information in this study. The aim is to improve the classification performance of MI-based BCIs. Furthermore a novel regularized common spatial pattern RCSP method is used to extract effective features. Finally a support vector machine SVM classifier with the Radial Basis Function RBF kernel is trained to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets BCI competition IV dataset 1 BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that the CCS algorithm obtained superior classification accuracy 78% versus 56.4% for dataset1 86.6% versus 76.5% for dataset 2 and 91.3% versus 85.1% for dataset 3 compared to the algorithm using all channels AC when CSP is used to extract the features. Furthermore RCSP could further improve the classification accuracy 81.6% for dataset1 87.4% for dataset2 and 91.9% for dataset 3 when CCS is used to select the channels.
