"Aberrant connectivity is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia. However other than a few disease-associated candidate genes we know little about the degree to which genetics play a role in the brain networks; we know even less about specific genes that influence brain connections. Twin and family-based studies can generate estimates of overall genetic influences on a trait but genome-wide association scans GWASs can screen the genome for specific variants influencing the brain or risk for disease. To identify the heritability of various brain connections we scanned healthy young adult twins with high-field high-angular resolution diffusion MRI. We adapted GWASs to screen the brains connectivity pattern allowing us to discover genetic variants that affect the human brains wiring. The association of connectivity with the SPON1 variant at rs2618516 on chromosome 11 11p15.2 reached connectome-wide genome-wide significance after stringent statistical corrections were enforced and it was replicated in an independent subsample. rs2618516 was shown to affect brain structure in an elderly population with varying degrees of dementia. Older people who carried the connectivity variant had significantly milder clinical dementia scores and lower risk of Alzheimers disease. As a posthoc analysis we conducted GWASs on several organizational and topological network measures derived from the matrices to discover variants in and around genes associated with autism MACROD2 development NEDD4 and mental retardation UBE2A significantly associated with connectivity. Connectome-wide genome-wide screening offers substantial promise to discover genes affecting brain connectivity and risk for brain diseases."
