Cigarette cravings have been associated with less successful attempts to quit smoking and a greater likelihood of relapse after smoking cessation. Background craving refers to a relatively steady and continuous experience of craving while cue-induced craving refers to phases of intense craving triggered by cues associated with smoking. Cue exposure treatment CET involves repeated exposure to stimuli associated with substance use in order to reduce craving responses. However mixed results have been found regarding the effect of CET on both types of craving. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of systematic virtual reality cue exposure treatment VR-CET on background and cue-induced cravings. Effects of systematic cue exposure through virtual reality on cigarette craving.
