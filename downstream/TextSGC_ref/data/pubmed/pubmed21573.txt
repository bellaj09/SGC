Smaller incisions and reduced surgical trauma made minimally invasive surgery MIS grow in popularity even though long training is required to master the instrument manipulation constraints. While numerous training systems have been developed in the past very few of them tackled fetal surgery and more specifically the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome TTTS. To address this lack of training resources this paper presents a novel mixed-reality surgical trainer equipped with comprehensive sensing for TTTS procedures. The proposed trainer combines the benefits of box trainer technology and virtual reality systems. Face and content validation studies are presented and a use-case highlights the benefits of having embedded sensors. A mixed-reality surgical trainer with comprehensive sensing for fetal laser minimally invasive surgery.
