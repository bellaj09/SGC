This chapter begins by a brief description of some of the different types of simulation tools and techniques that are being used to study self-motion perception along with some of the advantages and disadvantages of the different interfaces. Subsequently some of the current empirical work investigating multisensory self-motion perception using these technologies will be summarized focusing mainly on visual proprioceptive and vestibular influences during full-body self-motion through space. Finally the implications of this research for several applied areas will be briefly described. Multimodal Integration during Self-Motion in Virtual Reality.
