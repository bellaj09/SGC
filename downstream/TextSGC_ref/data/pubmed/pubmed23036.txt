Subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD has garnered recent attention because of the significant distress and functional impairment associated with the symptoms as well as the increased risk of progression to full PTSD. However the clinical presentation of subthreshold PTSD can vary widely and therefore is not clearly defined nor is there an evidence-based treatment approach. Thus we aim to further the understanding of subthreshold PTSD symptoms by reporting the use of a virtual combat environment in eliciting distinctive psychophysiological responses associated with PTSD symptoms in a sample of subthreshold recently deployed US service members. Psychophysiological response to virtual reality and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in recently deployed military.
