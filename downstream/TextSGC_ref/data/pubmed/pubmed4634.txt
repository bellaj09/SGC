Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders ASDs involve atypical network connectivity. Given the central role of social deficits in the ASD phenotype this investigation examined functional connectivity of the amygdala-a brain structure critically involved in processing of social information-in children and adolescents with ASDs as well as age-dependent changes and links with clinical symptoms. Atypical Functional Connectivity of Amygdala Related to Reduced Symptom Severity in Children With Autism.
