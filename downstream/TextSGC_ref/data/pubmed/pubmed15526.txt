"Advancement and evolution of current virtual reality VR surgical simulation technologies is integral to improve the available armamentarium of surgical skill education. This is especially important in high-risk surgical specialties. Such fields including neurosurgery are beginning to explore the utilization of virtual reality simulation in the assessment and training of psychomotor skills. An important issue facing the available VR simulation technologies is the lack of complexity of scenarios which fail to replicate the visual and haptic realities of complex neurosurgical procedures. Therefore there is a need to create more realistic and complex scenarios with the appropriate visual and haptic realities to maximize the potential of virtual reality technology METHODS: We outline a roadmap for creating complex virtual reality neurosurgical simulation scenarios using a step-wise description of our teams subpial tumor resection project as a model."
