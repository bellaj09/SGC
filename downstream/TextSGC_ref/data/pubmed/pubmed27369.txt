In this study we present a novel multi-class brain-computer interface BCI for communication and control. In this system the information processing is shared by the algorithm computer and the user human. Specifically an electro-tactile cycle was presented to the user providing the choice class by delivering timely sensory input. The user discriminated these choices by his/her endogenous sensory ability and selected the desired choice with an intuitive motor task. This selection was detected by a fast brain switch based on real-time detection of movement-related cortical potentials from scalp EEG. We demonstrated the feasibility of such a system with a four-class BCI yielding a true positive rate of \xa0\xa080% and \xa0\xa070% and an information transfer rate of \xa0\xa07 bits/min and \xa0\xa05 bits/min for the movement and imagination selection command respectively. Furthermore when the system was extended to eight classes the throughput of the system was improved demonstrating the capability of accommodating a large number of classes. Combining the endogenous sensory discrimination with the fast brain switch the proposed system could be an effective multi-class gaze-independent BCI system for communication and control applications.
