Conventional education results in unsatisfactory morphological understanding of acetabular fractures due to lack of three-dimensional 3D details and tactile feedback of real fractures. Virtual reality VR and 3D printing 3DP techniques are widely applied in teaching. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of physical model PM VR and 3DP models in education of morphological understanding of acetabular fractures. 141 students were invited to participate in this study. Participants were equally and randomly assigned to the PM VR and 3DP learning groups. Three-level objective tests were conducted to evaluate learning including identifying anatomical landmarks describing fracture lines identifying classification and inferring fracture mechanism. Four subjective questions were asked to evaluate the usability and value of instructional materials. Generally the 3DP group showed a clear advantage over the PM and VR groups in objective tests while there was no significant difference between the PM and VR groups. 3DP was considered to be the most valuable learning tool for understanding acetabular fractures. The findings demonstrate that 3DP modelling of real fractures is an effective learning instrument that can be used to understand the morphology of acetabular fractures and promote subjective interest.
