Although it is generally acknowledged that experiences of frustration confusion and anxiety are embodied phenomena very little is known about how these processes modulate presumably unconscious but constantly present subtle bodily movement. We addressed this problem by tracking the low-level dynamics of body movement using 1/f noise pink noise or "fractal scaling" during naturalistic experiences of affect in two studies involving deep learning and effortful problem-solving. Our results indicate that body movement fluctuations of individuals experiencing cognitive equilibrium was characteristic of correlated pink noise but there was a whitening of the signal when participants experienced states that are diagnostic of cognitive distress such as anxiety confusion and frustration. We orient our findings within theories that emphasise the embodied nature of cognition and affect and with perspectives that view affective and cognitive processes as emergent products of a self-organising dynamical system the brain that is inextricably coupled to the body. Disequilibrium in the mind disharmony in the body.
