"Single-cell microscopy image analysis has proved invaluable in protein subcellular localization for inferring gene/protein function. Fluorescent-tagged proteins across cellular compartments are tracked and imaged in response to genetic or environmental perturbations. With a large number of images generated by high-content microscopy while manual labeling is both labor-intensive and error-prone machine learning offers a viable alternative for automatic labeling of subcellular localizations. Contrarily in recent years applications of deep learning methods to large datasets in natural images and other domains have become quite successful. An appeal of deep learning methods is that they can learn salient features from complicated data with little data preprocessing. For such purposes we applied several representative types of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs and two popular ensemble methods random forests and gradient boosting to predict protein subcellular localization with a moderately large cell image data set. We show a consistently better predictive performance of CNNs over the two ensemble methods. We also demonstrate the use of CNNs for feature extraction. In the end we share our computer code and pretrained models to facilitate CNNs applications in genetics and computational biology."
