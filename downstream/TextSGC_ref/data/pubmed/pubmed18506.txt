"Stroke-related sensory and motor deficits often steal away the independent mobility and balance from stroke survivors. Often this compels the stroke survivors to rely heavily on their non-paretic leg during weight shifting to execute activities of daily living ADL with reduced usage of the paretic leg. Increased reliance on non-paretic leg often leads to learned nonuse of the paretic leg. Therefore it is necessary to measure the contribution of individual legs toward ones overall balance. In turn techniques can be developed to condition the usage of both the legs during ones balance training thereby encouraging the hemiplegic patients for increased use of their paretic leg. The aim of this study is to 1 develop a virtual reality VR-based balance training platform that can estimate the contribution of each leg during VR-based weight-shifting tasks in an individualized manner and 2 understand the implication of operant conditioning paradigm during balance training on the overall balance of hemiplegic stroke patients." Virtual reality-based balance training system augmented with operant conditioning paradigm.
