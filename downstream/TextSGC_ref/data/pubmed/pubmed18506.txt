Studying human spatial navigation in the lab can be challenging particularly when including non-invasive neural measures like functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and scalp encephalography EEG. While there is broad consensus that human spatial navigation involves both egocentric self-referenced and allocentric world-referenced coding schemes exactly how these can be measured in ecologically meaningful situations remains controversial. Here we explore these two forms of representation and how we might better measure them by reviewing commonly used spatial memory tasks and proposing a new task: the relative vector discrimination RVD task. Additionally we explore how different encoding modalities desktop virtual reality immersive virtual reality maps and real-world navigation might alter how egocentric and allocentric representations manifest. Specifically we discuss desktop virtual reality vs. more immersive forms of navigation that better approximate real-world situations and the extent to which less immersive encoding modalities alter neural and cognitive codes engaged during navigation more generally. We conclude that while encoding modality likely alters navigation-related codes to some degree including egocentric and allocentric representations it does not fundamentally change the underlying representations. Considering these arguments together we suggest that tools to study human navigation in the lab such as desktop virtual reality provide overall a reasonable approximation of in vivo navigation with some caveats.
