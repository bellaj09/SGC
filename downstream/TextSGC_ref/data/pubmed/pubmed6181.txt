Determining the fundamental architectural design of complex nervous systems will lead to significant medical and technological advances. Yet it remains unclear how nervous systems evolved highly efficient networks with near optimal sharing of pathways that yet produce multiple distinct behaviors to reach the organism\s goals. To determine this the nematode roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model system. Progress has been made in delineating the behavioral circuits of the C. elegans however many details are unclear including the specific functions of every neuron and synapse as well as the extent the behavioral circuits are separate and parallel versus integrative and serial. Network analysis provides a normative approach to help specify the network design. We investigated the vulnerability of the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome by performing computational experiments that a "attacked" 279 individual neurons and 2990 weighted synaptic connections composed of 6393 chemical synapses and 890 electrical junctions and b quantified the effects of each removal on global network properties that influence information processing. The analysis identified 12 critical neurons and 29 critical synapses for establishing fundamental network properties. These critical constituents were found to be control elements-i.e. those with the most influence over multiple underlying pathways. Additionally the critical synapses formed into circuit-level pathways. These emergent pathways provide evidence for a the importance of backward locomotion avoidance behavior and social feeding behavior to the organism; b the potential roles of specific neurons whose functions have been unclear; and.
