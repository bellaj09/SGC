Improving the independent living ability of people who have suffered spinal cord injuries SCIs is essential for their quality of life. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide promising solutions for people with high-level SCIs. This paper proposes a novel and practical P300-based hybrid stimulus-on-device SoD BCI architecture for wireless networking applications. Instead of a stimulus-on-panel architecture SoP the proposed SoD architecture provides an intuitive control scheme. However because P300 recognitions rely on the synchronization between stimuli and response potentials the variation of latency between target stimuli and elicited P300 is a concern when applying a P300-based BCI to wireless applications. In addition the subject-dependent variation of elicited P300 affects the performance of the BCI. Thus an adaptive model that determines an appropriate interval for P300 feature extraction was proposed in this paper. Hence this paper employed the artificial bee colony- ABC- based interval type-2 fuzzy logic system IT2FLS to deal with the variation of latency between target stimuli and elicited P300 so that the proposed P300-based SoD approach would be feasible. Furthermore the target and nontarget stimuli were identified in terms of a support vector machine SVM classifier. Experimental results showed that from five subjects the performance of classification and information transfer rate were improved after calibrations 86.00% and 24.2 bits/ min before calibrations; 90.25% and 27.9 bits/ min after calibrations.
