"The evolving demands of surgical training have led to the successful implementation of skills examinations in the areas of laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery. Currently there is no similar formal skills assessment in vascular surgery despite endovascular intervention replacing open surgery in treatment of many vascular conditions. The adoption of less invasive techniques to treat aneurysm and occlusive disease has resulted in new training paradigms and technical challenges for trainees. The duty hour restriction for trainees and declining numbers of complex open vascular interventions have added to the challenges of vascular surgery training. Simulation is a promising avenue for both skills training and assessment. The ability to evaluate the fundamental skills of trainees would be an important step to ensure a degree of uniformity in trainees technical abilities. The role of simulation-based training in acquiring testing and refining these skills is still in its infancy in the vascular surgery training paradigm. This article aims to impart a deeper understanding of the conditions for developing and implementing the fundamentals of\xa0vascular and endovascular surgery and to provide guidance regarding the role of simulation-based training in a rapidly evolving specialty. There are various forms of simulation available including benchtop models high-fidelity simulators and virtual-reality simulators and each requires a different method of proficiency assessment. Both open surgery and endovascular skills can be assessed and the application of successful implementation in academic vascular surgery training program is presented." The pathway to a national vascular skills examination and the role of simulation-based training in an increasingly complex specialty.
