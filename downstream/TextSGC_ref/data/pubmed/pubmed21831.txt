"Arm end-point position end-point velocity and the intended final location or goal of a reach have all been decoded from cortical signals for use in brain-machine interface BMI applications. These different aspects of arm movement can be decoded from the brain and used directly to control the position velocity or movement goal of a device. However these decoded parameters can also be remapped to control different aspects of movement such as using the decoded position of the hand to control the velocity of a device. People easily learn to use the position of a joystick to control the velocity of an object in a videogame. Similarly in BMI systems the position velocity or goal of a movement could be decoded from the brain and remapped to control some other aspect of device movement. This study evaluates how easily people make transformations between position velocity and reach goal in BMI systems. It also evaluates how different amounts of decoding error impact on device control with and without these transformations. Results suggest some remapping options can significantly improve BMI control. This study provides guidance on what remapping options to use when various amounts of decoding error are present."
