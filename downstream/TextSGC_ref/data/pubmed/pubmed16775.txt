Robotic surgical skill development is central to training in urology as well as other surgical disciplines. Vesicourethral anastomosis VUA in robotic prostatectomy is a challenging task for novices due to delicate tissue and difficult suturing angles. Commercially available realistic training models are limited. Here we describe the development and validation of a 3D-printed model of the VUA for ex vivo training using the da Vinci Surgical System. Models of the bladder and urethra were created using 3D-printing technology based on estimations of average in vivo anatomy. 10 surgical residents without prior robotics training were enrolled in the study: 5 residents received structured virtual reality VR training on the da Vinci Skills Simulator "trained" while the other 5 did not "untrained". 4 faculty robotic surgeons trained in robotic urologic oncology "experts" were also enrolled. Mean range completion percentage was 20% 10-30% 54% 40-70% and 96% 85-100% by the untrained trained and expert groups respectively. Anastomosis integrity was rated as excellent as opposed to moderate or poor in 40% 60% and 100% of untrained trained and expert groups respectively. Face validity realism was rated as 8 of 10 on average by the expert surgeons each of whom rated the model as a superior training tool to digital VR trainers. Content validity usefulness was rated as 10 of 10 by all participants. This is the first reported 3D-printed ex vivo trainer for VUA in robotic prostatectomy validated for use in robotic simulation. The addition of 3D-printed ex vivo training to existing digital simulation technologies may augment and improve robotic surgical education in the future.
