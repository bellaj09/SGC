"Virtual-reality-based training can influence gait recovery in children with cerebral palsy. A consensus concerning its influence on spatiotemporal gait parameters and effective training dosage is still warranted. This study analyzes the influence of virtual-reality training relevant training dosage on gait recovery in children with cerebral palsy. A search was performed by two reviewers according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA guidelines on nine databases: PEDro EBSCO PubMed Cochrane Web of Science EMBASE ICI Scopus and PROQUEST. Of 989 records 16 studies involving a total of 274 children with cerebral palsy met our inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight percent of the studies reported significant enhancements in gait performance after training with virtual reality. Meta-analyses revealed positive effects of virtual-reality training on gait velocity Hedges g = 0.68 stride length 0.30 cadence 0.66 and gross motor function measure 0.44. Subgroup analysis reported a training duration of 20-30 min per session 4 times per week across 8 weeks to allow maximum enhancements in gait velocity. This study provides preliminary evidence for the beneficial influence of virtual-reality training in gait rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy."
