Despite the current success of neuromodulation standard biphasic rectangular pulse shapes may not be optimal to achieve symptom alleviation. Here we compared stimulation efficiency in terms of charge between complex and standard pulses in two areas of the rat brain. In motor cortex Gaussian and interphase gap stimulation IPG increased stimulation efficiency in terms of charge per phase compared with a standard pulse. Moreover IPG stimulation of the deep mesencephalic reticular formation in freely moving rats was more efficient compared to a standard pulse. We therefore conclude that complex pulses are superior to standard stimulation as less charge is required to achieve the same behavioral effects in a motor paradigm. These results have important implications for the understanding of electrical stimulation of the nervous system and open new perspectives for the design of the next generation of safe and efficient neural implants.
