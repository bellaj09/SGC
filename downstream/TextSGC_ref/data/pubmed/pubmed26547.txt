Ideal Brain Computer Interfaces need to perform asynchronously and at real time. We propose Hidden Semi-Markov Models HSMM to better segment and classify EEG data. The proposed HSMM method was tested against a simple windowed method on standard datasets. We found that our HSMM outperformed the simple windowed method. Furthermore due to the computational demands of the algorithm we adapted the HSMM algorithm to an online setting and demonstrate that this faster version of the algorithm can run in real time.
