This study aimed to develop a Walking Pattern Evaluation System during Hypogravity Simulation SAMSH which included the adaptation of a body suspension device the instrumentation of a treadmill and the development of a virtual environment. SAMSH was developed using one subject. Kinematic analyses were performed whilst one individual was walking on the treadmill during body weight reduction simulating the gravitational forces of the Moon reduction of 60% and Mars reduction of 30% with and without virtual reality glasses Head Mounted Display HMD. The walking pattern was evaluated by means of knee and ankle electrogoniometers foot switches placed on the front and back part of the plantar region and five video cameras. Results showed that the body weight reduction during Moon simulation alter the walking pattern including the increase in step time contact time step length and aerial time and the decrease of walking cadence time steps per minute. The findings of this study also suggested that hypogravity simulation reduces walking effort. The utilization of the HMD allowed the evaluation of the head position three-dimensionally during hypogravity simulation. The virtual environment reduced postural balance due to the absence of visual input which was evidenced by a protective extension reaction. Development of walking pattern evaluation system for hypogravity simulation.
