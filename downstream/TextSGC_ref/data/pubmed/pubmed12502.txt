Accurate prediction of inter-residue contacts of a protein is important to calculating its tertiary structure. Analysis of co-evolutionary events among residues has been proved effective in inferring inter-residue contacts. The Markov random field MRF technique although being widely used for contact prediction suffers from the following dilemma: the actual likelihood function of MRF is accurate but time-consuming to calculate; in contrast approximations to the actual likelihood say pseudo-likelihood are efficient to calculate but inaccurate. Thus how to achieve both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously remains a challenge. Predicting protein inter-residue contacts using composite likelihood maximization and deep learning.
