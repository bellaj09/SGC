Bipolar disorder BP is characterized by periods of depression BPD and hypomania BPM but the underlying state-related brain circuit abnormalities are not fully understood. Striatal functional activation and connectivity abnormalities have been noted in BP but consistent findings have not been reported. To further elucidate striatal abnormalities in different BP states this study investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity of six striatal subregions in BPD BPM and healthy control HC subjects. Ninety medication-free subjects 30 BPD 30 BPM and 30 HC closely matched for age and gender were scanned using 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI acquired at resting state. Correlations of low-frequency blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations for six previously described striatal subregions were used to obtain connectivity maps of each subregion. Using a factorial design main effects for differences between groups were obtained and post hoc pairwise group comparisons performed. BPD showed increased connectivity of the dorsal caudal putamen with somatosensory areas such as the insula and temporal gyrus. BPM group showed unique increased connectivity between left dorsal caudate and midbrain regions as well as increased connectivity between ventral striatum inferior and thalamus. In addition both BPD and BPM exhibited widespread functional connectivity abnormalities between striatal subregions and frontal cortices limbic regions and midbrain structures. In summary BPD exhibited connectivity abnormalities of associative and somatosensory subregions of the putamen while BPM exhibited connectivity abnormalities of associative and limbic caudate. Most other striatal subregion connectivity abnormalities were common to both groups and may be trait related.
