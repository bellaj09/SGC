Background and Objective Fatty Liver Disease FLD - a disease caused by deposition of fat in liver cells is predecessor to terminal diseases such as liver cancer. The machine learning ML techniques applied for FLD detection and risk stratification using ultrasound US have limitations in computing tissue characterization features thereby limiting the accuracy. Methods Under the class of Symtosis for FLD detection and risk stratification this study presents a Deep Learning DL-based paradigm that computes nearly seven million weights per image when passed through a 22 layered neural network during the cross-validation training and testing paradigm. The DL architecture consists of cascaded layers of operations such as: convolution pooling rectified linear unit dropout and a special block called inception model that provides speed and efficiency. All data analysis is performed in optimized tissue region obtained by removing background information. We benchmark the DL system against the conventional ML protocols: support vector machine SVM and extreme learning machine ELM. Results The liver US data consists of 63 patients 27 normal/36 abnormal. Using the K10 cross-validation protocol 90% training and 10% testing the detection and risk stratification accuracies are: 82% 92% and 100% for SVM ELM and DL systems respectively. The corresponding area under the curve is: 0.79 0.92 and 1.0 respectively. We further validate our DL system using two class biometric facial data that yields an accuracy of 99%. Conclusion DL system shows a superior performance for liver detection and risk stratification compared to conventional machine learning systems: SVM and ELM.
