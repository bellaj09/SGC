Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms however collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research for example the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals providing an excellent resource for this field yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach.
