The olive oil assessment involves the use of a standardized sensory analysis according to the "panel test" method. However there is an important interest to design novel strategies based on the use of Gas Chromatography GC coupled to mass spectrometry MS or ion mobility spectrometry IMS together with a chemometric data treatment for olive oil classification. It is an essential task in an attempt to get the most robust model over time and both to avoid fraud in the price and to know whether it is suitable for consumption or not. The aim of this paper is to combine chemical techniques and Deep Learning approaches to automatically classify olive oil samples from two different harvests in their three corresponding classes: extra virgin olive oil EVOO virgin olive oil VOO and lampante olive oil LOO. Our Deep Learning model is built with 701 samples which were obtained from two olive oil campaigns 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The data from the two harvests are built from the selection of specific olive oil markers from the whole spectral fingerprint obtained with GC-IMS method. In order to obtain the best results we have configured the parameters of our model according to the nature of the data. The results obtained show that a deep learning approach applied to data obtained from chemical instrumental techniques is a good method when classifying oil samples in their corresponding categories with higher success rates than those obtained in previous works.
