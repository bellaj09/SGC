"The purpose of this study was to design a one-hour brain dissection protocol for a medical neuroscience course and evaluate the short and long-term effects of its implementation on medical students. First-year medical students n\u2009=\u2009166 participated in a brain dissection activity that included dissection of the basal nuclei and associated deep brain structures. Short-term retention was assessed by administering identical pre- and post-activity tests involving identification of brain structures. Following the brain dissection the students posttest scores were significantly higher 68.8%\u2009\u200917.8%; mean percent score\u2009\u2009SD than their pretest scores 35.8%\u2009\u200920.0% P\u2009\u20090.0001. Long-term retention was evaluated by conducting an identical assessment five months after completion of the course. Students who participated in the dissection activity n\u2009=\u200980 had significantly higher scores 46.6%\u2009\u200923.8% than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity n\u2009=\u200985 38.1%\u2009\u200923.9% P\u2009\u20090.05. In addition to the long-term retention assessment the NBME Subject Examination scores of students who participated in the dissection activity were significantly higher than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity P\u2009\u20090.01. Results suggest that this succinct brain dissection activity may be a practical addition to an undergraduate medical neuroscience course for increasing the effectiveness of neuroanatomy training. This effect may have long-term benefits on knowledge retention and may be correlated with higher performance levels on standardized subject examinations. Anat Sci Educ 9: 565-574."
