Pattern recognition technology allows for more intuitive control of myoelectric prostheses. However the need to collect electromyographic data to initially train the pattern recognition system and to re-train it during prosthesis use adds complexity that can make using such a system difficult. Although experienced clinicians may be able to guide users to ensure successful data collection methods they may not always be available when a user needs to retrain their device. Adapting myoelectric control in real-time using a virtual environment.
