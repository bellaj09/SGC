Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN is rapidly becoming the preferred surgical choice for the treatment of advanced Parkinson\s disease PD. We report initial results in 15 patients after 12 months and in nine patients evaluated between 30 and 36 months postoperatively. Our experience confirms the robust antiparkinsonian effect of DBS of the STN in advanced PD. The severity of "off" episodes as assessed by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale UPDRS was drastically reduced by 74% at 12 months and dyskinesia scores Dyskinesia Rating Scale decreased. The levodopa daily dose was reduced by 55% at 12 months. A double-blind assessment to determine the effect of stimulation performed in nine patients at 3 months in the "off" medication condition was very significant p<0.05. Nine patients have been followed for 3 years with maintained efficacy in the UPDRS "off" score and the dyskinesia score. The experience of other groups using a similar technique is reviewed. The overall assessment indicates a high antiparkinsonian effect of DBS of the STN even in advanced patients. The existence of a learning curve for this procedure should be taken into account when initial results are evaluated.
