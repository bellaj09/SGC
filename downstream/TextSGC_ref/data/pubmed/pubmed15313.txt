Brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF is a major signaling molecule that the brain uses to control a vast network of intracellular cascades fundamental to properties of learning and memory and cognition. While much is known about BDNF signaling in the healthy nervous system where it controls the mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK and cyclic-AMP pathways less is known about its role in multiple brain disorders where it contributes to the dysregulated neuroplasticity seen in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury TBI. We previously found that neurons respond to prolonged BDNF exposure both in vivo in models of epilepsy and TBI and in vitro in BDNF treated primary neuronal cultures by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This pathway is best known for its association with inflammatory cytokines in non-neuronal cells.
