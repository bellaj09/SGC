"Studies of the same disease often implicate different brain regions contributing to a perceived reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging. Here we leverage the normative human brain connectome to test whether seemingly heterogeneous neuroimaging findings localize to connected brain networks. We use neurodegenerative disease and specifically Alzheimers disease as our example as it is one of the diseases that has been studied the most using neuroimaging. First we show that neuroimaging findings in Alzheimers disease occur in different brain regions across different studies but localize to the same functionally connected brain network. Second we show that neuroimaging findings across different neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimers disease frontotemporal dementia corticobasal syndrome and progressive non-fluent aphasia localize to different disease-specific brain networks. Finally we show that neuroimaging findings for a specific symptom within a disease delusions in Alzheimers disease localize to a symptom-specific brain network. Our results suggest that neuroimaging studies that appear poorly reproducible may identify different regions within the same connected brain network. Human connectome data can be used to link heterogeneous neuroimaging findings to common neuroanatomy improving localization of neuropsychiatric diseases and symptoms."
