An audiovisual object may contain multiple semantic features such as the gender and emotional features of the speaker. Feature-selective attention and audiovisual semantic integration are two brain functions involved in the recognition of audiovisual objects. Humans often selectively attend to one or several features while ignoring the other features of an audiovisual object. Meanwhile the human brain integrates semantic information from the visual and auditory modalities. However how these two brain functions correlate with each other remains to be elucidated. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study we explored the neural mechanism by which feature-selective attention modulates audiovisual semantic integration. During the fMRI experiment the subjects were presented with visual-only auditory-only or audiovisual dynamical facial stimuli and performed several feature-selective attention tasks. Our results revealed that a distribution of areas including heteromodal areas and brain areas encoding attended features may be involved in audiovisual semantic integration. Through feature-selective attention the human brain may selectively integrate audiovisual semantic information from attended features by enhancing functional connectivity and thus regulating information flows from heteromodal areas to brain areas encoding the attended features.
