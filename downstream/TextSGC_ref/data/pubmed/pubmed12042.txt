Deep convolutional neural networks CNNs have shown superior performance on the task of single-label image classification. However the applicability of CNNs to multi-label images still remains an open problem mainly because of two reasons. First each image is usually treated as an inseparable entity and represented as one instance which mixes the visual information corresponding to different labels. Second the correlations amongst labels are often overlooked. To address these limitations we propose a deep multi-modal CNN for multi-instance multi-label image classification called MMCNN-MIML. By combining CNNs with multi-instance multi-label MIML learning our model represents each image as a bag of instances for image classification and inherits the merits of both CNNs and MIML. In particular MMCNN-MIML has three main appealing properties: 1 it can automatically generate instance representations for MIML by exploiting the architecture of CNNs; 2 it takes advantage of the label correlations by grouping labels in its later layers; and 3 it incorporates the textual context of label groups to generate multi-modal instances which are effective in discriminating visually similar objects belonging to different groups. Empirical studies on several benchmark multi-label image data sets show that MMCNN-MIML significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on multi-label image classification tasks.
