Chest X-ray radiography and computed tomography the two mainstay modalities in thoracic radiology are under active investigation with deep learning technology which has shown promising performance in various tasks including detection classification segmentation and image synthesis outperforming conventional methods and suggesting its potential for clinical implementation. However the implementation of deep learning in daily clinical practice is in its infancy and facing several challenges such as its limited ability to explain the output results uncertain benefits regarding patient outcomes and incomplete integration in daily workflow. In this review article we will introduce the potential clinical applications of deep learning technology in thoracic radiology and discuss several challenges for its implementation in daily clinical practice. Clinical Implementation of Deep Learning in Thoracic Radiology: Potential Applications and Challenges.
