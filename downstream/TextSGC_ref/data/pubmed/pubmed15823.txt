"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN or the internal segment of the globus pallidus GPi improves Parkinsons disease and increases frontal blood flow. We assessed the effects of bilateral DBS on executive function in Parkinsons disease patients seven with electrodes implanted in the STN and six in the GPi. Patients were assessed off medication with stimulators off on and off again. The groups showed differential change with stimulation on the Reitan Trail-Making test TMT B STN more improved and on some measures of random number generation and Wisconsin Card Sorting STN improved GPi worse with stimulation. Across the groups stimulation speeded up responding Stroop control trial TMT A and improved performance on paced serial addition and missing digit tests. Conversely conditional associative learning became more errorful with stimulation across the two groups. In general change in performance with stimulation was significant for the STN but not the GPi group. These results support two opposite predictions. In support of current models of Parkinsons disease releasing the brake on frontal function with DBS improved aspects of executive function. Conversely disruption of basal ganglia outflow during DBS impaired performance on tests requiring changing behaviour in novel contexts as predicted by Marsden and Obeso in 1994."
