Previous structural brain connectivity studies have mainly focussed on the macroscopic scale of around 1000 or fewer brain areas network nodes. However it has recently been demonstrated that high resolution structural connectomes of around 50000 nodes can be generated reproducibly. In this study we infer high resolution brain connectivity matrices using diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. With such high resolution we are able to analyse networks within brain areas in a single subject. We show that the global network has a scale invariant topological organisation which means there is a hierarchical organisation of the modular architecture. Specifically modules within brain areas are spatially localised. We find that long range connections terminate between specific modules whilst short range connections via highly curved association fibers terminate within modules. We suggest that spatial locations of white matter modules overlap with cytoarchitecturally distinct grey matter areas and may serve as the structural basis for function specialisation within brain areas. Future studies might elucidate how brain diseases change this modular architecture within brain areas. Within brain area tractography suggests local modularity using high resolution connectomics.
