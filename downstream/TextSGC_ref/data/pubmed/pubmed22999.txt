Mental training of laparoscopic procedures with E-learning has been shown to translate to the operating room. The present study aims to explore whether the use of checklists during E-learning improves transfer of skills to the simulated OR on a Virtual Reality VR trainer for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB. Does rating with a checklist improve the effect of E-learning for cognitive and practical skills in bariatric surgery? A rater-blinded randomized-controlled trial.
