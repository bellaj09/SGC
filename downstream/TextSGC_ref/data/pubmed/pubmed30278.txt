This study aimed at investigating the organization of joint angle variability during walking by using the uncontrolled manifold UCM theory. We tested two hypotheses: i. the coordinative mechanism underlying joint angle variance during the stance phase is compatible with a kinematic synergy that stabilizes the centre of mass CoM position; ii. the walking speed affects the variance components onto and orthogonal to the UCM. Eight healthy subjects 26.02.0years old steadily walked on a treadmill at five normalised speeds from 0.620.03m/s to 1.150.07m/s. Joint angles and foot orientation and components of the CoM position were respectively used as elemental variables and task performance for the UCM implementation. The effect of speed time events and variance components on the distribution of data variance in the space of joint angles was analyzed by the ANOVA test. Results corroborated the hypothesis that the variance of elemental variables is structured in order to minimize the stride-to-stride variability of the CoM position at all speeds. Noticeably both variance components increase during the propulsive phase albeit that parallel to the UCM was always grater than the orthogonal one. Accordingly the observed kinematic synergy is supposed to contribute to accomplishing an efficient transition between two steps. Results also revealed that the walking speed does not affect the partitioning of elemental variables-related variance onto and orthogonal to the UCM. Accordingly the organization of leg joint variance underlying the stabilization of CoM position remains almost unaltered across speeds. Uncontrolled manifold hypothesis: Organization of leg joint variance in humans while walking in a wide range of speeds.
