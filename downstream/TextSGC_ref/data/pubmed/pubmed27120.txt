The constrained ICA cICA is a recent approach which can extract the desired source signal by using prior information. cICA employs gradient-based algorithms to optimize non convex objective functions and therefore global optimum solution is not guaranteed. In this study we propose the Global optimal constrained ICA GocICA algorithm for solving the conventional cICA problems. Due to the importance of movement related cortical potentials MRCPs for neurorehabilitation and developing a suitable mechanism for detection of movement intention single-trial MRCP extraction is presented as an application of GocICA. Global optimal constrained ICA and its application in extraction of movement related cortical potentials from single-trial EEG signals.
