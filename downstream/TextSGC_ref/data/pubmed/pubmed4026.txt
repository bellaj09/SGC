"The corpus callosum is the largest white matter tract in the brain connecting the 2 hemispheres. The functions of the corpus callosum are many and varied and lesions frequently cause only subtle clinical findings. The range of diseases that can affect the corpus callosum is vast and includes all potential white matter disease. The distribution of lesions in the corpus callosum is disease specific in only a few entities such as Susac syndrome and Marchiafava-Bignami disease. Group studies have found significant differences of diffusivity metrics in the corpus callosum in preterm infants patients suffering seizure activity and patients with early-onset Alzheimers disease. Given the challenges that multiple orientation of fibers within the callosum presents advanced postprocessing methods may be required to reveal ultrastructural disease."
