Brain cells communicate with one another via local and long-range synaptic connections. Structural connectivity is the foundation for neural function. Brain-wide connectivity can be described at macroscopic mesoscopic and microscopic levels. The mesoscale connectome represents connections between neuronal types across different brain regions. Building a mesoscale connectome requires a detailed understanding of the cell type composition of different brain regions and the patterns of inputs and outputs that each of these cell types receives and forms respectively. In this review I discuss historical and contemporary tracing techniques in both anterograde and retrograde directions to map the input and output connections at population and individual cell levels as well as imaging and network analysis approaches to build mesoscale connectomes for mammalian brains.
