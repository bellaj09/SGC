Carbohydrate-active enzymes CAZymes are extremely important to bioenergy human gut microbiome and plant pathogen researches and industries. Here we developed a new amino acid k-mer-based CAZyme classification motif identification and genome annotation tool using a bipartite network algorithm. Using this tool we classified 390 CAZyme families into thousands of subfamilies each with distinguishing k-mer peptides. These k-mers represented the characteristic motifs in the form of a collection of conserved short peptides of each subfamily and thus were further used to annotate new genomes for CAZymes. This idea was also generalized to extract characteristic k-mer peptides for all the Swiss-Prot enzymes classified by the EC enzyme commission numbers and applied to enzyme EC prediction. eCAMI: simultaneous classification and motif identification for enzyme annotation.
