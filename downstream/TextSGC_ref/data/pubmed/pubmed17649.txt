Transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS of the primary motor cortex M1 has beneficial effects on motor performance and motor learning in healthy subjects and is emerging as a promising tool for motor neurorehabilitation. Applying tDCS concurrently with a motor task has recently been found to be more effective than applying stimulation before the motor task. This study extends this finding to examine whether such task-concurrent stimulation further enhances motor learning on a dual M1 montage. Enhanced motor learning following task-concurrent dual transcranial direct current stimulation.
