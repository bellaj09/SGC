Traumatic brain injury TBI is considered one of the most pervasive causes of disability in people under the age of 45. TBI often results in disorders of consciousness and clinical assessment of the state of consciousness in these patients is challenging due to the lack of behavioural responsiveness. Functional neuroimaging offers a means to assess these patients without the need for behavioural signs indicating that brain connectivity plays a major role in consciousness emergence and maintenance. However little is known regarding how changes in connectivity during recovery from TBI accompany changes in the level of consciousness. Here we aim to combine cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques to follow changes in brain connectivity in patients recovering from severe TBI.
