Objectives: To evaluate if the use of a photographic handbook PH can be a useful tool to improve the detection of disorders during cystoscopy training as several hands-on tools have been proposed to improve technical skills but very few aim to improve specificity and sensitivity. Subjects and methods: Eight junior residents JRs were divided into two groups: Group A comprised four JRs with previous limited experience of performing cystoscopies; and Group B including four inexperienced JRs who were asked to study a specific PH before performing cystoscopies. The findings of the two groups were compared using the chi-squared test. Results: A total of 401 consecutive cystoscopies of which 214 53.4% were performed by Group A and 187 46.6% by Group B were considered. Group B showed superior ability in detecting uncommon findings i.e. carcinoma in situ bullous oedema interstitial cystitis etc. with 24/46 52.2% detected vs eight of 32 25% in Group A P =\xa00.016. Conclusions: The PH was a useful tool for improving identification of pathological conditions which could be used to enhance hands-on simulator and practical tutored training.
