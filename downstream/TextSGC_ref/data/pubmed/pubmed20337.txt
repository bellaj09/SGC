The aim of this experiment was to measure the effect of immersion in a virtual environment VE on postural stability and examine the relationship between postural stability and self-reported simulator sickness. Forty healthy subjects were exposed to 20 min of immersion in an interactive VE with restricted user movement. The VE was viewed on a head mounted display HMD and the subject remained standing throughout the immersion period. Two static postures normal stance and tandem romberg were recorded before immersion immediately after immersion and again at 10 min postimmersion. Performance in each posture was simultaneously measured by recording time that the posture could be maintained and mm path length of body sway over a 30-s period. The results demonstrated differences in the sensitivity of postural stability measurement techniques and variations in inter- and intraindividual responses to measures. Sway magnetometry measured a significant increase in postural instability in normal stance after VE immersion. None of the other measures were sensitive to this change. Postimmersion reports of simulator sickness symptoms indicate that the VE stimulus was provocative and correlation was found between reports of simulator sickness and balance-related symptoms. However no association between self-reported symptoms and performance measures of postural instability was found. Static posture tests for the assessment of postural instability after virtual environment use.
