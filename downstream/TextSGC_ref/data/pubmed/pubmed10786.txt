"Nano-scaled structures wireless sensing wearable devices and wireless communications systems are anticipated to support the development of new next-generation technologies in the near future. Exponential rise in future Radio-Frequency RF sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas such as wearable consumer electronics remote healthcare monitoring wireless implants and smart buildings. In this paper we propose a novel non-wearable device-free privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router network interface card and an omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without deploying a device on persons body. The Wi-Fi signals received using non-wearable devices are converted into time-frequency scalograms. The occupancy is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural network. In addition to occupancy detection the deep neural network also identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover a novel encryption algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is 91.1%."
