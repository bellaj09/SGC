Stroke can be a source of significant upper extremity dysfunction and affect the quality of life QoL in survivors. In this context novel rehabilitation approaches employing robotic rehabilitation devices combined with brain-machine interfaces can greatly help in expediting functional recovery in these individuals by actively engaging the user during therapy. However optimal training conditions and parameters for these novel therapeutic systems are still unknown. Here we present preliminary findings demonstrating successful movement intent detection from scalp electroencephalography EEG during robotic rehabilitation using the MAHI Exo-II in an individual with hemiparesis following stroke. These findings have strong clinical implications for the development of closed-loop brain-machine interfaces to robotic rehabilitation systems. Detecting movement intent from scalp EEG in a novel upper limb robotic rehabilitation system for stroke.
