"Swing in a crew boat a good jazz riff a fluid conversation: these tasks require extracting sensory information about how others flow in order to mimic and respond. To determine what factors influence coordination we build an environment to manipulate incoming sensory information by combining virtual reality and motion capture. We study how people mirror the motion of a human avatars arm as we occlude the avatar. We efficiently map the transition from successful mirroring to failure using Gaussian process regression. Then we determine the change in behaviour when we introduce audio cues with a frequency proportional to the speed of the avatars hand or train individuals with a practice session. Remarkably audio cues extend the range of successful mirroring to regimes where visual information is sparse. Such cues could facilitate joint coordination when navigating visually occluded environments improve reaction speed in human-computer interfaces or measure altered physiological states and disease." Audio cues enhance mirroring of arm motion when visual cues are scarce.
