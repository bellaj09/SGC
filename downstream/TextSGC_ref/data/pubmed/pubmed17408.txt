Human Motion Capture MoCap data can be used for animation of virtual human-like characters in distributed virtual reality applications and networked games. MoCap data compressed using the standard MPEG-4 encoding pipeline comprising of predictive encoding and/or DCT decorrelation quantization and arithmetic/Huffman encoding entails significant power consumption for the purpose of decompression. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for compression of MoCap data which is based on smart indexing of the MoCap data by exploiting structural information derived from the skeletal virtual human model. The indexing algorithm can be fine-controlled using three predefined quality control parameters QCPs. We demonstrate how an efficient combination of the three QCPs results in a lower network bandwidth requirement and reduced power consumption for data decompression at the client end when compared to standard MPEG-4 compression. Since the proposed algorithm exploits structural information derived from the skeletal virtual human model it is observed to result in virtual human animation of visually acceptable quality upon decompression. Human motion capture data compression by model-based indexing: a power aware approach.
