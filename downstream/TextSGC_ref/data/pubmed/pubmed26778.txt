Electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI systems are mainly divided into three major paradigms: motor imagery MI event-related potential ERP and steady-state visually evoked potential SSVEP. Here we present a BCI dataset that includes the three major BCI paradigms with a large number of subjects over multiple sessions. In addition information about the psychological and physiological conditions of BCI users was obtained using a questionnaire and task-unrelated parameters such as resting state artifacts and electromyography of both arms were also recorded. We evaluated the decoding accuracies for the individual paradigms and determined performance variations across both subjects and sessions. Furthermore we looked for more general severe cases of BCI illiteracy than have been previously reported in the literature.
