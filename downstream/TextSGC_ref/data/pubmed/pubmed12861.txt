"Postoperative programming in deep brain stimulation DBS therapy for movement disorders can be challenging and time consuming. Providing the neurologist with tools to visualize the electrode location relative to the patients anatomy along with models of tissue activation and statistical data can therefore be very helpful. In this study we evaluate the consistency between neurologists in interpreting and using such information provided by our DBS programming assistance software." Neurologist consistency in interpreting information provided by an interactive visualization software for deep brain stimulation postoperative programming assistance.
