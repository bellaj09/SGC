Training on micro- and nano- computed tomography CT scanners has been traditionally conducted via extensive practice on the instrument. This entails presence of an instructor to guide through the training procedure until reasonable experience is attained. Modern tomographic instruments being expensive to maintain the operational costs escalates with increasing number of training conducted. In a pioneering approach the technical know-how to operate such equipment has been partly imparted via virtual reality environment running on the Second Life grid. The experimentation has indicated a reduction of the total training time. The authors hope that in the long run such techniques will aid in significant reduction of instruction time and costs associated with training. SLATE: virtualizing multiscale CT training.
