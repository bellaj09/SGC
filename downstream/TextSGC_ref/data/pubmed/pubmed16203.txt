Over the last couple of decades learning through simulation has become popularised for various reasons and is continuing to expand exponentially despite a lack of robust evidence that it actually improves outcomes for patients and learners. There has been a particular growth in the use of high-fidelity virtual reality simulators for surgical training as the technology has become more affordable. In the field of Otolaryngology simulation appears to help teach simple procedural skills through to complex surgery of the temporal bone and paranasal sinuses. This is happening in an era when quality of care and patient safety are top of the agenda and cadaveric material is in short supply. In this article we explore the history behind simulation review the available evidence and discuss its applications within Otolaryngology. Teaching Otolaryngology skills through simulation.
