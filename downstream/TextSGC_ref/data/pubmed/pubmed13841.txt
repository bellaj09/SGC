"Many classical machine learning techniques have been used to explore Alzheimers disease AD evolving from image decomposition techniques such as principal component analysis toward higher complexity non-linear decomposition algorithms. With the arrival of the deep learning paradigm it has become possible to extract high-level abstract features directly from MRI images that internally describe the distribution of data in low-dimensional manifolds. In this work we try a new exploratory data analysis of AD based on deep convolutional autoencoders. We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of neuropsychological test outcomes diagnoses and other clinical data with the imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis and the influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is estimated. The imaging-derived markers could then predict clinical variables with correlations above 0.6 in the case of neuropsychological evaluation variables such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores achieving a classification accuracy over 80% for the diagnosis of AD."
