"There is a debate on possible alterations of self-identity following deep brain stimulation for neurological disorders including Parkinsons disease. Among the psychological variables likely to undergo changes throughout such a medical procedure illness representations and coping strategies have not been the target of much research to this day. In order to remedy this we investigated the dynamics of illness representations and coping strategies in an 18-month longitudinal study involving 45 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for idiopathic Parkinsons disease. Two research hypotheses were formulated and investigated through repeated measures of ANOVAs and structural equation modelling with full information maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimations. Representations of Parkinsons disease as a cyclical condition and perception of control over the disease diminished after surgery. Use of instrumental coping strategies was not modified after deep brain stimulation. These changes were identified by SEM but not ANOVAs; their magnitude was nevertheless relatively small implying general stability in representations. These findings suggest that psychological variables do not undergo major changes after deep brain stimulation for Parkinsons disease."
