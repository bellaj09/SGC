Mental disorders often occur in combinations e.g. a patient with an anxiety disorder may also develop depression. This co-occurring mental health condition provides the focus for our work on classifying online communities with an interest in depression. For this we have crawled a large body of 620\xa0000 posts made by 80\xa0000 users in 247 online communities. We have extracted the topics and psycholinguistic features expressed in the posts using these as inputs to our model. Following a machine learning technique we have formulated a joint modeling framework in order to classify mental health-related co-occurring online communities from these features. Finally we performed empirical validation of the model on the crawled dataset where our model outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines.
