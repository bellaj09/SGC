"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional RNA sequence alteration. Current methods have identified editing sites and facilitated research but require sufficient genomic annotations and prior-knowledge-based filtering steps resulting in a cumbersome time-consuming identification process. Moreover these methods have limited generalizability and applicability in species with insufficient genomic annotations or in conditions of limited prior knowledge. We developed DeepRed a deep learning-based method that identifies RNA editing from primitive RNA sequences without prior-knowledge-based filtering steps or genomic annotations. DeepRed achieved 98.1% and 97.9% area under the curve AUC in training and test sets respectively. We further validated DeepRed using experimentally verified U87 cell RNA-seq data achieving 97.9% positive predictive value PPV. We demonstrated that DeepRed offers better prediction accuracy and computational efficiency than current methods with large-scale mass RNA-seq data. We used DeepRed to assess the impact of multiple factors on editing identification with RNA-seq data from the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities and Sequencing Quality Control projects. We explored developmental RNA editing pattern changes during human early embryogenesis and evolutionary patterns in Drosophila species and the primate lineage using DeepRed. Our work illustrates DeepReds state-of-the-art performance; it may decipher the hidden principles behind RNA editing making editing detection convenient and effective."
