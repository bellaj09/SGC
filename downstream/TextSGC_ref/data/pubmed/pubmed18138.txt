Simulating the behaviour of elastic objects in real time is one of the current objectives of computer graphics. One of its fields of application lies in virtual reality mainly in surgery simulation systems. In computer graphics the models used for the construction of objects with deformable behaviour are known as deformable models. These have two conflicting characteristics: interactivity and motion realism. The different deformable models developed to date have promoted only one of these usually interactivity to the detriment of the other biomechanical realism. In this paper we present a classification of the different deformable models that have been developed. We present the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Finally we make a comparison of deformable models and perform an evaluation of the state of the art and the future of deformable models. Real-time deformable models for surgery simulation: a survey.
