Neural responses to visually presented objects have a large-scale spatial organization across the cortex related to the dimensions of animacy and object size. Most proposals about the origins of this organization point to the influence of differential connectivity with other cortical regions as the key organizing force that drives distinctions in object-responsive cortex. To explore this possibility we used resting-state functional connectivity to examine the relationship between stimulus-evoked organization of objects and distinctions in functional network architecture. Using a data-driven analysis we found evidence for three distinct whole-brain resting-state networks that route through object-responsive cortex and these naturally manifest the tripartite structure of the stimulus-evoked organization. However object-responsive regions were also highly correlated with each other at rest. Together these results point to a nested network architecture with a local interconnected network across object-responsive cortex and distinctive subnetworks that specifically route these key object distinctions to distinct long-range regions. Broadly these results point to the viability that long-range connections are a driving force of the large-scale organization of object-responsive cortex. The Large-Scale Organization of Object-Responsive Cortex Is Reflected in Resting-State Network Architecture.
