The article presents an introduction to studies of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging during rest rsfMRI. These studies are based on the fact that the resting brain exhibits a certain level of constant background activity. These spontaneous rsfMRT activities are characterized by fluctuations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent BOLD signal typically in the low frequency part of the power spectrum <\u20090.1 Hz which correlate with the local neuronal activity and can be seen as a result of neuronal coupling of monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections. The first network described in detail is the so-called default mode network DMN. This includes the medial prefrontal cortex MPC the posterior cingulate cortex PCC the precuneus PrC parts of the medial temporal lobe and the lateral inferior parietal lobe. In addition a number of other resting state networks RSNs such as a motor somatosensory visual auditory and cognitive system has been described which partly process long-term connections from the cerebral cortex to the diencephalon brain stem and cerebellum.
