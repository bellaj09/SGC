Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is often found to co-exist with non-core behavioral manifestations that include difficulties in disengagement of attention to sensory cues. Here we examined whether this behavioral abnormality can be induced in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid VPA a well-established teratogen associated with ASD animal models. We tested rats using an auditory-cued sensorimotor task ACST based on the premise that ACST will be more sensitive to developmental changes in temporal association cortex TeA of the posterior attention system. We show that VPA rats learned the ACST markedly faster than control animals but they exhibited a profound preoccupation with cues associated with the expectancy at the reward location such that disengagement was disrupted. Control rats on the other hand were able to disengage and utilize auditory cues for re-engagement. However both control and VPA-treated rats performed similarly when tested on novel object recognition NOR and novel context mismatch NOCM behavioral tasks that are known to be sensitive to normal perirhinal and prefrontal network functioning respectively. Consistent with disrupted posterior rather than frontal networks we also report that VPA can selectively act on deep-layer TeA cortical neurons by showing that VPA increased dendritic density in isolated deep-layer TeA but not frontal neurons. These results describe a useful approach to examine the role of cue-dependent control of attention systems in rodent models of autism and suggest that disengagement impairments may arise from an inability to modify behavior through the appropriate use of sensory cue associations. Auditory-cued sensorimotor task reveals disengagement deficits in rats exposed to the autism-associated teratogen valproic acid.
