Digital therapeutics is an evidence-based intervention using high-quality software with the sole purpose of treatment. As many healthcare systems are encountering high demands of quality outcomes the need for digital therapeutics is gradually increasing in the clinical field. We conducted review of the implications of digital therapeutics in the treatment of neurological deficits for stroke patients. The implications of digital therapeutics have been discussed in four domains: cognition speech and aphasia motor and vision. It was evident that different forms of digital therapeutics such as online platforms virtual reality trainings and iPad applications have been investigated in many trials to test its feasibility in clinical use. Although digital therapeutics may deliver high-quality solutions to healthcare services the medicalization of digital therapeutics is accompanied with many limitations. Clinically validated digital therapeutics should be developed to prove its efficacy in stroke rehabilitation. Digital Therapeutics: Emerging New Therapy for Neurologic Deficits after Stroke.
