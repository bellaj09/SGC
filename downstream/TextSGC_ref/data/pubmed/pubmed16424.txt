The development of deep sequencing technologies has led to the discovery of novel transcripts. Many in silico methods have been developed to assess the coding potential of these transcripts to further investigate their functions. Existing methods perform well on distinguishing majority long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs and coding RNAs mRNAs but poorly on RNAs with small open reading frames sORFs. Here we present DeepCPP deep neural network for coding potential prediction a deep learning method for RNA coding potential prediction. Extensive evaluations on four previous datasets and six new datasets constructed in different species show that DeepCPP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods especially on sORF type data which overcomes the bottleneck of sORF mRNA identification by improving more than 4.31 37.24 and 5.89% on its accuracy for newly discovered human vertebrate and insect data respectively. Additionally we also revealed that discontinuous k-mer and our newly proposed nucleotide bias and minimal distribution similarity feature selection method play crucial roles in this classification problem. Taken together DeepCPP is an effective method for RNA coding potential prediction.
