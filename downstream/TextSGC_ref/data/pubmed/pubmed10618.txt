Oceanic phenomena detection in synthetic aperture radar SAR images is important in the fields of fishery military and oceanography. The traditional detection methods of oceanic phenomena in SAR images are based on handcrafted features and detection thresholds which have a problem of poor generalization ability. Methods based on deep learning have good generalization ability. However most of the deep learning methods currently applied to oceanic phenomena detection only detect one type of phenomenon. To satisfy the requirements of efficient and accurate detection of multiple information of multiple oceanic phenomena in massive SAR images this paper proposes an oceanic phenomena detection method in SAR images based on convolutional neural network CNN. The method first uses ResNet-50 to extract multilevel features. Second it uses the atrous spatial pyramid pooling ASPP module to extract multiscale features. Finally it fuses multilevel features and multiscale features to detect oceanic phenomena. The SAR images acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite are used to establish a sample dataset of oceanic phenomena. The method proposed can achieve 91% accuracy on the dataset.
