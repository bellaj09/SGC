Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas of our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology and the related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books journals search engines print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms some of which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology especially in diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to physicians especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates for moral/ethical status certain ethical issues arise. Questions about moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be.
