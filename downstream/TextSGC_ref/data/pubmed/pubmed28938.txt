"Electrocorticography ECoG is commonly used to map epileptic foci and to implement brain-computer interfaces. Understanding the spatiotemporal correspondence between potentials recorded from the brains surface and the firing patterns of neurons within the cortex would inform the interpretation of ECoG signals and the design of microfabricated micro-ECoG electrode arrays. Based on the theory that synaptic potentials generated by neurons firing in synchrony superimpose to generate local field potentials LFPs we hypothesized that neurons in the cortex would fire at preferential phases of the micro-ECoG signal in a spatially dependent way." Phase relationship between micro-electrocorticography and cortical neurons.
