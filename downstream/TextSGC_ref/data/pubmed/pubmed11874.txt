The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related\xa0macular degeneration and diabetic macular\xa0edema. We also provide a more transparent and\xa0interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia\xa0using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral\xa0of these treatable conditions thereby facilitating earlier treatment resulting in improved clinical outcomes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
