Hip arthroscopy is one of the most rapidly growing areas in orthopaedic surgery because of increased awareness of nonarthritic hip pathologies advanced imaging modalities and advanced techniques to reproducibly manage nonarthritic hip pathologies within a deep soft-tissue envelope and a constrained joint. In addition more academic medical centers are providing residents with education on hip arthroscopy and many hip preservation fellowships and courses are helping increase awareness of nonarthritic hip pathologies. Nonarthritic hip pathologies currently managed via hip arthroscopy include nonrepairable labral lesions femoroacetabular impingement hip instability and hip fractures. Periarticular hip pathologies currently managed via endoscopy include greater trochanteric pain syndrome tendinopathy and tears of the gluteus medius and minimus partial and complete hamstring avulsions and sciatic nerve entrapment. Ischiofemoral impingement may be addressed endoscopically via the deep gluteal space. Orthopaedic surgeons should understand the role and safety of hip arthroscopy in the pediatric population specifically in the management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis Legg-Calv-Perthes disease and septic arthritis of the hip. The efficacy of hip arthroscopy is limited and hip arthroscopy is relatively contraindicated in patients with osteoarthritis and hip dysplasia. Complications can occur and likely are underreported in patients who undergo hip arthroscopy. Orthopaedic surgeons should understand practical issues associated with incorporating hip arthroscopy into a practice including the difficult learning curve associated with hip arthroscopy and the reluctance of some payors to reimburse procedures performed arthroscopically because hip arthroscopy is a relatively new technology.
