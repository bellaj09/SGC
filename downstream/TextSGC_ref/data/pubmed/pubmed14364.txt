Cancer biomarker discovery is a critical part of cancer prevention and treatment. Despite the decades of effort only a small number of cancer biomarkers have been identified for and validated in clinical settings. Conceptual and methodological breakthroughs may help accelerate the discovery of additional cancer biomarkers particularly their use for diagnostics. In this review we have attempted to review the emerging concepts in cancer biomarker discovery including real-world evidence open access data and data paucity in rare or uncommon cancers. We have also summarized the recent methodological progress in cancer biomarker discovery such as high-throughput sequencing liquid biopsy big data artificial intelligence AI and deep learning and neural networks. Much attention has been given to the methodological details and comparison of the methodologies. Notably these concepts and methodologies interact with each other and will likely lead to synergistic effects when carefully combined. Newer more innovative concepts and methodologies are emerging as the current emerging ones became mainstream and widely applied to the field. Some future challenges are also discussed. This review contributes to the development of future theoretical frameworks and technologies in cancer biomarker discovery and will contribute to the discovery of more useful cancer biomarkers.
