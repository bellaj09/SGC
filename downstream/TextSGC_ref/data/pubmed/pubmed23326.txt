"Speaking is a sensorimotor behavior whose neural basis is difficult to study with single neuron resolution due to the scarcity of human intracortical measurements. We used electrode arrays to record from the motor cortex hand knob in two people with tetraplegia an area not previously implicated in speech. Neurons modulated during speaking and during non-speaking movements of the tongue lips and jaw. This challenges whether the conventional model of a motor homunculus division by major body regions extends to the single-neuron scale. Spoken words and syllables could be decoded from single trials demonstrating the potential of intracortical recordings for brain-computer interfaces to restore speech. Two neural population dynamics features previously reported for arm movements were also present during speaking: a component that was mostly invariant across initiating different words followed by rotatory dynamics during speaking. This suggests that common neural dynamical motifs may underlie movement of arm and speech articulators." Neural ensemble dynamics in dorsal motor cortex during speech in people with paralysis.
