Simple lumped-parameter musculoskeletal models may be more adaptable and practical for clinical real-time control applications such as prosthesis control. In this study we determined whether a lumped-parameter EMG-driven musculoskeletal model with four muscles could predict wrist and metacarpophalangeal MCP joint flexion/extension. Forearm EMG signals and joint kinematics were collected simultaneously from 5 able-bodied AB subjects. For one subject with unilateral transradial amputation TRA joint kinematics were collected from the sound arm during bilateral mirrored motion. Twenty-two model parameters were optimized such that joint kinematics predicted by EMG-driven forward dynamic simulation closely matched measured kinematics. Cross validation was employed to evaluate the model kinematic predictions using Pearsons correlation coefficient r. Model predictions of joint angles were highly to very highly positively correlated with measured values at the wrist AB mean r=0.94 TRA r=0.92 and MCP AB mean r=0.88 TRA r=0.93 joints during single-joint wrist and MCP movements respectively. In simultaneous multi-joint movement the prediction accuracy for TRA at the MCP joint decreased r=0.56 while r-values derived from AB subjects and TRA wrist motion were still above 0.75. Though parameters were optimized to match experimental sub-maximal kinematics passive and maximum isometric joint moments predicted by the model were comparable to reported experimental measures. Our results showed the promise of a lumped-parameter musculoskeletal model for hand/wrist kinematic estimation. Therefore the model might be useful for EMG control of powered upper limb prostheses but more work is needed to demonstrate its online performance.
