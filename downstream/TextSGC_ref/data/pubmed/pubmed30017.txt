We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model an optical fiber and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices 350-m thick obtained from a 20-28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore it gives us the possibility to simulate "synaptic plasticity" by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system hybrid neural circuit provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts neuroprosthetics damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.
