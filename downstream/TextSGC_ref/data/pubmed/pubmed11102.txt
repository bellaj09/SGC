We present the Twitter Health Surveillance THS application framework. THS is designed as an integrated platform to help health officials collect tweets determine if they are related with a medical condition extract metadata out of them and create a big data warehouse that can be used to further analyze the data. THS is built atop open source tools and provides the following value added services: Data Acquisition Tweet Classification and Big Data Warehousing. In order to validate THS we have created a collection of roughly twelve thousands labelled tweets. These tweets contain one or more target medical terms and the labels indicate if the tweet is related or not to a medical condition. We used this collection to test various models based on LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks. Our experiments show that we can classify tweets with 96% precision 92% recall and 91% F1 score. These results compare favorably with recent research on this area and show the promise of our THS system. Twitter Health Surveillance THS System.
