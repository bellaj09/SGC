Methodological advances in metagenome assembly are rapidly increasing in the number of published metagenome assemblies. However identifying misassemblies is challenging due to a lack of closely related reference genomes that can act as pseudo ground truth. Existing reference-free methods are no longer maintained can make strong assumptions that may not hold across a diversity of research projects and have not been validated on large scale metagenome assemblies.
