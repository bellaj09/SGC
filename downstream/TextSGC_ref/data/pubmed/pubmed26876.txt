Support vector machines SVM have developed into a gold standard for accurate classification in brain-computer interfaces BCI. The choice of the most appropriate classifier for a particular application depends on several characteristics in addition to decoding accuracy. Here we investigate the implementation of hidden Markov models HMM for online BCIs and discuss strategies to improve their performance. Hidden Markov model and support vector machine based decoding of finger movements using electrocorticography.
