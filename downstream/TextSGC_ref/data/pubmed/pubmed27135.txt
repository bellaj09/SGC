The application space for brain-computer interface BCI technologies is rapidly expanding with improvements in technology. However most real-time BCIs require extensive individualized calibration prior to use and systems often have to be recalibrated to account for changes in the neural signals due to a variety of factors including changes in human state the surrounding environment and task conditions. Novel approaches to reduce calibration time or effort will dramatically improve the usability of BCI systems. Active Learning AL is an iterative semi-supervised learning technique for learning in situations in which data may be abundant but labels for the data are difficult or expensive to obtain. In this paper we apply AL to a simulated BCI system for target identification using data from a rapid serial visual presentation RSVP paradigm to minimize the amount of training samples needed to initially calibrate a neural classifier. Our results show AL can produce similar overall classification accuracy with significantly less labeled data in some cases less than 20% when compared to alternative calibration approaches. In fact AL classification performance matches performance of 10-fold cross-validation CV in over 70% of subjects when training with less than 50% of the data. To our knowledge this is the first work to demonstrate the use of AL for offline electroencephalography EEG calibration in a simulated BCI paradigm. While AL itself is not often amenable for use in real-time systems this work opens the door to alternative AL-like systems that are more amenable for BCI applications and thus enables future efforts for developing highly adaptive BCI systems.
