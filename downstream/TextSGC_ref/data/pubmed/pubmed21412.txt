"Purpose This study examined the effects of training using virtual reality games on stroke patients functional recovery. Paticipants and Methods Twenty-four hemiplegia patients whose disease duration was longer than six months participated in this study. The participants were divided at random into a control group n=12 which received traditional rehabilitation therapy and an experimental group n=12 which received both traditional rehabilitation therapy and training using virtual reality games. The program lasted for a total of 12 weeks. To examine the participants functional recovery their upper limb function was measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Manual Function Test before and after they completed the training and their daily living activities were measured using the Stroke Impact Scale before and after they completed the training. Results The experimental group participants daily living activities improved after training. In addition the experimental group scored significantly higher on all the tests than the control group but upper extremity function between the groups was not significantly different. Conclusion Stroke patients who completed the additional training using virtual reality games showed significantly greater improvement in their daily living activities than those who only received traditional rehabilitation therapy." Effects of a virtual reality video game exercise program on upper extremity function and daily living activities in stroke patients.
