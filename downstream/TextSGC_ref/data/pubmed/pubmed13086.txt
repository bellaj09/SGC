Deep learning DL a subset of machine learning approaches has emerged as a versatile tool to assimilate large amounts of heterogeneous data and provide reliable predictions of complex and uncertain phenomena. These tools are increasingly being used by the plant science community to make sense of the large datasets now regularly collected via high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping. We review recent work where DL principles have been utilized for digital image-based plant stress phenotyping. We provide a comparative assessment of DL tools against other existing techniques with respect to decision accuracy data size requirement and applicability in various scenarios. Finally we outline several avenues of research leveraging current and future DL tools in plant science. Deep Learning for Plant Stress Phenotyping: Trends and Future Perspectives.
