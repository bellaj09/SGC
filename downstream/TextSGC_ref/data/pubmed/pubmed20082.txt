Despite increased research on virtual reality VR platforms in recent years there are very few studies that specifically examine its application within a gerontological context. This study examines the usability preferences and application considerations of a mobile VR platform by individually interviewing community-dwelling older adults both before and after trying the Samsung Gear VR. Participants were asked to self-select and view short VR videos 30 s-3 min that were filmed within the local community e.g. walking path and art museum. Semi-structured interview questions explored participant perceptions of using the device and was followed with two focus group sessions. Thematic analysis was employed when reviewing observational notes and transcribed audio recordings. Ten adults aged 63-89 participated and themes identified include a usability b video subject matter preferences and c application. These themes highlighted both the challenges and opportunities of VR use among a wide range of older populations and provided greater insight with its exploration and application in future studies. This included potential use among those older adults who have notable functional limitations such as those who are immobile or reside within a care facility.
