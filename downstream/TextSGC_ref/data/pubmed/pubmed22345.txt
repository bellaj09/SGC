Neuroscientific data is typically analyzed based on the behavioral response of the participant. However the errors made may or may not be in line with the neural processing. In particular in experiments with time pressure or studies where the threshold of perception is measured the error distribution deviates from uniformity due to the structure in the underlying experimental set-up. When we base our analysis on the behavioral labels as usually done then we ignore this problem of systematic and structured non-uniform label noise and are likely to arrive at wrong conclusions in our data analysis. This paper contributes a remedy to this important scenario: we present a novel approach for a measuring label noise and b removing structured label noise. We demonstrate its usefulness for EEG data analysis using a standard d2 test for visual attention N=20 participants.
