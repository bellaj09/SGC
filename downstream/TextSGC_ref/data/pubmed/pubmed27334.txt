Cerebral palsy CP includes a broad range of disorders which can result in impairment of posture and movement control. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been proposed as assistive devices for individuals with CP. Better understanding of the neural processing underlying motor control in affected individuals could lead to more targeted BCI rehabilitation and treatment options. We have explored well-known neural correlates of movement including event-related desynchronization ERD phase synchrony and a recently-introduced measure of phase dynamics in participants with CP and healthy control participants. Although present significantly less ERD and phase locking were found in the group with CP. Additionally inter-group differences in phase dynamics were also significant. Taken together these findings suggest that users with CP exhibit lower levels of motor cortex activation during motor imagery as reflected in lower levels of ongoing mu suppression and less functional connectivity. These differences indicate that development of BCIs for individuals with CP may pose additional challenges beyond those faced in providing BCIs to healthy individuals.
