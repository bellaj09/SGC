"Many well-known brain-computer interfaces measure signals at the brain and then rely on the brains ability to learn via operant conditioning in order to control objects in the environment. In our lab we have been developing brain-muscle-computer interfaces which measure signals at a single muscle and then rely on the brains ability to learn neuromuscular skills via operant conditioning. Here we report a new mobile-phone based brain-muscle-computer interface prototype for severely paralyzed persons based on previous results from our group showing that humans may actively create specified power levels in two separate frequency bands of a single sEMG signal. Electromyographic activity on the surface of a single face muscle Auricularis superior is recorded with a standard electrode. This analog electrical signal is imported into an Android-based mobile phone. User-modulated power in two separate frequency band serves as two separate and simultaneous control channels for machine control. After signal processing the Android phone sends commands to external devices via Bluetooth. Users are trained to use the device via biofeedback with simple cursor-to-target activities on the phone screen." Multidimensional control using a mobile-phone based brain-muscle-computer interface.
