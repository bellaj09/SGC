"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a tractable model system to study locomotion sensory navigation and decision-making. In its natural habitat it is thought to navigate complex multisensory environments in order to find food and mating partners while avoiding threats like predators or toxic environments. While research in past decades has shed much light on the functions and mechanisms of selected sensory neurons we are just at the brink of understanding how sensory information is integrated by interneuron circuits for action selection in the worm. Recent technological advances have enabled whole-brain Ca2+ imaging and Ca2+ imaging of neuronal activity in freely moving worms. A common principle emerging across multiple studies is that most interneuron activities are tightly coupled to the worms instantaneous behaviour; notably these observations encompass neurons receiving direct sensory neuron inputs. The new findings suggest that in the C. elegans brain sensory and motor representations are integrated already at the uppermost sensory processing layers. Moreover these results challenge a perhaps more intuitive view of sequential feed-forward sensory pathways that converge onto premotor interneurons and motor neurons. We propose that sensorimotor integration occurs rather in a distributed dynamical fashion. In this perspective article we will explore this view discuss the challenges and implications of these discoveries on the interpretation and design of neural activity experiments and discuss possible functions. Furthermore we will discuss the broader context of similar findings in fruit flies and rodents which suggest generalizable principles that can be learnt from this amenable nematode model organism.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution."
