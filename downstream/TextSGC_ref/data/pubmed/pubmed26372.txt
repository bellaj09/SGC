In brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs the number of selectable targets is rather limited when each target has its own stimulation frequency. One way to remedy this is by combining frequency- with phase encoding. We introduce a new multivariate spatiotemporal filter based on Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance LCMV beamforming for discriminating between frequency-phase encoded targets more accurately even when using short signal lengths than with extended Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA which is traditionally posited for this stimulation paradigm.
