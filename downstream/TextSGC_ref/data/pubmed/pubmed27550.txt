Intracortical brain-machine interfaces BMIs aim to restore lost motor function to people with neurological deficits by decoding neural activity into control signals for guiding prostheses. An important challenge facing BMIs is that over time the number of neural signals recorded from implanted multielectrode arrays will decline and result in a concomitant decrease of BMI performance. We sought to extend BMI lifetime by developing an algorithmic technique implemented entirely in software to improve performance over state-of-the-art algorithms as the number of recorded neural signals decline. Our approach augments the decoder by incorporating neural population dynamics remembered from an earlier point in the array lifetime. We demonstrate in closed-loop experiments with two rhesus macaques that after the loss of approximately 60% of recording electrodes our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decoders by a factor of 3.2 and 1.7 corresponding to a 46% and 22% recovery of maximal performance. Further our results suggest that neural population dynamics in motor cortex are invariant to the number of recorded neurons. By extending functional BMI lifetime this approach increases the clinical viability of BMIs. Leveraging neural dynamics to extend functional lifetime of brain-machine interfaces.
