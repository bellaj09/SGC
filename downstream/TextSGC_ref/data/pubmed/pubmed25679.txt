Appropriately combining mental practice MP and physical practice PP in a poststroke rehabilitation is critical for ensuring a substantially positive rehabilitation outcome. Here we present a rehabilitation protocol incorporating a separate active PP stage followed by MP stage using a hand exoskeleton and brain-computer interface BCI. The PP stage was mediated by a force sensor feedback-based assist-as-needed control strategy whereas the MP stage provided BCI-based multimodal neurofeedback combining anthropomorphic visual feedback and proprioceptive feedback of the impaired hand extension attempt. A six week long clinical trial was conducted on four hemiparetic stroke patients screened out of 16 with a left-hand disability. The primary outcome motor functional recovery was measured in terms of changes in grip-strength GS and action research arm test ARAT scores; whereas the secondary outcome usability of the system was measured in terms of changes in mood fatigue and motivation on a visual-analog-scale. A positive rehabilitative outcome was found as the group mean changes from the baseline in the GS and ARAT were +6.38 kg and +5.66 accordingly. The VAS scale measurements also showed betterment in mood  1.38 increased motivation +2.10 and reduced fatigue 0.98 as compared to the baseline. Thus the proposed neurorehabilitation protocol is found to be promising both in terms of clinical effectiveness and usability.
