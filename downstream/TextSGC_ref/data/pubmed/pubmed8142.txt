Automatic and accurate segmentation of osteosarcoma region in CT images can help doctor make a reasonable treatment plan thus improving cure rate. In this paper a multiple supervised residual network MSRN was proposed for osteosarcoma image segmentation. Three supervised side output modules were added to the residual network. The shallow side output module could extract image shape features such as edge features and texture features. The deep side output module could extract semantic features. The side output module could compute the loss value between output probability map and ground truth and back-propagate the loss information. Then the parameters of residual network could be modified by gradient descent method. This could guide the multi-scale feature learning of the network. The final segmentation results were obtained by fusing the results output by the three side output modules. A total of 1900 CT images from 15 osteosarcoma patients were used to train the network and a total of 405 CT images from another 8 osteosarcoma patients were used to test the network. Results indicated that MSRN enabled a dice similarity coefficient DSC of 89.22% a sensitivity of 88.74% and a F1-measure of 0.9305 which were larger than those obtained by fully convolutional network FCN and U-net. Thus MSRN for osteosarcoma segmentation could give more accurate results than FCN and U-Net. Multiple supervised residual network for osteosarcoma segmentation in CT images.
