There is growing interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and particularly deep learning for computer vision in histopathology. While accumulating studies highlight expert-level performance of convolutional neural networks CNNs on focused classification tasks most studies rely on probability distribution scores with empirically defined cutoff values based on post-hoc analysis. More generalizable tools that allow humans to visualize histology-based deep learning inferences and decision making are scarce.
