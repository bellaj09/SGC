Obtaining the complete segmentation map of retinal lesions is the first step toward an automated diagnosis tool for retinopathy that is interpretable in its decision-making. However the limited availability of ground truth lesion detection maps at a pixel level restricts the ability of deep segmentation neural networks to generalize over large databases. In this paper we propose a novel approach for training a convolutional multi-task architecture with supervised learning and reinforcing it with weakly supervised learning. The architecture is simultaneously trained for three tasks: segmentation of red lesions and of bright lesions those two tasks done concurrently with lesion detection. In addition we propose and discuss the advantages of a new preprocessing method that guarantees the color consistency between the raw image and its enhanced version. Our complete system produces segmentations of both red and bright lesions. The method is validated at the pixel level and per-image using four databases and a cross-validation strategy. When evaluated on the task of screening for the presence or absence of lesions on the Messidor image set the proposed method achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.839 comparable with the state-of-the-art.
