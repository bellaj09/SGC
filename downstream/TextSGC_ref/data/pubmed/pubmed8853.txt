Glaucoma is a serious ocular disorder for which the screening and diagnosis are carried out by the examination of the optic nerve head ONH. The color fundus image CFI is the most common modality used for ocular screening. In CFI the central region which is the optic disc and the optic cup region within the disc are examined to determine one of the important cues for glaucoma diagnosis called the optic cup-to-disc ratio CDR. CDR calculation requires accurate segmentation of optic disc and cup. Another important cue for glaucoma progression is the variation of depth in ONH region. In this paper we first propose a deep learning framework to estimate depth from a single fundus image. For the case of monocular retinal depth estimation we are also plagued by the labeled data insufficiency. To overcome this problem we adopt the technique of pretraining the deep network where instead of using a denoising autoencoder we propose a new pretraining scheme called pseudo-depth reconstruction which serves as a proxy task for retinal depth estimation. Empirically we show pseudo-depth reconstruction to be a better proxy task than denoising. Our results outperform the existing techniques for depth estimation on the INSPIRE dataset. To extend the use of depth map for optic disc and cup segmentation we propose a novel fully convolutional guided network where along with the color fundus image the network uses the depth map as a guide. We propose a convolutional block called multimodal feature extraction block to extract and fuse the features of the color image and the guide image. We extensively evaluate the proposed segmentation scheme on three datasets- ORIGA RIMONEr3 and DRISHTI-GS. The performance of the method is comparable and in many cases outperforms the most recent state of the art.
