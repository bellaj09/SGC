"Brain reading technologies are rapidly being developed in a number of neuroscience fields. These technologies can record process and decode neural signals. This has been described as mind reading technology in some instances especially in popular media. Should the public at large be concerned about this kind of technology? Can it really read minds? Concerns about mind-reading might include the thought that in having ones mind open to view the possibility for free deliberation and for self-conception are eroded where one isnt at liberty to privately mull things over. Themes including privacy cognitive liberty and self-conception and expression appear to be areas of vital ethical concern. Overall this article explores whether brain reading technologies are really mind reading technologies. If they are ethical ways to deal with them must be developed. If they are not researchers and technology developers need to find ways to describe them more accurately in order to dispel unwarranted concerns and address appropriately those that are warranted."
