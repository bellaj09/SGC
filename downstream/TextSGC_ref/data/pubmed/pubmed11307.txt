In this paper we deal with the Mental Workload MWL classification problem based on the measured physiological data. First we discussed the optimal depth i.e. the number of hidden layers and parameter optimization algorithms for the Convolutional Neural Networks CNN. The base CNNs designed were tested according to five classification performance indices namely Accuracy Precision F-measure G-mean and required training time. Then we developed an Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network ECNN to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the individual CNN model. For the ECNN design three model aggregation approaches weighted averaging majority voting and stacking were examined and a resampling strategy was used to enhance the diversity of individual CNN models. The results of MWL classification performance comparison indicated that the proposed ECNN framework can effectively improve MWL classification performance and is featured by entirely automatic feature extraction and MWL classification when compared with traditional machine learning methods.
