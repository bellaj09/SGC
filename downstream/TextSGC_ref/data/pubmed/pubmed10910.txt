"The purpose of our present study was to develop a forecasting method that would help asthmatic individuals to take evasive action when the probability of an attack was at THEIR PERSONAL THRESHOLD levels. The results are encouraging. Risk factor analysis helps improve the agents performance by allowing it to consider personalized risk score of asthma attack triggers while making a decision and being able to ignore the non-triggers increasing transparency of deep reinforcement learning in medicine applications by using the results of analyzing risk factors and its association to take actions and increase accuracy over time since the association risk factor indicators are also changing over time with more accuracy rate. It also brings the possibility of including population-based health in personalized health which could support a more efficient self-management of chronic diseases."
