Behavioural and neuroimaging data have recently pointed out that empathy feeling into someone else is associated with mental imagery and transformation related to one\s and other\s visuo-spatial perspectives. Impairments of both empathic and visuo-spatial abilities have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Especially it has been suggested that schizophrenics are altered in spontaneously simulating another individual\s first-person experience. However there is so far only little evidence regarding the relationship between deficits in empathy and disturbances in spontaneous heterocentered coding in schizophrenia. In the present pilot-study we tested with schizophrenic patients our behavioural paradigm that enables to measure from the bodily postures and movements whether individuals in ecologically more valid conditions are interacting with another individual by using egocentered - as in sympathy feeling with someone else - or heterocentered - as in empathy - visuo-spatial mechanisms. For that ten patients and ten controls standing and moving interacted with a virtual tightrope walker displayed life-sized standing and moving as well. We show that patients with higher negative symptoms had in most cases deficits in spontaneously using heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms and employed preferentially an egocentered referencing to interact with the avatar. In contrast preserved spontaneous heterocentered visuo-spatial strategies were not linked to a prevailing negative or positive symptomatology. Our data suggest that the severity of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia relates with disturbances of spontaneous "on-line" empathic processing in association with lower scoring self-reported trait cognitive empathy. Disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: a behavioural pilot-study using virtual reality technology.
