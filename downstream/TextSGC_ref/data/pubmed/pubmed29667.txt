Numerous studies in the area of BCI are focused on the search for a better experimental paradigm-a set of mental actions that a user can evoke consistently and a machine can discriminate reliably. Examples of such mental activities are motor imagery mental computations etc. We propose a technique that instead allows the user to try different mental actions in the search for the ones that will work best. Mental state space visualization for interactive modeling of personalized BCI control strategies.
