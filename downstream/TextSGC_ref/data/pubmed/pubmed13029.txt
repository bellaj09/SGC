Ribosome stalling is manifested by the local accumulation of ribosomes at specific codon positions of mRNAs. Here we present ROSE a deep learning framework to analyze high-throughput ribosome profiling data and estimate the probability of a ribosome stalling event occurring at each genomic location. Extensive validation tests on independent data demonstrated that ROSE possessed higher prediction accuracy than conventional prediction models with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by up to 18.4%. In addition genome-wide statistical analyses showed that ROSE predictions can be well correlated with diverse putative regulatory factors of ribosome stalling. Moreover the genome-wide ribosome stalling landscapes of both human and yeast computed by ROSE recovered the functional interplays between ribosome stalling and cotranslational events in protein biogenesis including protein targeting by the signal recognition particles and protein secondary structure formation. Overall our study provides a novel method to complement the ribosome profiling techniques and further decipher the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying translation elongation dynamics encoded in the mRNA sequence.
