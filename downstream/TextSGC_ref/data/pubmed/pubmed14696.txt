"The current study sought to investigate the effects of matching body movement and body size between an avatar and a participant on the body ownership illusion BOI the body size illusion the sense of presence simulator sickness and emotional responses within an immersive virtual reality IVR. Forty participants experienced their life-sized virtual avatars from a first-person perspective using a full-body motion-capture system. The experiment used a 2 Motion: Synchrony and Asynchrony\u2009\u20092 Size: Matched and Unmatched within-subject design. Each participant completed a self-reported questionnaire that evaluated BOI body size illusion presence simulator sickness and emotional valence. Results showed that matching participants motion to that of an avatar increased the BOI and sense of presence while reducing simulator sickness. Furthermore participants reported more positive emotions when motion was synchronized to the virtual avatar. Most notably synchronizing body movement between participants and avatars resulted in strong body size illusion even when the body size of an avatar was larger than the one of a participant. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to directly link synchronization of user motion and body size to a virtual avatar with users subjective experience BOI body size illusion sense of presence simulator sickness and valence in IVR. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of synchronized body motion and matched body size between a user and avatar on users subjective experience in IVR which can possibly boost the effects of virtual reality applications in the fields of entertainment psychotherapy and education."
