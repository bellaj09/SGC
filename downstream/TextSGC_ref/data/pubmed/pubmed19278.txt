In cranio-maxillofacial surgery the principle of distraction osteogenesis DO can be used for the reconstruction of the deformed skull midface complex mandible and alveolar ridge. Optimal results can only be obtained with accurate planning of the osteotomies and accurate positioning of the distraction device. In addition the surgical planning must be transferred very precisely to the patient in the operating theater. The clinical accuracy and utility of stereolithographic models in cranio-maxillofacial distraction osteogenesis of the midface mandible and alveolar ridge will be demonstrated. The use of rapid prototyping in the preoperative planning of distraction osteogenesis of the cranio-maxillofacial skeleton.
