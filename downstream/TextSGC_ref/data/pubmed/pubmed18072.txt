We propose a simple strategy to improve automatic medical image segmentation. The key idea is that without deep understanding of a segmentation method we can still improve its performance by directly calibrating its results with respect to manual segmentation. We formulate the calibration process as a bias correction problem which is addressed by machine learning using training data. We apply this methodology on three segmentation problems/methods and show significant improvements for all of them. Standing on the shoulders of giants: improving medical image segmentation via bias correction.
