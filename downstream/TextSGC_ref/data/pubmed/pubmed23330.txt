There have been many attempts to design brain-computer interfaces BCIs for wheelchair control based on steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/ERS during motor imagery MI tasks P300 evoked potential and some hybrid signals. However those BCI systems cannot implement the wheelchair navigation flexibly and effectively. In this paper we propose a hybrid BCI scheme based on two-class MI and four-class SSVEP tasks. It cannot only provide multi-degree control for its user but also allow the user implement the different types of commands in parallel. In order for the subject to learn the hybrid mental strategies effectively we design a visual and auditory cues and feedback-based training paradigm. Furthermore an algorithm based on entropy of classification probabilities is proposed to detect intentional control IC state for hybrid tasks and ensure that multi-degree control commands are accurately and quickly generated. The experiment results attest to the efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid BCI for wheelchair control in the real-world. Evaluation and application of a hybrid brain computer interface for real wheelchair parallel control with multi-degree of freedom.
