"Actors were trained in sensory-motor rhythm SMR neurofeedback interfaced with a computer rendition of a theatre auditorium. Enhancement of SMR led to changes in the lighting while inhibition of theta and high beta led to a reduction in intrusive audience noise. Participants were randomised to a virtual reality VR representation in a ReaCTor with surrounding image projection seen through glasses or to a 2D computer screen which is the conventional neurofeedback medium. In addition there was a no-training comparison group. Acting performance was evaluated by three experts from both filmed studio monologues and Hamlet excerpts on the stage of Shakespeares Globe Theatre. Neurofeedback learning reached an asymptote earlier as did identification of the required mental state following training in the ReaCTor training compared with the computer screen though groups reached the same asymptote. These advantages were paralleled by higher ratings of acting performance overall well-rounded performance and especially the creativity subscale including imaginative expression conviction and characterisation. On the Flow State scales both neurofeedback groups scored higher than the no-training controls on self-ratings of sense of control confidence and feeling at-one. This is the first demonstration of enhancement of artistic performance with eyes-open neurofeedback training previously demonstrated only with eyes-closed slow-wave training. Efficacy is attributed to psychological engagement through the ecologically relevant learning context of the acting-space putatively allowing transfer to the real world otherwise achieved with slow-wave training through imaginative visualisation. The immersive VR technology was more successful than a 2D rendition." Acting performance and flow state enhanced with sensory-motor rhythm neurofeedback comparing ecologically valid immersive VR and training screen scenarios.
