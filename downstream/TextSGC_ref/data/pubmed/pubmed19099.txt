This study shows the development and validation of a dental anesthesia-training simulator specifically for the inferior alveolar nerve block IANB. The system developed provides the tactile sensation of inserting a real needle in a human patient using Virtual Reality VR techniques and a haptic device that can provide a perceived force feedback in the needle insertion task during the anesthesia procedure.
