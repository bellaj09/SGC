Although the influence of sleep on epilepsy has long been recognized this relationship has yet to be fully exploited to benefit patients. The past decade has seen significant advances in understanding paediatric sleep providing a framework by which to properly evaluate the sleep of children with epilepsy which itself has been subject to increasing scrutiny. The role of sleep in learning and the potential for interictal discharges to disrupt sleep-related memory consolidation provide a novel perspective for understanding the association of childhood epilepsy with a high rate of intellectual disability. In this review I outline the evolution of sleep duration architecture and homeostasis across childhood relating this to the development of cognitive functions. I describe how these may be disrupted or preserved in children with epilepsy; in particular collating data from polysomnography. Finally I explore how sleep may in the future be modulated to improve cognitive outcome in these patients. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Children with epilepsy have less rapid eye movement sleep than controls but this improves with seizure cessation. Deep or slow-wave sleep is highly conserved in children with epilepsy. Sleep homeostasis may be disrupted either at a local or global level by the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges. Sleep architecture and homeostasis in children with epilepsy: a neurodevelopmental perspective.
