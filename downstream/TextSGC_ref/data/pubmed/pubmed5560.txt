The stressors associated with poverty increase the risks for externalizing psychopathology; however specific patterns of neurobiology and higher self-regulation may buffer against these effects. This study leveraged a randomized control trial aimed at increasing self-regulation at ~11\xa0years of age. As adults these same individuals completed functional MRI scanning Mage \xa0=\xa024.88\xa0years; intervention n\xa0=\xa044; control n\xa0=\xa049. Functional connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was examined in relation to the intervention gains in self-regulation and present-day externalizing symptoms. Increased connectivity between these brain areas was noted in the intervention group compared to controls. Furthermore individual gains in self-regulation instilled by the intervention statistically explained this brain difference. These results begin to connect neurobiological and psychosocial markers of risk and resiliency.
