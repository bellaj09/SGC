The region of far peripheral vision beyond 60 degrees of visual angle is important to the evaluation of peripheral dark shadows negative dysphotopsia seen by some intraocular lens IOL patients. Theoretical calculations show that the limited diameter of an IOL affects ray paths at large angles leading to a dimming of the main image for small pupils and to peripheral illumination by light bypassing the IOL for larger pupils. These effects are rarely bothersome and cataract surgery is highly successful but there is a need to improve the characterization of far peripheral vision for both pseudophakic and phakic eyes. Perimetry is the main quantitative test but the purpose is to evaluate pathologies rather than characterize vision and object and image regions are no longer uniquely related in the pseudophakic eye. The maximum visual angle is approximately 1050 but there is limited information about variations with age race or refractive error in case there is an unexpected link with the development of myopia or about how clear cornea iris location and the limiting retina are related. Also the detection of peripheral motion is widely recognized to be important yet rarely evaluated. Overall people rarely complain specifically about this visual region but with "normal" vision including an IOL for >5% of people and increasing interest in virtual reality and augmented reality there are new reasons to characterize peripheral vision more completely.
