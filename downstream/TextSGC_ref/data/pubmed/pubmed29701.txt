Adapted from the concept of channel capacity the information transfer rate ITR has been widely used to evaluate the performance of a brain-computer interface BCI. However its traditional formula considers the model of a discrete memoryless channel in which the transition matrix presents very particular symmetries. As an alternative to compute the ITR this work indicates a more general closed-form expression-also based on that channel model but with less restrictive assumptions-and with the aid of a selection heuristic based on a wrapper algorithm extends such formula to detect classes that deteriorate the operation of a BCI system.
