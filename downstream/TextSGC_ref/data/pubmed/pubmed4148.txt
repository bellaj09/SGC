-Synuclein is a soluble protein that is present in abundance in the brain though its normal function in the healthy brain is poorly defined. Intraneuronal inclusions of -synuclein commonly referred to as Lewy pathology are pathological hallmarks of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as -synucleinopathies. Though -synuclein is expressed predominantly in neurons -synuclein aggregates in astrocytes are a common feature in these neurodegenerative diseases. How and why -synuclein ends up in the astrocytes and the consequences of this dysfunctional proteostasis in immune cells is a major area of research that can have far-reaching implications for future immunobiotherapies in -synucleinopathies. Accumulation of aggregated -synuclein can disrupt astrocyte function in general and more importantly can contribute to neurodegeneration in -synucleinopathies through various pathways. Here we summarize our current knowledge on how astrocytic -synucleinopathy affects CNS function in health and disease and propose a model of neuroglial connectome altered by -synuclein proteostasis that might be amenable to immune-based therapies. -Synuclein and astrocytes: tracing the pathways from homeostasis to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease.
