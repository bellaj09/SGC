Radiologic imaging of trauma patients often uncovers findings that are unrelated to the trauma.

We developed and evaluated an automated pipeline to identify incidental findings at sentence and section levels in radiology reports of trauma patients. Identifying incidental findings from radiology reports of trauma patients: An evaluation of automated feature representation methods.
