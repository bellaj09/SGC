For the past few years electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have gotten tremendous progress and attracted increasing attention. To broaden the application of BCIs researchers have focused on the increasement of the BCI instruction number in recent years. However with a large number of instructions the BCI calibration time will be too long to be accepted in practical usage. This study proposed a new coding method based on multifocal steady-state visual evoked potentials mfSSVEPs in which 16 targets were binary coded by 4 frequencies. Notably the training data needed for calibration corresponded to only five out of the sixteen targets. Five volunteers were recruited to test this paradigm. Task-related component analysis combined with a probabilistic model were employed for target recognition. As a result the accuracy could reach as high as 93.1% with 1s-length data. The highest information transfer rate ITR was 101.1 bits/min with an average of 73.9 bits/min. The results indicate that this new paradigm is promising to encode a large BCI instruction set with less trainings. A Multifocal SSVEPs-based Brain-Computer Interface with Less Calibration Time.
