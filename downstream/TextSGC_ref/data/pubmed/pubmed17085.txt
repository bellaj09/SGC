Two learning approaches are consistently distinguished in the literature: deep and surface learning. The deep learning approach is considered preferable.

In this study we test the hypothesis that open-book tests stimulate deep learning more than closed-book tests. "Influence of open- and closed-book tests on medical students learning approaches."
