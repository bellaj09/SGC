Oral cancer is a complex wide spread cancer which has high severity. Using advanced technology and deep learning algorithm early detection and classification are made possible. Medical imaging technique computer-aided diagnosis and detection can make potential changes in cancer treatment. In this research work we have developed a deep learning algorithm for automated computer-aided oral cancer detecting system by investigating patient hyperspectral images. Computer-assisted medical image classification for early diagnosis of oral cancer employing deep learning algorithm.
