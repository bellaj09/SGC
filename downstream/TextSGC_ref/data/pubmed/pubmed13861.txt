"Alzheimers is a disease for which there is no cure. Diagnosing Alzheimers disease AD early facilitates family planning and cost control. The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of AD using socio-demographic clinical and magnetic resonance imaging MRI data. Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate non-imagery methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies OASIS-1 cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine GBM predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender age education socioeconomic status SES and a mini-mental state exam MMSE. A residual network with 50 layers ResNet-50 predicted the clinical dementia rating CDR presence and severity from MRIs multi-class classification. The GBM achieved a mean 91.3% prediction accuracy 10-fold stratified cross validation for dichotomous CDR using socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most important feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80% training set resulted in 98.99% three class prediction accuracy on 4139 images 20% validation set at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class predication accuracy on the training set 99.34%. Machine learning methods classify AD with high accuracy. GBM models may help provide initial detection based on non-imagery analysis while ResNet-50 network models might help identify AD patients automatically prior to provider review."
