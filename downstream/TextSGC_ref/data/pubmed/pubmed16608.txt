Data suggest that the students enrolled in the training program comparing with students in the control group showed a significant improvement in their declarative knowledge of learning strategies and in their deep approach to learning consequently lowering their use of a surface approach. In spite of this in what concerns to academic achievement no statistically significant differences have been found.
