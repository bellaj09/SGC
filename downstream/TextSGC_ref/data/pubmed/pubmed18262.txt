External cephalic version ECV is associated with a moderate degree of pain. Virtual reality VR is a technology that has shown promise in offering procedural analgesia. We undertook a clinical pilot to assess the viability of VR to reduce pain during ECV. In an open randomised controlled trial RCT we randomised 50 women to either VR or standard care each 25 per group. Women receiving VR were administered VR content Skylights via a headset. Pre- and post-procedural measures of pain anxiety device experience and vital signs were measured. There were no significant differences between groups VR/no VR in pain scores 60.68 vs 49.76; p\u2009=\u20090.2 ECV success rates 80% vs 76%; p\u2009=\u20090.7 or anxiety levels. The women receiving VR had a significantly higher anticipation of pain pre-procedurally 70.0 vs 50.0; p\u2009=\u20090.03. 20 80% of the VR women indicated that they would use VR again and 22 88% indicated they would recommend it to a friend having ECV. There were no significant differences between groups for side effects encountered or changes in vital signs. We have shown that using VR during ECV is feasible and appears safe. Our results inform the design of future RCTs. A randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility of utilising virtual reality to facilitate analgesia during external cephalic version.
