Inhibition plays a powerful role in regulating network excitation and plasticity; however the activity of defined interneuron types during spatial exploration remain poorly understood. Using two-photon calcium imaging we recorded hippocampal CA1 somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as mice performed a goal-directed spatial navigation task in new visual virtual reality VR contexts. Activity in both interneuron classes was strongly suppressed but recovered as animals learned to adapt the previously learned task to the new spatial context. Surprisingly although there was a range of activity suppression across the population individual somatostatin-expressing interneurons showed consistent levels of activity modulation across exposure to multiple novel environments suggesting context-independent stable network roles during spatial exploration. This work reveals population-level temporally dynamic interneuron activity in new environments within which each interneuron shows stable and consistent activity modulation.
