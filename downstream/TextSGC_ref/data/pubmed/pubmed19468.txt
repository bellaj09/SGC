"Approach and avoidance orientations are key elements of adaptive regulation at the evaluation-behavior interface. On the one hand continuous evaluations of the world fuel approach-avoidance reactions as a function of the individuals immediate environment. On the other hand in turn these individual-environment adjustments influence evaluations. A grounded perspective of social cognition placing the sensorimotor aspects of individual-environment interactions at the core of cognition has much to offer for the understanding of evaluative processes. Despite the growing enthusiasm for a grounded view of cognition and action in the approach-avoidance literature its core principles are seldom reflected at the operationalization level. In this paper we relied on the insights of a grounded perspective to propose more encompassing operationalizations of approach-avoidance orientations and investigate their influence on evaluations. Across six studies we varied the approach-avoidance operationalizations upper-body incline upper-body posture and walking steps and incrementally considered the grounded assumptions. We failed to obtain the theorized positive effect of approach as compared to avoidance on evaluations. Interestingly further exploratory analyses on two studies conducted in Virtual Reality suggested that the more participants felt being present in the situation the more the approach-avoidance ecological actions activated the corresponding neuropsychological systems. We discuss these emergent findings in light of grounded cognition and the notion of feeling of presence."
