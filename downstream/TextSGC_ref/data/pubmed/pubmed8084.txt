Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL is the most common childhood cancer. While there are a number of well-recognized prognostic biomarkers at diagnosis the most powerful independent prognostic factor is the response of the leukemia to induction chemotherapy Campana and Pui: Blood 129 2017 1913-1918. Given the potential for machine learning to improve precision medicine we tested its capacity to monitor disease in children undergoing ALL treatment. Diagnostic and on-treatment bone marrow samples were labeled with an ALL-discriminating antibody combination and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry. Ignoring the fluorescent markers and using only features extracted from bright-field and dark-field cell images a deep learning model was able to identify ALL cells at an accuracy of >88%. This antibody-free single cell method is cheap quick and could be adapted to a simple laser-free cytometer to allow automated point-of-care testing to detect slow early responders. Adaptation to other types of leukemia is feasible which would revolutionize residual disease monitoring.  2020 The Authors.
