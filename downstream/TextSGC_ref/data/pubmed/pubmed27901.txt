We describe how upper limb amputees can be made to experience a rubber hand as part of their own body. This was accomplished by applying synchronous touches to the stump which was out of view and to the index finger of a rubber hand placed in full view 26 cm medial to the stump. This elicited an illusion of sensing touch on the artificial hand rather than on the stump and a feeling of ownership of the rubber hand developed. This effect was supported by quantitative subjective reports in the form of questionnaires behavioural data in the form of misreaching in a pointing task when asked to localize the position of the touch and physiological evidence obtained by skin conductance responses when threatening the hand prosthesis. Our findings outline a simple method for transferring tactile sensations from the stump to a prosthetic limb by tricking the brain thereby making an important contribution to the field of neuroprosthetics where a major goal is to develop artificial limbs that feel like a real parts of the body. Upper limb amputees can be induced to experience a rubber hand as their own.
