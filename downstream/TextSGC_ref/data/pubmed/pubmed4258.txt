Mild traumatic brain injury mTBI is a major public health concern. Functional MRI has reported alterations in several brain networks following mTBI. However the connectome-scale brain network changes are still unknown. In this study sixteen mTBI patients were prospectively recruited from an emergency department and followed up at 4-6 weeks after injury. Twenty-four healthy controls were also scanned twice with the same time interval. Three hundred fifty-eight brain landmarks that preserve structural and functional correspondence of brain networks across individuals were used to investigate longitudinal brain connectivity. Network-based statistic NBS analysis did not find significant difference in the group-by-time interaction and time effects. However 258 functional pairs show group differences in which mTBI patients have higher functional connectivity. Meta-analysis showed that "Action" and "Cognition" are the most affected functional domains. Categorization of connectomic signatures using multiview group-wise cluster analysis identified two patterns of functional hyperconnectivity among mTBI patients: I between the posterior cingulate cortex and the association areas of the brain and II between the occipital and the frontal lobes of the brain. Our results demonstrate that brain concussion renders connectome-scale brain network connectivity changes and the brain tends to be hyperactivated to compensate the pathophysiological disturbances.
