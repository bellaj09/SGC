Elite-standard rowers tend to use a fast-start strategy followed by an inverted parabolic-shaped speed profile in 2000-m races. This strategy is probably the best to manage energy resources during the race and maximise performance. This study investigated the use of virtual reality VR with novice rowers as a means to learn about energy management. Participants from an avatar group n = 7 were instructed to track a virtual boat on a screen whose speed was set individually to follow the appropriate to-be-learned speed profile. A control group n = 8 followed an indoor training programme. In spite of similar physiological characteristics in the groups the avatar group learned and maintained the required profile resulting in an improved performance i.e. a decrease in race duration whereas the control group did not. These results suggest that VR is a means to learn an energy-related skill and improve performance. Energy management using virtual reality improves 2000-m rowing performance.
