CRISPR/Cas9 system as the third-generation genome editing technology has been widely applied in target gene repair and gene expression regulation. Selection of appropriate sgRNA can improve the on-target knockout efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 system with high sensitivity and specificity. However when CRISPR/Cas9 system is operating unexpected cleavage may occur at some sites known as off-target. Presently a number of prediction methods have been developed to predict the off-target propensity of sgRNA at specific DNA fragments. Most of them use artificial feature extraction operations and machine learning techniques to obtain off-target scores. With the rapid expansion of off-target data and the rapid development of deep learning theory the existing prediction methods can no longer satisfy the prediction accuracy at the clinical level. Deep learning improves the ability of sgRNA off-target propensity prediction.
