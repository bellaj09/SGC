"Even though feedback is considered to play an important role in learning how to operate a brain-computer interface BCI to date no significant influence of feedback design on BCI-performance has been reported in literature. In this work we adapt a standard motor-imagery BCI-paradigm to study how BCI-performance is affected by biasing the belief subjects have on their level of control over the BCI system. Our findings indicate that subjects already capable of operating a BCI are impeded by inaccurate feedback while subjects normally performing on or close to chance level may actually benefit from an incorrect belief on their performance level. Our results imply that optimal feedback design in BCIs should take into account a subjects current skill level." Biased feedback in brain-computer interfaces.
