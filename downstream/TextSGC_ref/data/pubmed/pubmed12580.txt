In selective internal radiation therapy SIRT an accurate total liver segmentation is required for activity prescription and absorbed dose calculation. Our goal was to investigate the feasibility of using automatic liver segmentation based on a convolutional neural network CNN for CT imaging in SIRT and the ability of CNN to reduce inter-observer variability of the segmentation. Whole liver segmentation based on deep learning and manual adjustment for clinical use in SIRT.
