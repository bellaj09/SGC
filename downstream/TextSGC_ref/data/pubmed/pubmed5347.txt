Individuals with autism spectrum disorders ASD often exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD. Across both disorders observations of distributed functional abnormalities suggest aberrant large-scale brain network connectivity. Yet common and distinct network correlates of ASD and ADHD remain unidentified. Here we aimed to examine patterns of dysconnection in school-age children with ASD and ADHD and typically developing children who completed a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Shared and distinct intrinsic functional network centrality in autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
