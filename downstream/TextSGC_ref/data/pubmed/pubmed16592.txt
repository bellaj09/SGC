Real-world inverse synthetic aperture radar ISAR object recognition is a critical and challenging problem in computer vision tasks. In this article an efficient real-world ISAR object recognition method is proposed namely real-world ISAR object recognition RIOR based on deep multimodal relation learning DMRL. It cannot only handle the complex multimodal recognition problem efficiently but also exploit the relations among the features attributes labels and classes with semantic knowledge: 1 an adaptive multimodal mechanism AMM is proposed in convolutional neural network CNN to substantially promote the CNN sampling and transformation capability and significantly raise the output feature map resolutions by keeping almost all of the information; 2 deep attribute relation graph learning DARGL is proposed to jointly estimate the large numbers of heterogeneous attributes and collaboratively explore the relations among the features attributes labels and classes with common knowledge graphs; and 3 relational-regularized convolutional sparse learning RCSL is proposed to further achieve good translation invariance and improve the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are performed on two real-world ISAR datasets demonstrating that RIOR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while running quickly.
