Chronic low back pain CLBP is associated with an impaired control of transversus abdominis/internal oblique muscle TrA/IO volitionally and during anticipatory postural adjustment delay along with maladaptive reorganization of primary motor cortex M1. Specific training of deep trunk muscles and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation RPMS improve motor control. We thus tested whether RPMS over TrA/IO combined with training could promote TrA/IO motor control and decrease pain beyond the gains already reached in CLBP. Peripheral neurostimulation and specific motor training of deep abdominal muscles improve posturomotor control in chronic low back pain.
