Familial hypercholesterolemia FH is one of the most frequent diseases with monogenic inheritance. Previous data indicated that the heterozygous form occurred in 1:250 people. Based on these reports around 36000-40000 people are estimated to have FH in Hungary however there are no exact data about the frequency of the disease in our country. Therefore we initiated a cooperation with a clinical site partner company that provides modern data mining methods on the basis of medical and statistical records and we applied them to two major hospitals in the Northern Great Plain region of Hungary to find patients with a possible diagnosis of FH. Identifying patients with familial hypercholesterolemia using data mining methods in the Northern Great Plain region of Hungary.
