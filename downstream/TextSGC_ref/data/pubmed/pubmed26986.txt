"The bilateral loss of the grasp function associated with a lesion of the cervical spinal cord severely limits the affected individuals ability to live independently and return to gainful employment after sustaining a spinal cord injury SCI. Any improvement in lost or limited grasp function is highly desirable. With current neuroprostheses relevant improvements can be achieved in end users with preserved shoulder and elbow but missing hand function." Hybrid brain-computer interfaces and hybrid neuroprostheses for restoration of upper limb functions in individuals with high-level spinal cord injury.
