Although Deep learning algorithms have outperformed conventional methods in predicting the sequence specificities of DNA-protein binding they lack to consider the dependencies among nucleotides and the diverse binding lengths for different transcription factors TFs. To address the above two limitations simultaneously in this paper we propose a high-order convolutional neural network architecture HOCNN which employs a high-order encoding method to build high-order dependencies among nucleotides and a multi-scale convolutional layer to capture the motif features of different length. The experimental results on real ChIP-seq datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning method DeepBind in the motif discovery task. In addition we provide further insights about the importance of introducing additional convolutional kernels and the degeneration problem of importing high-order in the motif discovery task.
