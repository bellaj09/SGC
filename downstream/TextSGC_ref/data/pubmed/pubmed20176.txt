An Internet-based tele-operative robotic catheter operating system was designed for vascular interventional surgery to afford unskilled surgeons the opportunity to learn basic catheter/guidewire skills while allowing experienced physicians to perform surgeries cooperatively. Remote surgical procedures limited by variable transmission times for visual feedback have been associated with deterioration in operability and vascular wall damage during surgery. A virtual reality-based method of decreasing transmission time of visual feedback for a tele-operative robotic catheter operating system.
