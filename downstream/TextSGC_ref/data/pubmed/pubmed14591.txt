This paper conducts a comparative analysis of deep models in biometrics using scalogram of electrocardiogram ECG. A scalogram is the absolute value of the continuous wavelet transform coefficients of a signal. Since biometrics using ECG signals are sensitive to noise studies have been conducted by transforming signals into a frequency domain that is efficient for analyzing noisy signals. By transforming the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain using the wavelet the 1-D signal becomes a 2-D matrix and it could be analyzed at multiresolution. However this process makes signal analysis morphologically complex. This means that existing simple classifiers could perform poorly. We investigate the possibility of using the scalogram of ECG as input to deep convolutional neural networks of deep learning which exhibit optimal performance for the classification of morphological imagery. When training data is small or hardware is insufficient for training transfer learning can be used with pretrained deep models to reduce learning time and classify it well enough. In this paper AlexNet GoogLeNet and ResNet are considered as deep models of convolutional neural network. The experiments are performed on two databases for performance evaluation. Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt PTB-ECG is a well-known database while Chosun University CU-ECG is directly built for this study using the developed ECG sensor. The ResNet was 0.73%-0.27% higher than AlexNet or GoogLeNet on PTB-ECG-and the ResNet was 0.94%-0.12% higher than AlexNet or GoogLeNet on CU-ECG.
