Early detection of carotid atherosclerosis on the vessel wall VW magnetic resonance imaging MRI VW-MRI images can prevent the progression of cardiovascular disease. However the manual inspection process of the VW-MRI images is cumbersome and has low reproducibility. Therefore in this paper by using the convolutional neural networks CNNs we develop a deep morphology aided diagnosis DeepMAD network for automated segmentation of the VW of carotid artery and for automated diagnosis of the carotid atherosclerosis with the black-blood BB VW-MRI i.e. the T1-weighted MRI in a slice-by-slice manner. Deep morphology aided diagnosis network for segmentation of carotid artery vessel wall and diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis on black-blood vessel wall MRI.
