"This study aimed to analyze the ability of extracting automatically generated features using deep structured algorithms in lung nodule CT image diagnosis and compare its performance with traditional computer aided diagnosis CADx systems using hand-crafted features. All of the 1018 cases were acquired from Lung Image Database Consortium LIDC public lung cancer database. The nodules were segmented according to four radiologists markings and 13668 samples were generated by rotating every slice of nodule images. Three multichannel ROI based deep structured algorithms were designed and implemented in this study: convolutional neural network CNN deep belief network DBN and stacked denoising autoencoder SDAE. For the comparison purpose we also implemented a CADx system using hand-crafted features including density features texture features and morphological features. The performance of every scheme was evaluated by using a 10-fold cross-validation method and an assessment index of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC. The observed highest area under the curve AUC was 0.8990.018 achieved by CNN which was significantly higher than traditional CADx with the AUC=0.8480.026. The results from DBN was also slightly higher than CADx while SDAE was slightly lower. By visualizing the automatic generated features we found some meaningful detectors like curvy stroke detectors from deep structured schemes. The study results showed the deep structured algorithms with automatically generated features can achieve desirable performance in lung nodule diagnosis. With well-tuned parameters and large enough dataset the deep learning algorithms can have better performance than current popular CADx. We believe the deep learning algorithms with similar data preprocessing procedure can be used in other medical image analysis areas as well."
