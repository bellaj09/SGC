Topographic regularity is a fundamental property in brain connectivity. In this work we present a novel method for studying topographic regularity of functional connectivity based on resting-state fMRI rfMRI which is widely available and easy to acquire in large-scale studies. The main idea in our method is the incorporation of topographically regular structural connectivity for independent component analysis ICA. This is enabled by the recent development of novel tractography and tract filtering algorithms that can generate highly organized fiber bundles connecting different brain regions. By leveraging these cutting-edge tractography algorithms here we develop a kernel-regularized ICA method for the extraction of functional topography with rfMRI signals. In our experiments we use rfMRI scans of 35 unrelated right-handed subjects from the Human Connectome Project HCP to study the functional topography of the motor cortex. We first demonstrate that our method can generate functional connectivity maps with more regular topography than conventional group ICA. We also show that the components extracted by our algorithm are able to capture co-activation patterns that respect the organized topography of the motor cortex across the hemisphere. Finally we show that our method achieves improved reproducibility as compared to conventional group ICA. Kernel-Regularized ICA for Computing Functional Topography from Resting-state fMRI.
