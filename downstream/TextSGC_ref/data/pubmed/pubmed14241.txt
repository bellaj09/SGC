Bin-picking of small parcels and other textureless planar-faced objects is a common task at warehouses. A general color image-based vision-guided robot picking system requires feature extraction and goal image preparation of various objects. However feature extraction for goal image matching is difficult for textureless objects. Further prior preparation of huge numbers of goal images is impractical at a warehouse. In this paper we propose a novel depth image-based vision-guided robot bin-picking system for textureless planar-faced objects. Our method uses a deep convolutional neural network DCNN model that is trained on 15000 annotated depth images synthetically generated in a physics simulator to directly predict grasp points without object segmentation. Unlike previous studies that predicted grasp points for a robot suction hand with only one vacuum cup our DCNN also predicts optimal grasp patterns for a hand with two vacuum cups left cup on right cup on or both cups on. Further we propose a surface feature descriptor to extract surface features center position and normal and refine the predicted grasp point position removing the need for texture features for vision-guided robot control and sim-to-real modification for DCNN model training. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our system namely that a robot with 7 degrees of freedom can pick randomly posed textureless boxes in a cluttered environment with a 97.5% success rate at speeds exceeding 1000 pieces per hour.
