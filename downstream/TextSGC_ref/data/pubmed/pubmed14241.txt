Invasive ductal carcinoma cancer which invades the breast tissues by destroying the milk channels is the most common type of breast cancer in women. Approximately 80% of breast cancer patients have invasive ductal carcinoma and roughly 66.6% of these patients are older than 55\xa0years. This situation points out a powerful relationship between the type of breast cancer and progressed woman age. In this study the classification of invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer is performed by using deep learning models which is the sub-branch of artificial intelligence. In this scope convolutional neural network models and the autoencoder network model are combined. In the experiment the dataset was reconstructed by processing with the autoencoder model. The discriminative features obtained from convolutional neural network models were utilized. As a result the most efficient features were determined by using the ridge regression method and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis. The best success rate of classification was achieved as 98.59%. Consequently the proposed approach can be admitted as a successful model in the classification. Application of breast cancer diagnosis based on a combination of convolutional neural networks ridge regression and linear discriminant analysis using invasive breast cancer images processed with autoencoders.
