The disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia has been extensively tested in adults. Recent studies have reported the presence of brain disconnection in younger patients adding evidence to support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. Because of drug confounds in chronic and medicated patients it has been extremely challenging for researchers to directly investigate abnormalities in the development of connectivity and their role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to examine functional homotopy - a measure of interhemispheric connection - and its relevance to clinical symptoms in first-episode drug-nave early-onset schizophrenia EOS patients. Homotopic connectivity in drug-nave first-episode early-onset schizophrenia.
