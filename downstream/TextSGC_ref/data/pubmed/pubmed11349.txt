Breast ultrasound and computer aided diagnosis CAD has been used to classify tumors into benignancy or malignancy. However conventional CAD software has some problems such as handcrafted features are hard to design; conventional CAD systems are difficult to confirm overfitting problems etc.. In our study we propose a CAD system for tumor diagnosis using an image fusion method combined with different image content representations and ensemble different CNN architectures on US images. The CNN-based method proposed in this study includes VGGNet ResNet and DenseNet. In our private dataset there was a total of 1687 tumors that including 953 benign and 734 malignant tumors. The accuracy sensitivity specificity precision F1 score and the AUC of the proposed method were 91.10% 85.14% 95.77% 94.03% 89.36% and 0.9697 respectively. In the open dataset BUSI there was a total of 697 tumors that including 437 benign lesions 210 malignant tumors and 133 normal images. The accuracy sensitivity specificity precision F1 score and the AUC of the proposed method were 94.62% 92.31% 95.60% 90% 91.14% and 0.9711. In conclusion the results indicated different image content representations that affect the prediction performance of the CAD system more image information improves the prediction performance and the tumor shape feature can improve the diagnostic effect.
