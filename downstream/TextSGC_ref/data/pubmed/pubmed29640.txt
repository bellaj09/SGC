Wearable assistive devices have demonstrated the potential to improve mobility outcomes for individuals with disabilities and to augment healthy human performance; however these benefits depend on how effectively power is transmitted from the device to the human user. Quantifying and understanding this power transmission is challenging due to complex human-device interface dynamics that occur as biological tissues and physical interface materials deform and displace under load absorbing and returning power. Physical interface dynamics alter how robotic exosuits augment human movement: implications for optimizing wearable assistive devices.
