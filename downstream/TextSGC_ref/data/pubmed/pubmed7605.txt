We propose a novel end-to-end approach namely the semantic-containing double-level embedding Bi-LSTM model SCDE-Bi-LSTM to solve the three key problems of Q&A matching in the Chinese medical field. In the similarity calculation of the Q&A core module we propose a text similarity calculation method that contains semantic information to solve the problem that previous Q&A methods do not incorporate the deep information of a sentence into the similarity calculations. For the sentence vector representation module we present a double-level embedding sentence representation method to reduce the error caused by Chinese medical word segmentation. In addition due to the problem of the attention mechanism tending to cause backward deviation of the features we propose an improved algorithm based on Bi-LSTM in the feature extraction stage. The Q&A framework proposed in this paper not only retains important timing features but also loses low-frequency features and noise. Additionally it is applicable to different domains. To verify the framework extensive Chinese medical Q&A corpora are created. We run several state-of-the-art Q&A methods as contrastive experiments on the medical corpora and the current popular insuranceQA dataset under different performance measures. The experimental results on the medical corpora show that our framework significantly outperforms several strong baselines and achieves an improvement of top-1 accuracy of up to 14% reaching 79.15%.
