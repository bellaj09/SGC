This article reviews a growing body of research and theory in hypnosis and neuroscience that supports the empathic involvement theory EIT of hypnosis Wickramasekera II 2001; Wickramasekera II & Szlyk 2003; Wickramasekera II 2007c. The EIT is a unified transpersonal theory of hypnosis and the self which weaves together empathic elements of Dzogchen neodissociative neuroscience psychoanalytic sociocognitive and other theories by proposing that hypnotic phenomena are inherently characterized by their deep involvement with processes of empathy and the self. The EIT proposes that the experience of hypnosis is embodied in a system of neural networks in the brain that utilizes empathy-related processes adaptive resonance between perceptual input and top-down expectancies and connectionist learning algorithms to a empathically enact the affect cognition body language response expectancies social roles sensations etc. that are presented to them during hypnosis in accordance with socio-cognitive theories of hypnosis; b engage in a convergent psychophysiological relationship with another person in accordance with psychoanalytic Ericksonian and polyvagal/social engagement system theories; c alter the empathic self/other theory of mind coding of phenomenological experiences during hypnosis in accordance with aspects of the neo-dissociative and socio-cognitive traditions; and d develop an experiential understanding of the illusion of self that may lead in some people to its transcendence in accordance with Bon-Buddhist Dzogchen and transpersonal scholars. A unified definition of hypnosis is proposed based on findings in the empathic neuroscience of hypnosis as well as a working model of the neuromatrix of the self. Mysteries of hypnosis and the self are revealed by the psychology and neuroscience of empathy.
