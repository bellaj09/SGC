Data mapping plays an important role in data integration and exchanges among institutions and organizations with different data standards. However traditional rule-based approaches and machine learning methods fail to achieve satisfactory results for the data mapping problem. In this paper we propose a novel and sophisticated deep learning framework for data mapping called mixture feature embedding convolutional neural network MfeCNN. The MfeCNN model converts the data mapping task to a multiple classification problem. In the model we incorporated multimodal learning and multiview embedding into a CNN for mixture feature tensor generation and classification prediction. Multimodal features were extracted from various linguistic spaces with a medical natural language processing package. Then powerful feature embeddings were learned by using the CNN. As many as 10 classes could be simultaneously classified by a softmax prediction layer based on multiview embedding. MfeCNN achieved the best results on unbalanced data average F1 score 82.4% among the traditional state-of-the-art machine learning models and CNN without mixture feature embedding. Our model also outperformed a very deep CNN with 29 layers which took free texts as inputs. The combination of mixture feature embedding and a deep neural network can achieve high accuracy for data mapping and multiple classification.
