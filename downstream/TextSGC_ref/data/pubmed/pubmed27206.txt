People affected by severe neuro-degenerative diseases e.g. late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or locked-in syndrome eventually lose all muscular control. Thus they cannot use traditional assistive communication devices that depend on muscle control or brain-computer interfaces BCIs that depend on the ability to control gaze. While auditory and tactile BCIs can provide communication to such individuals their use typically entails an artificial mapping between the stimulus and the communication intent. This makes these BCIs difficult to learn and use. In this study we investigated the use of selective auditory attention to natural speech as an avenue for BCI communication. In this approach the user communicates by directing his/her attention to one of two simultaneously presented speakers. We used electrocorticographic ECoG signals in the gamma band 70-170 Hz to infer the identity of attended speaker thereby removing the need to learn such an artificial mapping. Our results from twelve human subjects show that a single cortical location over superior temporal gyrus or pre-motor cortex is typically sufficient to identify the attended speaker within 10 s and with 77% accuracy 50% accuracy due to chance. These results lay the groundwork for future studies that may determine the real-time performance of BCIs based on selective auditory attention to speech.
