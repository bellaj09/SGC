The effective fault diagnosis in the prognostic and health management of reciprocating compressors has been a research hotspot for a long time. The vibration signal of reciprocating compressors is nonlinear and non-stationary. However the traditional methods applied to processing such signals have three issues including separating the useful frequency bands from overlapped signals extracting fault features with strong subjectivity and processing the massive data with limited learning abilities. To address the above issues this paper which is based on the idea of deep learning proposed an intelligent fault diagnosis method combining Local Mean Decomposition LMD and the Stack Denoising Autoencoder SDAE. The vibration signal is firstly decomposed by LMD and reconstructed based on the cross-correlation criterion. The virtual noise channel is constructed to reduce the noise of the vibration signal. Then the de-noised signal is input into the trained SDAE model to learn the fault features adaptively. Finally the conditions of the reciprocating compressor valve are classified by the proposed method. The results show that classification accuracy is 92.72% under the condition of a low signal-noise ratio which is 5 percentage points higher than that of the traditional methods. This shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method for Reciprocating Compressors Based on LMD and SDAE.
