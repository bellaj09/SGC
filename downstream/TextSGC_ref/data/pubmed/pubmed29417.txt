Brain computer interface BCI is an assistive technology which decodes neurophysiological signals generated by the human brain and translates them into control signals to control external devices e.g. wheelchairs. One problem challenging noninvasive BCI technologies is the limited control dimensions from decoding movements of mainly large body parts e.g. upper and lower limbs. It has been reported that complicated dexterous functions i.e. finger movements can be decoded in electrocorticography ECoG signals while it remains unclear whether noninvasive electroencephalography EEG signals also have sufficient information to decode the same type of movements. Phenomena of broadband power increase and low-frequency-band power decrease were observed in EEG in the present study when EEG power spectra were decomposed by a principal component analysis PCA. These movement-related spectral structures and their changes caused by finger movements in EEG are consistent with observations in previous ECoG study as well as the results from ECoG data in the present study. The average decoding accuracy of 77.11% over all subjects was obtained in classifying each pair of fingers from one hand using movement-related spectral changes as features to be decoded using a support vector machine SVM classifier. The average decoding accuracy in three epilepsy patients using ECoG data was 91.28% with the similarly obtained features and same classifier. Both decoding accuracies of EEG and ECoG are significantly higher than the empirical guessing level 51.26% in all subjects p<0.05. The present study suggests the similar movement-related spectral changes in EEG as in ECoG and demonstrates the feasibility of discriminating finger movements from one hand using EEG. These findings are promising to facilitate the development of BCIs with rich control signals using noninvasive technologies. Decoding individual finger movements from one hand using human EEG signals.
