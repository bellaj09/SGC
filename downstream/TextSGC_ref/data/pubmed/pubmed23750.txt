The planar compound eye has the advantages of simple structure and no requirement for complex relay optical elements but the field of view FOV is very difficult to expand. Overcoming the limitation of FOV especially with simple structures is a great challenge for the development of planar compound eyes. Different from the existing designs that only considering refraction this article proposes a catadioptric planar compound eye based on the reflection and refraction to expand the FOV. In the proposed design the incident light from a large angle is reflected into the lenslet array by two rotationally symmetric mirrors whose surface equations are optimized by mathematical and optical softwares. The FOV of the proposed catadioptric planar compound eye theoretically can reach 96.6 which is much wider than the opening record of 70. Moreover no distortion of the imaging system can be obtained theoretically in this design. Simulation results show a linearity of better than 99% for the most of the incident angles. The verification experiments show that the FOV of the proposed device can reach 90.7 while the FOV of the corresponding planar compound eye without mirrors is 41.6. The proposed catadioptric planar compound eye has the great potential in monitoring detection and virtual reality since the FOV has been widen significantly.
