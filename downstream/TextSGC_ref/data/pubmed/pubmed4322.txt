Structure-function relationships are a fundamental principle of many naturally occurring systems. However network neuroscience research suggests that there is an imperfect link between structural connectivity and functional connectivity in the brain. Here we synthesize the current state of knowledge linking structure and function in macroscale brain networks and discuss the different types of models used to assess this relationship. We argue that current models do not include the requisite biological detail to completely predict function. Structural network reconstructions enriched with local molecular and cellular metadata in concert with more nuanced representations of functions and properties hold great potential for a truly multiscale understanding of the structure-function relationship.
