"Slow deep breathing SDB is commonly employed in the management of pain but the underlying mechanisms remain equivocal. This study sought to investigate effects of instructed breathing patterns on experimental heat pain and to explore possible mechanisms of action. In a within-subject experimental design healthy volunteers n\u202f=\u202f48 performed four breathing patterns: 1 unpaced breathing UB 2 paced breathing at the participants spontaneous breathing frequency PB 3 SDB at six breaths per minute with a high inspiration/expiration ratio SDB-H and 4 SDB at six breaths per minute with a low inspiration/expiration ratio SDB-L. During presentation of each breathing pattern participants received painful heat stimuli of three different temperatures and rated each stimulus on pain intensity. Respiration heart rate and blood pressure were recorded. Compared to UB participants reported less intense pain during each of the three instructed breathing patterns. Among the instructed breathing patterns pain did not differ between PB and SDB-H and SDB-L attenuated pain more than the PB and SDB-H patterns. The latter effect was paralleled by greater blood pressure variability and baroreflex effectiveness index during SDB-L. Cardiovascular changes did not mediate the observed effects of breathing patterns on pain. Perspective: SDB is more efficacious to attenuate pain when breathing is paced at a slow rhythm with an expiration that is long relative to inspiration but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated."
