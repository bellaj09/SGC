Purpose This study aimed to assess the effect of a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks on the balance and gait of stroke patients. Subjects Twenty stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups 10 to an experimental group that performed a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks and 10 to a control group. The control group performed a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise program. Balance was measured with the Berg Balance Scale. Gait was assessed using the Timed Up and Go Test. The paired t-test was used to compare groups before and after the experiment. The independent t-test was conducted to assess differences in the degree of change between the two groups before and after the experiment. Results Within-group comparison in the experimental group showed significant differences in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test. In a comparison between groups the differences in the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test in the experimental group appeared significant compared with the control group. Conclusion The results of the experiment indicate that a virtual reality exercise program accompanied by cognitive tasks has a positive effect on the balance and gait of stroke patients.
