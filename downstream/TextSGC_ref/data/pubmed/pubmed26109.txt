Brain-computer interface BCI systems identify brain signals through extracting features from them. In view of the limitations of the autoregressive model feature extraction method and the traditional principal component analysis to deal with the multichannel signals this paper presents a multichannel feature extraction method that multivariate autoregressive MVAR model combined with the multiple-linear principal component analysis MPCA and used for magnetoencephalography MEG signals and electroencephalograph EEG signals recognition. Firstly we calculated the MVAR model coefficient matrix of the MEG/EEG signals using this method and then reduced the dimensions to a lower one using MPCA. Finally we recognized brain signals by Bayes Classifier. The key innovation we introduced in our investigation showed that we extended the traditional single-channel feature extraction method to the case of multi-channel one. We then carried out the experiments using the data groups of IV-III and IV - I. The experimental results proved that the method proposed in this paper was feasible. A novel method of multi-channel feature extraction combining multivariate autoregression and multiple-linear principal component analysis.
