The practical utilization of soft nanocomposites as a strain mapping sensor in tactile sensors and artificial skins requires robustness for various contact conditions as well as low-cost fabrication process for large three dimensional surfaces. In this work we propose a multi-point and multi-directional strain mapping sensor based on multiwall carbon nanotube MWCNT-silicone elastomer nanocomposites and anisotropic electrical impedance tomography aEIT. Based on the anisotropic resistivity of the sensor aEIT technique can reconstruct anisotropic resistivity distributions using electrodes around the sensor boundary. This strain mapping sensor successfully estimated stretch displacements error of 0.54\u2009\u20090.53\u2009mm surface normal forces error of 0.61\u2009\u20090.62 N and multi-point contact locations error of 1.88\u2009\u20090.95\u2009mm in 30\u2009mm\u2009\u200930\u2009mm area for a planar shaped sensor and error of 4.80\u2009\u20093.05\u2009mm in 40\u2009mm\u2009\u2009110\u2009mm area for a three dimensional contoured sensor. In addition the direction of lateral stretch was also identified by reconstructing anisotropic distributions of electrical resistivity. Finally a soft human-machine interface device was demonstrated as a practical application of the developed sensor.
