Electroencephalogram EEG data from performing motor imagery are usually used to calibrate a subject-specific model in Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface MI-BCI. However the performance of MI is not directly observable by another person. Studies that attempted to address this issue in order to improve subjects with low MI performance had shown that it is feasible to use calibration data from Passive Movement PM to detect MI in healthy subjects. This study investigates the feasibility of using calibration data from PM of stroke patients to detect MI. EEG data from 2 calibration runs of MI and PM by a robotic haptic knob and 1 evaluation run of MI were collected in one session of recording from 34 hemiparetic stroke patients recruited in the clinical study. In each run 40 trials of MI or PM and 40 trials of the background rest were collected. The off-line run-to-run transfer kappa values from the calibration runs of MI PM and combined MI and PM to the evaluation run of MI were then evaluated and compared. The results showed that calibration using PM 0.392 yielded significantly lower kappa value than the calibration using MI 0.457 p=4.40e-14. The results may be due to a significant disparity between the EEG data from PM and MI in stroke subjects. Nevertheless the results showed that the calibration using both MI and PM 0.506 yielded significantly higher kappa value than the calibration using MI 0.457 p=9.54e-14. Hence the results of this study suggest a promising direction to combine calibration data from PM and MI to improve MI detection on stroke.
