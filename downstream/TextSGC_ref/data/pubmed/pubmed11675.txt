Raman spectroscopy is widely used as a fingerprint technique for molecular identification. However Raman spectra contain molecular information from multiple components and interferences from noise and instrumentation. Thus component identification using Raman spectra is still challenging especially for mixtures. In this study a novel approach entitled deep learning-based component identification DeepCID was proposed to solve this problem. Convolution neural network CNN models were established to predict the presence of components in mixtures. Comparative studies showed that DeepCID could learn spectral features and identify components in both simulated and real Raman spectral datasets of mixtures with higher accuracy and significantly lower false positive rates. In addition DeepCID showed better sensitivity when compared with the logistic regression LR with L1-regularization k-nearest neighbor kNN random forest RF and back propagation artificial neural network BP-ANN models for ternary mixture spectral datasets. In conclusion DeepCID is a promising method for solving the component identification problem in the Raman spectra of mixtures. Deep learning-based component identification for the Raman spectra of mixtures.
