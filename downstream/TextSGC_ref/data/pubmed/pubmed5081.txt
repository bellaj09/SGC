Inferring brain connectivity networks from fMRI data can take place at the Region of Interest ROI or voxel level. With most ROI-based approaches the signals from same-ROI voxels are simply averaged neglecting any inhomogeneity in each ROI and assuming that the same voxels will interact with different ROIs in a similar manner. In this paper we propose a novel method of representing ROI activity and estimating brain connectivity that takes into account the regionally-specific nature of brain activity the spatial location of concentrated activity and activity in other ROIs. The proposed method is able to integrate intrinsic regional structures into a network modelling framework which we call local activity constrained canonical correlation analysis LA-cCCA. We evaluated LA-cCCA on both simulated and real fMRI data. The simulation results demonstrated that LA-cCCA had improved accuracy of the estimated brain connectivity networks compared to the average-signal or Principal Component Analysis PCA-based correlation methods and the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA method. We further examined the performance of LA-cCCA on real fMRI data set from the Human Connectome Project. LA-cCCA outperformed the other three approaches in terms of connectivity reproducibility. The proposed method explores the potentials of regional activity representation and is a reliable model for connectivity network estimation. It may serve as a promising tool for studying both the healthy and diseased brain.
