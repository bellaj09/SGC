In an effort to reduce morbidity during minimally-invasive cardiac procedures we have recently developed an interventional technique targeted towards off-pump cardiac interventions. To compensate for the absence of direct visualization our system employs a virtual reality environment for image guidance that integrates pre-operative information with real-time intra-operative imaging and surgical tool tracking. This work focuses on enhancing intracardiac visualization and navigation by overlaying pre-operative cardiac models onto the intra-operative virtual space to display surgical targets within their specific anatomical context. Our method for integrating pre-operative data into the intra-operative environment is accurate within 5.0 mm. Thus we feel that our virtually-augmented surgical space is accurate enough to improve spatial orientation and intracardiac navigation.
