Two-dimensional 2D movement control is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces BCIs research because being able to move for example a cursor with the brain will enable patients with motor disabilities to control their environment. However it is still a challenge to continuously control 2D movement with a non-invasive BCI system. In this paper we developed a 2D cursor control with motor imagery BCI tasks allowing users to move a cursor to any position by using a combination strategy. With this strategy a user can combine multiple motor imagery tasks alternatively or simultaneously to control 2D movements. A combination strategy based brain-computer interface for two-dimensional movement control.
