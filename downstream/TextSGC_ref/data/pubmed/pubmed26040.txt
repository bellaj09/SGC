Bringing a Brain-Computer Interface BCI out of the lab one of the main problems has to be solved: to shorten the training time. Finding a solution for this problem the use of a BCI will be open not only for people who have no choice e.g. persons in a locked-in state or suffering from a degenerating nerve disease. By reducing the training time to a minimum also healthy persons will make use of the system e.g. for using this kind of control for games. For realizing such a control the post-movement beta rebound occurring after brisk feet movement was used to set up a classifier. This classifier was then used in a cue-based motor imagery system. After classifier adaptation a self-paced brain-switch based on brisk foot motor imagery MI was evaluated. Four out of six subjects showed that a post-movement beta rebound after feet MI and succeeded with a true positive rate between 69 and 89% while the positive predictive value was between 75 and 93%. Fast set-up asynchronous brain-switch based on detection of foot motor imagery in 1-channel EEG.
