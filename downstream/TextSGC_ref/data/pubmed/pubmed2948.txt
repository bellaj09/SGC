The neuroimaging community has witnessed a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery from using traditional univariate brain mapping approaches to multivariate predictive models allowing the field to move toward a translational neuroscience era. Regression-based multivariate models hereafter "predictive modeling" provide a powerful and widely used approach to predict human behavior with neuroimaging features. These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function symptom severity personality traits and emotion processing. Finally we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data longitudinal prediction external validations and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.
