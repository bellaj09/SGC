To achieve an automatic unloading of a reactor during the sherardizing process it is necessary to calculate the pose and position of the reactors in an industrial environment with various amounts of luminance and floating dust. In this study the defects of classic image processing methods and deep learning methods used for locating the reactors are first analyzed. Next an improved You Only Look OnceYOLO model is employed to find the region of interest of the handling hole and a handling hole corner detection method based on the image morphology and a Hough transform is presented. Finally the position and pose of the reactors will be obtained by establishing a 3D handling hole model according to the principle of a binocular stereo system. To test the performance of the proposed method a set of experimental systems was set up and experiments were conducted. The results indicate that the proposed location method is effective and the precision of the position recognition can be controlled to within 4.64 mm and 1.68  when the cameras are approximately 5 m away from the reactor meeting the requirements.
