RAKI is a novel fast MRI image reconstruction algorithm that has been recently proposed which gives satisfying results for highly accelerated MRI. However due to RAKI reconstruction depends on multiple convolutional neural networks implementing RAKI reconstruction is a time-consuming task. In this study we present accelerate strategies for RAKI implementation aided by GPU parallel programming. Aiming at the characteristics of RAKI we limited the iteration number of solving optimization problems in the network training stage while maintaining the reconstruction results are visually satisfying. Further more according to the independence between multiple networks we parallelized the training tasks by CPU multiprocessing which maximizes the performance by fully utilizing GPU resources. According to our experiments these efforts gave more than 60x speed up compared with conventional sequential implementation. With the ability of completing RAKI reconstruction in minutes we are able to bring RAKI into practical applications.
