Coronary computed tomographic angiography CTA is a reliable modality to detect coronary artery disease. However CTA generally overestimates stenosis severity compared with invasive angiography and angiographic stenosis does not necessarily imply hemodynamic relevance when fractional flow reserve FFR is used as reference. CTA-based FFR CT-FFR using computational fluid dynamics CFD improves the correlation with invasive FFR results but is computationally demanding. More recently a new machine-learning ML CT-FFR algorithm has been developed based on a deep learning model which can be performed on a regular workstation. In this large multicenter cohort the diagnostic performance ML-based CT-FFR was compared with CTA and CFD-based CT-FFR for detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease.
