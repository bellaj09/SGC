Fasciotomy is a life-saving procedure to treat acute compartment syndrome a surgical emergency. As fasciotomy dramatically improves wound pain it should be performed as soon as possible. Moreover delays in the use of fasciotomy can increase the rate of wound infections. Once the fasciotomy wound is infected pain control is achieved via the long-term use of opioids or anti-inflammatory analgesics. However the administration of high doses of opioids may cause complications such as respiratory depression over-sedation and constipation. Therefore treatment methods other than narcotic administration should be established to better manage the pain caused by fasciotomy wound infections. Virtual reality has recently been introduced in analgesic therapy as a replacement or complement to conventional pharmacological treatments. Its use has been extensively studied in the pain management of patients with burns. An increasing number of painful conditions are being successfully treated with virtual reality. Here we report a case of acute compartment syndrome complicated by fasciotomy wound infection. Virtual reality as a non-pharmacologic analgesic for fasciotomy wound infections in acute compartment syndrome: a case report.
