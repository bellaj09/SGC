"As a medical imaging technology which can show the metabolism of the brain 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG-positron emission tomography PET is of great value for the diagnosis of Parkinsons Disease PD. With the development of pattern recognition technology analysis of brain images using deep learning are becoming more and more popular. However existing computer-aided-diagnosis technologies often over fit and have poor generalizability. Therefore we aimed to improve a framework based on Group Lasso Sparse Deep Belief Network GLS-DBN for discriminating PD and normal control NC subjects based on FDG-PET imaging. In this study 225 NC and 125 PD cohorts from Huashan and Wuxi 904 hospitals were selected. They were divided into the training & validation dataset and 2 test datasets. First in the training & validation set subjects were randomly partitioned 80:20 with multiple training iterations for the deep learning model. Next Locally Linear Embedding was used as a dimension reduction algorithm. Then GLS-DBN was used for feature learning and classification. Different sparse DBN models were used to compare datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. Accuracy sensitivity and specificity were examined to validate the results. Output variables of the network were also correlated with longitudinal changes of rating scales about movement disorders UPDRS H&Y. As a result accuracy of prediction 90% in Test 1 86% in Test 2 for classification of PD and NC patients outperformed conventional approaches. Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with UPDRS and H&Y R = 0.705 p < 0.001; R = 0.697 p < 0.001 in Test 1; R = 0.592 p = 0.0018 R = 0.528 p = 0.0067 in Test 2. These results show the GLS-DBN is feasible method for early diagnosis of PD." "Use of Overlapping Group LASSO Sparse Deep Belief Network to Discriminate Parkinsons Disease and Normal Control."
