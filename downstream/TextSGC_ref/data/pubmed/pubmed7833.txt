"Although sciences and technology have progressed rapidly de novo drug development has been a costly and time-consuming process over the past decades. In view of these circumstances drug repurposing or drug repositioning has appeared as an alternative tool to accelerate drug development process by seeking new indications for already approved drugs rather than discovering de novo drug compounds nowadays accounting for 30% of newly marked drugs in the U.S. In the meantime the explosive and large-scale growth of molecular genomic and phenotypic data of pharmacological compounds is enabling the development of new area of drug repurposing called computational drug repurposing. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the area of computational drug repurposing. First it summarizes available repositioning strategies followed by computational methods commonly used. Then it describes validation techniques for repurposing studies. Finally it concludes by discussing the remaining challenges in computational repurposing." A review of computational drug repurposing.
