This paper introduces a new method for data analysis of animal muscle activation during locomotion. It is based on fitting Gaussian mixture models GMMs to surface EMG data sEMG. This approach enables researchers/users to isolate parts of the overall muscle activation within locomotion EMG data. Furthermore it provides new opportunities for analysis and exploration of sEMG data by using the resulting Gaussian modes as atomic building blocks for a hierarchical clustering. In our experiments composite peak models representing the general activation pattern per sensor location one sensor on the long back muscle three sensors on the gluteus muscle on each body side were identified per individual for all 14 horses during walk and trot in the present study. Hereby we show the applicability of the method to identify composite peak models which describe activation of different muscles throughout cycles of locomotion.
