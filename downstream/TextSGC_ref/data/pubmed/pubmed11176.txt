"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a deep deficit in language and social interaction accompanied by restricted stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. The use of genetic autism animal models has revealed that the alteration of the mechanisms controlling the formation and maturation of neural circuits are points of convergence for the physiopathological pathways in several types of autism. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor BDNF a key multifunctional regulator of brain development has been related to autism in several ways. However its precise role is still elusive in part due to its extremely complex posttranscriptional regulation. In order to contribute to this topic we treated prenatal rats with Valproate a well-validated model of autism to analyze BDNF levels in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. Valproate-treated rats exhibited an autism-like behavioral profile characterized by a deficit in social interaction anxiety-like behavior and repetitive behavior. In situ hybridization ISH experiments revealed that Valproate reduced BDNF mRNA especially long-3UTR-containing transcripts in specific areas of the dentate gyrus DG and CA3 regions. At the same time Valproate reduced BDNF immunoreactivity in the suprapyramidal and lucidum layers of CA3 but improved hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. The molecular changes reported here may help to explain the cognitive and behavioral signs of autism and reinforce BDNF as a potential molecular target for this neurodevelopmental disorder."
