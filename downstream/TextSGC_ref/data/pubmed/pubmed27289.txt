"In recent years various applications of brain computer interfaces BCIs have been studied. In this paper we present a hybrid BCI combining P300 and motor imagery to operate an explorer. Our system is mainly composed of a BCI mouse a BCI speller and an explorer. Through this system the user can access his computer and manipulate open close copy paste and delete files such as documents pictures music movies and so on. The system has been tested with five subjects and the experimental results show that the explorer can be successfully operated according to subjects intentions."
