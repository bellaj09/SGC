Leukemia is a lethal disease that is harmful to bone marrow and overall blood health. The classification of white blood cell images is crucial for leukemia diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to classify white blood cells by extracting discriminative information from cell segmentation and combining it with the fine-grained features. We propose a hybrid adversarial residual network with support vector machine SVM which utilizes the extracted features to improve the classification accuracy for human peripheral white cells.
