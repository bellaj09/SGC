Virtual clinical trials VCTs can satisfy the need for rigorous clinical trials by using distributed technological solutions that eliminate the need for a physical trial site. This report explores potential benefits of using virtual reality VR to provide a "virtual site" for VCTs a shared immersive hub in which VCT participants could experience elements of the trial and interact with the trial team. VR is a communication technology that has been emerging alongside the development of VCTs although they have never been merged in a substantial way. Many of the gaps within the VCT paradigm are areas in which VR excels. VR environments are standardized and precisely uniform the technology allows introduction of an almost endless set of stimuli to participants\ visual and auditory systems and VR systems are adept at capturing precise movement and behavioral data. Although VR has not yet found its way into VCTs much of the groundwork for such integration has been laid through research and technological development achieved in the past few years. Future implementation of VR within VCTs could move us from site-less trials to those with a virtual site serving as a hub for trial information provision interaction with trial representatives administration of evaluations and assessments and more. A Virtual Home for the Virtual Clinical Trial.
