The wide applications of X-ray computed tomography CT bring low-dose CT LDCT into a clinical prerequisite but reducing the radiation exposure in CT often leads to significantly increased noise and artifacts which might lower the judgment accuracy of radiologists. In this paper we put forward a domain progressive 3D residual convolution network DP-ResNet for the LDCT imaging procedure that contains three stages: sinogram domain network SD-net filtered back projection FBP and image domain network ID-net. Though both are based on the residual network structure the SD-net and ID-net provide complementary effect on improving the final LDCT quality. The experimental results with both simulated and real projection data show that this domain progressive deep-learning network achieves significantly improved performance by combing the network processing in the two domains.
