"The elastic parameters of soft tissues are important for medical diagnosis and virtual surgery simulation. In this study we propose a novel nonlinear parameter estimation method for soft tissues. Firstly an in-house data acquisition platform was used to obtain external forces and their corresponding deformation values. To provide highly precise data for estimating nonlinear parameters the measured forces were corrected using the constructed weighted combination forecasting model based on a support vector machine WCFM_SVM. Secondly a tetrahedral finite element parameter estimation model was established to describe the physical characteristics of soft tissues using the substitution parameters of Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio to avoid solving complicated nonlinear problems. To improve the robustness of our model and avoid poor local minima the initial parameters solved by a linear finite element model were introduced into the parameter estimation model. Finally a self-adapting Levenberg-Marquardt LM algorithm was presented which is capable of adaptively adjusting iterative parameters to solve the established parameter estimation model. The maximum absolute error of our WCFM_SVM model was less than 0.03\u202fNewton resulting in more accurate forces in comparison with other correction models tested. The maximum absolute error between the calculated and measured nodal displacements was less than 1.5\u202fmm demonstrating that our nonlinear parameters are precise."
