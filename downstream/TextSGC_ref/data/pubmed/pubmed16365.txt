"We report development of a PC-based virtual reality training system for hip fracture fixation that comprises a surgical simulator and an assessment component. The simulator allows hip fracture fixation to be performed on a virtual hip model using two-dimensional radiographic images to guide fracture reduction and implant placement. Ten operative scenarios with increasing complexities of fracture type are available. The face validity of the simulator was tested using a 26 item feedback questionnaire with answers on a 5 cm visual analogue scale from disagree strongly to agree strongly. Ten study participants aged 20-50 and with variable levels of surgical skills each performed six operative scenarios on the simulator before completing the questionnaire. The results showed that the simulator had good face validity with the majority of subjects stating it provided a realistic view of the operating environment median score 8.2/10 and that the three-dimensional view provided was all that was required median score 7.8/10. The subjects considered the simulator was able to test problem solving ability median score 8.0/10. These results confirm that this simulator achieves good face validity without computationally intensive touch feedback haptics. Overall this study demonstrates that non-haptic simulators have a larger role to play in virtual simulation than is currently recognised."
