In this paper a robot-assisted therapy system is presented mainly focused on the improvement of fine movements of patients with motor deficits of upper limbs. This system combines the use of a haptic device with an augmented reality environment where a kind of occupational therapy exercises are implemented. The main goal of the system is to provide an extra motivation to patients who are stimulated visually and tactilely into a scene that mixes elements of real and virtual worlds. Additionally using the norm of tracking error it is possible to quantitatively measure the performance of the patient during a therapy session likewise it is possible to obtain information such as runtime and the followed path. Development of a haptic interface for motor rehabilitation therapy using augmented reality.
