Virtual reality systems may allow for organized study of mass casualty triage systems by allowing investigators to replicate the same mass casualty incident with the same victims for a large number of rescuers. The study objectives were to develop such a virtual reality system and use it to assess the ability of trained paramedic students to triage simulated victims using two triage systems. Comparison of the SALT and Smart triage systems using a virtual reality simulator with paramedic students.
