In VR patients use a head-mounted device to experience computer-generated 360 simulated environments. Studies have shown that VR activates some of the same areas of the brain that substances activate. The science and technology of VR is evolving resulting in more affordability but the price is likely still a barrier for most treatment providers and patients. In addition applications used to treat SUDs were developed for use in research and are not currently available for public use. More rigorous studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of VR as a treatment for SUDs. Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services 576 15-19..
