Multi-sensor recordings are normally used in event-related potential ERP-based brain computer interfaces BCIs for capturing brain activities widely distributed over the cortical surface. However this may lead to an increased number of sensors for boosting classification performance as well as a complicated computational effort for optimizing/reducing sensors limiting the popularization of mobile/wearable BCIs for the end use. The localization of brain activities may help fix this issue by making useful information concentrated on relatively local brain areas thus greatly reducing the number of sensors required and computational burden arising from the sensor selection. In the present study we examined localization of brain activities for an ERP speller by using novel visual graphic stimuli to induce specific brain responses. Participants were instructed to perform a spelling task under both the graphic stimuli-based and traditional character-flashing-based ERP speller paradigms. Experimental results showed that compared to character-flashing stimuli localized brain activities concentrated over the posterior region were observed for the graphic stimuli. Classification accuracies and information transfer rates were further evaluated and compared among full- FS normal- NS and localized- LS sensor settings. Effects of PARADIGM SENSORSETTING and TRIAL LENGTH were examined by a three-way repeated measure analysis of variance ANOVA. ANOVA results showed that the graphic paradigm achieved significantly better performance under LS than those achieved by the traditional paradigm at any of the three sensor settings indicating that with visual graphic stimuli localized posterior activities were enough to drive an ERP-based speller to achieve comparable or even better performance compared to the traditional paradigm using global activities.
