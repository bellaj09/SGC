"In this work the perception of affordances was analysed in terms of cognitive neuroscience during an interactive experience in a virtual reality environment. In particular we chose a virtual reality scenario based on the Leap Motion controller: this sensor device captures the movements of the users hand and fingers which are reproduced on a computer screen by the proper software applications. For our experiment we employed a sample of 10 subjects matched by age and sex and chosen among university students. The subjects took part in motor imagery training and immersive affordance condition a virtual training with Leap Motion and a haptic training with real objects. After each training sessions the subject performed a recognition task in order to investigate event-related potential ERP components. The results revealed significant differences in the attentional components during the Leap Motion training. During Leap Motion session latencies increased in the occipital lobes which are entrusted to visual sensory; in contrast latencies decreased in the frontal lobe where the brain is mainly activated for attention and action planning."
