With the aging population and the global diabetes epidemic the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration AMD and diabetic macular edema DME diseases which are the leading causes of blindness is further increasing. Intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor anti-VEGF medications are the standard of care for their indications. Optical coherence tomography OCT as a noninvasive imaging modality plays a major part in guiding the administration of anti-VEGF therapy by providing detailed cross-sectional scans of the retina pathology. Fully automating OCT image detection can significantly decrease the tedious clinician labor and obtain a faithful pre-diagnosis from the analysis of the structural elements of the retina. Thereby we explore the use of deep transfer learning method based on the visual geometry group 16 VGG-16 network for classifying AMD and DME in OCT images accurately and automatically. Fully automated detection of retinal disorders by image-based deep learning.
