"Brain machine interfaces have the potential for restoring motor function not only in patients with amputations or lesions of efferent pathways in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves but also patients with acquired brain lesions such as strokes and tumors. In these patients the most efficient components of cortical motor systems are not available for BMI control. Here we had the opportunity to investigate the possibility of utilizing subdural electrocorticographic ECoG signals to control natural reaching movements under these circumstances. In a subject with a left arm monoparesis following resection of a recurrent glioma we found that ECoG signals recorded in remaining cortex were sufficient for decoding kinematics of natural reach movements of the nonparetic arm ipsilateral to the ECoG recordings. The relationship between the subjects ECoG signals and reach trajectory in three dimensions two of which were highly correlated was captured with a computationally simple linear model mean Pearsons r in depth dimension= 0.68 in height= 0.73 in lateral= 0.24. These results were attained with only a small subset of 7 temporal/spectral neural signal features. The small subset of neural features necessary to attain high decoding results show promise for a restorative BMI controlled solely by ipsilateral ECoG signals."
