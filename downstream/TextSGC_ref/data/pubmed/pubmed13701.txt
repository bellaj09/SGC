Even though ghost imaging GI an unconventional imaging method has received increased attention by researchers during the last decades imaging speed is still not satisfactory. Once the data-acquisition method and the system parameters are determined only the processing method has the potential to accelerate image-processing significantly. However both the basic correlation method and the compressed sensing algorithm which are often used for ghost imaging have their own problems. To overcome these challenges a novel deep learning ghost imaging method is proposed in this paper. We modified the convolutional neural network that is commonly used in deep learning to fit the characteristics of ghost imaging. This modified network can be referred to as ghost imaging convolutional neural network. Our simulations and experiments confirm that using this new method a target image can be obtained faster and more accurate at low sampling rate compared with conventional GI method.
