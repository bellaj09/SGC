We investigate the application of distributional semantics models for facilitating unsupervised extraction of biomedical terms from unannotated corpora. Term extraction is used as the first step of an ontology learning process that aims to semi-automatic annotation of biomedical concepts and relations from more than 300K PubMed titles and abstracts. We experimented with both traditional distributional semantics methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis LSA and Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA as well as the neural language models CBOW and Skip-gram from Deep Learning. The evaluation conducted concentrates on sepsis a major life-threatening condition and shows that Deep Learning models outperform LSA and LDA with much higher precision.
