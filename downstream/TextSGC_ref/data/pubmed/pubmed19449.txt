Imaging of the levator ani hiatus provides valuable information for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pelvic organ prolapse POP. This study compared measurements of levator ani hiatal volume during rest and on maximum Valsalva obtained using conventional three-dimensional 3D translabial ultrasound and virtual reality imaging. Our objectives were to establish their agreement and reliability and their relationship with prolapse symptoms and POP quantification POP-Q stage. Agreement and reliability of pelvic floor measurements during rest and on maximum Valsalva maneuver using three-dimensional translabial ultrasound and virtual reality imaging.
