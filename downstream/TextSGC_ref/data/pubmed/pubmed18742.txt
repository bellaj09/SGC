Light field displays based on integral imaging feature ultra-compact volume and freedom of the vergence-accommodation conflict for advanced virtual reality and augmented reality devices; however they currently suffer from low visual resolution. Considering that subpixels have an intrinsically tripled resolution compared with triad pixels this Letter develops a subpixel-level algorithm by recombining subpixels with relatively small raytracing errors from different elemental images. As a result based on a highly accurate image formation model the resolution of a typical system pixel size 7.8\xa0m; system thickness 4.07\xa0mm is remarkably enhanced from 8.3 to 20.0 pixels per degree for a gain of 2.41. In addition the color breakup introduced by the chromatic subpixels is largely suppressed. Resolution-enhanced light field displays by recombining subpixels across elemental images.
