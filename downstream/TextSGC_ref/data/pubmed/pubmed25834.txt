A traditional goal of neural recording with extracellular electrodes is to isolate action potential waveforms of an individual neuron. Recently in brain-computer interfaces BCIs it has been recognized that threshold crossing events of the voltage waveform also convey rich information. To date the threshold for detecting threshold crossings has been selected to preserve single-neuron isolation. However the optimal threshold for single-neuron identification is not necessarily the optimal threshold for information extraction. Here we introduce a procedure to determine the best threshold for extracting information from extracellular recordings. We apply this procedure in two distinct contexts: the encoding of kinematic parameters from neural activity in primary motor cortex M1 and visual stimulus parameters from neural activity in primary visual cortex V1. Extracellular voltage threshold settings can be tuned for optimal encoding of movement and stimulus parameters.
