"Changes in brain state that depend on various visual image stimulations have been investigated recently; however it is difficult to decode visual image information from brain signal information. Recently deep learning techniques have been applied to classify brain signals in various experiments such as motor imagery and steady state visual evoked potential. However although the deep learning model seems powerful it is understood poorly and thus can be considered a black box. Accordingly when multi-channel brain signals are trained which channels include important information is not understood clearly. In this paper we proposed a channel attention network CANet and investigated the way the deep learning network may determine which channels contain more important information that represents brainwaves characteristics and the way it may visualize that information. Using such spatial channel information we found that our proposed deep learning architecture outperforms basic approaches spatial channel information is not considered to classifying categorized images from visual evoked magnetoencephalographic MEG brain signals."
