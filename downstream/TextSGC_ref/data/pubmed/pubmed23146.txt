Innovative methods and new technologies have significantly improved the quality of our daily life. However disabled people for example those that cannot use their arms and legs anymore often cannot benefit from these developments since they cannot use their hands to interact with traditional interaction methods such as mouse or keyboard to communicate with a computer system. A brain-computer interface BCI system allows such a disabled person to control an external device via brain waves. Past research mostly dealt with static interfaces which limit users to a stationary location. However since we are living in a world that is highly mobile this paper evaluates a speller interface on a mobile phone used in a moving condition. The spelling experiments were conducted with 14 able-bodied subjects using visual flashes as the stimulus to spell 47 alphanumeric characters 38 letters and 9 numbers. This data was then used for the classification experiments. In par- ticular two research directions are pursued. The first investigates the impact of different classification algorithms and the second direction looks at the channel configuration i.e. which channels are most beneficial in terms of achieving the highest classification accuracy. The evaluation results indicate that the Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm achieves the best accuracy. Also the findings of the investigation on the channel configuration which can potentially reduce the amount of data processing on a mobile device with limited computing capacity is especially useful in mobile BCIs.
