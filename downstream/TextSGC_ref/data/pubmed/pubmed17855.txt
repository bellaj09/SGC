"Third-person perspective full-body illusions 3PP-FBI enable the manipulation through multisensory stimulation of perceived self-location. Perceived self-location is classically measured by a locomotion task. Yet as locomotion modulates various sensory signals we developed in immersive virtual reality\xa0a measure of self-location without locomotion. Tactile stimulation was applied on the back of twenty-five participants and displayed synchronously or asynchronously on an avatars back seen from behind. Participants completed the locomotion task and a novel mental imagery task in which they self-located in relation to a virtual ball approaching them. Participants self-identified with the avatar more during synchronous than asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in\xa0both tasks. This was accentuated for the mental imagery task showing a larger self-relocation toward the avatar together with higher reports of presence bi-location and disembodiment in the synchronous condition only for the mental imagery task. In conclusion the results suggest that avoiding multisensory updating during walking and using a perceptual rather than a motor task can improve measures of illusory self-location."
