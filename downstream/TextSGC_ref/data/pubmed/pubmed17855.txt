Avatar-based three-dimensional technology is a new approach to improve physical function in older adults. The aim of this study was to use three-dimensional video gaming technology in virtual reality training to improve postural balance and lower extremity strength in a population of community-dwelling older adults. The experimental group participated in the virtual reality training program for 60\xa0min twice a week for 6\xa0weeks. Both experimental and control groups were given three times for falls prevention education at the first third and fifth weeks. The experimental group showed significant improvements not only in static and dynamic postural balance but also lower extremity strength p\u2009<\u2009.05. Furthermore the experimental group was improved to overall parameters compared with the control group p\u2009<\u2009.05. Therefore three-dimensional video gaming technology might be beneficial for improving postural balance and lower extremity strength in community-dwelling older adults.
