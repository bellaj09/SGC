A cobalt sulfide/PVDFPolyvinylidene Fluoride composite was prepared by a simple blending method and the microstructure of the composite was investigated through X-ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Increased absorption properties at frequencies ranging from 2\u2009GHz to 18\u2009GHz were studied and the mechanical properties were investigated via tensile tests and finite element method simulations. The results indicated that the cobalt sulfide/PVDF composites exhibited strong microwave absorption intensities -43\u2009dB at 6.6\u2009GHz with a low filler loading 5.0\u2009wt%. The elastic modulus increased with the cobalt sulfide mass fraction. Cobalt sulfide could improve the mechanical properties of the composite especially in the lengthwise direction.
