Adult cortical areas consist of specialized cell types and circuits that support unique higher-order cognitive functions. How this regional diversity develops from an initially uniform neuroepithelium has been the subject of decades of seminal research and emerging technologies including single-cell transcriptomics provide a new perspective on area-specific molecular diversity. Here we review the early developmental processes that underlie cortical arealization including both cortex intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms as embodied by the protomap and protocortex hypotheses respectively. We propose an integrated model of serial homology whereby intrinsic genetic programs and local factors establish early transcriptomic differences between excitatory neurons destined to give rise to broad "proto-regions" and activity-dependent mechanisms lead to progressive refinement and formation of sharp boundaries between functional areas. Finally we explore the potential of these basic developmental processes to inform our understanding of the emergence of functional neural networks and circuit abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders.
