Augmented reality AR which use computer-aided projected information to augment our sense has important impact on human life especially for the elder people. However there are three major challenges regarding the optical system in the AR system which are registration vision correction and readability under strong ambient light. Here we solve three challenges simultaneously for the first time using two liquid crystal LC lenses and polarizer-free attenuator integrated in optical-see-through AR system. One of the LC lens is used to electrically adjust the position of the projected virtual image which is so-called registration. The other LC lens with larger aperture and polarization independent characteristic is in charge of vision correction such as myopia and presbyopia. The linearity of lens powers of two LC lenses is also discussed. The readability of virtual images under strong ambient light is solved by electrically switchable transmittance of the LC attenuator originating from light scattering and light absorption. The concept demonstrated in this paper could be further extended to other electro-optical devices as long as the devices exhibit the capability of phase modulations and amplitude modulations. Augmented reality with image registration vision correction and sunlight readability via liquid crystal devices.
