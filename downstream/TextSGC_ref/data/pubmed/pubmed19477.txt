With the continuous progress of virtual simulation technology medical surgery visualization system has been developed from two-dimensional to three-dimensional from digital to network and intelligentization. The visualization system with mixed reality technology will also be used in all stage of medical surgery such as case discussion surgical planning intraoperative guidance post-operative evaluation rehabilitation so as to further promote high intelligence high precision of medical surgery and consequently improve effectiveness of treatment and quality of medical service. This paper discusses the composition and technical characteristics of medical operation visualization system based on mixed reality technology and introduces some typical applications of mixed reality technology in medical operation visualization which provides a new perspective for the application of mixed technology in medical surgery. Application of Mixed Reality Technology in Visualization of Medical Operations.
