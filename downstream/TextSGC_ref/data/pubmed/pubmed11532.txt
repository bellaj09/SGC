"Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a well-established imaging technique for structural assessment of knee osteoarthritis OA particularly in a research context. Conventional MRI allows evaluation of morphological changes in osteoarthritis and advanced compositional MRI techniques enable assessment of premorphologic biochemical compositional changes of articular and periarticular tissues. Limitations of conventional radiography are well known although radiography remains the primary imaging modality applied in osteoarthritis clinical trials to date. Hybrid techniques such as PET/MRI have been introduced which may potentially supplement conventional imaging techniques. Artificial Intelligence AI such as deep learning with convolutional neural networks is becoming increasingly recognised as a supportive instrument to deepen our understanding of morphologic OA development and progression. In this narrative review article we will first give summary of current concepts and widely used MRI assessment techniques of knee osteoarthritis. We will then describe more recent and novel MRI techniques focusing primarily on publications from the last 4 years 2016-2019."
