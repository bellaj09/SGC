"2-O-methylation 2-O-me of ribose moiety is one of the significant and ubiquitous post-transcriptional RNA modifications which is vital for metabolism and functions of RNA. Although recent development of new technology Nmseq enabled biologists to find precise location of 2-O-me in RNA sequences there is still a lack of computational tools that can also provide high resolution prediction of this RNA modification. In this paper we propose a deep learning based method that takes advantage of an embedding method to learn complex feature representation of pre-mRNA sequences and employs a Convolutional Neural Network to fine-tune the features required for accurate prediction of such alteration. Specifically we adopted dna2vec a biological sequence embedding method originally inspired by the word2vec model of text analysis to yield embedded representation of sequences that may or may not contain 2-O-me sites before feeding those features into CNN for classification. Our model was trained using the data collected from Nm-seq experiment. The proposed method achieved AUC and auPRC scores of 90% outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin in both balanced and unbalanced class testing scenarios."
