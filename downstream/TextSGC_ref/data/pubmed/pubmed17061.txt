This study concerned the role of gestures that accompany discourse in deep learning processes. We assumed that co-speech gestures favor the construction of a complete mental representation of the discourse content and we tested the predictions that a discourse accompanied by gestures as compared with a discourse not accompanied by gestures should result in better recollection of conceptual information a greater number of discourse-based inferences drawn from the information explicitly stated in the discourse and poorer recognition of verbatim of the discourse. The results of three experiments confirmed these predictions. The deep versus the shallow: effects of co-speech gestures in learning from discourse.
