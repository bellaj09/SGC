Virtual reality VR enables the real-time assessment of paranoid ideation and of associated social performance. In this two-phase study we aimed to recruit a general population sample to investigate the association between trait paranoia and cognitive emotional and behavioral components of social performance. In phase 1 a general population online survey N\u2009=\u2009609 investigated how trait paranoia related to fear of negative evaluation FNE interpersonal sensitivity social avoidance and distress SAD mood and demographic characteristics. In phase 2 we piloted a new VR social situation paradigm a party in a bar with a subsample of participants who scored high or low in trait paranoia. Eighty-nine participants entered the VR party in a bar scenario to evaluate the acceptability of the task and the relationship between paranoid ideation and social performance. As hypothesized in phase 1 trait paranoia was associated with FNE SAD interpersonal sensitivity mood and demographics all small-to-medium effects; in phase 2 participants found the VR environment acceptable and immersive; exposure to the VR environment elicited a range of cognitive emotional and behavioral components of social performance; and high trait paranoia participants reported higher state paranoia and greater negative components of social performance all medium effects. The study tests a novel sample recruited predominantly online and validates the virtual environment for psychological assessment and treatment. This result suggests that the new VR scenario could be used as a psychological assessment and treatment tool for people who experience paranoia in social situations.
