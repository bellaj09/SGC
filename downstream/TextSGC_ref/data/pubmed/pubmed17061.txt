Although widely used as a pointing device on personal computers PCs the mouse was originally designed for control of two-dimensional 2D cursor movement and is not suited to complex three-dimensional 3D image manipulation. Augmented reality AR is a field of computer science that involves combining the physical world and an interactive 3D virtual world; it represents a new 3D user interface UI paradigm. A system for 3D and four-dimensional 4D image manipulation has been developed that uses optical tracking AR integrated with a smartphone remote control. The smartphone is placed in a hard case jacket with a 2D printed fiducial marker for AR on the back. It is connected to a conventional PC with an embedded Web camera by means of WiFi. The touch screen UI of the smartphone is then used as a remote control for 3D and 4D image manipulation. Using this system the radiologist can easily manipulate 3D and 4D images from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in an AR environment with high-quality image resolution. Pilot assessment of this system suggests that radiologists will be able to manipulate 3D and 4D images in the reading room in the near future.
