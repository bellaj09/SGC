Radio-based locating systems allow for a robust and continuous tracking in industrial environments and are a key enabler for the digitalization of processes in many areas such as production manufacturing and warehouse management. Time difference of arrival TDoA systems estimate the time-of-flight ToF of radio burst signals with a set of synchronized antennas from which they trilaterate accurate position estimates of mobile tags. However in industrial environments where multipath propagation is predominant it is difficult to extract the correct ToF of the signal. This article shows how deep learning DL can be used to estimate the position of mobile objects directly from the raw channel impulse responses CIR extracted at the receivers. Our experiments show that our DL-based position estimation not only works well under harsh multipath propagation but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in line-of-sight situations.
