A high percentage of Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF and Operation Enduring Freedom OEF combat veterans have been diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD during and following their respective combat tours. Virtual Reality VR treatment has been documented as an exceptional treatment for anxiety disorders and specifically for PTSD. An Office of Naval Research ONR funded pilot study completed by the Virtual Reality Medical Center and Naval Medical Center San Diego NMCSD investigated the use of Virtual Reality Graded Exposure Therapy VR-GET study with participants who had been diagnosed with PTSD following their combat deployments. A significant reduction in PTSD symptoms severity was noted. Implications for treatment with VR-GET and future research areas of investigation including the use of VR-GET with smart phones and the internet are suggested.
