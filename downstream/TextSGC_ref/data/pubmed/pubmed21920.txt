"Several researchers have proposed a new application for human augmentation which is to provide human supervision to autonomous artificial intelligence AI systems. In this paper we introduce a framework to implement this proposal which consists of using BrainComputer Interfaces BCI to influence AI computation via some of their core algorithmic components such as heuristic search. Our framework is based on a joint analysis of philosophical proposals characterising the behaviour of autonomous AI systems and recent research in cognitive neuroscience that support the design of appropriate BCI. Our framework is defined as a motivational approach which on the AI side influences the shape of the solution produced by heuristic search using a BCI motivational signal reflecting the users disposition towards the anticipated result. The actual mapping is based on a measure of prefrontal asymmetry which is translated into a non-admissible variant of the heuristic function. Finally we discuss results from a proof-of-concept experiment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS to capture prefrontal asymmetry and control the progression of AI computation of traditional heuristic search problems."
