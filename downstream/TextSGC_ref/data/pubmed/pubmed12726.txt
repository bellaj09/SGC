Deep learning has been an important topic in fault diagnosis of motor bearings which can avoid the need for extensive domain expertise and cumbersome artificial feature extraction. However existing neural networks have low fault recognition rates and low adaptability under variable load conditions. In order to solve these problems we propose a one-dimensional fusion neural network OFNN which combines Adaptive one-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks with Wide Kernel ACNN-W and Dempster-Shafer D-S evidence theory. Firstly the original vibration time-domain signals of a motor bearing acquired by two sensors are resampled. Then four frameworks of ACNN-W optimized by RMSprop are utilized to learn features adaptively and pre-classify them with Softmax classifiers. Finally the D-S evidence theory is used to comprehensively determine the class vector output by the Softmax classifiers to achieve fault detection of the bearing. The proposed method adapts to different load conditions by incorporating complementary or conflicting evidences from different sensors through experiments on the Case Western Reserve University CWRU motor bearing database. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the cross-domain adaptive ability of the model and has a better diagnostic accuracy than other existing experimental methods.
