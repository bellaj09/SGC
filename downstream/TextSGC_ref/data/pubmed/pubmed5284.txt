It is well accepted that physiological noise PN obscures the detection of neural fluctuations in resting-state functional connectivity rsFC magnetic resonance imaging. However a clear consensus for an optimal PN correction PNC methodology and how it can impact the rsFC signal characteristics is still lacking. In this study we probe the impact of three PNC methods: RETROICOR: Glover et al. 2000  ANATICOR: Jo et al. 2010  and RVTMBPM: Bianciardi et al. 2009 . Using a reading network model we systematically explore the effects of PNC optimization on sensitivity specificity and reproducibility of rsFC signals. In terms of specificity ANATICOR was found to be effective in removing local white matter WM fluctuations and also resulted in aggressive removal of expected cortical-to-subcortical functional connections. The ability of RETROICOR to remove PN was equivalent to removal of simulated random PN such that it artificially inflated the connection strength thereby decreasing sensitivity. RVTMBPM maintained specificity and sensitivity by balanced removal of vasodilatory PN and local WM nuisance edges. Another aspect of this work was exploring the effects of PNC on identifying reading group differences. Most PNC methods accounted for between-subject PN variability resulting in reduced intersession reproducibility. This effect facilitated the detection of the most consistent group differences. RVTMBPM was most effective in detecting significant group differences due to its inherent sensitivity to removing spatially structured and temporally repeating PN arising from dense vasculature. Finally results suggest that combining all three PNC resulted in "overcorrection" by removing signal along with noise.
