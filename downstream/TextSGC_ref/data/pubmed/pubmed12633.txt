"The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire R-SPQ-2F was developed in 1998 using the true score theory to measure students deep approaches DA and surface approaches SA to learning. Using Rasch analyses this study aimed to 1 validate the R-SPQ-2Fs two-factor structure and 2 explore whether the full scale FS after reverse scoring responses to SA items could measure learning approach as a uni-dimensional construct. University students N = 327 completed an online version of the R-SPQ-2F. The researchers validated the R-SPQ-2F by showing that items on the three rating scales DA SA and FS had acceptable fit; both DA and FS but not SA showed acceptable targeting function; and all three scales had acceptable reliabilities 0.74 - 0.79. The DA and SA scales not the FS satisfied the unidimensionality requirement supporting the claim that student approaches to learning are represented by DA and SA as separate constructs."
