Recent progress in biosensor technology and wearable devices has created a formidable opportunity for remote healthcare monitoring systems as well as real-time diagnosis and disease prevention. The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning SICDL as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis such as healthy vs unhealthy and detailed analysis such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease. The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis unhealthy individuals. We evaluated the proposed approach using available physiological sensor data from Physionet databases and achieved 38% energy reduction in comparison to the conventional deep learning approach.
