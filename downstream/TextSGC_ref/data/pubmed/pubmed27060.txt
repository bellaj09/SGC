"We present a system for the acquisition of EEG signals based on active electrodes and implementing a Driving Right Leg circuit DgRL. DgRL allows for single-ended amplification and analog-to-digital conversion still guaranteeing a common mode rejection in excess of 110 dB. This allows the system to acquire high-quality EEG signals essentially removing network interference for both wet and dry-contact electrodes. The front-end amplification stage is integrated on the electrode minimizing the systems sensitivity to electrode contact quality cable movement and common mode interference. The A/D conversion stage can be either integrated in the remote back-end or placed on the head as well allowing for an all-digital communication to the back-end. Noise integrated in the band from 0.5 to 100 Hz is comprised between 0.62 and 1.3 V depending on the configuration. Current consumption for the amplification and A/D conversion of one channel is 390 A. Thanks to its low noise the high level of interference suppression and its quick setup capabilities the system is particularly suitable for use outside clinical environments such as in home care brain-computer interfaces or consumer-oriented applications."
