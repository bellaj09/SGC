Electroencephalographic EEG neurofeedback training has been shown to produce plastic modulations in salience network and default mode network functional connectivity in healthy individuals. In this study we investigated whether a single session of neurofeedback training aimed at the voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm 8-12 Hz amplitude would be related to differences in EEG network oscillations functional MRI fMRI connectivity and subjective measures of state anxiety and arousal in a group of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. Plastic modulation of PTSD resting-state networks and subjective wellbeing by EEG neurofeedback.
