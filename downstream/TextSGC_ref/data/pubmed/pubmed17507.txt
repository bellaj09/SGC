We explore motion parameters more specifically gait parameters as an objective indicator to assess simulator sickness in Virtual Reality VR. We discuss the potential relationships between simulator sickness immersion and presence. We used two different camera pose position and orientation estimation methods for the evaluation of motion tasks in a large-scale VR environment: a simple model and an optimized model that allows for a more accurate and natural mapping of human senses. Participants performed multiple motion tasks walking balancing running in three conditions: a physical reality baseline condition a VR condition with the simple model and a VR condition with the optimized model. We compared these conditions with regard to the resulting sickness and gait as well as the perceived presence in the VR conditions. The subjective measures confirmed that the optimized pose estimation model reduces simulator sickness and increases the perceived presence. The results further show that both models affect the gait parameters and simulator sickness which is why we further investigated a classification approach that deals with non-linear correlation dependencies between gait parameters and simulator sickness. We argue that our approach could be used to assess and predict simulator sickness based on human gait parameters and we provide implications for future research. Sick Moves!
