When single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS is applied over the primary motor cortex M1 with sufficient intensity it evokes muscular contractions motor-evoked potentials MEPs and muscle twitches TMS-evoked movements. Participants may also report various hand sensations related to TMS but the perception elicited by TMS and its relationship to MEPs and evoked movements has not been systematically studied. Hand perceptions induced by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex.
