Cervical auscultation is a method for assessing swallowing performance. However its ability to serve as a classification tool for a practical clinical assessment method is not fully understood. In this study we utilized neural network classification methods in the form of Deep Belief networks in order to classify swallows. We specifically utilized swallows that did not result in clinically significant aspiration and classified them on whether they originated from healthy subjects or unhealthy patients. Dual-axis swallowing vibrations from 1946 discrete swallows were recorded from 55 healthy and 53 unhealthy subjects. The Fourier transforms of both signals were used as inputs to the networks of various sizes. We found that single and multi-layer Deep Belief networks perform nearly identically when analyzing only a single vibration signal. However multi-layered Deep Belief networks demonstrated approximately a 5% to 10% greater accuracy and sensitivity when both signals were analyzed concurrently indicating that higher-order relationships between these vibrations are important for classification and assessment.
