The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BNST and the laterobasal nucleus LB centromedial nucleus CM and superficial nucleus SF of the amygdala form an interconnected dynamical system whose combined activity mediates a variety of behavioral and autonomic responses in reaction to homeostatic challenges. Although previous research provided deeper insight into the structural and functional connections between these nuclei studies investigating their resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI connectivity were solely based on undirected connectivity measures. Here we used high-quality data of 391 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to estimate the effective connectivity EC between the BNST the LB CM and SF through spectral dynamic causal modeling the relation of the EC estimates with age and sex as well as their stability over time. Our results reveal a time-stable asymmetric EC structure with positive EC between all amygdala nuclei which strongly inhibited the BNST while the BNST exerted positive influence onto all amygdala nuclei. Simulation of the impulse response of the estimated system showed that this EC structure shapes partially antagonistic out of phase activity flow between the BNST and amygdala nuclei. Moreover the BNST-LB and BNST-CM EC parameters were less negative in males. In conclusion our data points toward partially separated information processing between BNST and amygdala nuclei in the resting-state.
