Somatosensory feedback is the next step in brain computer interface BCI. Here we compare three cortical stimulating array modalities for generating somatosensory percepts in BCI. We compared human subjects with either a 64-channel "mini"-electrocorticography grid mECoG; 1.2-mm diameter exposed contacts with 3-mm spacing N\u202f=\u202f1 over the hand area of primary somatosensory cortex S1 or a standard grid sECoG; 1.5-mm diameter exposed contacts with 1-cm spacing N\u202f=\u202f1 to generate artificial somatosensation through direct electrical cortical stimulation. Finally we reference data in the literature from a patient implanted with microelectrode arrays MEA placed in the S1 hand area. We compare stimulation results to assess coverage and specificity of the artificial percepts in the hand. Using the mECoG array hand mapping revealed coverage of 41.7% of the hand area versus 100% for the sECoG array and 18.8% for the MEA. On average stimulation of a single electrode corresponded to sensation reported in 4.42 boxes range 1-11 boxes for the mECoG array 19.11 boxes range 4-48 boxes for the sECoG grid and 2.3 boxes range 1-5 boxes for the MEA. Sensation in any box on average corresponded to stimulation from 2.65 electrodes range 1-5 electrodes for the mECoG grid 3.58 electrodes for the sECoG grid range 2-4 electrodes and 11.22 electrodes range 2-17 electrodes for the MEA. Based on these findings we conclude that mECoG grids provide an excellent balance between spatial cortical coverage of the hand area of S1 and high-density resolution.
