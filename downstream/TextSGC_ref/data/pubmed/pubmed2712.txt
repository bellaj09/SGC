We hypothesized that appraisal of brain connectivity may shed light on the substrate of the radiologically isolated syndrome RIS a term applied to asymptomatic subjects with brain MRI abnormalities highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. We thus used a multimodal MRI approach on the human brain by modeling measures of microstructural integrity of white matter WM tracts with those of functional connectivity FC at the level of resting state networks in RIS subjects demographically matched normal controls NC and relapsing-remitting RR MS patients also matched with RIS for brain macrostructural damage i.e. lesions and atrophy. Compared with NC in both RIS subjects and MS patients altered integrity of WM tracts was present. However RIS subjects showed at a less conservative threshold lower diffusivities than RRMS patients in distinct cerebral associative commissural projection and cerebellar WM tracts suggesting a relatively better anatomical connectivity. FC was similar in NC and RIS subjects even in the presence of important risk factors for MS spinal cord lesions oligoclonal bands and dissemination in time on MRI and increased in RRMS patients in two clinically relevant networks subserving "processing" sensorimotor and "control" working memory functions. In RIS the lack of functional reorganization in key brain networks may represent a model of "functional reserve" which may become upregulated with an adaptive or maladaptive role only at a later stage in case of occurrence of clinical deficit.
