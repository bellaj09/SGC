Tales of ghosts wraiths and other apparitions have been reported in virtually all cultures. The strange sensation that somebody is nearby when no one is actually present and cannot be seen feeling of a presence FoP is a fascinating feat of the human mind and this apparition is often covered in the literature of divinity occultism and fiction. Although it is described by neurological and psychiatric patients and healthy individuals in different situations it is not yet understood how the phenomenon is triggered by the brain. Here we performed lesion analysis in neurological FoP patients supported by an analysis of associated neurological deficits. Our data show that the FoP is an illusory own-body perception with well-defined characteristics that is associated with sensorimotor loss and caused by lesions in three distinct brain regions: temporoparietal insular and especially frontoparietal cortex. Based on these data and recent experimental advances of multisensory own-body illusions we designed a master-slave robotic system that generated specific sensorimotor conflicts and enabled us to induce the FoP and related illusory own-body perceptions experimentally in normal participants. These data show that the illusion of feeling another person nearby is caused by misperceiving the source and identity of sensorimotor tactile proprioceptive and motor signals of one\s own body. Our findings reveal the neural mechanisms of the FoP highlight the subtle balance of brain mechanisms that generate the experience of "self" and "other" and advance the understanding of the brain mechanisms responsible for hallucinations in schizophrenia. Neurological and robot-controlled induction of an apparition.
