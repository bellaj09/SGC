Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials SSVEPs have been used to quantify attention-related neural activity to visual targets. This study investigates how empirical mode decomposition EMD can improve detection accuracy and rate of SSVEPs. First the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram EEG signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions IMFs by EMD. Then IMF components accounting for SSVEPs are selected for target frequency detection. Finally target frequency is identified by two methods: Gabor transform and Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA. This study quantitatively explores the impact of EMD on the target frequency detection. Empirical results show that the EMD improves their recognition accuracy when Gabor transform is used even in a shorter Gaussian window but has little effects on the performance of the CCA. Further this study finds that harmonic responses of the target frequency can be used to enhance the SSVEP detection both for the Gabor transform and CCA. Empirical mode decomposition improves detection of SSVEP.
