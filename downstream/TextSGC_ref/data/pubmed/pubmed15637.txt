"Tumor movements should be accurately predicted to improve delivery accuracy and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure to healthy tissue during radiotherapy. The tumor movements pertaining to respiration are divided into intra-fractional variation occurring in a single treatment session and inter-fractional variation arising between different sessions. Most studies of patients respiration movements deal with intra-fractional variation. Previous studies on inter-fractional variation are hardly mathematized and cannot predict movements well due to inconstant variation. Moreover the computation time of the prediction should be reduced. To overcome these limitations we propose a new predictor for intra- and inter-fractional data variation called intra- and inter-fraction fuzzy deep learning IIFDL where FDL equipped with breathing clustering predicts the movement accurately and decreases the computation time. Through the experimental results we validated that the IIFDL improved root-mean-square error RMSE by 29.98% and prediction overshoot by 70.93% compared with existing methods. The results also showed that the IIFDL enhanced the average RMSE and overshoot by 59.73% and 83.27% respectively. In addition the average computation time of IIFDL was 1.54 ms for both intra- and inter-fractional variation which was much smaller than the existing methods. Therefore the proposed IIFDL might achieve real-time estimation as well as better tracking techniques in radiotherapy."
