Service learning is becoming a keystone of the undergraduate learning experience. At Stonehill College we implemented a service learning course called a Learning Community in Neuroscience. This course was created to complement the basic research available to Stonehill Neuroscience majors with experience in a more applied and "clinical" setting. The Neuroscience Learning Community is designed to promote a deep understanding of Neuroscience by combining traditional classroom instruction with clinical perspectives and real-life experiences. This Neuroscience Learning Community helps students translate abstract concepts within the context of neurodevelopment by providing students with contextual experience in a real-life unscripted setting. The experiential learning outside of the classroom enabled students to participate in informed discussions in the classroom especially with regard to neurodevelopmental disorders. We believe that all students taking this course gain an understanding of the importance of basic and applied Neuroscience as it relates to the individual and the community. Students also have used this concrete learning-by-doing experience to make informed decisions about career paths and choice of major.
