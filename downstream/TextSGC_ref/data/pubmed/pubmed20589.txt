Improvement of classification performance is one of the key challenges in electroencephalogram EEG based motor imagery brain-computer interface BCI. Recently sparse representation based classification SRC method has been shown to provide satisfactory classification accuracy in motor imagery classification. In this paper we aim to evaluate the performance of the SRC method in terms of not only its classification accuracy but also of its computation time. For this purpose we investigate the performance of recently developed fast L1 minimization methods for their use in SRC such as homotopy and fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm FISTA. From experimental analysis we note that the SRC method with the fast L1 minimization algorithms is shown to provide robust classification performance compared to support vector machine SVM both in time and accuracy.
