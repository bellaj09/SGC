Semantic features are common radiological traits used to characterize a lesion by a trained radiologist. These features have been recently formulated quantified on a point scale in the context of lung nodules by our group. Certain radiological semantic traits have been shown to extremely predictive of malignancy 26. Semantic traits observed by a radiologist at examination describe the nodules and the morphology of the lung nodule shape size border attachment to vessel or pleural wall location and texture etc. Deep features are numeric descriptors often obtained from a convolutional neural network CNN which are widely used for classification and recognition. Deep features may contain information about texture and shape primarily. Lately with the advancement of deep learning convolutional neural networks CNN are also being used to analyze lung nodules. In this study we relate deep features to semantic features by looking for similarity in ability to classify. Deep features were obtained using a transfer learning approach from both an ImageNet pre-trained CNN and our trained CNN architecture. We found that some of the semantic features can be represented by one or more deep features. In this process we can infer that some deep features have similar discriminatory ability as semantic features. Representation of Deep Features using Radiologist defined Semantic Features.
