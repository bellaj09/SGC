"Being able to predict who will likely experience cancer related cognitive impairment CRCI could enhance patient care and potentially reduce economic and human costs associated with this adverse event. We aimed to determine if post-treatment patient reported CRCI could also be predicted from baseline resting state fMRI in patients with breast cancer. 76 newly diagnosed patients n\u2009=\u200942 planned for chemotherapy; n\u2009=\u200934 not planned for chemotherapy and 50 healthy female controls were assessed at 3 times points T1 prior to treatment; T2 1\xa0month post chemotherapy; T3 1\xa0year after T2 and at yoked intervals for controls. Data collection included self-reported executive dysfunction memory function and psychological distress and resting state fMRI data converted to connectome matrices for each participant. Statistical analyses included linear mixed modeling independent t tests and connectome-based predictive modeling CPM. Executive dysfunction increased over time in the chemotherapy group and was stable in the other two groups p\u2009<\u20090.001. Memory function decreased over time in both patient groups compared to controls p\u2009<\u20090.001. CPM models successfully predicted executive dysfunction and memory function scores r\u2009>\u20090.31 p\u2009<\u20090.002. Support vector regression with a radial basis function SVR RBF showed the highest performance for executive dysfunction and memory function r\u2009=\u20090.68; r\u2009=\u20090.44 ps\u2009<\u20090.001. Baseline neuroimaging may be useful for predicting patient reported cognitive outcomes which could assist in identifying patients in need of surveillance and/or early intervention for treatment-related cognitive effects."
