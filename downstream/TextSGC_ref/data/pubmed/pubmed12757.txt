"Structural magnetic resonance imaging sMRI has been widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders e.g. Alzheimers disease AD due to its sensitivity to morphological changes caused by brain atrophy. Recently a few deep learning methods e.g. convolutional neural networks CNNs have been proposed to learn task-oriented features from sMRI for AD diagnosis and achieved superior performance than the conventional learning-based methods using hand-crafted features. However these existing CNN-based methods still require the pre-determination of informative locations in sMRI. That is the stage of discriminative atrophy localization is isolated to the latter stages of feature extraction and classifier construction. In this paper we propose a hierarchical fully convolutional network H-FCN to automatically identify discriminative local patches and regions in the whole brain sMRI upon which multi-scale feature representations are then jointly learned and fused to construct hierarchical classification models for AD diagnosis. Our proposed H-FCN method was evaluated on a large cohort of subjects from two independent datasets i.e. ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 demonstrating good performance on joint discriminative atrophy localization and brain disease diagnosis."
