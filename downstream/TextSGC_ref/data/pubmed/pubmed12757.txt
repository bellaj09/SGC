Recently WAC was reported as a candidate gene for intellectual disability ID based on the identification of a de novo mutation in an individual with severe ID. WAC regulates transcription-coupled histone H2B ubiquitination and has previously been implicated in the 10p12p11 contiguous gene deletion syndrome. In this study we report on 10 individuals with de novo WAC mutations which we identified through routine diagnostic exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of WAC in 2326 individuals with unexplained ID. All but one mutation was expected to lead to a loss-of-function of WAC. Clinical evaluation of all individuals revealed phenotypic overlap for mild ID hypotonia behavioral problems and distinctive facial dysmorphisms including a square-shaped face deep set eyes long palpebral fissures and a broad mouth and chin. These clinical features were also previously reported in individuals with 10p12p11 microdeletion syndrome. To investigate the role of WAC in ID we studied the importance of the Drosophila WAC orthologue CG8949 in habituation a non-associative learning paradigm. Neuronal knockdown of Drosophila CG8949 resulted in impaired learning suggesting that WAC is required in neurons for normal cognitive performance. In conclusion we defined a clinically recognizable ID syndrome caused by de novo loss-of-function mutations in WAC. Independent functional evidence in Drosophila further supported the role of WAC in ID. On the basis of our data WAC can be added to the list of ID genes with a role in transcription regulation through histone modification. De novo loss-of-function mutations in WAC cause a recognizable intellectual disability syndrome and learning deficits in Drosophila.
