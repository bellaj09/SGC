Deep brain stimulation is an effective way to treat movement disorders and a powerful research tool for exploring brain functions. This report proposes a "curved lead pathway" method for lead implantation such that a single lead can reach in sequence to any two intracranial targets. A new type of stereotaxic system for implanting a curved lead to the brain of human/primates was designed the auxiliary device needed for this method to be used in rat/mouse was fabricated and verified in rat and the Excel algorithm used for automatically calculating the necessary parameters was implemented. This "curved lead pathway" method of lead implantation may complement the current method make lead implantation for multiple targets more convenient and expand the experimental techniques of brain function research. The "curved lead pathway" method to enable a single lead to reach any two intracranial targets.
