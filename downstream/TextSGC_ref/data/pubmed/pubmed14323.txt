The purpose of this study was to examine the educational impact of an intervention the inquiry-focused textbook Integrating Concepts in Biology ICB when used in a yearlong introductory biology course sequence. Student learning was evaluated using three published instruments: 1 The Biology Concept Inventory probed depth of student mastery of fundamental concepts in organismal and cellular topics when confronting misconceptions as distractors. ICB students had higher gains in all six topic categories +43% vs. peers overall p < 0.01. 2 The Biology Card Sorting Task assessed whether students organized biological ideas more superficially as novices do or based on deeper concepts like experts. The frequency with which ICB students connected deep-concept pairs or triplets was similar to peers; but deep understanding of structure/function was much higher for pairs: 77% vs. 25% p < 0.01. 3 A content-focused Medical College Admission Test MCAT posttest compared ICB student content knowledge with that of peers from 15 prior years. Historically MCAT performance for each semester ranged from 53% to 64%; the ICB cohort scored 62% in the top quintile. Longitudinal tracking in five upper-level science courses the following year found ICB students outperformed peers in physiology 85% vs. 80% p < 0.01.
