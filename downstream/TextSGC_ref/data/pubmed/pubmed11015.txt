Magnetic resonance MR images denoising is important in medical image analysis. Denoising methods based on deep learning have shown great promise and outperform all of the other conventional methods. However deep-learning methods are limited by the number of training samples. In this article using a small sample size we applied a wider denoising neural network to MR images with Rician noise and trained several denoising models. The first model is specific to a certain noise while the other applies to a wide range of noise levels. We considered the noise range as one interval two sub-intervals three sub-intervals or even more sub-intervals to train the corresponding models. Experimental results demonstrate that for MR images the proposed deep-learning models are efficient in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio structure-similarity-index metrics and normalized mutual information. In addition for blind noise the effect of the three sub-intervals is better than that of the other sub-intervals.
