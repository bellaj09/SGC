Acquisition and reacquisition of skills is a main pillar of functional recovery after stroke. Nighttime sleep has a positive influence on motor learning in healthy individuals whereas the effect of daytime sleep on neuro-rehabilitative training and relearning of the trained skills is often neglected. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daytime sleep napping and the ability to learn a new visuomotor task in chronic stroke patients. The main hypothesis was that sleep enhances motor memory consolidation after training resulting in better motor performance after a period of daytime sleep. Thirty stroke survivors completed the study. They were randomized to one of three different conditions i wakeful resting ii short nap 10-20 min or iii long nap 50-80 min. All individuals trained the task with the contralesional stroke-impaired hand behavioral evaluation was performed after the break time wake nap and 24 h later. Patients demonstrated a significant task-related behavioral improvement throughout the training. In contrast to the main hypothesis there was no evidence for sleep-dependent motor consolidation early after the initial diurnal break or after an additional full night of sleep. In a secondary analysis the performance changes of stroke survivors were compared with those of a group of healthy older adults who performed the identical task within the same experimental setup with their non-dominant hand. Performance levels were comparable between both cohorts at all time points. Stroke-related difficulties in motor control did not impact on the degree of performance improvement through training and daytime sleep did not impact on the behavioral gains in the two groups. In summary the current study indicates that one-time daytime sleep after motor training does not influence behavioral gains. Can Daytime Napping Assist the Process of Skills Acquisition After Stroke?
