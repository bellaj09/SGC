"Biomarkers that represent the structural and functional integrity of the motor system enable us to better assess motor outcome post-stroke. The degree of overlap between the stroke lesion and corticospinal tract CST Injury is a measure of the structural integrity of the motor system whereas the left-to-right motor cortex resting state connectivity LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity is a measure of its functional integrity. CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity each individually correlate with motor outcome post-stroke but less is understood about the relationship between these biomarkers. Thus this study investigates the relationship between CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity individually and together with motor outcome. Twenty-seven participants with upper limb motor deficits post-stroke completed motor assessments and underwent MRI at one time point. CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity were derived from T1-weighted and resting state functional MRI scans respectively. We performed hierarchical multiple regression analyses to determine the contribution of each biomarker in explaining motor outcome. The interaction between CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity does not significantly contribute to the variability in motor outcome. However inclusion of both CST Injury and LM1-RM1 rs-connectivity explains more variability in motor outcome than either alone. We suggest both biomarkers provide distinct information about an individuals motor outcome." Variability in stroke motor outcome is explained by structural and functional integrity of the motor system.
