Background: Intensive adaptable and engaging telerehabilitation is needed to enhance recovery and maximize outcomes. Such services may be provided under early supported discharge or later for chronic populations. A novel virtual reality game-based telerehabilitation system was designed for individuals post-stroke to enhance their bimanual upper extremity motor function cognition and wellbeing.Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of novel therapeutic game controller and telerehabilitation system for home use.Methods: Individuals chronic post-stroke and their caregivers were recruited n = 8 + 8 for this feasibility study. One was a screen failure and seven completed 4 weeks 20 sessions of home-based therapy with or without remote monitoring. Standardized clinical outcome measures were taken pre- and post-therapy. Game performance outcomes were sampled at every session while participant and caregiver subjective evaluations were done weekly.Results: There was a 96% rate of compliance to protocol resulting in an average of 13000 total arm repetitions/week/participant. Group analysis showed significant p <.05 improvements in grasp strength effect size ES = 0.15 depression Beck Depression Inventory II ES = 0.75 and cognition Neuropsychological Assessment Battery for Executive Function ES = 0.46. Among the 49 outcome variables 36 variables 73.5% improved significantly p = .001 binomial sign test. Technology acceptance was very good with system rating by participants at 3.7/5 and by caregivers at 3.5/5.Conclusions: These findings indicate the feasibility and efficacy of the system in providing home-based telerehabilitation. The BrightBrainer system needs to be further evaluated in randomized control trials and with individuals early post-stroke. Feasibility of integrative games and novel therapeutic game controller for telerehabilitation of individuals chronic post-stroke living in the community.
