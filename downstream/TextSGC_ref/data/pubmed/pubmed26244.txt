We experimentally tested the degree that the size-weight illusion depends on perceptual conditions allowing the observer to assume that both the visual and the kinesthetic stimuli of a weight seen and lifted emanate from the same object. We expected that the degree of the illusion depended on the "realism" provided by different kinds of virtual reality VR used when the weights are seen in virtual reality and at the same time lifted in natural reality. Seeing size and feeling weight: the size-weight illusion in natural and virtual reality.
