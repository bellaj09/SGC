Non-stationarity and inherent variability of the noninvasive electroencephalogram EEG makes robust recognition of spontaneous EEG patterns challenging. Reliable modulation of EEG patterns that a BCI can robustly detect is a skill that users must learn. In this paper we present a novel online co-adaptive BCI training paradigm. The system autonomously screens users for their ability to modulate EEG patterns in a predictive way and adapts its model parameters online. Results of a supporting study in seven first-time BCI users with disability are very encouraging. Three of 7 users achieved online accuracy > 70% for 2-class BCI control after 24 minutes of training. Online performance in 6 of 7 users was significantly higher than chance level. Online control was based on one single bipolar EEG channel. Beta band activity carried most discriminant information. Our fully automatic co-adaptive online approach allows to evaluate whether user benefit from current BCI technology within a reasonable timescale. Bring mental activity into action!
