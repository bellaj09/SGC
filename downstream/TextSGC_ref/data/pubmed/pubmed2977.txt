Nervous systems are networks of neurons and brain regions that are structurally interconnected and dynamically linked in complex patterns. As mapping and recording techniques become increasingly capable of capturing neural structure and activity across widely distributed circuits and systems there is a growing need for new analysis tools and modeling approaches to make sense of these rich big data sets. Modern network science offers a way forward. Both structural and functional brain data sets can be rendered in the form of complex networks and thus become amenable for network modeling and analysis which can be carried out across scales from the micro-scale of individual neurons to the macro-scale of whole-brain recordings. In this article I sketch an overview of structural and functional brain network studies ranging from cells to systems. My emphasis will be on common themes in mapping network attributes across scales. In addition to highlighting important advances I will outline some major challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a more complete understanding of connectome networks.
