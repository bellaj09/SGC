Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle LV from cine magnetic resonance imaging MRI is an important step in the reliable assessment of cardiac function in cardiovascular disease patients. Several deep learning convolutional neural network CNN models have achieved state-of-the-art performances for LV segmentation from cine MRI. However most published deep learning methods use individual cine frames as input and process each frame separately. This approach entirely ignores an important visual clue-the dynamic cardiac motion along the temporal axis which radiologists observe closely when viewing cine MRI. To imitate the approach of experts we propose a novel U-net-based method OF-net that integrates temporal information from cine MRI into LV segmentation. Our proposed network adds the temporal dimension by incorporating an optical flow OF field to capture the cardiac motion. In addition we introduce two additional modules a LV localization module and an attention module that provide improved LV detection and segmentation accuracy respectively. We evaluated OF-net on the public Cardiac Atlas database with multicenter cine MRI data. The results showed that OF-net achieves an average perpendicular distance APD of 0.900.08 pixels and a Dice index of 0.950.03 for LV segmentation in the middle slices outperforming the classical U-net model APD 0.920.04 pixels Dice 0.940.16 p\u202f<\u202f0.05. Specifically the proposed method enhances the temporal continuity of segmentation at the apical and basal slices which are typically more difficult to segment than middle slices. Our work exemplifies the ability of CNN to "learn" from expert experience when applied to specific analysis tasks. Cine MRI analysis by deep learning of optical flow: Adding the temporal dimension.
