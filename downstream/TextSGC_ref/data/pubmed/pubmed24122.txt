"In optical systems the range of distance near the point of focus where objects are perceived sharply is referred as depth-of-field; objects outside this region are defocused and blurred. Furthermore ophthalmology studies state that the amplitude and the latency of visual evoked potentials are affected by defocusing. In this context this paper evaluates a novel setup for a steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP brain-computer interface in which two stimuli are presented together in the center of the users field of view but at different distances ensuring that if one stimulus is focused on the other one is non-focused and vice versa. The evaluationwas conductedwith eight healthy subjects who were asked to focus on just one stimulus at a time. An average accuracy rate of 0.93 was achieved for a time window of 4 s by employing well know SSVEP detection methods. Results show that distinguishable SSVEP can be elicited by the focused stimulus regardless of the non-focused one is also present in the field of view. Finally this approach allows users to send commands through a stimuli selection by focusing mechanism that does not demand neck head and/or eyeball movements."
