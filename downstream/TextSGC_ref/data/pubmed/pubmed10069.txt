Lymph node metastasis LNM is a significant prognostic factor in patients with head and neck cancer and the ability to predict it accurately is essential for treatment optimization. PET and CT imaging are routinely used for LNM identification. However uncertainties of LNM always exist especially for small size or reactive nodes. Radiomics and deep learning are the two preferred imaging-based strategies for node malignancy prediction. Radiomics models are built based on handcrafted features and deep learning can learn the features automatically. We proposed a hybrid predictive model that combines many-objective radiomics MO-radiomics and 3-dimensional convolutional neural network 3D-CNN through evidential reasoning ER approach. To build a more reliable model we proposed a new many-objective radiomics model. Meanwhile we designed a 3D-CNN that fully utilizes spatial contextual information. Finally the outputs were fused through the ER approach. To study the predictability of the two modalities three models were built for PET CT and PET& CT. The results showed that the model performed best when the two modalities were combined. Moreover we showed that the quantitative results obtained from the hybrid model were better than those obtained from MO-radiomics and 3D-CNN.
