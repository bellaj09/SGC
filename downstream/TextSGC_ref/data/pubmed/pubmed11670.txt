"Generalizability of algorithms for binary cancer vs. no cancer classification is unknown for clinically more significant multi-class scenarios where intermediate categories have different risk factors and treatment strategies. We present a system that classifies whole slide images WSI of breast biopsies into five diagnostic categories. First a saliency detector that uses a pipeline of four fully convolutional networks trained with samples from records of pathologists screenings performs multi-scale localization of diagnostically relevant regions of interest in WSI. Then a convolutional network trained from consensus-derived reference samples classifies image patches as non-proliferative or proliferative changes atypical ductal hyperplasia ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Finally the saliency and classification maps are fused for pixel-wise labeling and slide-level categorization. Experiments using 240 WSI showed that both saliency detector and classifier networks performed better than competing algorithms and the five-class slide-level accuracy of 55% was not statistically different from the predictions of 45 pathologists. We also present example visualizations of the learned representations for breast cancer diagnosis."
