"With the rapid development of deep learning technology behavior recognition based on video streams has made great progress in recent years. However there are also some problems that must be solved: 1 In order to improve behavior recognition performance the models have tended to become deeper wider and more complex. However some new problems have been introduced also such as that their real-time performance decreases; 2 Some actions in existing datasets are so similar that they are difficult to distinguish. To solve these problems the ResNet34-3DRes18 model which is a lightweight and efficient two-dimensional 2D and three-dimensional 3D fused model is constructed in this study. The model used 2D convolutional neural network 2DCNN to obtain the feature maps of input images and 3D convolutional neural network 3DCNN to process the temporal relationships between frames which made the model not only make use of 3DCNNs advantages on video temporal modeling but reduced model complexity. Compared with state-of-the-art models this method has shown excellent performance at a faster speed. Furthermore to distinguish between similar motions in the datasets an attention gate mechanism is added and a Res34-SE-IM-Net attention recognition model is constructed. The Res34-SE-IM-Net achieved 71.85% 92.196% and 36.5% top-1 accuracy The predicting label obtained from model is the largest one in the output probability vector. If the label is the same as the target label of the motion the classification is correct. respectively on the test sets of the HMDB51 UCF101 and Something-Something v1 datasets."
