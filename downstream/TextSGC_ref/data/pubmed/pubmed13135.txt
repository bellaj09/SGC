In this study we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance of convolutional neural networks CNNs and compare frequently used methods to address the issue. Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity MNIST CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling undersampling two-phase training and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ROC AUC adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that i\xa0the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; ii\xa0the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; iii\xa0oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; iv\xa0as opposed to some classical machine learning models oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; v\xa0thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest. A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks.
