Existing works in photovoltaic PV power generation focus on accurately predicting the PV power output on a forecast horizon. As the solar power generation is heavily influenced by meteorological conditions such as solar radiation the weather forecast is a critical input in the prediction performance. However the weather forecast is traditionally considered to have coarse granularity so many are compelled to use on-site meteorological sensors to complement it. However the approach involving on-site sensors has several issues. First it incurs the cost in the installation operation and management of the sensors. Second the physical model of the sensor dynamics itself can be a source of forecast errors. Third it requires an accumulation of sensory data that represent all seasonal variations which takes time to collect. In this paper we take an alternative approach to use a relatively large deep neural network DNN instead of the on-site sensors to cope with the coarse-grained weather forecast. With historical PV output power data from our grid-connected building with a rooftop PV power generation facility and the publicly available weather forecast history data we demonstrate that we can train a six-layer feedforward DNN for the day-ahead forecast. It achieves the average mean absolute error MAE of 2.9% comparable to that of the conventional model but without involing the on-site sensors.
