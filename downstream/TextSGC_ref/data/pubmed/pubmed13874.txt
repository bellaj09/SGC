Optical coherence tomography OCT images of the retina are a powerful tool for diagnosing and monitoring eye disease. However they are plagued by speckle noise which reduces image quality and reliability of assessment. This paper introduces a novel speckle reduction method inspired by the recent successes of deep learning in medical imaging. We present two versions of the network to reflect the needs and preferences of different end-users. Specifically we train a convolution neural network to denoise cross-sections from OCT volumes of healthy eyes using either 1 mean-squared error or 2 a generative adversarial network GAN with Wasserstein distance and perceptual similarity. We then interrogate the success of both methods with extensive quantitative and qualitative metrics on cross-sections from both healthy and glaucomatous eyes. The results show that the former approach provides state-of-the-art improvement in quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM and aids layer segmentation. However the latter approach which puts more weight on visual perception outperformed for qualitative comparisons based on accuracy clarity and personal preference. Overall our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of a deep learning approach to denoising OCT images while maintaining subtle details in the images.
