Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis PCA score a multivariate linear regression and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network CNN. We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers. Extracting biological age from biomedical data via deep learning: too much of a good thing?
