Virtual reality VR provides an immersive environment in which a participant can experience a feeling of presence in a virtual world. Such environments generate strong emotional and physical responses and have been used for wide-ranging applications. The ability to collect functional neuroimaging data whilst a participant is immersed in VR would represent a step change for experimental paradigms; unfortunately traditional brain imaging requires participants to remain still limiting the scope of naturalistic interaction within VR. Recently however a new type of magnetoencephalography MEG device has been developed that employs scalp-mounted optically-pumped magnetometers OPMs to measure brain electrophysiology. Lightweight OPMs coupled with precise control of the background magnetic field enables participant movement during data acquisition. Here we exploit this technology to acquire MEG data whilst a participant uses a virtual reality head-mounted display VRHMD. We show that despite increased magnetic interference from the VRHMD we were able to measure modulation of alpha-band oscillations and the visual evoked field. Moreover in a VR experiment in which a participant had to move their head to look around a virtual wall and view a visual stimulus we showed that the measured MEG signals map spatially in accordance with the known organisation of primary visual cortex. This technique could transform the type of neuroscientific experiment that can be undertaken using functional neuroimaging. Towards OPM-MEG in a virtual reality environment.
