Positron emission tomography PET suffers from severe resolution limitations which reduce its quantitative accuracy. In this paper we present a super-resolution SR imaging technique for PET based on convolutional neural networks CNNs. To facilitate the resolution recovery process we incorporate high-resolution HR anatomical information based on magnetic resonance MR imaging. We introduce the spatial location information of the input image patches as additional CNN inputs to accommodate the spatially-variant nature of the blur kernels in PET. We compared the performance of shallow 3-layer and very deep 20-layer CNNs with various combinations of the following inputs: low-resolution LR PET radial locations axial locations and HR MR. To validate the CNN architectures we performed both realistic simulation studies using the BrainWeb digital phantom and clinical studies using neuroimaging datasets. For both simulation and clinical studies the LR PET images were based on the Siemens HR+ scanner. Two different scenarios were examined in simulation: one where the target HR image is the ground-truth phantom image and another where the target HR image is based on the Siemens HRRT scanner - a high-resolution dedicated brain PET scanner. The latter scenario was also examined using clinical neuroimaging datasets. A number of factors affected relative performance of the different CNN designs examined including network depth target image quality and the resemblance between the target and anatomical images. In general however all deep CNNs outperformed classical penalized deconvolution and partial volume correction techniques by large margins both qualitatively e.g. edge and contrast recovery and quantitatively as indicated by three metrics: peak signal-to-noise-ratio structural similarity index and contrast-to-noise ratio.
