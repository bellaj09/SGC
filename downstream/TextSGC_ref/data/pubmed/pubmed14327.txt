"The Morris water maze test MWM is one of the most popular and established behavioral tests to evaluate rodents spatial learning ability. The conventional training period is around 5 days but there is no clear evidence or guidelines about the appropriate duration. In many cases the final outcome of the MWM seems predicable from previous data and their trend. So we assumed that if we can predict the final result with high accuracy the experimental period could be shortened and the burden on testers reduced. An artificial neural network ANN is a useful modeling method for datasets that enables us to obtain an accurate mathematical model. Therefore we constructed an ANN system to estimate the final outcome in MWM from the previously obtained 4 days of data in both normal mice and vascular dementia model mice. Ten-week-old male C57B1/6 mice wild type WT were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis WT-BCAS or sham-operation WT-sham. At 6 weeks after surgery we evaluated their cognitive function with MWM. Mean escape latency was significantly longer in WT-BCAS than in WT-sham. All data were collected and used as training data and test data for the ANN system. We defined a multiple layer perceptron MLP as a prediction model using an open source framework for deep learning Chainer. After a certain number of updates we compared the predicted values and actual measured values with test data. A significant correlation coefficient was derived form the updated ANN model in both WT-sham and WT-BCAS. Next we analyzed the predictive capability of human testers with the same datasets. There was no significant difference in the prediction accuracy between human testers and ANN models in both WT-sham and WT-BCAS. In conclusion deep learning method with ANN could predict the final outcome in MWM from 4 days of data with high predictive accuracy in a vascular dementia model."
