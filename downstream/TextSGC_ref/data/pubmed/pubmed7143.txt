Tumor specimens contain a variety of healthy cells as well as cancerous cells and this heterogeneity underlies resistance to various cancer therapies. But this problem has not been thoroughly investigated until recently. Meanwhile technological breakthroughs in imaging have led to an explosion of molecular and cellular profiling data from large numbers of samples and modern machine learning approaches including deep learning have been shown to produce encouraging results by finding hidden structures and make accurate predictions. In this paper we propose a Deep learning based Nucleus Classification DeepNC approach using paired histopathology and immunofluorescence images for label and demonstrate its classification prediction power. This method can solve current issue on discrepancy between genomic- or transcriptomic-based and pathology-based tumor purity estimates by improving histological evaluation. We also explain challenges in training a deep learning model for huge dataset. Deep learning based Nucleus Classification in pancreas histological images.
