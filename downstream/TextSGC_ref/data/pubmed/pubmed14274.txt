A core learning objective of undergraduate neuroscience education is an understanding of synaptic function and neurotransmission. This article presents a critical thinking activity in which students explore and evaluate neurotransmitter function at the synapse. Students analyze fictional datasets to identify fundamental processes involved in synaptic function first following evoked neurotransmitter release and then in response to two "mystery" drugs. The activity requires students to synthesize information from multiple datasets in order to interpret data and figures skills crucial to science literacy. Students\ self-reported perceptions and declarative knowledge following the activity suggest that this activity promoted critical thinking and deep learning related to synaptic function. The activity is amenable to collaborative team-based learning and can be modified for a range of undergraduate courses in neuroscience psychology and biology. Mystery Neurotransmitters! An Active Learning Activity on Synaptic Function for Undergraduate Students.
