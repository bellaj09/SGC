Computer-assisted surgical CAS planning tools are available for craniofacial surgery but are usually based on computer-aided design CAD tools that lack the ability to detect the collision of virtual objects i.e. fractured bone segments. We developed a CAS system featuring a sense of touch haptic that enables surgeons to physically interact with individual patient-specific anatomy and immerse in a three-dimensional virtual environment. In this study we evaluated initial user experience with our novel system compared to an existing CAD system. Ten surgery resident trainees received a brief verbal introduction to both the haptic and CAD systems. Users simulated mandibular fracture reduction in three clinical cases within a 15 min time limit for each system and completed a questionnaire to assess their subjective experience. We compared standard landmarks and linear and angular measurements between the simulated results and the actual surgical outcome and found that haptic simulation results were not significantly different from actual postoperative outcomes. In contrast CAD results significantly differed from both the haptic simulation and actual postoperative results. In addition to enabling a more accurate fracture repair the haptic system provided a better user experience than the CAD system in terms of intuitiveness and self-reported quality of repair.
