Rett syndrome RTT is a neurological disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms. Communication is a major area of difficulty. Use of eye tracking technology offers a potentially effective method of communication when underpinned by intact oculomotor function. In this study oculomotor function was assessed using electronystagmography ENG. However challenges were encountered when examining individuals with RTT. Challenges in evaluating the oculomotor function in individuals with Rett syndrome using electronystagmography.
