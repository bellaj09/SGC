Instrumental conditioning of EEG activity EEG-IC is a promising method for improvement and rehabilitation of cognitive functions. However it has been found that even healthy adults are not always able to learn how to regulate their brain activity during EEG-IC. In the present study the role of a neurophysiological predictor of EEG-IC learning performance the resting-state power of sensorimotor rhythm rs-SMR 12-15Hz was investigated. Resting-state sensorimotor rhythm SMR power predicts the ability to up-regulate SMR in an EEG-instrumental conditioning paradigm.
