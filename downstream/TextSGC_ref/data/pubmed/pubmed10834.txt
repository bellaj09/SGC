In emergency departments the most common cause of death associated with suspected infected patients is sepsis. In this study deep learning algorithms were used to predict the mortality of suspected infected patients in a hospital emergency department. During January 2007 and December 2013 42220 patients considered in this study were admitted to the emergency department due to suspected infection. In the present study a deep learning structure for mortality prediction of septic patients was developed and compared with several machine learning methods as well as two sepsis screening tools: the systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS and quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment qSOFA. The mortality predictions were explored for septic patients who died within 72 h and 28 days. Results demonstrated that the accuracy rate of deep learning methods especially Convolutional Neural Network plus SoftMax 87.01% in 72 h and 81.59% in 28 d exceeds that of the other machine learning methods SIRS and qSOFA. We expect that deep learning can effectively assist medical staff in early identification of critical patients.
