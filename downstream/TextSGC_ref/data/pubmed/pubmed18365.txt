With increasing complexity in electrophysiology EP procedures the use of electroanatomic mapping systems EAMS as a supplement to fluoroscopy has become common practice. This is the first study that evaluates spatial and point localization accuracy for 2 current EAMS CARTO3 Biosense Webster Diamond Bar CA USA and EnSite Velocity St. Jude Medical Inc. St. Paul MN USA and for a novel overlay guidance OG software Siemens AG Forchheim Germany in a phantom experiment. Accuracy assessment of catheter guidance technology in electrophysiology procedures: a comparison of a new 3D-based fluoroscopy navigation system to current electroanatomic mapping systems.
