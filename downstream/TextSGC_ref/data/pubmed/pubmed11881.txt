By developing sophisticated image priors or designing deeper architectures a variety of image super-resolution SR approaches have been proposed recently and achieved very promising performance. A natural question that arises is whether these methods can be reformulated into a unifying framework and whether this framework assists in SR reconstruction? In this paper we present a simple but effective single image SR method based on ensemble learning which can produce a better performance than that could be obtained from any of SR methods to be ensembled or called component super-resolvers. Based on the assumption that better component super-resolver should have larger ensemble weight when performing SR reconstruction we present a maximum a posteriori MAP estimation framework for the inference of optimal ensemble weights. Especially we introduce a reference dataset which is composed of high-resolution HR and low-resolution LR image pairs to measure the SR abilities prior knowledge of different component super-resolvers. To obtain the optimal ensemble weights we propose to incorporate the reconstruction constraint which states that the degenerated HR estimation should be equal to the LR observation one as well as the prior knowledge of ensemble weights into the MAP estimation framework. Moreover the proposed optimization problem can be solved by an analytical solution. We study the performance of the proposed method by comparing with different competitive approaches including four state-of-the-art nondeep learning-based methods four latest deep learning-based methods and one ensemble learning-based method and prove its effectiveness and superiority on some general image datasets and face image datasets.
