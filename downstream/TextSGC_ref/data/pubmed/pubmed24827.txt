Two of the most challenging problems that scientists and researchers face when they want to experiment with new cutting-edge algorithms are the time-consuming for encoding and the difficulties for linking them with other technologies and devices. In that sense this article introduces the artificial organic networks toolkit for LabVIEW AON-TL from the implementation point of view. The toolkit is based on the framework provided by the artificial organic networks technique giving it the potential to add new algorithms in the future based on this technique. Moreover the toolkit inherits both the rapid prototyping and the easy-to-use characteristics of the LabVIEW software e.g. graphical programming transparent usage of other softwares and devices built-in programming event-driven for user interfaces to make it simple for the end-user. In fact the article describes the global architecture of the toolkit with particular emphasis in the software implementation of the so-called artificial hydrocarbon networks algorithm. Lastly the article includes two case studies for engineering purposes i.e. sensor characterization and chemistry applications i.e. blood-brain barrier partitioning data model to show the usage of the toolkit and the potential scalability of the artificial organic networks technique. The development of an artificial organic networks toolkit for LabVIEW.
