"Mixed Reality MR refers to the blending of virtual content into the real world. Using MR we create contextually meaningful scenarios in which users carry out tasks encountered in the presence of visual and aural distracters. Visual distracters can include subtle ones - people walking; and more abrupt ones - cartons falling. Aural distracters can include gentle ones - fans whirring; and more aggressive ones - automobiles backfiring. The intensity of these distracters can be dynamically controlled by a therapist or software that takes into account the patients perceived level of stress. Intensity can also be controlled between experiences. For example one may increase the stress level in a subsequent session attempting to improve a persons tolerance. Assessment of progress includes psychophysical metrics stress indicators and the performance of tasks accuracy and adherence to time constraints. By accurately capturing a patients interaction with the environment in the context of simulation events we can use MR as a tool for assessment and rehabilitation planning for individuals with stress-related injuries. This paper reports on the MR environment we have developed and its efficacy realized and potential for the assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD with or without traumatic brain injury TBI."
