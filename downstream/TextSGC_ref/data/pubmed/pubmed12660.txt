Multiple sclerosis MS lesions are heterogeneous with regard to inflammation demyelination axonal injury and neuronal loss. We previously developed a diffusion basis spectrum imaging DBSI technique to better address MS lesion heterogeneity. We hypothesized that the profiles of multiple DBSI metrics can identify lesion-defining patterns. Here we test this hypothesis by combining a deep learning algorithm using deep neural network DNN with DBSI and other imaging methods. Deep learning with diffusion basis spectrum imaging for classification of multiple sclerosis lesions.
