Virtual reality VR provides interactive multimodal sensory stimuli and biofeedback and can be a powerful tool for physical and cognitive rehabilitation. However existing systems have generally not implemented realistic full-body avatars and/or a scaling of visual movement feedback. We developed a "virtual mirror" that displays a realistic full-body avatar that responds to full-body movements in all movement planes in real-time and that allows for the scaling of visual feedback on movements in real-time. The primary objective of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the ability of healthy subjects to detect scaled feedback on trunk flexion movements. Real-time modulation of visual feedback on human full-body movements in a virtual mirror: development and proof-of-concept.
