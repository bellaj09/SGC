As "the second eyes" of radiologists computer-aided diagnosis systems play a significant role in nodule detection and diagnosis for lung cancer. In this paper we aim to provide a systematic survey of state-of-the-art techniques both traditional techniques and deep learning techniques for nodule diagnosis from computed tomography images. This review first introduces the current progress and the popular structure used for nodule diagnosis. In particular we provide a detailed overview of the five major stages in the computer-aided diagnosis systems: data acquisition nodule segmentation feature extraction feature selection and nodule classification. Second we provide a detailed report of the selected works and make a comprehensive comparison between selected works. The selected papers are from the IEEE Xplore Science Direct PubMed and Web of Science databases up to December 2018. Third we discuss and summarize the better techniques used in nodule diagnosis and indicate the existing future challenges in this field such as improving the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy developing new deep learning-based diagnosis techniques building efficient feature sets fusing traditional features and deep features developing high-quality labeled databases with malignant and benign nodules and promoting the cooperation between medical organizations and academic institutions.
