Correlating electrical activity within the human brain to movement is essential for developing and refining interventions e.g. deep brain stimulation DBS to treat central nervous system disorders. It also serves as a basis for next generation brain-machine interfaces BMIs. This study highlights a new decoding strategy for capturing movement and its corresponding laterality from deep brain local field potentials LFPs. Movement decoding using neural synchronization and inter-hemispheric connectivity from deep brain local field potentials.
