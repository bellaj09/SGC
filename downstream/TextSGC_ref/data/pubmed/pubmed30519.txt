"The majority of scientific studies on consciousness have focused on vision exploring the cognitive and neural mechanisms of conscious access to visual stimuli. In parallel studies on bodily consciousness have revealed that bodily i.e. tactile proprioceptive visceral vestibular signals are the basis for the sense of self. However the role of bodily signals in the formation of visual consciousness is not well understood. Here we investigated how body-related visuo-tactile stimulation modulates conscious access to visual stimuli. We used a robotic platform to apply controlled tactile stimulation to the participants back while they viewed a dot moving either in synchrony or asynchrony with the touch on their back. Critically the dot was rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. Manipulating the visual context by presenting the dot moving on either a body form or a non-bodily object we show that: i conflict induced by synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in a body context is associated with a delayed conscious access compared to asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation ii this effect occurs only in the context of a visual body form and iii is not due to detection or response biases. The results indicate that body-related visuo-tactile conflicts impact visual consciousness by facilitating access of non-conflicting visual information to awareness and that these are sensitive to the visual context in which they are presented highlighting the interplay between bodily signals and visual experience."
