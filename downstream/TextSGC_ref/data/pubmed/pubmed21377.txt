"With the recent development of low-cost wearable electroencephalogram EEG recording systems passive brain-computer interface pBCI applications are being actively studied for a variety of application areas such as education entertainment and healthcare. Various EEG features have been employed for the implementation of pBCI applications; however it is frequently reported that some individuals have difficulty fully enjoying the pBCI applications because the dynamic ranges of their EEG features i.e. its amplitude variability over time were too small to be used in the practical applications. Conducting preliminary experiments to search for the individualized EEG features associated with different mental states can partly circumvent this issue; however these time-consuming experiments were not necessary for the majority of users whose dynamic ranges of EEG features are large enough to be used for pBCI applications. In this study we tried to predict an individual users dynamic ranges of the EEG features that are most widely employed for pBCI applications from resting-state EEG RS-EEG with the ultimate goal of identifying individuals who might need additional calibration to become suitable for the pBCI applications. We employed a machine learning-based regression model to predict the dynamic ranges of three widely used EEG features known to be associated with the brain states of valence relaxation and concentration. Our results showed that the dynamic ranges of EEG features could be predicted with normalized root mean squared errors of 0.2323 0.1820 and 0.1562 respectively demonstrating the possibility of predicting the dynamic ranges of the EEG features for pBCI applications using short resting EEG data."
