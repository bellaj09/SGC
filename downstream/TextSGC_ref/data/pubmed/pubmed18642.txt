"We investigated how performance in the real-life perceptual task of analog clock reading is influenced by the clocks orientation with respect to egocentric gravitational and visual-environmental reference frames. In Experiment 1 we designed a simple clock-reading task and found that observers reaction time to correctly tell the time depends systematically on the clocks orientation. In Experiment 2 we dissociated egocentric from environmental reference frames by having participants sit upright or lie sideways while performing the task. We found that both reference frames substantially contribute to response times in this task. In Experiment 3 we placed upright or rotated participants in an upright or rotated immersive virtual environment which allowed us to further dissociate vestibular from visual cues to the environmental reference frame. We found evidence of environmental reference frame effects only when visual and vestibular cues were aligned. We discuss the implications for the design of remote and head-mounted displays."
