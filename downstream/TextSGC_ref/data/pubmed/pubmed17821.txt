"A key area for consideration is determining how optimal conditions for learning can be created. Higher education in nursing aims to prepare students to develop their capabilities to become independent professionals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sequencing clinical practice prior to theoretical studies on students experiences of self-directed learning readiness and students approach to learning in the second year of a three-year undergraduate study program in nursing. 123 nursing students was included in the study and divided in two groups. In group A n = 60 clinical practice preceded theoretical studies. In group n = 63 theoretical studies preceded clinical practice. Learning readiness was measured using the Directed Learning Readiness Scale for Nursing Education SDLRSNE and learning process was measured using the revised two-factor version of the Study Process Questionnaire R-SPQ-2F. Students were also asked to write down their personal reflections throughout the course. By using a mixed method design the qualitative component focused on the students personal experiences in relation to the sequencing of theoretical studies and clinical practice. The quantitative component provided information about learning readiness before and after the intervention. Our findings confirm that students are sensitive and adaptable to their learning contexts and that the sequencing of courses is subordinate to a pedagogical style enhancing students deep learning approaches which needs to be incorporated in the development of undergraduate nursing programs."
