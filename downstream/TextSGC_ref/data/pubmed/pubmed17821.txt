Highly efficient tactile display devices must fulfill technical requirements for tactile stimulation all the while preserving the lightness and compactness needed for handheld operation. This paper focuses on the elaboration of highly integrated magnetic microactuators for tactile display devices. FEM simulation conception fabrication and characterization of these microactuators are presented in this paper. The current demonstrator offers a 4  4 flexible microactuator array with a resolution of 2 mm. Each actuator is composed of a Poly Dimethyl-Siloxane PDMS elastomeric membrane magnetically actuated by coil-magnet interaction. It represents a proof of concept for fully integrated MEMS tactile devices with fair actuation forces provided for a power consumption up to 100 mW per microactuator. The prototypes are destined to provide both static and dynamic tactile sensations with an optimized membrane geometry for actuation frequencies between DC and 350 Hz. On the basis of preliminary experiments this display device can offer skin stimulations for various tactile stimuli for applications in the fields of Virtual Reality or Human-Computer Interaction HCI. Moreover the elastomeric material used in this device and its global compactness offer great advantages in matter of comfort of use and capabilities of integration in haptic devices.
