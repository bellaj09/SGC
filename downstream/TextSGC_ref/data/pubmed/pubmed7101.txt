"In recent years closed-loop adaptive deep brain stimulation aDBS for Parkinsons disease PD has gained focus in the research community due to promising proof-of-concept studies showing its suitability for improving DBS therapy and ameliorating related side effects.The main challenges faced in the aDBS control problem is the presence of non-stationary/non-linear dynamics and the heterogeneity of PDs phenotype making the exploration of data-driven dynamics-aware control algorithms a promising research direction. However due to the severe safety constraints related to working with patients aDBS is a sensitive research field that requires surrogate development platforms with growing complexity as novel control algorithms are validated.With our current contribution we propose the characterization and categorization of non-stationary dynamics found in the aDBS problem. We show how knowledge about these dynamics can be embedded in a surrogate simulation environment which has been designed to support early development stages of aDBS control strategies specifically those based on reinforcement learning RL algorithms. Finally we present a comparison of representative RL methods designed to cope with the type of non-stationary dynamics found in aDBS.To allow reproducibility and encourage adoption of our approach the source code of the developed methods and simulation environment are made available online."
