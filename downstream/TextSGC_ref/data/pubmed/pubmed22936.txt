"Recognition of drivers intention from electroencephalogram EEG can be helpful in developing an in-car brain computer interface BCI systems for intelligent cars. This could be beneficial in enhancing the quality of interaction between the driver and the car to provide the response of the intelligent cars in line with drivers intention. We proposed investigating anticipation as the cognitive state leading to specific actions during car driving. An experimental protocol is designed for recording EEG from 6 subjects while driving the virtual reality driving simulator. The experimental protocol is a variant of the contingent negative variation CNV paradigm with Go and No-go conditions in driving framework. The results presented in this study support the presence of the slow cortical anticipatory potentials in EEG grand averages and also confirm the discriminability of these potentials in offline single trial classification with the average of 0.76  0.12 in area under the curve AUC."
