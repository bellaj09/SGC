Cancer bears a poisoning threat to human society. Melanoma the skin cancer originates from skin layers and penetrates deep into subcutaneous layers. There exists an extensive research in melanoma diagnosis using dermatoscopic images captured through a dermatoscope. While designing a diagnostic model for general handheld imaging systems is an emerging trend this article proposes a computer-aided decision support system for macro images captured by a general-purpose camera. General imaging conditions are adversely affected by nonuniform illumination which further affects the extraction of relevant information. To mitigate it we process an image to define a smooth illumination surface using the multistage illumination compensation approach and the infected region is extracted using the proposed multimode segmentation method. The lesion information is numerated as a feature set comprising geometry photometry border series and texture measures. The redundancy in feature set is reduced using information theory methods and a classification boundary is modeled to distinguish benign and malignant samples using support vector machine random forest neural network and fast discriminative mixed-membership-based naive Bayesian classifiers. Moreover the experimental outcome is supported by hypothesis testing and boxplot representation for classification losses. The simulation results prove the significance of the proposed model that shows an improved performance as compared with competing arts. Machine learning-based diagnosis of melanoma using macro images.
