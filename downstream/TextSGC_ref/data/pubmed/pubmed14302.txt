"We are all stressed out to read and understand our medical practice which is so vast and seems monotonous. Amidst so much tension we can still enjoy our profession if we can narrate the sequence in a different style. Poetry is one way of such expression. Poetry is a combination of knowledge and feeling. Just as we have all read Zachary Copes Surgery in Verse which correlates the disease with its signs in a different way that is poetry I have tried to use poetry in my medical practice too. We can understand as well as express better. The whole topic seems so easy once it comes in the form of poetry. Writing in a poetic form requires a thorough knowledge of the subject. Added to this are empathy and sympathy. It needs a deep sense of understanding to feel what the sufferer would feel. Imagination can take us to any part of the world and beyond however minute the structure imagined may be. This is an attempt to present poetry in medical both while learning and during practice."
