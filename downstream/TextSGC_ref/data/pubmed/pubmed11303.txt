"The main cause of death related to cancer worldwide is from hepatic cancer. Detection of hepatic cancer early using computed tomography CT could prevent millions of patients death every year. However reading hundreds or even tens of those CT scans is an enormous burden for radiologists. Therefore there is an immediate need is to read detect and evaluate CT scans automatically quickly and accurately. However liver segmentation and extraction from the CT scans is a bottleneck for any system and is still a challenging problem. In this work a deep learning-based technique that was proposed for semantic pixel-wise classification of road scenes is adopted and modified to fit liver CT segmentation and classification. The architecture of the deep convolutional encoder-decoder is named SegNet and consists of a hierarchical correspondence of encode-decoder layers. The proposed architecture was tested on a standard dataset for liver CT scans and achieved tumor accuracy of up to 99.9% in the training phase."
