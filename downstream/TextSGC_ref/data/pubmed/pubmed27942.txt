Brain-machine interface decoding algorithms need to be predicated on assumptions that are easily met outside of an experimental setting to enable a practical clinical device. Given present technological limitations there is a need for decoding algorithms which a are not dependent upon a large number of neurons for control b are adaptable to alternative sources of neuronal input such as local field potentials LFPs and c require only marginal training data for daily calibrations. Moreover practical algorithms must recognize when the user is not intending to generate a control output and eliminate poor training data. In this paper we introduce and evaluate a Bayesian maximum-likelihood estimation strategy to address the issues of isolating quality training data and self-paced control. Six animal subjects demonstrate that a multiple state classification task loosely based on the standard center-out task can be accomplished with fewer than five engaged neurons while requiring less than ten trials for algorithm training. In addition untrained animals quickly obtained accurate device control utilizing LFPs as well as neurons in cingulate cortex two non-traditional neural inputs. Use of a Bayesian maximum-likelihood classifier to generate training data for brain-machine interfaces.
