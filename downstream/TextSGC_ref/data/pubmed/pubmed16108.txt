Over the past two decades a circular form of RNA circular RNA produced through alternative splicing has become the focus of scientific studies due to its major role as a microRNA miRNA activity modulator and its association with various diseases including cancer. Therefore the detection of circular RNAs is vital to understanding their biogenesis and purpose. Prediction of circular RNA can be achieved in three steps: distinguishing non-coding RNAs from protein coding gene transcripts separating short and long non-coding RNAs and predicting circular RNAs from other long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs. However the available tools are less than 80 percent accurate for distinguishing circular RNAs from other lncRNAs due to difficulty of classification. Therefore the availability of a more accurate and fast machine learning method for the identification of circular RNAs which considers the specific features of circular RNA is essential to the development of systematic annotation. circDeep: deep learning approach for circular RNA classification from other long non-coding RNA.
