Based on the data of the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project we have computed structural connectomes of 426 human subjects in five different resolutions of 83 129 234 463 and 1015 nodes and several edge weights. The graphs are given in anatomically annotated GraphML format that facilitates better further processing and visualization. For 96 subjects the anatomically classified sub-graphs can also be accessed formed from the vertices corresponding to distinct lobes or even smaller regions of interests of the brain. For example one can easily download and study the connectomes restricted to the frontal lobes or just to the left precuneus of 96 subjects using the data. Partially directed connectomes of 423 subjects are also available for download. We also present a GitHub-deposited set of tools called the Brain Graph Tools for several processing tasks of the connectomes on the site http://braingraph.org. The braingraph.org database of high resolution structural connectomes and the brain graph tools.
