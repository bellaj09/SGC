"Kneeling is a common activity required for both occupational and cultural reasons and has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of knee disorders. While excessive contact pressure is considered to be a possible aggressor it is not clear whether and to what extent stress on the cartilage during kneeling is different from that while standing. In this study finite element models of the knee joint for both kneeling and standing positions were constructed. The results indicated differences in high-stress regions between kneeling and standing. And both the peak von-Mises stress and contact pressure on the cartilage were larger in kneeling. During kneeling the contact pressure reached 4.25 MPa under a 300 N compressive load. It then increased to 4.66 MPa at 600 N and 5.15 MPa at 1000 N. Changing the Poissons ratio of the cartilage which represents changes in compressibility caused by different loading rates was found to have an influence on the magnitude of stress."
