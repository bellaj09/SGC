This paper presents a novel method for predicting suicidal ideation from electronic health records EHR and ecological momentary assessment EMA data using deep sequential models. Both EHR longitudinal data and EMA question forms are defined by asynchronous variable length randomly sampled data sequences. In our method we model each of them with a recurrent neural network and both sequences are aligned by concatenating the hidden state of each of them using temporal marks. Furthermore we incorporate attention schemes to improve performance in long sequences and time-independent pre-trained schemes to cope with very short sequences. Using a database of 1023 patients our experimental results show that the addition of EMA records boosts the system recall to predict the suicidal ideation diagnosis from 48.13% obtained exclusively from EHR-based state-of-the-art methods to 67.78%. Additionally our method provides interpretability through the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t-SNE representation of the latent space. Furthermore the most relevant input features are identified and interpreted medically. Deep Sequential Models for Suicidal Ideation From Multiple Source Data.
