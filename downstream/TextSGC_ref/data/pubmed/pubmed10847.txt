The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the literature available on machine learning ML algorithms applied to the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection LIDC-IDRI database as a tool for the optimization of detecting lung nodules in thoracic CT scans. This systematic review was compiled according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA guidelines. Only original research articles concerning algorithms applied to the LIDC-IDRI database were included. The initial search yielded 1972 publications after removing duplicates and 41 of these articles were included in this study. The articles were divided into two subcategories describing their overall architecture. The majority of feature-based algorithms achieved an accuracy >90% compared to the deep learning DL algorithms that achieved an accuracy in the range of 82.2%97.6%. In conclusion ML and DL algorithms are able to detect lung nodules with a high level of accuracy sensitivity and specificity using ML when applied to an annotated archive of CT scans of the lung. However there is no consensus on the method applied to determine the efficiency of ML algorithms.
