To control multiple degrees of freedom MDoF upper limb prostheses pattern recognition PR of electromyogram EMG signals has been successfully applied. This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions LMIs. However amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach electroencephalograph EEG signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore 32 EEG feature extraction methods including 12 spectral domain descriptors SDDs and 20 time domain descriptors TDDs were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05\xa0\xa03.12% as against 87.03\xa0\xa02.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p\xa0<\xa00.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.
