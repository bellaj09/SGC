Virtual reality users wearing head-mounted displays can experience the illusion of walking in any direction for infinite distance while in reality they are walking a curvilinear path in physical space. This is accomplished by introducing unnoticeable rotations to the virtual environment-a technique called redirected walking. This paper gives an overview of the research that has been performed since redirected walking was first practically demonstrated 15 years ago. 15 Years of Research on Redirected Walking in Immersive Virtual Environments.
