Simulation is becoming an increasingly accepted method for training personnel for complex or high risk tasks. With the advent of modern Virtual Reality VR technology such simulations are becoming more and more immersive. One significant limitation to the advance of this science is the challenges associated with simulating the touch or feel of various tasks in conjunction with VR simulations. This work has focused on creating and assessing the feasibility of haptic technology for high fidelity surgery simulation. It has culminated in a prototypical interface device to provide tactile feedback during the simulation of complex interventional radiology procedures such as Angioplasty. This device extends state of the art motion control distributed computing processes high resolution sensors for real-time feedback and modular design techniques to accomplish these goals. The realization of the device its capabilities interfacing requirements its limitations and future extensions will be presented here. The realization of a haptic force feedback interface device for the purpose of angioplasty surgery simulation.
