"Optical systems are traditionally used for accurate recording and measurement of the real worlds appearance. Present techniques allow us to form a computer-based virtual world which is used in a variety of technical fields. The crucial issue for future applications of virtual reality is the fidelity of rendered images to real-world objects. This is strongly affected by the appearance of the rendered objects surfaces. Currently the most applied method of describing a surfaces visual appearance of spatially nonuniform surfaces is bidirectional texture function BTF. We have designed optimized built and tested a unique portable instrument based on a rotary kaleidoscope principle for BTF acquisition in situ. To the best of our knowledge such an instrument has never been used before to measure BTF of a surface. We enhanced a common static kaleidoscope by adding rotation which allows us to get a larger number of images of the sample for more combinations of illumination directions and viewing directions. This results in a higher directional and spatial resolution of measured BTF data. In this paper we focus on the optomechanical design of the rotary BTF measurement instrument and issues related to its alignment to keep the desired mechanical precision."
