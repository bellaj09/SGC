Posterior parietal cortex PPC is considered to be related to forming of motor intention. The detection of the direction intended movements and the type of intended movement is a challenging goal in neuroscience and engineering applications such as brain-computer interfacing BCI. In previous studies it has been reported that EEG signals extracted from PPC can be used to decode intended movement direction. However it is not clear whether extracted EEG signals are related to motor intention because visually evoked potential VEP which evoked by visual cue in their experiment may be included in their extracted EEG signals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of VEP mixed into extracted EEG signals. Therefore experiments with not only visual but also tactile cues were conducted. EEG components that could be related to PPC were extracted by using independent component analysis ICA. We compared event related potential ERP waveforms between two experiments. In the result ERP waveforms of the experiment with tactile cue were significantly different from that of the experiment with visual cue. This result suggests that VEP was included in the EEG signals extracted from PPC in the experiment with visual cue.
