This paper presents a benchmark steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP dataset acquired with a 40-target brain- computer interface BCI speller. The dataset consists of 64-channel Electroencephalogram EEG data from 35 healthy subjects 8 experienced and 27 nave while they performed a cue-guided target selecting task. The virtual keyboard of the speller was composed of 40 visual flickers which were coded using a joint frequency and phase modulation JFPM approach. The stimulation frequencies ranged from 8 Hz to 15.8 Hz with an interval of 0.2 Hz. The phase difference between two adjacent frequencies was . For each subject the data included six blocks of 40 trials corresponding to all 40 flickers indicated by a visual cue in a random order. The stimulation duration in each trial was five seconds. The dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset to compare the methods for stimulus coding and target identification in SSVEP-based BCIs. Through offline simulation the dataset can be used to design new system diagrams and evaluate their BCI performance without collecting any new data. The dataset also provides high-quality data for computational modeling of SSVEPs. The dataset is freely available fromhttp://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.
