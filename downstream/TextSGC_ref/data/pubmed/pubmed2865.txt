Estimating the functional interactions and connections between brain regions to corresponding process in cognitive behavioral and psychiatric domains is a central pursuit for understanding the human connectome. Few studies have examined the effects of dynamic evolution on cognitive processing and brain activation using brain network model in scalp electroencephalography EEG data. Aim of this study was to investigate the brain functional connectivity and construct dynamic programing model from EEG data and to evaluate a possible correlation between topological characteristics of the brain connectivity and cognitive evolution processing. Here functional connectivity between brain regions is defined as the statistical dependence between EEG signals in different brain areas and is typically determined by calculating the relationship between regional time series using wavelet coherence. We present an accelerated dynamic programing algorithm to construct dynamic cognitive model that we found that spatially distributed regions coherence connection difference the topologic characteristics with which they can transfer information producing temporary network states. Our findings suggest that brain dynamics give rise to variations in complex network properties over time after variation audio stimulation dynamic programing model gives the dynamic evolution processing at different time and frequency. In this paper by applying a new construct approach to understand whole brain network dynamics firstly brain network is constructed by wavelet coherence secondly different time active brain regions are selected by network topological characteristics and minimum spanning tree. Finally dynamic evolution model is constructed to understand cognitive process by dynamic programing algorithm this model is applied to the auditory experiment results showed that quantitatively more correlation was observed after variation audio stimulation the EEG function connection dynamic evolution model on cognitive processing is feasible with wavelet coherence EEG recording. The research of constructing dynamic cognition model based on brain network.
