Over long timescales neuronal dynamics can be robust to quite large perturbations such as changes in white matter connectivity and grey matter structure through processes including learning aging development and certain disease processes. One possible explanation is that robust dynamics are facilitated by homeostatic mechanisms that can dynamically rebalance brain networks. In this study we simulate a cortical brain network using the Wilson-Cowan neural mass model with conduction delays and noise and use inhibitory synaptic plasticity ISP to dynamically achieve a spatially local balance between excitation and inhibition. Using MEG data from 55 subjects we find that ISP enables us to simultaneously achieve high correlation with multiple measures of functional connectivity including amplitude envelope correlation and phase locking. Further we find that ISP successfully achieves local E/I balance and can consistently predict the functional connectivity computed from real MEG data for a much wider range of model parameters than is possible with a model without ISP.
