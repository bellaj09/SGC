When the sensory-motor integration system is malfunctioning provokes a wide variety of neurological disorders which in many cases cannot be treated with conventional medication or via existing therapeutic technology. A brain-computer interface BCI is a tool that permits to reintegrate the sensory-motor loop accessing directly to brain information. A potential promising and quite investigated application of BCI has been in the motor rehabilitation field. It is well-known that motor deficits are the major disability wherewith the worldwide population lives. Therefore this paper aims to specify the foundation of motor rehabilitation BCIs as well as to review the recent research conducted so far specifically from 2007 to date in order to evaluate the suitability and reliability of this technology. Although BCI for post-stroke rehabilitation is still in its infancy the tendency is towards the development of implantable devices that encompass a BCI module plus a stimulation system.
