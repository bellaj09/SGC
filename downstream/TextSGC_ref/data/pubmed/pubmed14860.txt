Accurate segmentation of the iris area in input images has a significant effect on the accuracy of iris recognition and is a very important preprocessing step in the overall iris recognition process. In previous studies on iris recognition however the accuracy of iris segmentation was reduced when the images of captured irises were of low quality due to problems such as optical and motion blurring thick eyelashes and light reflected from eyeglasses. Deep learning-based iris segmentation has been proposed to improve accuracy but its disadvantage is that it requires a long processing time. To resolve this problem this study proposes a new method that quickly finds a rough iris box area without accurately segmenting the iris region in the input images and performs ocular recognition based on this. To address this problem of reduced accuracy the recognition is performed using the ocular area which is a little larger than the iris area and a deep residual network ResNet is used to resolve the problem of reduced recognition rates due to misalignment between the enrolled and recognition iris images. Experiments were performed using three databases: Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences CASIA-Iris-Distance CASIA-Iris-Lamp and CASIA-Iris-Thousand. They confirmed that the method proposed in this study had a higher recognition accuracy than existing methods.
