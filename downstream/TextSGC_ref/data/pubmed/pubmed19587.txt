Continuing medical education has historically been provided primarily by didactic lectures though adult learners prefer experiential or self-directed learning. Young physicians have extensive experience with computer-based or "video" games priming them for medical education--and treating their patients--via new technologies. We report our use of standardized patients SPs to educate physicians on the diagnosis and treatment of biological and chemical warfare agent exposure. We trained professional actors to serve as SPs representing exposure to biological agents such as anthrax and smallpox. We rotated workshop participants through teaching stations to interview examine diagnose and treat SPs. We also trained SPs to simulate a chemical mass casualty MASCAL incident. Workshop participants worked together to treat MASCAL victims followed by discussion of key teaching points. More recently we developed computer-based simulation CBS modules of patients exposed to biological agents. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of CBS vs. live SPs. Finally we detail plans for a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of virtual reality VR exposure therapy compared to pharmacotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. PTSD is associated with significant disability and healthcare costs which may be ameliorated by the identification of more effective therapy. Simulation and virtual reality in medical education and therapy: a protocol.
