In recent years there has been a significant effort towards developing localization systems in the underwater medium with current methods relying on anchor nodes explicitly modeling the underwater channel or cooperation from the target. Lately there has also been some work on using the approximation capabilities of Deep Neural Networks in order to address this problem. In this work we study how the localization precision of using Deep Neural Networks is affected by the variability of the channel the noise level at the receiver the number of neurons of the neural network and the utilization of the power or the covariance of the received acoustic signals. Our study shows that using deep neural networks is a valid approach when the channel variability is low which opens the door to further research in such localization methods for the underwater environment.
