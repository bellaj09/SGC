The human brain undergoes dramatic maturational changes during late stages of fetal and early postnatal life. The importance of this period to the establishment of healthy neural connectivity is apparent in the high incidence of neural injury in preterm infants in whom untimely exposure to ex-uterine factors interrupts neural connectivity. Though the relevance of this period to human neuroscience is apparent little is known about functional neural networks in human fetal life. Here we apply graph theoretical analysis to examine human fetal brain connectivity. Utilizing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data from 33 healthy human fetuses 19 to 39 weeks gestational age GA our analyses reveal that the human fetal brain has modular organization and modules overlap functional systems observed postnatally. Age-related differences between younger GA <31 weeks and older GA31 weeks fetuses demonstrate that brain modularity decreases and connectivity of the posterior cingulate to other brain networks becomes more negative with advancing GA. By mimicking functional principles observed postnatally these results support early emerging capacity for information processing in the human fetal brain. Current technical limitations as well as the potential for fetal fMRI to one day produce major discoveries about fetal origins or antecedents of neural injury or disease are discussed.
