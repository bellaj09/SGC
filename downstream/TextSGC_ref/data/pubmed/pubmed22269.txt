"Virtual Reality based driving simulators are increasingly used to train and assess users abilities to operate vehicles in a controlled and safe way. For the development of those simulators it is important to identify and evaluate design factors affecting perception behaviour and driving performance. In an exemplary power wheelchair simulator setting we identified the three immersion factors display type head-mounted display v monitor ability to freely change the field of view FOV and the visualisation of the users avatar as potentially affecting perception and behaviour. In a study with 72 participants we found all three factors affected the participants sense of presence in the virtual environment. In particular the display type significantly affected both perceptual and behavioural measures whereas FOV only affected behavioural measures. Our findings could guide future Virtual Reality simulator designers to evoke targeted user behaviours and perceptions."
