The hippocampus is considered to play a role in allocentric but not in egocentric spatial learning. How does this view fit with the emerging evidence that the hippocampus and possibly related cortical areas are necessary for episodic-like memory i.e. in all situations in which events need to be spatially or sequentially organized? Are NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms crucial for the acquisition of spatiotemporal relationships? To address this issue we used knock-out KO mice lacking hippocampal CA1 NMDA receptors and presenting a reduction of these receptors in the deep cortical layers NR1-KO mice. A new task the starmaze was designed allowing us to distinguish allocentric and sequential-egocentric memories. NR1-KO mice were impaired in acquiring both types of memory. Our findings suggest that memories composed of multiple spatiotemporal events require intact NMDA receptors-dependent mechanisms in CA1 and possibly in the deep cortical layers.
