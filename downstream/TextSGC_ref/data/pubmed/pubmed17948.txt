In recent decades the traditional teaching model of gastrointestinal endoscopy has been based on the teacher-student tutorial method based on theoretical models. Today simulators have the advantages of virtual reality. The handling apparatus is similar to that used in clinical practice; it is safe which allows unlimited use cost-effective for institutions and with superior performance over other training models. Besides biological simulators are a viable accessible and affordable tool to simulate gastrointestinal lesions allowing training in endoscopy with a high degree of similarity in the endoscopic appearance. In this review we analyze both models showing its advantages for the training of the endoscopist of the times. Endoscopy training by using ex vivo and simulators: a new teaching tool.
