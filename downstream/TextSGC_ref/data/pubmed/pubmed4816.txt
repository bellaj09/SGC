"Childhood is a critical period for the development of cognitive planning. There is a lack of knowledge on its neural mechanisms in children. This study aimed to examine cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical functional connectivity in association with planning skills in 6-year-olds n\u202f=\u202f76. We identified the cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical functional networks related to cognitive planning using activation likelihood estimation ALE meta-analysis on existing functional imaging studies on spatial planning and data-driven independent component analysis ICA of childrens resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI. We investigated associations of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical functional connectivity with planning ability in 6-year-olds as assessed using the Stockings of Cambridge task. Long-range functional connectivity of two cerebellar networks lobules VI and lateral VIIa with the prefrontal and premotor cortex were greater in children with poorer planning ability. In contrast cortico-cortical association networks were not associated with the performance of planning in children. These results highlighted the key contribution of the lateral cerebello-frontal functional connectivity but not cortico-cortical association functional connectivity for planning ability in 6-year-olds. Our results suggested that brain adaptation to the acquisition of planning ability during childhood is partially achieved through the engagement of the cerebello-cortical functional connectivity." Trade-off of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical functional networks for planning in 6-year-old children.
