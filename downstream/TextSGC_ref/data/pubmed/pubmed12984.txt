Learning in dental education has long been a subject of academic research. There are different types of student learning which directly or indirectly contribute to the learning outcomes. In this paper the various classifications of different types of learning; superficial deep individual collaborative and resource-based learning are explored. In order to achieve the learning objectives different teaching methods such as group-work rle-play and problem-based learning are employed. The types of resources used in present day teaching are diverse and multiple: such as print-based computer-based technologies and audio-visual technologies. In order to assess the effectiveness of such teaching different methods of assessment have been adopted for use in higher education. In the context of good teaching in higher education there are a number of constraints placed upon the individual and the institution. These constraints are discussed and recommendations made whereby they may be overcome. Learning in dental education.
