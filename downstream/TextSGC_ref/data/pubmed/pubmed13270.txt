Sleep is a very important physiological phenomenon for recovery of physical and mental fatigue. Recently there has been a lot of interest in the quality of sleep and the research is actively under way. In particular it is important to have a repetitive and regular sleep cycle for good sleep. However it takes a lot of time to determine sleep stages using physiological signals by experts. In this study we constructed an optimized classifier based on normalized mutual information feature selection NMIFS and kernel based extreme learning machine K-ELM and total 4 sleep stages Awake weak sleep stage1+stage2 deep sleepstage3+stage4 and rapid eye movement REM were automatically classified. As a results the average of the accuracy obtained by proposed method NMIFS+K-ELM is 2~3% higher than that of simple method K-ELM. Optimized automatic sleep stage classification using the normalized mutual information feature selection NMIFS method.
