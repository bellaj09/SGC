"Cardiovascular diseases lead to a high consumption of financial resources. An important part of the recovery process is the cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study aimed to present a new cardiovascular rehabilitation system to 11 outpatients with coronary artery disease from a Hospital in Porto Portugal later collecting their opinions. This system is based on a virtual reality game system using the Kinect sensor while performing an exercise protocol which is integrated in a home-based cardiovascular rehabilitation programme with a duration of 6\u2009months and at the maintenance phase. The participants responded to a questionnaire asking for their opinion about the system. The results demonstrated that 91% of the participants n\u2009=\u200910 enjoyed the artwork while 100% n\u2009=\u200911 agreed on the importance and usefulness of the automatic counting of the number of repetitions moreover 64% n\u2009=\u20097 reported motivation to continue performing the programme after the end of the study and 100% n\u2009=\u200911 recognized Kinect as an instrument with potential to be an asset in cardiovascular rehabilitation. Criticisms included limitations in motion capture and gesture recognition 91% n\u2009=\u200910 and the lack of home space 27% n\u2009=\u20093. According to the participants opinions the Kinect has the potential to be used in cardiovascular rehabilitation; however several technical details require improvement particularly regarding the motion capture and gesture recognition."
