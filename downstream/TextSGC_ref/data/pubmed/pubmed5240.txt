The preservation of the spatial relationships among axonal pathways has long been studied and known to be critical for many functions of the brain. Being a fundamental property of the brain connections there is an intuitive understanding of topographic regularity in neuroscience but yet to be systematically explored in connectome imaging research. In this work we propose a general mathematical model for topographic regularity of fiber bundles that is consistent with its neuroanatomical understanding. Our model is based on a novel group spectral graph analysis GSGA framework motivated by spectral graph theory and tensor decomposition. GSGA provides a common set of eigenvectors for the graphs formed by topographic proximity measures whose preservation along individual tracts in return is modeled as topographic regularity. To demonstrate the application of this novel measure of topographic regularity we apply it to filter fiber tracts from connectome imaging. Using large-scale data from the Human Connectome Project HCP we show that our novel algorithm can achieve better performance than existing methods on the filtering of both individual bundles and whole brain tractograms.
