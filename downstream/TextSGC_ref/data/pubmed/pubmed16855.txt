Accurate medical Augmented Reality AR rendering requires two calibrations a camera intrinsic matrix estimation and a hand-eye transformation. We present a unified practical marker-less real-time system to estimate both these transformations during surgery. For camera calibration we perform calibrations at multiple distances from the endoscope pre-operatively to parametrize the camera intrinsic matrix as a function of distance from the endoscope. Then we retrieve the camera parameters intra-operatively by estimating the distance of the surgical site from the endoscope in less than 1 s. Unlike in prior work our method does not require the endoscope to be taken out of the patient; for the hand-eye calibration as opposed to conventional methods that require the identification of a marker we make use of a rendered tool-tip in 3D. As the surgeon moves the instrument and observes the offset between the actual and the rendered tool-tip they can select points of high visual error and manually bring the instrument tip to match the virtual rendered tool tip. To evaluate the hand-eye calibration 5 subjects carried out the hand-eye calibration procedure on a da Vinci robot. Average Target Registration Error of approximately 7mm was achieved with just three data points.
