"Objective: A range of recent studies suggest that overall mindset about stress is related to health performance and well-being. Therefore an exploratory study was conducted to examine whether virtual reality VR with real-time biofeedback would have potential in training people in an engaging way to develop a new stress-is-enhancing mindset. Materials and Methods: The specific application to improve peoples stress mindset that was used in this study is Stressjam. The application was tested on its attractiveness by 111 healthy participants specifically on their personal involvement through the Personal Involvement Inventory and its usability through the System Usability Scale. In addition to the healthy participants a group of 64 patients dealing with stress used Stressjam for at least three sessions. The Stress Mindset Measure was used to assess the stress mindset of both groups at baseline and after finishing their sessions. Results: Stressjam appears to be an application that is user friendly with good user involvement. The healthy participants and the patient sample both had a more positive stress mindset after using the application than at baseline t111\u2009=\u20094.38 P\u2009<\u20090.001 and F163\u2009=\u200966.57 P\u2009<\u20090.001 respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study give some indications that using VR with biofeedback might be useful in working toward a more positive stress mindset. As such further research into applications such as Stressjam is warranted." Changing Stress Mindset Through Stressjam: A Virtual Reality Game Using Biofeedback.
