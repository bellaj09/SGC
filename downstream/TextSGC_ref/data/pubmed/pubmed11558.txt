Robust and fast detection of anatomical structures represents an important component of medical image analysis technologies. Current solutions for anatomy detection are based on machine learning and are generally driven by suboptimal and exhaustive search strategies. In particular these techniques do not effectively address cases of incomplete data i.e. scans acquired with a partial field-of-view. We address these challenges by following a new paradigm which reformulates the detection task to teaching an intelligent artificial agent how to actively search for an anatomical structure. Using the principles of deep reinforcement learning with multi-scale image analysis artificial agents are taught optimal navigation paths in the scale-space representation of an image while accounting for structures that are missing from the field-of-view. The spatial coherence of the observed anatomical landmarks is ensured using elements from statistical shape modeling and robust estimation theory. Experiments show that our solution outperforms marginal space deep learning a powerful deep learning method at detecting different anatomical structures without any failure. The dataset contains 5043 3D-CT volumes from over 2000 patients totaling over 2500000 image slices. In particular our solution achieves 0% false-positive and 0% false-negative rates at detecting whether the landmarks are captured in the field-of-view of the scan excluding all border cases with an average detection accuracy of 2.78\u202fmm. In terms of runtime we reduce the detection-time of the marginal space deep learning method by 20-30 times to under 40\xa0ms an unmatched performance for high resolution incomplete 3D-CT data.
