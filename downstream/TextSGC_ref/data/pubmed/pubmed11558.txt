"Acute coronary syndrome ACS is a syndrome caused by a decrease in blood flow in the coronary arteries. The ACS is usually related to coronary thrombosis and is primarily caused by plaque rupture followed by plaque erosion and calcified nodule. Thin-cap fibroatheroma TCFA is known to be the most similar lesion morphologically to a plaque rupture. In this paper we propose methods to classify TCFA using various machine learning classifiers including feed-forward neural network FNN K-nearest neighbor KNN random forest RF and convolutional neural network CNN to figure out a classifier that shows optimal TCFA classification accuracy. In addition we suggest pixel range-based feature extraction method to extract the ratio of pixels in the different region of interests to reflect the physicians TCFA discrimination criteria. Our feature extraction method examines the pixel distribution of the intravascular ultrasound IVUS image at a given ROI which allows us to extract general characteristics of the IVUS image while simultaneously reflecting the different properties of the vessels substances such as necrotic core and calcified nodule depending on the brightness of the pixel. A total of 12325 IVUS images were labeled with corresponding optical coherence tomography OCT images to train and evaluate the classifiers. We achieved 0.859 0.848 0.844 and 0.911 area under the ROC curve AUC in the order of using FNN KNN RF and CNN classifiers. As a result the CNN classifier performed best and the top 10 features of the feature-based classifiers FNN KNN RF were found to be similar to the physicians TCFA diagnostic criteria.
