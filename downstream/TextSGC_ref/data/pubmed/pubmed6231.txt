"Focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy FIB-SEM has become an essential tool for studying neural tissue at resolutions below 10 nm  10 nm  10 nm producing data sets optimized for automatic connectome tracing. We present a technical advance ultrathick sectioning which reliably subdivides embedded tissue samples into chunks 20 m thick optimally sized and mounted for efficient parallel FIB-SEM imaging. These chunks are imaged separately and then volume stitched back together producing a final three-dimensional data set suitable for connectome tracing." Ultrastructurally smooth thick partitioning and volume stitching for large-scale connectomics.
