High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation HF-rTMS has gained great interest in multiple clinical and research fields and is believed to accomplish its effect by influencing neuronal networks. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlPFC is frequently chosen as the cortical target for HF-rTMS. However very little is known about the differential effect of HF-rTMS over the left and right dlPFC on intrinsic functional connectivity networks in patients or in healthy individuals. The current study assessed the differential effects of left or right HF-rTMS corrected for sham on intrinsic independent component analysis ICA-defined functional connectivity networks in a sample of 45 healthy individuals. All subjects had a first scanning session in which baseline functional connectivity was assessed. During the second session individuals received one session of left right or sham dlPFC HF-rTMS 60 5-sec trains of 10\u2009Hz at 110% motor threshold. The sham condition was used to correct for time and placebo effects. ICAs were performed to assess baseline differences and stimulation effects on within- and between-network functional connectivity. Stimulation of the left dlPFC resulted in decreased functional connectivity in the salience network whereas right dlPFC stimulation resulted in increased functional connectivity within this network. No differences between left or right dlPFC stimulation were found in between-network connectivity. These results suggest that left and right HF-rTMS may have differential effects and more research is needed on the clinical consequences.
