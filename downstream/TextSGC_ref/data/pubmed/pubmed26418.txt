"Reaching and grasping are two of the most affected functions after stroke. Hybrid rehabilitation systems combining Functional Electrical Stimulation with Robotic devices have been proposed in the literature to improve rehabilitation outcomes. In this work we present the combined use of a hybrid robotic system with an EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface to detect the users movement intentions to trigger the assistance. The platform has been tested in a single session with a stroke patient. The results show how the patient could successfully interact with the BMI and command the assistance of the hybrid system with low latencies. Also the Feedback Error Learning controller implemented in this system could adjust the required FES intensity to perform the task."
