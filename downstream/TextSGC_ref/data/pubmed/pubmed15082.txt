We propose a see-through multi-projection three-dimensional 3D display using a transparent anisotropic diffuser. By immersing a metal-coated anisotropic diffuser into index matching oil which has the same refractive index of anisotropic diffuser a transparent anisotropic diffuser is implemented. The reflectance of the transparent anisotropic diffuser is analyzed with the transfer matrix. Two multi-projection methods are proposed based on reflection type integral imaging and multi-view method. Especially the reflection type multi-view-based system is realized with a curved anisotropic diffuser. High resolution see-through 3D display can be realized with the proposed methods. They can be used in various applications with the two multi-projection methods. In order to show the augmented reality features real objects and virtual 3D images are presented at the same time in the experimental setup.
