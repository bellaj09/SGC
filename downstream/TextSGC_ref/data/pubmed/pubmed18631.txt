This study uses a body motion interactive game developed in Scratch 2.0 to enhance the body strength of children with disabilities. Scratch 2.0 using an augmented-reality function on a program platform creates real world and virtual reality displays at the same time. This study uses a webcam integration that tracks movements and allows participants to interact physically with the project to enhance the motivation of children with developmental disabilities to perform physical activities. This study follows a single-case research using an ABAB structure in which A is the baseline and B is the intervention. The experimental period was 2 months. The experimental results demonstrated that the scores for 3 children with developmental disabilities increased considerably during the intervention phrases. The developmental applications of these results are also discussed. Interactive augmented reality using Scratch 2.0 to improve physical activities for children with developmental disabilities.
