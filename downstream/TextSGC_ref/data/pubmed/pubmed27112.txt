In Brain Computer Interfacing BCI speech imagery is still at nascent stage of development. There are few studies reported considering mostly vowels or monosyllabic words. However language specific vowels or words made it harder to standardise the whole analysis of electroencephalography EEG while distinguishing between them. Through this study we have explored significance of multifractal parameters for different imagined vowels chosen from International Phonetic Alphabets IPA. The vowels were categorised into two categories namely soft vowels and diphthongs. Multifractal analysis at EEG subband levels were evaluated. We have also reported significant contrasts between spatiotemporal distributions with fractal analysis for activation of different brain regions in imagining vowels.
