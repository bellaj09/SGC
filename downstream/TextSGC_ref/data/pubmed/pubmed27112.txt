The brain-computer interfacing BCI a platform to extract features and classify different motor movement tasks from noisy and highly correlated electroencephalogram signals is limited mostly by the complex and power-hungry algorithms. Among different techniques recently devised to tackle this issue real-time onset detection due to its negligible delay and minimal power overhead is the most efficient one. Here we propose a novel algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art design by sixfold in terms of speed without sacrificing the accuracy for a real-time hand movement intention detection based on the adaptive wavelet transform with only 1\xa0s detection delay and maximum sensitivity of 88% and selectivity of 78% only 7% loss of sensitivity.
