Deep learning algorithms have achieved human-equivalent performance in image recognition. However the majority of clinical data within electronic health records is inherently in a non-image format. Therefore creating visual representations of clinical data could facilitate using cutting-edge deep learning models for predicting outcomes such as in-hospital mortality while enabling clinician interpretability. The objective of this study was to develop a framework that first transforms longitudinal patient data into visual timelines and then utilizes deep learning to predict in-hospital mortality. Combining patient visual timelines with deep learning to predict mortality.
