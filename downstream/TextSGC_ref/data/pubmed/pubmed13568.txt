"Background: To validate our deep learning algorithm DLA to read diabetic retinopathy DR retinographies. Introduction: Currently DR detection is made by retinography; due to its increasing diabetes mellitus incidence we need to find systems that help us to screen DR. Materials and Methods: The DLA was built and trained using 88702 images from EyePACS 1748 from Messidor-2 and 19230 from our own population. For validation a total of 38339 retinographies from 17669 patients obtained from our DR screening databases were read by a DLA and compared by four senior retina ophthalmologists for detecting any-DR and referable-DR. We determined the values of Cohens weighted Kappa CWK index sensitivity S specificity SP positive predictive value PPV and negative predictive value NPV and errors type I and II. Results: The results of the DLA to detect any-DR were: CWK\u2009=\u20090.886  0.004 95% confidence interval CI 0.879-0.894 S\u2009=\u20090.967% SP\u2009=\u20090.976% PPV\u2009=\u20090.836% and NPV\u2009=\u20090.996%. The error type I\u2009=\u20090.024 and the error type II\u2009=\u20090.004. Likewise the referable-DR results were: CWK\u2009=\u20090.809 95% CI 0.798-0.819 S\u2009=\u20090.998 SP\u2009=\u20090.968 PPV\u2009=\u20090.701 NPV\u2009=\u20090.928 error type I\u2009=\u20090.032 and error type II\u2009=\u20090.001. Discussion: Our DLA can be used as a high confidence diagnostic tool to help in DR screening especially when it might be difficult for ophthalmologists or other professionals to identify. It can identify patients with any-DR and those that should be referred. Conclusions: The DLA can be valid to aid in screening of DR." Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Diabetic Retinopathy.
