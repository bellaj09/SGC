Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein structure prediction since contact information especially from those long-range residue pairs can significantly reduce the complexity of conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice. Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant homologous sequences accurate contact prediction for proteins with limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction. Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement. A deep learning framework for improving long-range residue-residue contact prediction using a hierarchical strategy.
