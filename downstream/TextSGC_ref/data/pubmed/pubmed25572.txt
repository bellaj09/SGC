This paper describes the implementation of a Brain Computer Interface BCI scheme using a common spatial patterns CSP filter in combination with a Recursive Least Squares RLS approach to iteratively update the coefficients of the CSP filter. The proposed adaptive CSP ACSP algorithm is made more robust by introducing regularization using Diagonal Loading DL and thus will be able to significantly reduce the length of training sessions when introducing new patients to the BCI system. The system is tested on a 4-class multi-limb motor imagery MI data set from the BCI competition IV 2a and a more complex single limb 3-class MI dataset recorded in-house. The latter dataset is produced to mimic an upper limb rehabilitation session e.g. after stroke. The findings indicate that when extensive calibration data is available the ACSP performs comparably to the CSP kappa value of 0.523 and 0.502 respectively for the 4-class problem; for reduced calibration sessions the ACSP significantly improved the performance of the system up to 4-fold. The proposed paradigm proved feasible and the ACSP algorithm seems to enable a user or semi user independent scenario where the need for long system calibration sessions without feedback is eliminated. An adaptive CSP filter to investigate user independence in a 3-class MI-BCI paradigm.
