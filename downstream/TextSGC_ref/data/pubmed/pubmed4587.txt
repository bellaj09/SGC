The disembedding ability i.e. the ability to identify a simple masked figure within a complex one depends on attentional mechanisms executive functions and working memory. Recent cognitive models ascribed different levels of disembedding task performance to the efficiency of the subtended mental processes engaged during visuo-spatial perception. Here we aimed at assessing whether different levels of the disembedding ability were associated to the functional signatures of neural efficiency defined as a specific modulation in response magnitude and functional connectivity strength in task-related areas. Consequently brain activity evoked by a visual task involving the disembedding ability was acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI in a sample of 23 right-handed healthy individuals. Brain activity was analyzed at different levels of information processing from local responses to connectivity interactions between brain nodes as far as to network topological properties. All different levels of information processing were significantly modulated by individual behavioral performance. Specifically single voxel response magnitude connectivity strength of the right intrahemispheric and interhemispheric edges and graph measures i.e. local and global efficiency were negatively associated to behavioral performance. Altogether these results indicate that efficiency during a disembedding task cannot be merely attributed to a reduced neural recruitment of task-specific regions but can be better characterized as an enhanced functional hemispherical asymmetry. Different levels of visual perceptual skills are associated with specific modifications in functional connectivity and global efficiency.
