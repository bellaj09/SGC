"Metabolic connectivity as showed by 18F fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron emission tomography FDG-PET reflects neuronal connectivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic impact on metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks and its clinical-pathological relationships in patients with Alzheimers disease AD. We separately investigated the modulation of 2 default mode subnetworks as identified with independent component analysis by comparing APOE-4 carriers to noncarriers with AD. We further analyzed the interaction effects of APOE APOE-4 carriers vs noncarriers with PICALM rs3851179-GG vs rs3851179-A-allele carriers on episodic memory EM deficits reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose CMRgl and decreased metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks. The metabolic connectivity in the ventral default mode network vDMN was positively correlated with EM scores \u2009=0.441 P\u2009<\u2009.001. The APOE-4 carriers had significantly lower metabolic connectivity in the vDMN than the APOE-4 carriers t96\u2009=\u2009-2.233 P\u2009=\u2009.028. There was an effect of the APOE-PICALM rs3851179 interactions on reduced CMRgl in regions of vDMN P <\u2009.001 and on memory deficits F393 =5.568 P =\u2009.020. This study identified that PICALM may modulates memory deficits reduced CMRgl and decreased metabolic connectivity in the vDMN in APOE-4 carriers. 18F FDG-PET-based metabolic connectivity may serve a useful tool to elucidate the neural networks underlying clinical-pathological relationships in AD." "Genetic interaction is associated with lower metabolic connectivity and memory impairment in clinically mild Alzheimers disease."
