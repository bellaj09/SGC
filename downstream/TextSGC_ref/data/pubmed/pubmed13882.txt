"In 1818 John Sinclairs advice for health and longevity included temporary retirement to the country. Two centuries later life in rural America means higher death rates throughout the lifespan. Health care delivery in rural areas is limited by a number of hardships associated with low-density living including a shortage of providers limited cultural diversity and geography.
