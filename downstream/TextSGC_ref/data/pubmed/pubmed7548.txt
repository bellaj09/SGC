Protein intrinsically disordered regions IDRs play an important role in many biological processes. Two key properties of IDRs are i the occurrence is proteome-wide and ii the ratio of disordered residues is about 6% which makes it challenging to accurately predict IDRs. Most IDR prediction methods use sequence profile to improve accuracy which prevents its application to proteome-wide prediction since it is time-consuming to generate sequence profiles. On the other hand the methods without using sequence profile fare much worse than using sequence profile.
