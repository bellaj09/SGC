Visual object representations are commonly thought to emerge rapidly yet it has remained unclear to what extent early brain responses reflect purely low-level visual features of these objects and how strongly those features contribute to later categorical or conceptual representations. Here we aimed to estimate a lower temporal bound for the emergence of conceptual representations by defining two criteria that characterize such representations: 1 conceptual object representations should generalize across different exemplars of the same object and 2 these representations should reflect high-level behavioral judgments. To test these criteria we compared magnetoencephalography MEG recordings between two groups of participants n\u202f=\u202f16 per group exposed to different exemplar images of the same object concepts. Further we disentangled low-level from high-level MEG responses by estimating the unique and shared contribution of models of behavioral judgments semantics and different layers of deep neural networks of visual object processing. We find that 1 both generalization across exemplars as well as generalization of object-related signals across time increase after 150\u202fms peaking around 230\u202fms; 2 representations specific to behavioral judgments emerged rapidly peaking around 160\u202fms. Collectively these results suggest a lower bound for the emergence of conceptual object representations around 150\u202fms following stimulus onset. The temporal evolution of conceptual object representations revealed through models of behavior semantics and deep neural networks.
