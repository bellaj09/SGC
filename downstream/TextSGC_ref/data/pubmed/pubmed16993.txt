The nature of the visual representation for words has been fiercely debated for over 150 y. We used direct brain stimulation pre- and postsurgical behavioral measures and intracranial electroencephalography to provide support for and elaborate upon the visual word form hypothesis. This hypothesis states that activity in the left midfusiform gyrus lmFG reflects visually organized information about words and word parts. In patients with electrodes placed directly in their lmFG we found that disrupting lmFG activity through stimulation and later surgical resection in one of the patients led to impaired perception of whole words and letters. Furthermore using machine-learning methods to analyze the electrophysiological data from these electrodes we found that information contained in early lmFG activity was consistent with an orthographic similarity space. Finally the lmFG contributed to at least two distinguishable stages of word processing an early stage that reflects gist-level visual representation sensitive to orthographic statistics and a later stage that reflects more precise representation sufficient for the individuation of orthographic word forms. These results provide strong support for the visual word form hypothesis and demonstrate that across time the lmFG is involved in multiple stages of orthographic representation.
