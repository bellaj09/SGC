"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI is widely used to research abnormal functional connectivity FC in patients with disorders of consciousness DOC. However most studies assumed steady spatial-temporal signal interactions between distinct brain regions during the scan period. The aim of this study was to explore abnormal dynamic functional connectivity dFC in DOC patients. After excluding 26 patients data that failed to meet the requirements of imaging quality we retained 19 DOC patients 12 with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and 7 in a minimally conscious state diagnosed with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised CRS-R for the dFC analysis. We used the sliding windows approach to construct dFC matrices. Then these matrices were clustered into distinct states using the k-means clustering algorithm. We found that the DOC patients showed decreased dFC in the sensory and somatomotor networks compared with the healthy controls. There were also significant differences in temporal properties the mean dwell time MDT and the number of transitions NT between the DOC patients and the healthy controls. In addition we also used a hidden Markov model HMM to test the robustness of the results. With the connectome-based predictive modeling CPM approach we found that the properties of abnormal dynamic network can be used to predict the CRS-R scores of the patients after severe brain injury. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the abnormal brain networks in DOC patients." Abnormal dynamic properties of functional connectivity in disorders of consciousness.
