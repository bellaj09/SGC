"This review summarizes functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI research done over the past decade that examined changes in the function and organization of brain networks across human adolescence. Its over-arching goal is to highlight how both resting state functional connectivity rs-fcMRI and task-based functional connectivity t-fcMRI have jointly contributed - albeit in different ways - to our understanding of the scope and types of network organization changes that occur from puberty until young adulthood. These two approaches generally have tested different types of hypotheses using different analysis techniques. This has hampered the convergence of findings. Although much has been learned about system-wide changes to adolescents neural network organization if both rs-fcMRI and t-fcMRI approaches draw upon each others methodology and ask broader questions it will produce a more detailed connectome-informed theory of adolescent neurodevelopment to guide physiological clinical and other lines of research." The contributions of resting state and task-based functional connectivity studies to our understanding of adolescent brain network maturation.
