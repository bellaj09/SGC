Side effects occur when excessive or low doses of analgesics are administered compared to the required amount to mediate the pain induced during surgery. It is important to accurately assess the pain level of the patient during surgery. We proposed a pain classifier based on a deep belief network DBN using photoplethysmography PPG. Our DBN learned about a complex nonlinear relationship between extracted PPG features and pain status based on the numeric rating scale NRS. A bagging ensemble model was used to improve classification performance. The DBN classifier showed better classification results than multilayer perceptron neural network MLPNN and support vector machine SVM models. In addition the classification performance was improved when the selective bagging model was applied compared with the use of each single model classifier. The pain classifier based on DBN using a selective bagging model can be helpful in developing a pain classification system.
