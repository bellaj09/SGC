Effective interactions in both real and stereoscopic environments require accurate perceptions of size and position. This study investigated the effects of parallax and interpupillary distance IPD on size perception of virtual objects in widescreen stereoscopic environments. Twelve participants viewed virtual spherical targets displayed at seven different depth positions based on seven parallax levels. A perceptual matching task using five circular plates of different sizes was used to report the size judgment. The results indicated that the virtual objects were perceived as larger and smaller than the corresponding theoretical sizes respectively in negative and positive parallaxes. Similarly the estimates from participants with small IPDs were greater than the predicted estimates. The findings of this study are used to explain human factor issues such as the phenomenon of inaccurate depth judgments in virtual environments where compression is widely reported especially at farther egocentric distances. Furthermore a multiple regression model was developed to describe how the size was affected by parallax and IPD. Practitioner Summary: The study investigates the effects of parallax and interpupillary distance on size perception of virtual targets in a stereoscopic environment. Virtual objects were perceived as larger in negative and smaller in positive parallax. Also size estimates were greater than the theoretical sizes for participants with smaller IPD. A multiple-regression model explains the impact of parallax and measured IPD.
