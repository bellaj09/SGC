The P300 is an endogenous event-related potential ERP that is naturally elicited by rare and significant external stimuli. P300s are used increasingly frequently in brain-computer interfaces BCIs because the users of ERP-based BCIs need no special training. However P300 waves are hard to detect and therefore multiple target stimulus presentations are needed before an interface can make a reliable decision. While significant improvements have been made in the detection of P300s no particular attention has been paid to the variability in shape and timing of P300 waves in BCIs. In this paper we start filling this gap by documenting modelling and exploiting a modulation in the amplitude of P300s related to the number of non-targets preceding a target in a Donchin speller. The basic idea in our approach is to use an appropriately weighted average of the responses produced by a classifier during multiple stimulus presentations instead of the traditional plain average. This makes it possible to weigh more heavily events that are likely to be more informative thereby increasing the accuracy of classification. The optimal weights are determined through a mathematical model that precisely estimates the accuracy of our speller as well as the expected performance improvement w.r.t. the traditional approach. Tests with two independent datasets show that our approach provides a marked statistically significant improvement in accuracy over the top-performing algorithm presented in the literature to date. The method and the theoretical models we propose are general and can easily be used in other P300-based BCIs with minimal changes.
