"Uncovering structural regularities and architectural topologies of cortical circuitry is vital for understanding neural computations. Recently an experimentally constrained algorithm generated a dense network reconstruction of a 0.3-mm3 volume from juvenile rat somatosensory neocortex comprising 31000 cells and 36 million synapses. Using this reconstruction we found a small-world topology with an average of 2.5 synapses separating any two cells and multiple cell-type-specific wiring features. Amounts of excitatory and inhibitory innervations varied across cells yet pyramidal neurons maintained relatively constant excitation/inhibition ratios. The circuit contained highly connected hub neurons belonging to a small subset of cell types and forming an interconnected cell-type-specific rich club. Certain three-neuron motifs were overrepresented matching recent experimental results. Cell-type-specific network properties were even more striking when synaptic strength and sign were considered in generating a functional topology. Our systematic approach enables interpretation of microconnectomics big data and provides several experimentally testable predictions."
