Medical images play an important role in medical diagnosis and research. In this paper a transfer learning- and deep learning-based super resolution reconstruction method is introduced. The proposed method contains one bicubic interpolation template layer and two convolutional layers. The bicubic interpolation template layer is prefixed by mathematics deduction and two convolutional layers learn from training samples. For saving training medical images a SIFT feature-based transfer learning method is proposed. Not only can medical images be used to train the proposed method but also other types of images can be added into training dataset selectively. In empirical experiments results of eight distinctive medical images show improvement of image quality and time reduction. Further the proposed method also produces slightly sharper edges than other deep learning approaches in less time and it is projected that the hybrid architecture of prefixed template layer and unfixed hidden layers has potentials in other applications.
