Inappropriate management of health and safety H&S risk in power infrastructure projects can result in occupational accidents and equipment damage. Accidents at work have detrimental effects on workers company and the general public. Despite the availability of H&S incident data utilizing them to mitigate accident occurrence effectively is challenging due to inherent limitations of existing data logging methods. In this study we used a text-mining approach for retrieving meaningful terms from data and develop six deep learning DL models for H&S risks management in power infrastructure. The DL models include DNNclassify risk or no risk DNNreg1 loss time DNNreg2 body injury DNNreg3 plant and fleet DNNreg4 equipment and DNNreg5 environment. An H&S risk database obtained from a leading UK power infrastructure construction company was used in developing the models using the H2O framework of the R language. Performances of DL models were assessed and benchmarked with existing models using test data and appropriate performance metrics. The overall accuracy of the classification model was 0.93. The average R2 value for the five regression models was 0.92 with mean absolute error between 0.91 and 0.94. The presented results in addition to the developed user-interface module will help practitioners obtain a better understanding of H&S challenges minimize project costs such as third-party insurance and equipment repairs and offer effective strategies to mitigate H&S risk.
