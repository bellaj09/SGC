P300 is an Event Related Potential control signal widely used in Brain Computer Interfaces. Using the oddball paradigm a P300 speller allows a human to spell letters through P300 events produced by his/her brain. One of the most common issues in the detection of this event is that its structure may differ between different subjects and over time for a specific subject. The main purpose of this work is to deal with this inherent variability and identify the main structure of P300 using algorithmic clustering based on string compression. Algorithmic clustering based on string compression to extract P300 structure in EEG signals.
