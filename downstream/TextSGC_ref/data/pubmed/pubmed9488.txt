The fusion of transrectal ultrasound TRUS and magnetic resonance MR images for guiding targeted prostate biopsy has significantly improved the biopsy yield of aggressive cancers. A key component of MR-TRUS fusion is image registration. However it is very challenging to obtain a robust automatic MR-TRUS registration due to the large appearance difference between the two imaging modalities. The work presented in this paper aims to tackle this problem by addressing two challenges: i the definition of a suitable similarity metric and ii the determination of a suitable optimization strategy. Learning deep similarity metric for 3D MR-TRUS image registration.
