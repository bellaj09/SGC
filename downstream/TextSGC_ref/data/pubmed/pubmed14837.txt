Objective: Virtual environments have been used to assess children with ADHD but have never been tested as therapeutic tools. We tested a new virtual classroom cognitive remediation program to improve symptoms in children with ADHD. Method: In this randomized clinical trial 51 children with ADHD 7-11 years were assigned to a virtual cognitive remediation group a methylphenidate group or a psychotherapy group. All children were evaluated before and after therapy with an ADHD Rating Scale a Continuous Performance Test CPT and a virtual classroom task. Results: After therapy by virtual remediation children exhibited significantly higher numbers of correct hits on the virtual classroom and CPT. These improvements were equivalent to those observed with methylphenidate treatment. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates for the first time that a cognitive remediation program delivered in a virtual classroom reduces distractibility in children with ADHD and could replace methylphenidate treatment in specific cases.
