The effectiveness of simulation-based training has been accepted with great success in many fields including medicine. Most of the simulation research and development in medicine has focused on surgery. There has been some development of hardware based biomechanical models of sections of human anatomy such as pelvic exam simulators. More recently with the advances in haptics technology software and hardware based simulators are being developed for the previously ignored area of palpatory diagnosis. The Virtual Haptic Back VHB is a simulator based on virtual reality and haptics that is currently being used to train medical students in palpatory diagnosis. This study examined the effect of repeating the training on the VHB. Repeated palpatory training of medical students on the Virtual Haptic Back.
