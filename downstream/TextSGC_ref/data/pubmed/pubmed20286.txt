Smokers who are not motivated to quit are less likely to seek help or utilize medication for cessation so it is critical to proactively reach them to motivate cessation. This study aims to determine feasibility and satisfaction of a smoking cessation induction intervention via a virtual reality VR headset worn during dental cleaning. Participants n = 23 were adult dental patients who were current smokers. During their teeth cleaning participants wore a VR headset to watch two 5-min smoking cessation videos one targeted to smokers who are not ready to quit and one for those who are ready to quit. Questionnaires were administered pre- and postappointment and 1 month later. Interviews were conducted immediately after the appointment. Implementation did not interfere with care delivery including instrument manipulation and patient-provider communication. On a 1-7 scale participants indicated satisfaction with the experience M = 5.4 SD = 1.3 and a positive impact on their willingness to quit 15 of 22 rated  6 and their knowledge of the effects of smoking on their health 22 of 23 rated as  6. Participants were highly satisfied with the video content M = 4.3; 1-5 scale. When prompted 82.6% were able to recall three things from the video. One month later four to five participants reported that they quit smoking varied by measure and 14 of 23 intentionally quit smoking  24 hr. Among nonquitters motivation to quit increased from baseline to follow up. This study may help guide the integration of virtual reality headset use in the dental setting to promote smoking cessation regardless of motivation to quit.
