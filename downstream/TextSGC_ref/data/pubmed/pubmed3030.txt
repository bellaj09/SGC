The dopamine D4 receptor DRD4 promoter -616; rs747302 has been associated with primary nocturnal enuresis PNE; however its relationship with neuroimaging has not been investigated. Therefore we assessed the effects of the DRD4 -616 C/G single nucleotide polymorphism on the gray matter volume GMV and functional connectivity density FCD during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in children with PNE using voxel-based morphometry and FCD methods. Genomic and imaging data were obtained from 97 children with PNE and 105 healthy controls. DRD4 -616 C/G was genotyped. Arousal from sleep AS was assessed on a scale of 1-8. Both the main effect of genotype and the group PNE/control-by-genotype interaction on GMV and FCD were calculated. Our results showed that C-allele carriers were associated with a higher AS decreased GMV and FCD in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex; children with PNE carrying the C allele exhibit decreased GMV and FCD in the thalamus; however controls carrying the C allele exhibit increased FCD in the posterior cingulate cortex. These effects of genetic variation of the DRD4 locus may help us understand the genetic susceptibility of the DRD4 -616 C allele to PNE.
