Virtual reality presents a platform for therapeutic gaming and incorporation of immersive biofeedback on gait may enhance outcomes in rehabilitation. Time is limited in therapeutic practice therefore any potential gait training tool requires a short set up time while maintaining clinical relevance and accuracy. The aim of this study was to develop validate and establish the usability of an avatar-based application for biofeedback-enhanced gait training with minimal set up time. The validity and usability of an eight marker model for avatar-based biofeedback gait training.
