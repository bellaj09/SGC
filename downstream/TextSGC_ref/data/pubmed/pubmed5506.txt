Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS therapy can modulate pathological neural network functional connectivity in major depressive disorder MDD. Posttraumatic stress disorder is often comorbid with MDD and symptoms of both disorders can be alleviated with TMS therapy. This is the first study to evaluate TMS-associated changes in connectivity in patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and MDD.
