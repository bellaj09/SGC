The performance of a deep-learning-based speech enhancement SE technology for hearing aid users called a deep denoising autoencoder DDAE was investigated. The hearing-aid speech perception index HASPI and the hearing- aid sound quality index HASQI which are two well-known evaluation metrics for speech intelligibility and quality were used to evaluate the performance of the DDAE SE approach in two typical high-frequency hearing loss HFHL audiograms. Our experimental results show that the DDAE SE approach yields higher intelligibility and quality scores than two classical SE approaches. These results suggest that a deep-learning-based SE method could be used to improve speech intelligibility and quality for hearing aid users in noisy environments.
