Successful interventions have been developed for smoking cessation but the success of smoking relapse prevention interventions has been limited. In particular cognitive behavioural therapy CBT has been hampered by a high relapse rate. Because relapses can be due to the presence of conditions associated with tobacco consumption such as drinking in bars with friends virtual reality exposure therapy VRET can generate synthetic environments that represent risk situations for the patient in the context of relapse prevention. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT coupled with VRET in comparison to CBT alone in the prevention of smoking relapse. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of CBT coupled with VRET on anxiety depression quality of life self-esteem and addictive comorbidities such as alcohol cannabis and gambling. A third objective examines the feasibility and acceptability of VR use considering elements such as presence cybersickness and number of patients who complete the VRET program.
