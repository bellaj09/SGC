The most common cardiac examination ordered by physicians is the 12 lead ECG frequently obtained with a computerized recording device that not only provides the ECG tracing but may also provide the diagnosis. In the past only persons working in the ECG laboratory were allowed to perform a 12 lead ECG on a patient. Today however this task has been delegated to a variety of health professionals including registered nurses licensed practice nurses and even nursing assistants in some health care facilities. New nurses are taught the skill of obtaining a 12 lead ECG during their initial hospital orientation. Because of this it is not uncommon to have staff development nurses teaching groups of health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG content and skill as many as 5 times in 1 week. For delivery of repetitive content the use of an interactive CD ROM can be very cost effective. Many health care institutions purchase commercially made CD ROM products while elsewhere nurse educators develop their own. An interactive CD ROM based on the principles of best practice in education and using embedded virtual reality was designed by the author to teach nurses students and other health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG. This article will: 1 describe the interactive CD ROM reality as a teaching methodology; 2 discuss the preliminary evaluation of learning outcomes using CD ROM as the instructional method; and 3 describe the applications interactive CD ROMs may have in nursing practice and education. Learning how to perform a 12 lead ECG using virtual reality.
