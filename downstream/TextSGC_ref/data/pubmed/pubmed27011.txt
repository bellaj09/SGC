Motor imagery is one of the most investigated paradigms in the field of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. The present study explored the feasibility of applying a common spatial pattern CSP-based algorithm for a functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS-based motor imagery BCI. Ten participants performed kinesthetic imagery of their left- and right-hand movements while 20-channel fNIRS signals were recorded over the motor cortex. The CSP method was implemented to obtain the spatial filters specific for both imagery tasks. The mean slope and variance of the CSP filtered signals were taken as features for BCI classification. Results showed that the CSP-based algorithm outperformed two representative channel-wise methods for classifying the two imagery statuses using either data from all channels or averaged data from imagery responsive channels only oxygenated hemoglobin: CSP-based: 75.313.1%; all-channel: 52.35.3%; averaged: 64.813.2%; deoxygenated hemoglobin: CSP-based: 72.313.0%; all-channel: 48.88.2%; averaged: 63.313.3%. Furthermore the effectiveness of the CSP method was also observed for the motor execution data to a lesser extent. A partial correlation analysis revealed significant independent contributions from all three types of features including the often-ignored variance feature. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of the CSP method for fNIRS-based motor imagery BCIs.
