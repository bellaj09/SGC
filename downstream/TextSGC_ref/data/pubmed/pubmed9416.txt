Automated segmentation of torso organs from positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT images is a prerequisite step for nuclear medicine image analysis. However accurate organ segmentation from clinical PET/CT is challenging due to the poor soft tissue contrast in the low-dose CT image and the low spatial resolution of the PET image. To overcome these challenges we developed a multi-atlas segmentation MAS framework for torso organ segmentation from 2-deoxy-2-18Ffluoro-D-glucose PET/CT images. Dual-modality multi-atlas segmentation of torso organs from 18FFDG-PET/CT images.
