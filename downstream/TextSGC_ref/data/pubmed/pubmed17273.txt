Immersive virtual reality IVR offers new possibilities to perform treatments in an ecological and interactive environment with multimodal online feedbacks. Sixteen school-aged children mean age 11\u2009\u20092.4 years with Bilateral CP-diplegia attending mainstream schools were recruited for a pilot study in a pre-post treatment experimental design. The intervention was\xa0focused on walking competences and endurance and performed by the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab GRAIL an innovative treadmill platform based on IVR. The participants underwent eighteen therapy sessions in 4 weeks. Functional evaluations instrumental measures including GAIT analysis and parental questionnaire were utilized to assess the treatment effects. Walking pattern stride length left and right side respectively p\u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.003; walking speed p\u2009=\u20090.001 endurance 6MWT p\u2009=\u20090.026 gross motor abilities GMFM-88 p\u2009=\u20090.041 and most kinematic and kinetic parameters significantly improved after the intervention. The changes were mainly predicted by age and cognitive abilities. The effect could have been due to the possibility of IVR to foster integration of motor/perceptual competences beyond the training of the walking ability giving a chance of improvement also to older and already treated children.
