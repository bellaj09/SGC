Local features are widely used in visual tracking to improve robustness in cases of partial occlusion deformation and rotation. This paper proposes a local fragment-based object tracking algorithm. Unlike many existing fragment-based algorithms that allocate the weights to each fragment this method firstly defines discrimination and uniqueness for local fragment and builds an automatic pre-selection of useful fragments for tracking. Then a Harris-SIFT filter is used to choose the current valid fragments excluding occluded or highly deformed fragments. Based on those valid fragments fragment-based color histogram provides a structured and effective description for the object. Finally the object is tracked using a valid fragment template combining the displacement constraint and similarity of each valid fragment. The object template is updated by fusing feature similarity and valid fragments which is scale-adaptive and robust to partial occlusion. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is accurate and robust in challenging scenarios. Robust Object Tracking Using Valid Fragments Selection.
