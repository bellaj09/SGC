"Conventional arthroscopic evaluation of articular cartilage is subjective and insufficient for assessing early compositional and structural changes during the progression of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Therefore in this study arthroscopic near-infrared NIR spectroscopy is introduced for the first time for in vivo evaluation of articular cartilage thickness proteoglycan PG content and collagen orientation angle. NIR spectra were acquired in vivo and in vitro from equine cartilage adjacent to experimental cartilage repair sites. As reference digital densitometry and polarized light microscopy were used to evaluate superficial and full-thickness PG content and collagen orientation angle. To relate NIR spectra and cartilage properties ensemble neural networks each with two different architectures were trained and evaluated by using Spearmans correlation analysis . The ensemble networks enabled accurate predictions for full-thickness reference properties PG content: in vitro Val=\u20090.691 in vivo=\u20090.676; collagen orientation angle: in vitro Val=\u20090.626 in vivo=\u20090.574 from NIR spectral data. In addition the networks enabled reliable prediction of PG content in superficial 25% cartilage in vitro Val=\u20090.650 in vivo=\u20090.613 and cartilage thickness in vitro Val=\u20090.797 in vivo=\u20090.596. To conclude NIR spectroscopy could enhance the detection of initial cartilage degeneration and thus enable demarcation of the boundary between healthy and compromised cartilage tissue\xa0during arthroscopic surgery."
