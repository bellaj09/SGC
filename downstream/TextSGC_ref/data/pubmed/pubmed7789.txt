Protein model quality assessment QA is a crucial and yet open problem in structural bioinformatics. The current best methods for single-model QA typically combine results from different approaches each based on different input features constructed by experts in the field. Then the prediction model is trained using a machine-learning algorithm. Recently with the development of convolutional neural networks CNN the training paradigm has changed. In computer vision the expert-developed features have been significantly overpassed by automatically trained convolutional filters. This motivated us to apply a three-dimensional 3D CNN to the problem of protein model QA. Protein model quality assessment using 3D oriented convolutional neural networks.
