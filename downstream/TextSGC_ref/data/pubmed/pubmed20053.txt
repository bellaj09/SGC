"We present a case in which a retrocondylar far-lateral approach was utilized to resect a hemangioblastoma at the craniocervical junction. The patient was a 33-year-old man presenting with 2 months of symptoms referable to compression at the craniocervical junction i.e. dizziness and gait instability. Though neurologically intact on exam his imaging demonstrated a highly vascular cystic lesion dorsolateral to the medulla on the left consistent with a hemangioblastoma. Virtual reality software was critical to visualize the patients lesion in relationship to the vertebral artery and draining vein  Fig. 1 . A far-lateral retrocondylar suboccipital craniectomy with a C1 hemilamiectomy permitted resection of this lesion. The operative strategy was to address the lesion similar to an arteriovenous malformation by detaching the lesion from its arterial feeders first and then addressing the lesions draining vein  Fig. 2 . Postoperative imaging demonstrated a gross-total resection and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. This case demonstrates not only the lateral reach of a retrocondylar far-lateral approach; but also clearly demonstrates an effective dissection strategy when approaching a hemangioblastoma.
