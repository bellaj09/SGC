We describe the main features and preliminary evaluation of Positive Technology a free mobile platform for the self-management of psychological stress http://positiveapp.info/. The mobile platform features three main components: i guided relaxation which provides the user with the opportunity of browsing a gallery of relaxation music and video-narrative resources for reducing stress; ii 3D biofeedback which helps the user learning to control his/her responses by visualizing variations of heart rate in an engaging 3D environment; iii stress tracking by the recording of heart rate and self-reports. We evaluated the Positive Technology app in an online trial involving 32 participants out of which 7 used the application in combination with the wrist sensor. Overall feedback from users was satisfactory and the analysis of data collected online indicated the capability of the app for reducing perceived stress levels. A future goal is to improve the usability of the application and include more advanced stress monitoring features based on the analysis of heart rate variability indexes.
