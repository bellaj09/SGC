"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA has funded innovative scientific research and technology developments in the field of brain-computer interfaces BCI since the 1970s. This review highlights some of DARPAs major advances in the field of BCI particularly those made in recent years. Two broad categories of DARPA programs are presented with respect to the ultimate goals of supporting the nations warfighters: 1 BCI efforts aimed at restoring neural and/or behavioral function and 2 BCI efforts aimed at improving human training and performance. The programs discussed are synergistic and complementary to one another and moreover promote interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers engineers and clinicians. Finally this review includes a summary of some of the remaining challenges for the field of BCI as well as the goals of new DARPA efforts in this domain."
