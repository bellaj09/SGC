"Current standard practice requires an invasive approach to the recording of electroencephalography EEG for epilepsy surgery deep brain stimulation DBS and brain-machine interfaces BMIs. The development of endovascular techniques offers a minimally invasive route to recording EEG from deep brain structures. This historical perspective aims to describe the technical progress in endovascular EEG by reviewing the first endovascular recordings made using a wire electrode which was followed by the development of nanowire and catheter recordings and finally the most recent progress in stent-electrode recordings. The technical progress in device technology over time and the development of the ability to record chronic intravenous EEG from electrode arrays is described. Future applications for the use of endovascular EEG in the preoperative and operative management of epilepsy surgery are then discussed followed by the possibility of the techniques future application in minimally invasive operative approaches to DBS and BMI."
