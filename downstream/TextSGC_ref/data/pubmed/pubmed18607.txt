Augmented reality AR in surgery consists in the fusion of synthetic computer-generated images 3D virtual model obtained from medical imaging preoperative workup and real-time patient images in order to visualize unapparent anatomical details. The 3D model could be used for a preoperative planning of the procedure. The potential of AR navigation as a tool to improve safety of the surgical dissection is outlined for robotic hepatectomy. Towards cybernetic surgery: robotic and augmented reality-assisted liver segmentectomy.
