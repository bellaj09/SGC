"Many neuroimaging studies focus on a frequency-specific or a multi-frequency network analysis showing that functional brain networks are disrupted in patients with Alzheimers disease AD. Although those studies enriched our knowledge of the impact of AD in brains functionality our goal is to test the effectiveness of combining neuroimaging with network neuroscience to predict with high accuracy subjects with mild cognitive impairment MCI that will convert to AD. In this study eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalography MEG recordings from 27 stable MCI sMCI and 27 progressive MCI pMCI from two scan sessions baseline and follow-up after approximately 3\u202fyears were projected via beamforming onto an atlas-based set of regions of interest ROIs. Dynamic functional connectivity networks were constructed independently for the five classical frequency bands while a multivariate phase-based coupling metric was adopted. Thus computing the distance between the fluctuation of functional strength of every pair of ROIs between the two conditions with dynamic time wrapping DTW a large set of features was extracted. A machine learning algorithm revealed 30 DTW-based features in the five frequency bands that can distinguish the sMCI from pMCI with absolute accuracy 100%. Further analysis of the selected links revealed that most of the connected ROIs were part of the default mode network DMN the cingulo-opercular CO the fronto-parietal and the sensorimotor network. Overall our dynamic network multi-frequency analysis approach provides an effective framework of constructing a sensitive MEG-based connectome biomarker for the prediction of conversion from MCI to Alzheimers disease."
