Functional brain network FBN has become very popular to analyze the interaction between cortical regions in the last decade. But researchers always spend a long time to search the best way to compute FBN for their specific studies. The purpose of this study is to detect the proficiency of operators during their mineral grinding process controlling based on FBN. To save the search time a novel semi-data-driven method of computing functional brain connection based on stacked autoencoder BCSAE is proposed in this paper. This method uses stacked autoencoder SAE to encode the multi-channel EEG data into codes and then computes the dissimilarity between the codes from every pair of electrodes to build FBN. The highlight of this method is that the SAE has a multi-layered structure and is semi-supervised which means it can dig deeper information and generate better features. Then an experiment was performed the EEG of the operators were collected while they were operating and analyzed to detect their proficiency. The results show that the BCSAE method generated more number of separable features with less redundancy and the average accuracy of classification 96.18% is higher than that of the control methods: PLV 92.19% and PLI 78.39%.
