The primary aim of this review was to synthesize the literature for studies investigating the use of computer simulation CS and virtual reality VR in undergraduate dental education in operative and restorative dentistry. The secondary aim was to list best practices that maximize the simulation experience in dental education. A literature review of the PubMed and ERIC databases was conducted using the search terms "Dental AND Simulator" "Dental AND Virtual reality" and "Simulation AND Dental education." Studies in English language were categorized into 1 of 5 themes: Manual dexterity and cavity preparation light curing skills simulation perception and experience predictability and simulation model development. Main practices of simulation education indicated in the McGaghie et\xa0al. critical review published in 2010 were used as a reference to identify common practices for dental simulation. Thirty nine of 579 identified abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Skill acquisition and feedback were the two most frequently investigated parameters found in the review. CS was efficient in teaching cavity preparation and light curing skills. Feedback and deliberate practice were among the best practices that should be emphasized in order to enhance the efficiency of the CS and VR simulation exercises. The use of CS is effective in teaching operative skills such as light curing and cavity preparation reliably; whereas the use of VR in undergraduate curricula is debatable. To achieve the maximum benefits of the simulation exercises emphasis must be given to the timely feedback and deliberate practice approaches.
