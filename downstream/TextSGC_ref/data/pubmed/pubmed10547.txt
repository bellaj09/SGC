Myelin imaging is a form of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging MRI that measures myelin content and can potentially allow demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis MS to be detected earlier. Although focal lesions are the most visible signs of MS pathology on conventional MRI it has been shown that even tissues that appear normal may exhibit decreased myelin content as revealed by myelin-specific images i.e. myelin maps. Current methods for analyzing myelin maps typically use global or regional mean myelin measurements to detect abnormalities but ignore finer spatial patterns that may be characteristic of MS. In this paper we present a machine learning method to automatically learn from multimodal MR images latent spatial features that can potentially improve the detection of MS pathology at early stage. More specifically 3D image patches are extracted from myelin maps and the corresponding T1-weighted T1w MRIs and are used to learn a latent joint myelin-T1w feature representation via unsupervised deep learning. Using a data set of images from MS patients and healthy controls a common set of patches are selected via a voxel-wise t-test performed between the two groups. In each MS image any patches overlapping with focal lesions are excluded and a feature imputation method is used to fill in the missing values. A feature selection process LASSO is then utilized to construct a sparse representation. The resulting normal-appearing features are used to train a random forest classifier. Using the myelin and T1w images of 55 relapse-remitting MS patients and 44 healthy controls in an 11-fold cross-validation experiment the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 87.9% SD\xa0=\xa08.4% which is higher and more consistent across folds than those attained by regional mean myelin 73.7% SD\xa0=\xa013.7% and T1w measurements 66.7% SD\xa0=\xa010.6% or deep-learned features in either the myelin 83.8% SD\xa0=\xa011.0% or T1w 70.1% SD\xa0=\xa013.6% images alone suggesting that the proposed method has strong potential for identifying image features that are more sensitive and specific to MS pathology in normal-appearing brain tissues.
