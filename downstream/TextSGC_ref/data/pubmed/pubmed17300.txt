The permafrost organic carbon OC stock is of global significance because of its large pool size and the potential positive feedback to climate warming. However due to the lack of systematic field observations and appropriate upscaling methodologies substantial uncertainties exist in the permafrost OC budget which limits our understanding of the fate of frozen carbon in a warming world. In particular the lack of comprehensive estimates of OC stocks across alpine permafrost means that current knowledge on this issue remains incomplete. Here we evaluated the pool size and spatial variations of permafrost OC stock to 3\xa0m depth on the Tibetan Plateau by combining systematic measurements from a substantial number of pedons i.e. 342 three-metre-deep cores and 177 50-cm-deep pits with a machine learning technique i.e. support vector machine SVM. We also quantified uncertainties in permafrost carbon budget by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. Our results revealed that the combination of systematic measurements with the SVM model allowed spatially explicit estimates to be made. The OC density OC amount per unit area OCD exhibited a decreasing trend from the south-eastern to the north-western plateau with the exception that OCD in the swamp meadow was substantially higher than that in surrounding regions. Our results also demonstrated that Tibetan permafrost stored a large amount of OC in the top 3\xa0m with the median OC pool size being 15.31 Pg C interquartile range: 13.03-17.77\xa0Pg C. 44% of OC occurred in deep layers i.e. 100-300\xa0cm close to the proportion observed across the northern circumpolar permafrost region. The large carbon pool size together with significant permafrost thawing suggests a risk of carbon emissions and positive climate feedback across the Tibetan alpine permafrost region.
