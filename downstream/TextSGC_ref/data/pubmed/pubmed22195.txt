Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs for disabled people should allow them to use all their remaining functionalities as control possibilities. Sometimes these people have residual activity of their muscles most likely in the morning when they are not exhausted. In this work we fuse electromyographic EMG with electroencephalographic EEG activity in the framework of a so called "Hybrid-BCI" hBCI approach. Thereby subjects could achieve a good control of their hBCI independently of their level of muscular fatigue. Furthermore although EMG alone yields good performance it is outperformed by the hybrid fusing of EEG and EMG. Two different fusion techniques are explored showing graceful performance degradation in the case of signal attenuation. Such a system allows a very reliable control and a smooth handover if the subjects get exhausted or fatigued during the day. Multimodal fusion of muscle and brain signals for a hybrid-BCI.
