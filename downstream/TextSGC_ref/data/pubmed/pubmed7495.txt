The development of whole slide scanners has revolutionized the field of digital pathology. Unfortunately whole slide scanners often produce images with out-of-focus/blurry areas that limit the amount of tissue available for a pathologist to make accurate diagnosis/prognosis. Moreover these artifacts hamper the performance of computerized image analysis systems. These areas are typically identified by visual inspection which leads to a subjective evaluation causing high intra- and inter-observer variability. Moreover this process is both tedious and time-consuming. The aim of this study is to develop a deep learning based software called DeepFocus which can automatically detect and segment blurry areas in digital whole slide images to address these problems. DeepFocus is built on TensorFlow an open source library that exploits data flow graphs for efficient numerical computation. DeepFocus was trained by using 16 different H&E and IHC-stained slides that were systematically scanned on nine different focal planes generating 216000 samples with varying amounts of blurriness. When trained and tested on two independent datasets DeepFocus resulted in an average accuracy of 93.2%  9.6% which is a 23.8% improvement over an existing method. DeepFocus has the potential to be integrated with whole slide scanners to automatically re-scan problematic areas hence improving the overall image quality for pathologists and image analysis algorithms.
