Amputees who wish to rid themselves of a phantom limb must weaken the neural representation of the absent limb. Conversely amputees who wish to replace a lost limb must assimilate a neuroprosthetic with the existing neural representation. Whether we wish to remove a phantom limb or assimilate a synthetic one we will benefit from knowing more about the developmental process that enables embodiment. A potentially critical contributor to that process is the spontaneous activity - in the form of limb twitches - that occurs exclusively and abundantly during active REM sleep a particularly prominent state in early development. The sensorimotor circuits activated by twitching limbs and the developmental context in which activation occurs could provide a roadmap for creating neuroprosthetics that feel as if they are part of the body.
