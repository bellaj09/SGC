Most electroencephalography EEG based emotion recognition systems make use of videos and images as stimuli. Few used sounds and even fewer studies were found involving self-induced emotions. Furthermore most of the studies rely on single stimuli to evoke emotions. The question of "whether different stimuli for same emotion elicitation generate any subject-independent correlations" remains unanswered. This paper introduces a dual modality based emotion elicitation paradigm to investigate if emotions can be classified induced with different stimuli. A method has been proposed based on common spatial pattern CSP and linear discriminant analysis LDA to analyze human brain signals for fear emotions evoked with two different stimuli. Self-induced emotional imagery is one of the considered stimuli while audio/video clips are used as the other stimuli. The method extracts features from the CSP algorithm and LDA performs classification. To investigate associated EEG correlations a spectral analysis was performed. To further improve the performance CSP was compared with other regularized techniques. Critical EEG channels are identified based on spatial filter weights. To the best of our knowledge our work provides the first contribution for the assessment of EEG correlations in the case of self versus video induced emotions captured with a commercial grade EEG device.
