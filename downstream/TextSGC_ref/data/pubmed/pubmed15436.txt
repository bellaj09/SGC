"Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials SEPs recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing. Consequently this fundamental information has furthered our understanding of the maladaptive plasticity changes related to pathophysiology of diseases characterized by abnormal movements such as Parkinsons disease dystonia and functional movement disorders."
