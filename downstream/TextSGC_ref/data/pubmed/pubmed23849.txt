Tabletop inanimate trainers have proven to be a safe inexpensive and convenient platform for developing laparoscopic skills. Historically programs that utilize these trainers rely on subjective evaluation of errors and time as the only measures of performance. Virtual reality simulators offer more extensive data collection capability but they are expensive and lack realism. This study reviews a new electronic proctor EP and its performance within the Rosser Top Gun Laparoscopic Skills and Suturing Program. This "hybrid" training device seeks to capture the strengths of both platforms by providing an affordable reliable realistic training arena with metrics to objectively evaluate performance. The use of a "hybrid" trainer in an established laparoscopic skills program.
