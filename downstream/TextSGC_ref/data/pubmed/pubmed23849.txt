Thought-controlled neuroprostheses could allow paralyzed patients to interact with the external world using brain waves. Thus far the fastest and more accurate control of neuroprostheses is achieved through direct recordings of neural activity Nicolelis M.A. 2001. Actions from thoughts.

Here we discuss some approaches that could enhance the speed and accuracy of non-invasive devices namely 1 enlarging the spectral analysis to include higher frequency oscillations able to transmit substantial information over short analysis windows; 2 using spectral analysis procedures that minimize the variance of the estimates; and 3 transforming EEG recorded activity into local field potential estimates eLFP. Theoretical and experimental arguments are used to explain why it is erroneous to think that scalp EEG cannot sense high frequency oscillations and how this might hinders further developments. We further illustrate how non-invasive eLFPs derived from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram EEG can be combined with robust broad band spectral analysis to accurately detect off-line the laterality of upcoming hand movements. Interestingly the use of pattern recognition to select the brain voxels differentially engaged by the explored tasks leads to sound neural activation images. Consequently our results indicate that both research lines i.e. neuroprosthetics and electrical neuroimaging might effectively benefit from their mutual interaction.
