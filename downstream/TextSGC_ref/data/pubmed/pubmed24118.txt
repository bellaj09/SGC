"The application of virtual reality technologies VRTs for users with autism spectrum disorder ASD has been studied for decades. However a gap remains in our understanding surrounding VRT head-mounted displays HMDs. As newly designed HMDs have become commercially available in this study the Oculus Rift the need to investigate newer devices is immediate. This study explored willingness acceptance sense of presence and immersion of ASD participants. Results revealed that all 29 participants mean age\xa0=\xa032; 33\xa0% with IQ\xa0<\xa070 were willing to wear the HMD. The majority of the participants reported an enjoyable experience high levels of presence and were likely to use HMDs again. IQ was found to be independent of the willingness to use HMDs and related VRT immersion experience." Brief Report: A Pilot Study of the Use of a Virtual Reality Headset in Autism Populations.
