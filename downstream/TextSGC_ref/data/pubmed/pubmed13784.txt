Among biometric recognition systems such as fingerprint finger-vein or face the iris recognition system has proven to be effective for achieving a high recognition accuracy and security level. However several recent studies have indicated that an iris recognition system can be fooled by using presentation attack images that are recaptured using high-quality printed images or by contact lenses with printed iris patterns. As a result this potential threat can reduce the security level of an iris recognition system. In this study we propose a new presentation attack detection PAD method for an iris recognition system iPAD using a near infrared light NIR camera image. To detect presentation attack images we first localized the iris region of the input iris image using circular edge detection CED. Based on the result of iris localization we extracted the image features using deep learning-based and handcrafted-based methods. The input iris images were then classified into real and presentation attack categories using support vector machines SVM. Through extensive experiments with two public datasets we show that our proposed method effectively solves the iris recognition presentation attack detection problem and produces detection accuracy superior to previous studies.
