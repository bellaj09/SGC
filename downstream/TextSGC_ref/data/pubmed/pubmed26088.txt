Gender differences in cognitive and behavioral performance have been reported throughout the psychological literature. Consequently gender differences should be considered and controlled for when cognitive research is conducted in virtual environments VEs. These variables may include gender-related differences in cognitive performance susceptibility for cybersickness and the impact of sex hormones on cognition. Such issues are addressed in the context of a recent VE study of the visuospatial ability referred to as mental rotation. The Mental Rotation Test MRT a paper and pencil measure has been shown to produce one of the largest gender differences in the cognitive literature. The outcomes of the MRT are in favor of males. However results reported from a Virtual Reality Spatial Rotation VRSR test demonstrate no gender differences when subjects were able to manually manipulate the stimuli in a VE. Further analysis uncovers gender differences in the patterns of associations between verbal and spatial tasks and performance on VRSR. Results are discussed in terms of dimensionality factors and hemispheric lateralization. Gender issues in the use of virtual environments.
