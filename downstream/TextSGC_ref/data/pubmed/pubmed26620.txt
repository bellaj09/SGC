"Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI are systems originally developed to assist paralyzed patients allowing for commands to the computer with brain activities. This study aims to examine cognitive state with an objective easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret method utilizing Brain-Computer Interface systems. Seventy healthy participants completed six tasks using a Brain-Computer Interface system and participants pupil dilation blink rate and Galvanic Skin Response GSR data were collected simultaneously. Participants filled Nasa-TLX forms following each task and task performances of participants were also measured. Cognitive state clusters were created from the data collected using the K-means method. Taking these clusters and task performances into account the general cognitive state of each participant was classified as low risk or high risk. Logistic Regression Decision Tree and Neural Networks were also used to classify the same data in order to measure the consistency of this classification with other techniques and the method provided a consistency between 87.1% and 100% with other techniques." Classification of BCI Users Based on Cognition.
