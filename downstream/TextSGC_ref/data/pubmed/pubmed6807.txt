Recently machine learning especially deep learning has been a core algorithm to be widely used in many fields such as natural language processing speech recognition object recognition and so on. At the same time another trend is that more and more applications are moved to wearable and mobile devices. However traditional deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network CNN and its variants consume a lot of memory resources. In this case these powerful deep learning methods are difficult to apply on mobile memory-limited platforms. In order to solve this problem we present a novel memory-management strategy called mmCNN in this paper. With the help of this method we can easily deploy a trained large-size CNN on any memory size platform such as GPU FPGA or memory-limited mobile devices. In our experiments we run a feed-forward CNN process in some extremely small memory sizes as low as 5\u2009MB on a GPU platform. The result shows that our method saves more than 98% memory compared to a traditional CNN algorithm and further saves more than 90% compared to the state-of-the-art related work "vDNNs" virtualized deep neural networks. Our work in this paper improves the computing scalability of lightweight applications and breaks the memory bottleneck of using deep learning method on memory-limited devices.
