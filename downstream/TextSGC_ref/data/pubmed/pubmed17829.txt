It is recognised that Visual Impact Assessment VIA unlike many other aspects of Environmental Impact Assessments EIA relies less upon measurement than upon experience and judgement. Hence it is necessary for a more structured and consistent approach towards VIA reducing the amount of bias and subjectivity. For proposed developments there are very few quantitative techniques for the evaluation of visibility and these existing methods can be highly inaccurate and time consuming. Percentage view changes are one of the few quantitative techniques and the use of computer technology can reduce the inaccuracy and the time spent evaluating the visibility of either existing or proposed developments. For over 10 years research work undertaken by the authors at the University of Nottingham has employed Computer Graphics CG and Virtual Reality VR in civilian and industrial contexts for environmental planning design visualisation accident reconstruction risk analysis data visualisation and training simulators. This paper describes a method to quantitatively assess the visual impact of proposed developments on the landscape using CG techniques. This method allows the determination of accurate percentage view changes with the use of a computer-generated model of the environment and the application of specialist software that has been developed at the University of Nottingham. The principles are easy to understand and therefore planners authorisation agencies and members of the public can use and understand the results. A case study is shown to demonstrate the application and the capabilities of the technology. The use of virtual environments for percentage view analysis.
