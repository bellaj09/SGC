The Pyramidal Neural Networks PNN are an example of a successful recently proposed model inspired by the human visual system and deep learning theory. PNNs are applied to computer vision and based on the concept of receptive fields. This paper proposes a variation of PNN named here as Structured Pyramidal Neural Network SPNN. SPNN has self-adaptive variable receptive fields while the original PNNs rely on the same size for the fields of all neurons which limits the model since it is not possible to put more computing resources in a particular region of the image. Another limitation of the original approach is the need to define values for a reasonable number of parameters which can turn difficult the application of PNNs in contexts in which the user does not have experience. On the other hand SPNN has a fewer number of parameters. Its structure is determined using a novel method with Delaunay Triangulation and k-means clustering. SPNN achieved better results than PNNs and similar performance when compared to Convolutional Neural Network CNN and Support Vector Machine SVM but using lower memory capacity and processing time.
