"Current commercial tractor guidance systems present to the driver information to perform agricultural tasks in the best way. This information generally includes a treated zones map referenced to the tractors position. Unlike actual guidance systems where the tractor driver must mentally associate treated zone maps and the plot layout this paper presents a guidance system that using Augmented Reality AR technology allows the tractor driver to see the real plot though eye monitor glasses with the treated zones in a different color. The paper includes a description of the system hardware and software a real test done with image captures seen by the tractor driver and a discussion predicting that the historical evolution of guidance systems could involve the use of AR technology in the agricultural guidance and monitoring systems." Design and implementation of a GPS guidance system for agricultural tractors using augmented reality technology.
