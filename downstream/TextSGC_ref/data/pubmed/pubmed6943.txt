Nuclei detection is often a critical initial step in the development of computer aided diagnosis and prognosis schemes in the context of digital pathology images. While over the last few years a number of nuclei detection methods have been proposed most of these approaches make idealistic assumptions about the staining quality of the tissue. In this paper we present a new Multi-Pass Adaptive Voting MPAV for nuclei detection which is specifically geared towards images with poor quality staining and noise on account of tissue preparation artifacts. The MPAV utilizes the symmetric property of nuclear boundary and adaptively selects gradient from edge fragments to perform voting for a potential nucleus location. The MPAV was evaluated in three cohorts with different staining methods: Hematoxylin &Eosin CD31 &Hematoxylin and Ki-67 and where most of the nuclei were unevenly and imprecisely stained. Across a total of 47 images and nearly 17700 manually labeled nuclei serving as the ground truth MPAV was able to achieve a superior performance with an area under the precision-recall curve AUC of 0.73. Additionally MPAV also outperformed three state-of-the-art nuclei detection methods a single pass voting method a multi-pass voting method and a deep learning based method.
