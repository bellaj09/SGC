We have performed the comparative spectral analysis of structural connectomes for various organisms using open-access data. Our results indicate new peculiar features of connectomes of higher organisms. We found that the spectral density of adjacency matrices of human connectome has maximal deviation from the one of randomized network compared to other organisms. Considering the network evolution induced by the preference of 3-cycles formation we discovered that for macaque and human connectomes the evolution with the conservation of local clusterization is crucial while for primitive organisms the conservation of averaged clusterization is sufficient. Investigating for the first time the level spacing distribution of the spectrum of human connectome Laplacian matrix we explicitly demonstrate that the spectral statistics corresponds to the critical regime which is hybrid of Wigner-Dyson and Poisson distributions. This observation provides strong support for debated statement of the brain criticality. Spectral peculiarity and criticality of a human connectome.
