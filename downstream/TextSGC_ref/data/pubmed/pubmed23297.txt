Historically cerebral processing has been conceptualized as a framework based on statically localized functions. However a growing amount of evidence supports a hodotopical delocalized and flexible organization. A number of studies have reported absence of a permanent neurological deficit after massive surgical resections of eloquent brain tissue. These results highlight the tremendous plastic potential of the brain. Understanding anatomo-functional correlates underlying this cerebral reorganization is a prerequisite to restore brain functions through brain-computer interfaces BCIs in patients with cerebral diseases or even to potentiate brain functions in healthy individuals. Here we review current knowledge of neural networks that could be utilized in the BCIs that enable movements and language. To this end intraoperative electrical stimulation in awake patients provides valuable information on the cerebral functional maps their connectomics and plasticity. Overall these studies indicate that the complex cerebral circuitry that underpins interactions between action cognition and behavior should be throughly investigated before progress in BCI approaches can be achieved.
