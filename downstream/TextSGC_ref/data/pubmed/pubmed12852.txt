The arc of drug discovery entails a multiparameter optimization problem spanning vast length scales. The key parameters range from solubility angstroms to protein-ligand binding nanometers to in vivo toxicity meters. Through feature learning-instead of feature engineering-deep neural networks promise to outperform both traditional physics-based and knowledge-based machine learning models for predicting molecular properties pertinent to drug discovery. To this end we present the PotentialNet family of graph convolutions. These models are specifically designed for and achieve state-of-the-art performance for protein-ligand binding affinity. We further validate these deep neural networks by setting new standards of performance in several ligand-based tasks. In parallel we introduce a new metric the Regression Enrichment Factor EF R to measure the early enrichment of computational models for chemical data. Finally we introduce a cross-validation strategy based on structural homology clustering that can more accurately measure model generalizability which crucially distinguishes the aims of machine learning for drug discovery from standard machine learning tasks.
