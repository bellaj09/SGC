Several lines of evidence suggest that Virtual Reality VR has a potential utility in eating disorders. The objective of this study is to review the literature on the use of VR in bulimia nervosa BN and binge eating disorder BED. Using PRISMA Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement for reporting systematic reviews we performed a PubMed Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS search to identify studies employing VR in the assessment and treatment of BN and BED. The following search terms were used: "virtual reality" "eating disorders" "binge eating" and "bulimia nervosa". From the 420 articles identified 19 were selected nine investigated VR in assessment and 10 were treatment studies one case-report two non-controlled and six randomized controlled trials. The studies using VR in BN and BED are at an early stage. However considering the available evidence the use of VR in the assessment of those conditions showed some promise in identifying: 1 how those patients experienced their body image; and 2 environments or specific kinds of foods that may trigger binge-purging cycle. Some studies using VR-based environments associated to cognitive behavioral techniques showed their potential utility in improving motivation for change self-esteem body image disturbances and in reducing binge eating and purging behavior.
