We reported that tinnitus patients showed reduced levels of auditory functional connectivity FC in comparison with normal hearing control subjects and that we succeeded in objective diagnosis of tinnitus with 86% sensitivity and 74% specificity by focusing only on auditory-related FC. However the age-related change of auditory FC is not clarified. In this study we examine age-related change of the auditory FC using the database of Human Connectome Project HCP and compared with our database of tinnitus patients. Age-related change of auditory functional connectivity in Human Connectome Project data and tinnitus patients.
