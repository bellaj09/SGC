In this paper we present a novel deep learning architecture for infrared and visible images fusion problem. In contrast to conventional convolutional networks our encoding network is combined by convolutional layers fusion layer and dense block in which the output of each layer is connected to every other layer. We attempt to use this architecture to get more useful features from source images in encoding process. And two fusion layersfusion strategies are designed to fuse these features. Finally the fused image is reconstructed by decoder. Compared with existing fusion methods the proposed fusion method achieves state-of-the-art performance in objective and subjective assessment.
