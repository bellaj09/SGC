Recent research has demonstrated the use of the structural connectome as a powerful tool to characterize the network architecture of the brain and potentially generate biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In particular the anatomic embedding of the edges of the cerebral graph have been postulated to elucidate the relative importance of white matter tracts to the overall network connectivity explaining the varying effects of localized white matter pathology on cognition and behavior. Here we demonstrate the use of a linear diffusion model to quantify the impact of these perturbations on brain connectivity. We show that the eigenmodes governing the dynamics of this model are strongly conserved between healthy subjects regardless of cortical and sub-cortical parcellations but show significant interpretable deviations in improperly developed brains. More specifically we investigated the effect of agenesis of the corpus callosum AgCC one of the most common brain malformations to identify differences in the effect of virtual corpus callosotomies and the neurodevelopmental disorder itself. These findings including the strong correspondence between regions of highest importance from graph eigenmodes of network diffusion and nexus regions of white matter from edge density imaging show converging evidence toward understanding the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome. Brain network eigenmodes provide a robust and compact representation of the structural connectome in health and disease.
