The existence of the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus SFOF in the human brain remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to clarify the existence course and terminations of the SFOF. High angular diffusion spectrum imaging DSI analysis was performed on six healthy adults and on a template of 842 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. To verify tractography results we performed fiber microdissections of four post-mortem human brains. Based on DSI tractography we reconstructed the SFOF in the subjects and the template from the Human Connectome Project that originated from the rostral and medial parts of the superior and middle frontal gyri. By tractography we found that the fibers formed a compact fascicle at the level of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle coursing above the head of caudate nucleus medial to the corona radiate and under the corpus callosum CC and terminated at the parietal region via the lower part of the caudate nucleus. We consider that this fiber bundle observed by tractography is the SFOF although it terminates mainly at the parietal region rather than occipital lobe. By contrast we were unable to identify a fiber bundle corresponding to the SFOF in our fiber dissection study. Although we did not provide definite evidence of the SFOF in the human brain these findings may be useful for future studies in this field.
