Translating and integrating scholarship into practice is a difficult concept for students to embrace through a passive education model. Therefore innovative teaching strategies were integrated into a translational science course for online graduate nursing students. The purpose of this project was to increase understanding of the research process and stimulate interest in translating nursing evidence into practice. The result was an effective educational strategy for teaching and learning about the research process in a virtual environment. A Process for Teaching Research Methods in a Virtual Environment.
