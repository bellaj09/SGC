"In this study we propose a compact lightweight scanning fiber microdisplay towards virtual and augmented reality applications. Our design that is tailored as a head-worn-display simply consists of a four-quadrant piezoelectric tube actuator through which a fiber optics cable is extended and actuated and a reflective or semi-reflective ellipsoidal surface that relays the moving tip of the fiber onto the viewers retina. The proposed display offers significant advantages in terms of architectural simplicity form-factor fabrication complexity and cost over other fiber scanner and MEMS mirror counterparts towards practical realization. We demonstrate the display of various patterns with VGA resolution and further provide analytical formulas for mechanical and optical constraints to compare the performance of the proposed scanning fiber microdisplay with that of MEMS mirror-based microdisplays. Also we discuss the road steps towards improving the performance of the proposed scanning fiber microdisplay to high-definition video formats such as HD1440 which is beyond what has been achieved by MEMS mirror based laser scanning displays."
