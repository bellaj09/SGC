"Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a complex multifaceted disorder encompassing behavioral emotional cognitive and physiological factors. Although PTSD was only codified in 1980 there has been an increasing interest in this area of research. Unfortunately relatively little attention has been given to the psychological treatment of motor vehicle accident survivors which is remarkable because vehicular collisions are deemed the number one cause of PTSD. As the emotional consequences of vehicular collisions prevail so does the need for more effective treatments. Randomized controlled clinical trials have identified exposure-based therapies as being the most efficacious for extinguishing fears. One type of exposure-based treatment called virtual reality exposure therapy VRET provides a safe controlled and effective therapeutic alternative that is not dependent on real-life props situations or even a persons imagination capabilities. This modality while relatively new has been implemented successfully in the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders and may offer a particularly beneficial and intermediary step for the treatment of collision-related PTSD. In particular VRET combined with physiological monitoring and feedback provides a unique opportunity for individuals to objectively recognize both anxiety and relaxation; learn how to manage their anxiety during difficult albeit simulated driving conditions; and then transfer these skills onto real-life roadways."
