"Iridescence is an original type of colouration that is relatively widespread in nature but has been either incompletely described or entirely neglected in prokaryotes. Recently we reported a brilliant pointillistic iridescence in agar-grown colony biofilms of Cellulophaga lytica and some other marine Flavobacteria that exhibit gliding motility. Bacterial iridescence is created by a unique self-organization of sub-communities of cells but the mechanisms underlying such living photonic crystals are unknown. In this study we used Petri dish assays to screen a large panel of potential activators or inhibitors of C. lyticas iridescence. Derivatives potentially interfering with quorum-sensing and other communication or biofilm formation processes were tested as well as metabolic poisons or algal exoproducts. We identified an indole derivative 5-hydroxyindole 5HI 250\u2009M which inhibited both gliding and iridescence at the colonial level. 5HI did not affect growth or cell respiration. At the microscopic level phase-contrast imaging confirmed that 5HI inhibits the gliding motility of cells. Moreover the lack of iridescence correlated with a perturbation of self-organization of the cell sub-communities in both the WT and a gliding-negative mutant. This effect was proved using recent advances in machine learning deep neuronal networks. In addition to its effect on colony biofilms 5HI was found to stimulate biofilm formation in microplates. Our data are compatible with possible roles of 5HI or marine analogues in the eco-biology of iridescent bacteria." Colony analysis and deep learning uncover 5-hydroxyindole as an inhibitor of gliding motility and iridescence in Cellulophaga lytica.
