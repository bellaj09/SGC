"In this paper we propose an approach towards an infinite surface haptic display. Our approach named ENcountered-Type ROtating Prop Approach ENTROPiA is based on a cylindrical spinning prop attached to a robots end-effector serving as an encountered-type haptic display ETHD. This type of haptic display permits the users to have an unconstrained free-hand contact with a surface being provided by a robotic device for the users to encounter a surface to be touched. In our approach the sensation of touching a virtual surface is given by an interaction technique that couples with the sliding movement of the prop under the users finger by tracking their hand location and establishing a path to be explored. This approach enables large motion for a larger surface rendering permits to render multi-textured haptic feedback and leverages the ETHD approach introducing large motion and sliding/friction sensations. As a part of our contribution a proof of concept was designed for illustrating our approach. A user study was conducted to assess the perception of our approach showing a significant performance for rendering the sensation of touching a large flat surface. Our approach could be used to render large haptic surfaces in applications such as rapid prototyping for automobile design."
