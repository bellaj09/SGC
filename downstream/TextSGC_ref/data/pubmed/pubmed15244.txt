Breast cancer intrinsic molecular subtype IMS as classified by the expression-based PAM50 assay is considered a strong prognostic feature even when controlled for by standard clinicopathological features such as age grade and nodal status yet the molecular testing required to elucidate these subtypes is not routinely performed. Furthermore when such bulk assays as RNA sequencing are performed intratumoral heterogeneity that may affect prognosis and therapeutic decision-making can be missed. A deep learning image-based intrinsic molecular subtype classifier of breast tumors reveals tumor heterogeneity that may affect survival.
