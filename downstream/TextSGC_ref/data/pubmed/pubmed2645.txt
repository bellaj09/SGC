Variations in the fat mass and obesity-associated FTO gene are linked to obesity. However the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which these genetic variants influence obesity behavior and brain are unknown. Given that Fto regulates D2/3R signaling in mice we tested in humans whether variants in FTO would interact with a variant in the ANKK1 gene which alters D2R signaling and is also associated with obesity. In a behavioral and fMRI study we demonstrate that gene variants of FTO affect dopamine D2-dependent midbrain brain responses to reward learning and behavioral responses associated with learning from negative outcome in humans. Furthermore dynamic causal modeling confirmed that FTO variants modulate the connectivity in a basic reward circuit of meso-striato-prefrontal regions suggesting a mechanism by which genetic predisposition alters reward processing not only in obesity but also in other disorders with altered D2R-dependent impulse control such as addiction. Significance statement: Variations in the fat mass and obesity-associated FTO gene are associated with obesity. Here we demonstrate that variants of FTO affect dopamine-dependent midbrain brain responses and learning from negative outcomes in humans during a reward learning task. Furthermore FTO variants modulate the connectivity in a basic reward circuit of meso-striato-prefrontal regions suggesting a mechanism by which genetic vulnerability in reward processing can increase predisposition to obesity.
