When people see a life-sized virtual body VB from first person perspective in virtual reality they are likely to have the perceptual illusion that it is their body. Additionally such virtual embodiment can lead to changes in perception implicit attitudes and behaviour based on attributes of the VB. To date the changes that have been studied are as a result of being embodied in a body representative of particular social groups e.g. children and other race. In our experiment participants alternately switched between a VB closely resembling themselves where they described a personal problem and a VB representing Dr Sigmund Freud from which they offered themselves counselling. Here we show that when the counsellor resembles Freud participants improve their mood compared to the counsellor being a self-representation. The improvement was greater when the Freud VB moved synchronously with the participant compared to asynchronously. Synchronous VB movement was associated with a much stronger illusion of ownership over the Freud body. This suggests that this form of embodied perspective taking can lead to sufficient detachment from habitual ways of thinking about personal problems so as to improve the outcome and demonstrates the power of virtual body ownership to effect cognitive changes.
