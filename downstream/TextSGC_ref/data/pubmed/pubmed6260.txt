Future advances in the auditory systems are difficult to predict and only educated guesses are possible. It is expected that innovative technologies in the field of neuroscience will be applied to the auditory system. Optogenetics Brainbow and CLARITY will improve our knowledge of the working of neural auditory networks and the relationship between sound and language providing a dynamic picture of the brain in action. CLARITY makes brain tissue transparent and offers a three-dimensional view of neural networks which combined with genetically labeling neurons with multiple distinct colors Optogenetics will provide detailed information of the complex brain system. Molecular functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI will allow the study of neurotransmitters detectable by MRI and their function in the auditory pathways. The Human Connectome project will study the patterns of distributed brain activity that underlie virtually all aspects of cognition and behavior and determine if abnormalities in the distributed patterns of activity may result in hearing and behavior disorders. Similarly the programs of Big Brain and ENIGMA will improve our understanding of auditory disorders. New stem-cell therapy and gene therapies therapy may bring about a partial restoration of hearing for impaired patients by inducing regeneration of cochlear hair cells. Future advances.
