NeuroVR 1.5 is a cost-free virtual reality platform based on open-source components allowing professionals to easily modify a virtual world to best suit the needs of the clinical setting. The goal of the present project is to extend the functionalities of this platform by allowing users to interact with the virtual environment by using gestures detected by a webcam. To this end we used CamSpace Beta 7 a cost-free and user-friendly computer vision technology. We describe how this integrated approach can be used to implement cognitive and motor training programs involving partial or full-body movements.
