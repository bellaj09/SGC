Recent studies in primate neurophysiology have focused on decoding multi-joint kinematics from single unit and local field potential recordings. However the extent to which these results can be generalized to human subjects is not known. We have recorded simultaneous electrocorticographic ECoG and hand kinematics in a human subject performing reach-grasp-hold of objects varying in shape and size. All Spectral features in various gamma bands 30-50 Hz 70-100 Hz and 100-150 Hz frequency bands were able to predict the time course of grasp aperture with high correlation max r = 0.80 using as few as one ECoG feature from a single electrode max r for single feature = 0.75 in single trials without prior knowledge of task timing. These results suggest that the population activity captured with ECoG contains information about coordinated finger movements that potentially can be exploited to control advanced upper limb neuroprosthetics.
