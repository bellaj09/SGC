The parcellation of the human cortex into meaningful anatomical units is a common step of various neuroimaging studies. There have been multiple successful efforts to process magnetic resonance MR brain images automatically and identify specific anatomical regions following atlases defined from cortical landmarks. Those definitions usually rely first on a high-quality brain surface reconstruction. On the other hand when high accuracy is not a requirement simpler methods based on warping a probabilistic atlas have been widely adopted. Here we develop a cortical parcellation method for MR brain images based on Convolutional Neural Networks ConvNets a machine-learning method with the goal of automatically transferring the knowledge obtained from surface analyses onto something directly applicable on simpler volume data. We train a ConvNet on a large thousand set of cortical ribbons of multiple MRI cohorts to reproduce parcellations obtained from a surface method in this case FreeSurfer. Further to make the model applicable in a broader context we force the model to generalize to unseen segmentations. The model is evaluated on unseen data of unseen cohorts. We characterize the behavior of the model during learning and quantify its reliance on the dataset itself which tends to give support for the necessity of large training sets augmentation and multiple contrasts. Overall ConvNets can provide an efficient way to parcel MRI images following the guidance established within more complex methods quickly and accurately. The trained model is embedded within a open-source parcellation tool available at https://github.com/bthyreau/parcelcortex.
