Endovascular neurosurgery has gained acceptance as the best method of treatment of vascular abnormalities like cerebral aneurysms. However the procedure is associated with difficulties in tool/tissue manipulation. Navigation of stent catheter and guide wire through complex arteries without any force information often causes stent snagging plaque dislocations and formation of thrombosis caused by the damage of the arterial wall. Currently there is no haptic device available which can provide the surgeons with the force information related to stent placement procedure. The goal of this work is to create a data base for a fast synthetic endovascular force simulator which will provide the surgeon with force information during tool-artery interaction based on the various combinations of tool sizes and vessel complexity 1 2 to facilitate better preoperative planning safer interventions and advanced training of new surgeons. Evaluating tool-artery interaction force during endovascular neurosurgery for developing haptic engine.
