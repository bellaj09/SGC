Hyporheic exchange is the interaction of river water and groundwater and is difficult to predict. One of the largest contributions to predictive uncertainty for hyporheic exchange has been attributed to the representation of heterogeneous subsurface properties. Our study evaluates the trade-offs between intrinsic irreducible and epistemic reducible model errors when choosing between homogeneous and highly complex subsurface parameter structures. We modeled the Steinlach River Test Site in Southwest Germany using a fully coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate hyporheic exchange and to assess the predictive errors and uncertainties of transit time distributions. A highly parameterized model was built treated as a "virtual reality" and used as a reference. We found that if the parameter structure is too simple it will be limited by intrinsic model errors. By increasing subsurface complexity through the addition of zones or heterogeneity we can begin to exchange intrinsic for epistemic errors. Thus the appropriate level of detail to represent the subsurface depends on the acceptable range of intrinsic structural errors for the given modeling objectives and the available site data. We found that a zonated model is capable of reproducing the transit time distributions of a more detailed model but only if the geological structures are known. An interpolated heterogeneous parameter field cf. pilot points showed the best trade-offs between the two errors indicating fitness for practical applications. Parameter fields generated by multiple-point geostatistics MPS produce transit time distributions with the largest uncertainties however these are reducible by additional hydrogeological data particularly flux measurements.
