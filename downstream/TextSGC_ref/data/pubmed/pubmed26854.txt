A novel method for motor imagery MI electroencephalogram EEG data classification is proposed in this study. Time-frequency representation is constructed by means of continuous wavelet transform from EEG signals and then weighted with 2-sample t-statistics which are also used to automatically select the area of interest in advance. Finally normalized cross-correlation is used to discriminate the test MI data. Compared with the nonweighted version on MI data the experimental results indicate that the proposed system achieves satisfactory results in the applications of brain-computer interface BCI.
