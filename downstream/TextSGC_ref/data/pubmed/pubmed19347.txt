"The new computer-based interactive technologies in medicine such as virtual reality VR have revolutionized education. The use of virtual microscopic images would be invaluable in the training of cyto-histopathologists. However due to the vast amount of digital information on a scanned conventional cyto-histological slide which is enormous by current data storage standards these systems are expensive and not widely used in pathological medicine. The authors propose an inexpensive system based on quicktime virtual reality QTVR technology by Apple Computers Inc. which accommodates a wide area of a slide at high magnification generating a virtual slide which makes it possible to navigate by conventional input devices. Commercial softwares that stitch consecutive adjacent images of cyto-histological preparations onto a QTVR panorama were used. QTVR files have the ability to stand on their own as self-contained multimedia applications and also have the ability to generate multinode scenes by means of hot spots. QTVR movies can be played on Macintosh or Windows platforms and on major web browsers. Virtual slides by QTVR is an inexpensive system of high educational value which allows the creation of multimedia databases of cyto-histological preparations that can exist on an internet server or can be distributed on removable media."
