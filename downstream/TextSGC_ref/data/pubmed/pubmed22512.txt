In this paper a novel technique to create a reality-augmented virtual fluoroscopy for computer-assisted diaphyseal long bone fracture osteosynthesis and feasibility study results are presented. With this novel technique repositioning of bone fragments during closed fracture reduction and osteosynthesis can lead to image updates in the virtual imaging planes of all acquired images without any radiation. The technique is achieved with a two-stage method. After acquiring a few normally two calibrated fluoroscopic images and before fracture reduction the first stage data preparation interactively identifies and segments the bone fragments from the background in each image. After that the second stage image updates repositions the fragment projection on to each virtual imaging plane in real time during fracture reduction and osteosynthesis using an OpenGL-based texture warping. Combined with a photorealistic virtual implant model rendering technique the present technique allows the control of a closed indirect fracture osteosynthesis in the real world through direct insight into the virtual world. The first clinical study results show the reduction in the X-ray radiation to the patient as well as to the surgical team and the improved operative precision guaranteeing more safety for the patient. Furthermore based on the experiences gained from this clinical study two technical enhancements are proposed. One focuses on eliminating the user interactions with automated identifications and segmentations of bone fragments. The other focuses on providing non-photorealistic implant visualization. Further experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements.
