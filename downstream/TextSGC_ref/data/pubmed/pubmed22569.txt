From a review on the reality of Dong-In Hospital which was a hospital founded by Dong-Aa Dong-In-Hywe Foundation which was a corporation of governmental patron around Ulsa1905 protective treaty between Japan and Korea and this hospital seemed to be dissoluted just before the annexation signing of Korea to Japan. The building with site of Dong-In Hospital in Taegu was sold to Kyung-Sang Pook-Do province and Jaa-Hye Hospital was constructed instead as a virtual conscience. So it is impossible to say this Jaa-Hye Hospital as the predecessor of Dong-In Hospital although Jaa-Hye Hospital which was belonging to Kyung-Sang Pook-Do province as Kyung-Sang Pook-Do Hospital had changed the name several times until being Taegu Medical School Hospital by using as Taegu Medical Institute College Hospital which was absorbed to U.S. military government after the restoration of independence from Japan. Since 1953 Kyungpook National University absorbed Taegu Medical School it is possible to use Taegu Medical School Hospital as the predecessor of Kyungpook National University Hospital whereas it is impossible to use Jaa-Hye Hospital as the predecessor with nationality on the basis of the health and medical administrative system.
