Accurate diagnosis of early Alzheimer disease AD plays a critical role in preventing the progression of memory impairment. We aimed to develop a new deep belief network DBN framework using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron emission tomography PET metabolic imaging to identify patients at the mild cognitive impairment MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and to discriminate them from other patients with MCI. Predicting Alzheimer Disease From Mild Cognitive Impairment With a Deep Belief Network Based on 18F-FDG-PET Images.
