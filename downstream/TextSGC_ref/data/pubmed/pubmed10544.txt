The latest generation of convolutional neural networks CNNs has achieved impressive results in the field of image classification. This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model based on leaf image classification by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper starting from gathering images in order to create a database assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98% for separate class tests on average 96.3%.
