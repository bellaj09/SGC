Designated a Department of Defense Team Resource Center TRC in 2008 Naval Medical Center Portsmouth NMCP currently hosts three tri-service health care teams training courses annually. Each consists of didactic learning coupled with simulation-based training exercises to provide an interactive educational experience for health care professionals. Simulated cases are developed to reinforce specific teamwork skills and behaviors and to incorporate a variety of technologies including standardized patients manikins and virtual reality. The course is also the foundation of a research program designed to explore applications of modeling and simulation for enhanced team training in health care. The TRC has adopted two theoretical frameworks for evaluating training efficacy and outcomes and has used these frameworks to guide a systematic reconfiguration of the infrastructure supporting health care teams training at NMCP. Theoretically-driven infrastructure for supporting health care teams training at a military treatment facility.
