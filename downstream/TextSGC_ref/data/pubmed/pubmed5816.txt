We propose a new iterative segmentation model which can be accurately learned from a small dataset. A common approach is to train a model to directly segment an image requiring a large collection of manually annotated images to capture the anatomical variability in a cohort. In contrast we develop a segmentation model that recursively evolves a segmentation in several steps and implement it as a recurrent neural network. We learn model parameters by optimizing the intermediate steps of the evolution in addition to the final segmentation. To this end we train our segmentation propagation model by presenting incomplete and/or inaccurate input segmentations paired with a recommended next step. Our work aims to alleviate challenges in segmenting heart structures from cardiac MRI for patients with congenital heart disease CHD which encompasses a range of morphological deformations and topological changes. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach on a dataset of 20 images from CHD patients learning a model that accurately segments individual heart chambers and great vessels. Compared to direct segmentation the iterative method yields more accurate segmentation for patients with the most severe CHD malformations.
