Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most important model animals in neurobiology owing to its manageable brain size complex behaviour and extensive genetic tools. However without a comprehensive map of the brain-wide neural network our ability to investigate brain functions at the systems level is seriously limited. In this study we constructed a neuron-to-neuron network of the Drosophila brain based on the 28573 fluorescence images of single neurons in the newly released FlyCircuit v1.2 http://www.flycircuit.tw database. By performing modularity and centrality analyses we identified eight communities right olfaction left olfaction olfactory core auditory motor pre-motor left vision and right vision in the brain-wide network. Further investigation on information exchange and structural stability revealed that the communities of different functions dominated different types of centralities suggesting a correlation between functions and network structures. Except for the two olfaction and the motor communities the network is characterized by overall small-worldness. A rich club RC structure was also found in this network and most of the innermost RC members innervated the central complex indicating its role in information integration. We further identified numerous loops with length smaller than seven neurons. The observation suggested unique characteristics in the information processing inside the fruit fly brain.
