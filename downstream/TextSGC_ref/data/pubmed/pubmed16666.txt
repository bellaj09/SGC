An 80-year-old man who had dilated cardiomyopathy with right ventricular RV dilatation underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD implantation for advanced atrioventricular block and primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Tined and screw-in leads were placed on the right atrial appendage and RV apex respectively. Ventricular pacing inhibition was detected after surgery due to oversensing by diaphragmatic myopotential occurring only during deep inspiration. We performed re-surgery and switched the screw-in lead for a tined lead. The diaphragmatic myopotential decreased thereby improving oversensing by diaphragmatic myopotential and ventricular pacing inhibition. It might be beneficial to use a tined lead when placing the ventricular lead at the RV apex for implantation of a pacemaker or ICD if oversensing of diaphragmatic myopotential is observed using a screw-in lead. <Learning objective: Oversensing due to diaphragmatic myopotential is rarely observed. However if it occurs it becomes a critical problem which causes pacemaker inhibition or inappropriate ICD shock. However the method of preventing this problem is unknown. In this case we demonstrated that a tined-lead may be useful for the prevention of oversensing by diaphragmatic myopotential.>.
