"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing AS is prevalent in plants and is involved in many interactions between plants and environmental stresses. However the patterns and underlying mechanisms of AS evolution in plants remain unclear. By analyzing the transcriptomes of four eudicot species we revealed that the divergence of AS is largely due to the gains and losses of AS events among orthologous genes. Furthermore based on a subset of AS in which AS can be directly associated with specific transcripts we found that AS that generates transcripts containing premature termination codons PTC are likely more conserved than those that generate non-PTC containing transcripts. This suggests that AS coupled with nonsense-mediated decay NMD might play an important role in affecting mRNA levels post-transcriptionally. To understand the mechanisms underlying the divergence of AS we analyzed the key determinants of AS using a machine learning approach. We found that the presence/absence of alternative splice site SS within the junction the distance between the authentic SS and the nearest alternative SS the size of exon-exon junctions were the major determinants for both alternative 5 donor site and 3 acceptor site among the studied species suggesting a relatively conserved AS mechanism. The comparative analysis further demonstrated that variations of the identified AS determinants significantly contributed to the AS divergence among closely related species in both Solanaceae and Brassicaceae taxa. Together these results provide detailed insights into the evolution of AS in plants." Evolution of Alternative Splicing in Eudicots.
