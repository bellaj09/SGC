To identify the feasibility of using a deep convolutional neural network DCNN for the detection and localization of hip fractures on plain frontal pelvic radiographs PXRs. Hip fracture is a leading worldwide health problem for the elderly. A missed diagnosis of hip fracture on radiography leads to a dismal prognosis. The application of a DCNN to PXRs can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of hip fracture diagnosis. Application of a deep learning algorithm for detection and visualization of hip fractures on plain pelvic radiographs.
