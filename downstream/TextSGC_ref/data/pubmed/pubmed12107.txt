Accurately assessment of adipose tissue volume inside a human body plays an important role in predicting disease or cancer risk diagnosis and prognosis. In order to overcome limitation of using only one subjectively selected CT image slice to estimate size of fat areas this study aims to develop and test a computer-aided detection CAD scheme based on deep learning technique to automatically segment subcutaneous fat areas SFA and visceral fat areas VFA depicting on volumetric CT images. A retrospectively collected CT image dataset was divided into two independent training and testing groups. The proposed CAD framework consisted of two steps with two convolution neural networks CNNs namely Selection-CNN and Segmentation-CNN. The first CNN was trained using 2240 CT slices to select abdominal CT slices depicting SFA and VFA. The second CNN was trained with 84000pixel patches and applied to the selected CT slices to identify fat-related pixels and assign them into SFA and VFA classes. Comparing to the manual CT slice selection and fat pixel segmentation results the accuracy of CT slice selection using the Selection-CNN yielded 95.8% while the accuracy of fat pixel segmentation using the Segmentation-CNN was 96.8%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying a new deep learning based CAD scheme to automatically recognize abdominal section of human body from CT scans and segment SFA and VFA from volumetric CT data with high accuracy or agreement with the manual segmentation results. A two-step convolutional neural network based computer-aided detection scheme for automatically segmenting adipose tissue volume depicting on CT images.
