Bony ankylosis of the temporomandibular joints TMJ occurs in up to 28% of patients with syndromic mandibular dysostoses. Release of complete osseous ankylosis is particularly challenging due to the lack of tissue planes separating the mandible from the skull base and the presence of congenital skeletal abnormalities. One recent advance in surgical imaging technology is three-dimensional virtual reality 3D VR now in common use in neurosurgical resections. In this study we describe the usage of 3D VR in TMJ arthroplasty and compare 3D VR to traditional computed tomographic CT guidance. Pediatric patients with syndromic mandibular micrognathia including Treacher Collins Nager and cerebrocostomandibular syndrome were retrospectively evaluated between 2008 and 2016. Patient characteristics complications inpatient times and operative times were recorded. Of the 29 children with syndromic mandibular micrognathia treated between 2008 and 2016 7 were diagnosed with TMJ ankyloses. Four consecutive pediatric patients mean 8.7 years undergoing interpositional TMJ arthroplasty with Matthews device placement were retrospectively evaluated. Two patients underwent traditional CT-guided versus 3D VR-guided temporomandibular joint arthroplasty TMJA. No statistically significant differences were found among the age complications or inpatient hospitalization times. The average operative time in the traditional CT guidance group was 300 minute versus 134 minutes in the 3D VR group. Three-dimensional VR is a useful preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance tool. The major difference between VR and older technologies is the improved imaging in 3 dimensions for guidance thereby potentially decreasing operative times.
