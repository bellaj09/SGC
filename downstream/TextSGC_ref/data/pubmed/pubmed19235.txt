Virtual reality-simulated environments have been used for the training of personnel most notably for military applications for more than 35 years. The advantages conferred by being able to train novice personnel in a low- to no-risk simulated environment have long been appreciated by the medical community. The recent availability of affordable gigahertz-range microprocessors once the exclusive domain of the Cray supercomputer has made photorealistic graphical rendering and manipulation of virtual surgical substrates a reality. Concomitant advances in artificial intelligence systems and the portability of patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging computed tomographic scanning and angiographic image data presage the emergence of the surgical simulator as a modern surgical training adjunct. An overview of the status of surgical simulation with regard to its adaptability to current surgical training regimens is presented.
