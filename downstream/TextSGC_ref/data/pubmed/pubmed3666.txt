The combination of resting-state functional MRI R-fMRI technique and graph theoretical approaches has emerged as a promising tool for characterizing the topological organization of brain networks that is functional connectomics. In particular the construction and analysis of high-resolution brain connectomics at a voxel scale are important because they do not require prior regional parcellations and provide finer spatial information about brain connectivity. However the test-retest reliability of voxel-based functional connectomics remains largely unclear.
