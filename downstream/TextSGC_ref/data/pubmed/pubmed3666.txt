The male predominance in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder ASD has motivated research on sex differentiation in ASD. Multiple sources of evidence have suggested a neurophenotypic convergence of ASD-related characteristics and typical sex differences. Two existing albeit competing models provide predictions on such neurophenotypic convergence. These two models are testable with neuroimaging. Specifically the Extreme Male Brain EMB model predicts that ASD is associated with enhanced brain maleness in both males and females with ASD i.e. a shift-towards-maleness. In contrast the Gender Incoherence GI model predicts a shift-towards-maleness in females yet a shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD.
