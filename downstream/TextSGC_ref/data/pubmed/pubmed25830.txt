Although brain-computer interface technology is mainly designed with disabled people in mind it can also be beneficial to healthy subjects for example in gaming or virtual reality systems. In this paper we discuss the typical architecture paradigms requirements and limitations of electroencephalogram-based gaming systems. We have developed a prototype three-class brain-computer interface system based on the steady state visually evoked potentials paradigm and the Emotiv EPOC headset. An online target shooting game implemented in the OpenViBE environment has been used for user feedback. The system utilizes wave atom transform for feature extraction achieving an average accuracy of 78.2% using linear discriminant analysis classifier 79.3% using support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel and 80.5% using a support vector machine classifier with a radial basis function kernel.
