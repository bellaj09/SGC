"Meaningful quality measurement and public reporting have the potential to facilitate targeted outcome improvement practice-based learning shared decision making and effective resource utilization. Recent developments in national quality reporting programs such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Qualified Clinical Data Registry QCDR reporting option have enhanced the ability of specialty groups to develop relevant quality measures of the care they deliver. QCDRs will complete the collection and submission of Physician Quality Reporting System PQRS quality measures data on behalf of individual eligible professionals. The National Neurosurgery Quality and Outcomes Database N2QOD offers 21 non-PQRS measures initially focused on spine procedures which are the first specialty-specific measures for neurosurgery. Securing QCDR status for N2QOD is a tremendously important accomplishment for our specialty. This program will ensure that data collected through our registries and used for PQRS is meaningful for neurosurgeons related spine care practitioners their patients and other stakeholders. The 2015 N2QOD QCDR is further evidence of neurosurgerys commitment to substantively advancing the health care quality paradigm. The following manuscript outlines the measures now approved for use in the 2015 N2QOD QCDR. Measure specifications measure type and descriptions related measures if any as well as relevant National Quality Strategy domains along with rationale are provided for each measure."
