"In the early-middle stages of Parkinsons disease PD polysomnographic studies show early alterations of the structure of the sleep which may explain frequent symptoms reported by patients such as daytime drowsiness loss of attention and concentration feeling of tiredness. The aim of this study was to verify if there is a correlation between the sleep dysfunction and decision making ability. We used a Virtual Reality version of the Multiple Errand Test VMET developed using the NeuroVR free software http://www.neurovr2.org to evaluate decision-making ability in 12 PD not-demented patients and 14 controls. Five of our not-demented 12 PD patients showed abnormalities in the polysomnographic recordings associated to significant differences in the VMET performance."
