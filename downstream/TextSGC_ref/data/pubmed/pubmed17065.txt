Joint attention is a fundamental cognitive ability that supports daily interpersonal relationships and communication. The Parallel Distributed Processing model PDPM postulates that responding to RJA and initiating IJA joint attention are predominantly supported by posterior-parietal and frontal regions respectively. It also argues that these neural networks integrate during development supporting the parallel processes of self- and other-attention representation during interactions. However direct evidence for the PDPM is limited due to a lack of ecologically valid experimental paradigms that can capture both RJA and IJA. Building on existing interactive approaches we developed a virtual reality paradigm where participants engaged in an online interaction to complete a cooperative task. By including tightly controlled baseline conditions to remove activity associated with non-social task demands we were able to directly contrast the neural correlates of RJA and IJA to determine whether these processes are supported by common brain regions. Both RJA and IJA activated broad frontotemporoparietal networks. Critically a conjunction analysis identified that a subset of these regions were common to both RJA and IJA. This right-lateralised network included the dorsal portion of the middle frontal gyrus MFG inferior frontal gyrus IFG middle temporal gyrus MTG precentral gyrus posterior superior temporal sulcus pSTS temporoparietal junction TPJ and precuneus. Additional activation was observed in this network for IJA relative to RJA at MFG IFG TPJ and precuneus. This is the first imaging study to directly investigate the neural correlates common to RJA and IJA engagement and thus support the assumption that a broad integrated network underlies the parallel aspects of both initiating and responding to joint attention.
