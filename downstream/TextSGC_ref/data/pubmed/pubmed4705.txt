Previous studies have indicated a tight linkage between resting-state functional connectivity of the human brain and creative ability. This study aimed to further investigate the association between the topological organization of resting-state brain networks and creativity. Therefore we acquired resting-state fMRI data from 22 high-creativity participants and 22 low-creativity participants as determined by their Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking scores. We then constructed functional brain networks for each participant and assessed group differences in network topological properties before exploring the relationships between respective network topological properties and creative ability. We identified an optimized organization of intrinsic brain networks in both groups. However compared with low-creativity participants high-creativity participants exhibited increased global efficiency and substantially decreased path length suggesting increased efficiency of information transmission across brain networks in creative individuals. Using a multiple linear regression model we further demonstrated that regional functional integration properties i.e. the betweenness centrality and global efficiency of brain networks particularly the default mode network DMN and sensorimotor network SMN significantly predicted the individual differences in creative ability. Furthermore the associations between network regional properties and creative performance were creativity-level dependent where the difference in the resource control component may be important in explaining individual difference in creative performance. These findings provide novel insights into the neural substrate of creativity and may facilitate objective identification of creative ability.
