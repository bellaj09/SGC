Machine learning techniques especially deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to general image recognitions since their overwhelming performance at the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. Recently such techniques have also been applied to various medical including histopathological images to assist the process of medical diagnosis. In some cases deep learning-based algorithms have already outperformed experienced pathologists for recognition of histopathological images. However pathological images differ from general images in some aspects and thus machine learning of histopathological images requires specialized learning methods. Moreover many pathologists are skeptical about the ability of deep learning technology to accurately recognize histopathological images because what the learned neural network recognizes is often indecipherable to humans. In this review we first introduce various applications incorporating machine learning developed to assist the process of pathologic diagnosis and then describe machine learning problems related to histopathological image analysis and review potential ways to solve these problems. Machine learning approaches for pathologic diagnosis.
