Dynamic movement primitives DMPs have proven to be an effective movement representation for motor skill learning. In this paper we propose a new approach for training deep neural networks to synthesize dynamic movement primitives. The distinguishing property of our approach is that it can utilize a novel loss function that measures the physical distance between movement trajectories as opposed to measuring the distance between the parameters of DMPs that have no physical meaning. This was made possible by deriving differential equations that can be applied to compute the gradients of the proposed loss function thus enabling an effective application of backpropagation to optimize the parameters of the underlying deep neural network. While the developed approach is applicable to any neural network architecture it was evaluated on two different architectures based on encoder-decoder networks and convolutional neural networks. Our results show that the minimization of the proposed loss function leads to better results than when more conventional loss functions are used.
