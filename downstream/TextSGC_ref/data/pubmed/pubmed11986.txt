"Computer aided diagnosis CAD tools help radiologists to reduce diagnostic errors such as missing tumors and misdiagnosis. Vision researchers have been analyzing behaviors of radiologists during screening to understand how and why they miss tumors or misdiagnose. In this regard eye-trackers have been instrumental in understanding visual search processes of radiologists. However most relevant studies in this aspect are not compatible with realistic radiology reading rooms. In this study we aim to develop a paradigm shifting CAD system called collaborative CAD C-CAD that unifies CAD and eye-tracking systems in realistic radiology room settings. We first developed an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Second we propose a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data gaze into a graph model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve their diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD uses radiologists search efficiency by processing their gaze patterns. Furthermore the C-CAD incorporates a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose suspicious areas simultaneously. The proposed C-CAD system has been tested in a lung cancer screening experiment with multiple radiologists reading low dose chest CTs. Promising results support the efficiency accuracy and applicability of the proposed C-CAD system in a real radiology room setting. We have also shown that our framework is generalizable to more complex applications such as prostate cancer screening with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging mp-MRI."
