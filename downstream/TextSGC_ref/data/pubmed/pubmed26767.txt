Interactive displays armed with natural user interfaces NUIs will likely lead the next breakthrough in consumer electronics and brain-computer interfaces BCIs are often regarded as the ultimate NUI-enabling machines to respond to human emotions and mental states. Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs are a commonly used BCI modality due to the ease of detection and high information transfer rates. However the presence of flickering stimuli may cause user discomfort and can even induce migraines and seizures. With the aim of designing visual stimuli that can be embedded into video images this study developed a novel approach to induce detectable SSVEPs using a composition of red/green/blue flickering lights. Polychromatic SSVEP stimuli with subtle flickering adapted to brain-display interactions.
