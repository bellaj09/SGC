X-ray computed tomography CT using sparse projection views is a recent approach to reduce the radiation dose. However due to the insufficient projection views an analytic reconstruction approach using the filtered back projection FBP produces severe streaking artifacts. Recently deep learning approaches using large receptive field neural networks such as U-Net have demonstrated impressive performance for sparse-view CT reconstruction. However theoretical justification is still lacking. Inspired by the recent theory of deep convolutional framelets the main goal of this paper is therefore to reveal the limitation of U-Net and propose new multi-resolution deep learning schemes. In particular we show that the alternative U-Net variants such as dual frame and tight frame U-Nets satisfy the so-called frame condition which makes them better for effective recovery of high frequency edges in sparse-view CT. Using extensive experiments with real patient data set we demonstrate that the new network architectures provide better reconstruction performance.
