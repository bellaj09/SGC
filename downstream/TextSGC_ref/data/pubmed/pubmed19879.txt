As our understanding of onset and progress of diseases at the genetic and molecular level rapidly progresses the potential of advanced technologies such as 3D-printing Socially-Assistive Robots SARs or augmented reality AR that are applied to personalized nanomedicines PNMs to alleviate pathological conditions has become more prominent. Among advanced technologies AR in particular has the greatest potential to address those challenges and facilitate the translation of PNMs into formidable clinical application of personalized therapy. As AR is about to adapt additional new methods such as speech voice recognition eye tracing and motion tracking to enable interaction with host response or biological systems in 3-D space a combination of multiple approaches to accommodate varying environmental conditions such as public noise and atmosphere brightness will be explored to improve its therapeutic outcomes in clinical applications. For instance AR glasses still being developed by Facebook or Microsoft will serve as new platform that can provide people with the health information they are interested in or various measures through which they can interact with medical services. This review has addressed the current progress and impact of AR on PNMs and its application to the biomedical field. Special emphasis is placed on the application of AR based PNMs to the treatment strategies against senior care drug addiction and medication adherence. Augmented reality for personalized nanomedicines.
