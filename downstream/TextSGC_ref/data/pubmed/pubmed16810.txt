The virtual-reality framework AVATAR Advanced Virtual Approach to Topological Analysis of Reactivity for the immersive exploration of potential-energy landscapes is presented. AVATAR is based on modern consumer-grade virtual-reality technology and builds on two key concepts: a the reduction of the dimensionality of the potential-energy surface to two process-tailored physically meaningful generalized coordinates and b the analogy between the evolution of a chemical process and a pathway through valleys potential wells and mountain passes saddle points of the associated potential energy landscape. Examples including the discovery of competitive reaction paths in simple A\u2009+\u2009BC collisional systems and the interconversion between conformers in ring-puckering motions of flexible rings highlight the innovation potential that augmented and virtual reality convey for teaching training and supporting research in chemistry.
