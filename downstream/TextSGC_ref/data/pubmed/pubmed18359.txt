Arthroscopy uses a completely different skill set compared with open orthopedic surgery. Hitherto arthroscopy had not been given enough emphasis in the core orthopedic curricula. Simulation has been seen as an excellent way to teach the skills required in arthroscopy. The simulators used for arthroscopy training can be broadly classified into physical simulators such as cadavers animals models and box trainers virtual-reality simulators and hybrid simulators that combine virtual-reality simulation with physical components that allow real tactile feedback. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these types have been described in this article. The factors that determine skill acquisition using these simulators have been highlighted. In conclusion simulation seems to be a valuable tool for arthroscopy training although further studies are needed to state whether this translates into better operative skill on real patients. Role of simulation in arthroscopy training.
