In recent years the field of deep learning has achieved considerable success in pattern recognition image segmentation and many other classification fields. There are many studies and practical applications of deep learning on images video or text classification. Activation functions play a crucial role in discriminative capabilities of the deep neural networks and the design of new "static" or "dynamic" activation functions is an active area of research. The main difference between "static" and "dynamic" functions is that the first class of activations considers all the neurons and layers as identical while the second class learns parameters of the activation function independently for each layer or even each neuron. Although the "dynamic" activation functions perform better in some applications the increased number of trainable parameters requires more computational time and can lead to overfitting. In this work we propose a mixture of "static" and "dynamic" activation functions which are stochastically selected at each layer. Our idea for model design is based on a method for changing some layers along the lines of different functional blocks of the best performing CNN models with the aim of designing new models to be used as stand-alone networks or as a component of an ensemble. We propose to replace each activation layer of a CNN usually a ReLU layer by a different activation function stochastically drawn from a set of activation functions: in this way the resulting CNN has a different set of activation function layers.
