Deep learning has been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using computers. Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network D2NN architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform at the speed of light various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis feature detection and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D2NNs.
