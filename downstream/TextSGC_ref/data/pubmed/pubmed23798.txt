Despite the fact that development of the human embryo heart is of considerable clinical importance there is still disagreement over the process and the timing of events. It is likely that some of the conflicting accounts may have arisen from difficulties in describing and visualising 3-dimensional structures from 2-dimensional sections. To help overcome this problem and to improve our understanding of the development of the heart we have devised techniques for the production of interactive 3D models reconstructed from serial histological sections of human embryos. Our method uses commercial software designed for the creation of 3D models and virtual reality environments. The ability to construct interactive visual images which both illustrate and communicate complex 3D information contributes to our understanding of the complex developmental changes occurring in embryogenesis.
