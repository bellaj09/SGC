Memory encoding can be studied by monitoring brain activity correlated with subsequent remembering. To understand brain potentials associated with encoding we compared multiple factors known to affect encoding. Depth of processing was manipulated by requiring subjects to detect animal names deep encoding or boldface shallow encoding in a series of Chinese words. Recognition was more accurate with deep than shallow encoding and for low- compared to high-frequency words. Potentials were generally more positive for subsequently recognized versus forgotten words; for deep compared to shallow processing; and for remembered words only for low- than for high-frequency words. Latency and topographic differences between these potentials suggested that several factors influence the effectiveness of encoding and can be distinguished using these methods even with Chinese logographic symbols.
