"Neuropsychological assessment of human visual processing capabilities strongly depends on visual testing conditions including room lighting stimuli and viewing-distance. This limits standardization threatens reliability and prevents the assessment of core visual functions such as visual processing speed. Increasingly available virtual reality devices allow to address these problems. One such device is the portable light-weight and easy-to-use Oculus Rift. It is head-mounted and covers the entire visual field thereby shielding and standardizing the visual stimulation. A fundamental prerequisite to use Oculus Rift for neuropsychological assessment is sufficient test-retest reliability. Here we compare the test-retest reliabilities of Bundesens visual processing components visual processing speed threshold of conscious perception capacity of visual working memory as measured with Oculus Rift and a standard CRT computer screen. Our results show that Oculus Rift allows to measure the processing components as reliably as the standard CRT. This means that Oculus Rift is applicable for standardized and reliable assessment and diagnosis of elementary cognitive functions in laboratory and clinical settings. Oculus Rift thus provides the opportunity to compare visual processing components between individuals and institutions and to establish statistical norm distributions."
