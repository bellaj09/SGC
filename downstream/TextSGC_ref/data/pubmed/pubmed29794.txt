The paper presents a report on the recently developed BCI alternative for users suffering from impaired vision lack of focus or eye-movements or from the so-called "ear-blocking-syndrome" limited hearing. We report on our recent studies of the extents to which vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the head of a user can serve as a platform for a brain computer interface BCI paradigm. Tactile and bone-conduction auditory brain computer interface for vision and hearing impaired users.
