Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs decode brain activity with the aim to establish a direct communication channel with an external device. Albeit they have been hailed to re-establish communication in persons suffering from severe motor- and/or communication disabilities only recently BCI applications have been challenging other assistive technologies. Owing to their considerably increased performance and the advent of affordable technological solutions BCI technology is expected to trigger a paradigm shift not only in assistive technology but also in the way we will interface with technology. However the flipside of the quest for accuracy and speed is most evident in EEG-based visual BCI where it has led to a gamut of increasingly complex classifiers tailored to the needs of specific stimulation paradigms and use contexts. In this contribution we argue that spatiotemporal beamforming can serve several synchronous visual BCI paradigms. We demonstrate this for three popular visual paradigms even without attempting to optimizing their electrode sets. For each selectable target a spatiotemporal beamformer is applied to assess whether the corresponding signal-of-interest is present in the preprocessed multichannel EEG signals. The target with the highest beamformer output is then selected by the decoder maximum selection. In addition to this simple selection rule we also investigated whether interactions between beamformer outputs could be employed to increase accuracy by combining the outputs for all targets into a feature vector and applying three common classification algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of spatiotemporal beamforming with maximum selection is at par with that of the classification algorithms and interactions between beamformer outputs do not further improve that accuracy.
