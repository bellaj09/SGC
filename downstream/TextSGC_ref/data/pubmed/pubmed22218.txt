A novel technique is introduced for tissue deformation and stress analysis. Compared to the conventional Finite Element method this technique is orders of magnitude faster and yet still very accurate. The proposed technique uses preprocessed data obtained from FE analyses of a number of similar objects in a Statistical Shape Model framework as described below. This technique takes advantage of the fact that the body organs have limited variability especially in terms of their geometry. As such it is well suited for calculating tissue displacements of body organs. The proposed technique can be applied in many biomedical applications such as image guided surgery or virtual reality environment development where tissue behavior is simulated for training purposes.
