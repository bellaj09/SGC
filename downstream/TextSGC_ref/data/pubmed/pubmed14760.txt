Deep generative adversarial networks GANs are the emerging technology in drug discovery and biomarker development. In our recent work we demonstrated a proof-of-concept of implementing deep generative adversarial autoencoder AAE to identify new molecular fingerprints with predefined anticancer properties. Another popular generative model is the variational autoencoder VAE which is based on deep neural architectures. In this work we developed an advanced AAE model for molecular feature extraction problems and demonstrated its advantages compared to VAE in terms of a adjustability in generating molecular fingerprints; b capacity of processing very large molecular data sets; and c efficiency in unsupervised pretraining for regression model. Our results suggest that the proposed AAE model significantly enhances the capacity and efficiency of development of the new molecules with specific anticancer properties using the deep generative models. druGAN: An Advanced Generative Adversarial Autoencoder Model for de Novo Generation of New Molecules with Desired Molecular Properties in Silico.
