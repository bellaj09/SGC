Electroencephalogram EEG signals have been shown very effective for inferring user intents in brain-computer interface BCI applications. However existing EEG-based BCIs in many cases lack sufficient performance due to utilizing classifiers that operate on EEG signals induced by individual trials. While many factors influence the classification performance an important aspect that is often ignored is the temporal dependency of these trial-EEG signals in some cases impacted by interference of brain responses to consecutive target and non-target trials. In this study the EEG signals are analyzed in a parametric sequence-based fashion which considers all trials that induce brain responses in a rapid-sequence fashion including a mixture of consecutive target and non-target trials. EEG signals are described as a linear combination of time-shifted cortical source activities plus measurement noise. Using a superposition of time invariant with an auto-regressive AR process EEG signals are treated as a linear combination of a stationary Gaussian process and time-locked impulse responses to the stimulus input events onsets. The model performance is assessed in the framework of a rapid serial visualization presentation RSVP based typing task for three healthy subjects across two sessions. Signal modeling in this fashion yields promising performance outcomes considering a single EEG channel to estimate the user intent. A Parametric EEG Signal Model for BCIs with Rapid-Trial Sequences.
