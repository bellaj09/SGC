The detection and delineation of the liver from abdominal 3D computed tomography CT images are fundamental tasks in computer-assisted liver surgery planning. However automatic and accurate segmentation especially liver detection remains challenging due to complex backgrounds ambiguous boundaries heterogeneous appearances and highly varied shapes of the liver. To address these difficulties we propose an automatic segmentation framework based on 3D convolutional neural network CNN and globally optimized surface evolution. First a deep 3D CNN is trained to learn a subject-specific probability map of the liver which gives the initial surface and acts as a shape prior in the following segmentation step. Then both global and local appearance information from the prior segmentation are adaptively incorporated into a segmentation model which is globally optimized in a surface evolution way. The proposed method has been validated on 42 CT images from the public Sliver07 database and local hospitals. On the Sliver07 online testing set the proposed method can achieve an overall score of Formula: see text yielding a mean Dice similarity coefficient of Formula: see text and an average symmetric surface distance of Formula: see text mm. The quantitative validations and comparisons show that the proposed method is accurate and effective for clinical application.
