Deep learning has always been at the forefront of scientific research. It has also been applied to medical research. Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia SCA is characterized by gait abnormalities and is usually evaluated semi-quantitatively by scales. However more detailed gait characteristics of SCA and related objective methods have not yet been established. Therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the gait characteristics of SCA patients as well as to analyze the correlation between gait parameters clinical scales and imaging on deep learning. Gait characteristics and clinical relevance of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia on deep learning.
