"The monitoring of ones own actions is essential for adjusting behavior. In particular response errors are important events that require behavioral adjustments. Correct and incorrect responses as well as feedback to responses are followed by brain activity originating mainly in the anterior cingulate which can be measured with fMRI and event-related potential ERP techniques. After each response a small negativity Nc or CRN is elicited in the ERP which is strongly enhanced in incorrect trials Ne or ERN. Following feedback stimuli that signal a negative outcome of an action a similar negativity the feedback-related negativity FRN is elicited. Recently it has been shown that these neurophysiological correlates of response monitoring and evaluation can be classified even on the single-trial level in the EEG and thus could be utilized not only to distinguish between correct and erroneous actions but also can be used online for a wide range of applications such as prediction of clinical outcomes or brain computer interfaces."
