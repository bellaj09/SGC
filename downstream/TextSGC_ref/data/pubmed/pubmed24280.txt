So far the very meaning of health and therefore treatment and rehabilitation is benchmarked to the normal or species-typical body. We expect certain abilities in members of a species; we expect humans to walk but not to fly but a bird we expect to fly. However increasingly therapeutic interventions have the potential to give recipients beyond species-typical body related abilities therapeutic enhancements TE. We believe that the perfect storm of TE the shift in ability expectations toward beyond species-typical body abilities and the increasing desire of health consumers to shape the health system will increasingly influence various aspects of health care practice policy and scholarship. We employed qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate among others how human enhancement neuro/cognitive enhancement brain machine interfaces and social robot discourses cover a healthcare healthcare policy and healthcare ethics b disability and c health consumers and how visible various assessment fields are within Neuro/Cogno/ Human enhancement and within the BMI and social robotics discourse. We found that health care as such is little discussed as are health care policy and ethics; that the term consumers but not health consumers is used; that technology impact and needs assessment is absent; and that the imagery of disabled people is primarily a medical one. We submit that now at this early stage is the time to gain a good understanding of what drives the push for the enhancement agenda and enhancement-enabling devices and the dynamics around acceptance and diffusion of therapeutic enhancements.
