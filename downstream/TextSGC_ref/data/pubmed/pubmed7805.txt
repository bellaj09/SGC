Tessellation in fundus is not only a visible feature for aged-related and myopic maculopathy but also confuse retinal vessel segmentation. The detection of tessellated images is an inevitable processing in retinal image analysis. In this work we propose a model using convolutional neural network for detecting tessellated images. The input to the model is pre-processed fundus image and the output indicate whether this photograph has tessellation or not. A database with 12000 colour retinal images is collected to evaluate the classification performance. The best tessellation classifier achieves accuracy of 97.73% and AUC value of 0.9659 using pretrained GoogLeNet and transfer learning technique.
