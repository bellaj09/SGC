Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of Nintendo Wii games in addition to neurodevelopmental treatment in patients with cerebral palsy. Subjects and Methods Thirty hemiparetic cerebral palsy patients 16 females 14 males; mean age 6-15 years were included in the study and divided into two groups: a neurodevelopmental treatment+Nintendo Wii group group 1 n=15 and a neurodevelopmental treatment group group 2 n=15. Both groups received treatment in 45-minute sessions 2 days/week for six weeks. Use of the upper extremities speed disability and functional independence were evaluated using the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test ABILHAND-Kids test and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure self-care before and after treatment. Results There were statistically significant improvements in all parameters for group 1 and group 2 except quality of function after six weeks of treatment. Intergroup analysis showed that group 1 was superior to group 2 in mean change differences in the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. Conclusion Our results showed that neurodevelopmental treatment is effective for improving hand functions in hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To provide a enjoyable motivational safe and effective rehabilitation program the Nintendo Wii may be used in addition to neurodevelopmental treatment. Efficacy of neurodevelopmental treatment combined with the Nintendo Wii in patients with cerebral palsy.
