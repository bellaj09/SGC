"Spatial disorientation is a hallmark of amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI and Alzheimers disease. Our aim was to use virtual reality to determine the allocentric and egocentric memory deficits of subjects with single-domain aMCI aMCIsd and multiple-domain aMCI aMCImd. For this purpose we introduced an advanced virtual reality navigation task VRNT to distinguish these deficits in mild Alzheimers disease miAD aMCIsd and aMCImd." Using virtual reality to distinguish subjects with multiple- but not single-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment from normal elderly subjects.
