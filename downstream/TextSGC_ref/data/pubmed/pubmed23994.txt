Precision medicine models for personalizing achieving sustained behavior change are largely outside of current clinical practice. Yet changing self-regulatory behaviors is fundamental to the self-management of complex lifestyle-related chronic conditions such as depression and obesity - two top contributors to the global burden of disease and disability. To optimize treatments and address these burdens behavior change and self-regulation must be better understood in relation to their neurobiological underpinnings. Here we present the conceptual framework and protocol for a novel study "Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ENGAGE". The ENGAGE study integrates neuroscience with behavioral science to better understand the self-regulation related mechanisms of behavior change for improving mood and weight outcomes among adults with comorbid depression and obesity. We collect assays of three self-regulation targets emotion cognition and self-reflection in multiple settings: neuroimaging and behavioral lab-based measures virtual reality and passive smartphone sampling. By connecting human neuroscience and behavioral science in this manner within the ENGAGE study we develop a prototype for elucidating the underlying self-regulation mechanisms of behavior change outcomes and their application in optimizing intervention strategies for multiple chronic diseases. The ENGAGE study: Integrating neuroimaging virtual reality and smartphone sensing to understand self-regulation for managing depression and obesity in a precision medicine model.
