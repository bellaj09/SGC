"This paper presents the experimental validation of a readout circuit for the acquisition amplification and transmission of extremely weak biopotentials with a focus on electroencephalography EEG signals. The device dubbed CochlEEG benefits from a low-power design for long-term power autonomy and provides configurable gain and sampling rates to suit the needs of various EEG applications. CochlEEG features high sampling rates up to 4\xa0kHz low-noise signal acquisitions support for active electrodes and a potential for Wi-Fi data transmission. Moreover it is lightweight pocket size and affordable which makes CochlEEG suitable for wearable and real-world applications. The efficiency of CochlEEG in EEG data acquisition is also investigated in this paper. Auditory steady-state responses acquisition results validate CochlEEGs capability in recording EEG with a signal quality comparable to commercial mobile or research EEG acquisition devices. Moreover the results of an oddball paradigm experiment prove the capability of CochlEEG in recording event-related potentials and demonstrate its potential for brain-computer interface applications and electrophysiological research applications requiring higher temporal resolution."
