Unplanned preventable hospital readmissions within 30 days are a great burden to patients and the healthcare system. With an estimated $41.3 billion spent yearly reducing such readmission rates is of the utmost importance. With the widespread adoption of big data and machine learning clinicians can use these analytical tools to understand these complex relationships and find predictive factors that can be generalized to future patients. The object of this study was to assess the efficacy of a machine learning algorithm in the prediction of 30-day hospital readmission after posterior spinal fusion surgery. Using machine learning to predict 30-day readmissions after posterior lumbar fusion: an NSQIP study involving 23264 patients.
