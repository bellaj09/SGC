Photoacoustic tomography PAT is a non-invasive imaging modality combining the benefits of optical contrast at ultrasonic resolution. Analytical reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic signals require large number of data points for accurate image reconstruction. However in practical scenarios data is collected using limited number of transducers along with data being often corrupted with noise resulting in only qualitative images. Further the collected boundary data is band-limited due to limited bandwidth of the transducer making the photoacoustic imaging with limited data being qualitative. In this work a deep neural network based model with loss function being scaled root-mean-squared-error was proposed for super-resolution denoising as well as bandwidth enhancement of the photoacoustic signals collected at the boundary of the domain. The proposed network has been compared with traditional as well as other popular deep learning methods in numerical as well as experimental cases and is shown to improve the collected boundary data in turn providing superior quality reconstructed photoacoustic image. The improvement obtained in the Pearson Correlation Structural Similarity Index Metric and Root Mean Square Error was as high as 35.62% 33.81% and 41.07% respectively for phantom cases and Signal to Noise Ratio improvement in the reconstructed photoacoustic images was as high as 11.65 dB for in-vivo cases as compared to reconstructed image obtained using original limited bandwidth data.
