Virtual reality VR experiments are increasingly employed because of their internal and external validity compared to real-world observation and laboratory experiments respectively. VR is especially useful for geographic visualizations and investigations of spatial behavior. In spatial behavior research VR provides a platform for studying the relationship between navigation and physiological measures e.g. skin conductance heart rate blood pressure. Specifically physiological measures allow researchers to address novel questions and constrain previous theories of spatial abilities strategies and performance. For example individual differences in navigation performance may be explained by the extent to which changes in arousal mediate the effects of task difficulty. However the complexities in the design and implementation of VR experiments can distract experimenters from their primary research goals and introduce irregularities in data collection and analysis. To address these challenges the Experiments in Virtual Environments EVE framework includes standardized modules such as participant training with the control interface data collection using questionnaires the synchronization of physiological measurements and data storage. EVE also provides the necessary infrastructure for data management visualization and evaluation. The present paper describes a protocol that employs the EVE framework to conduct navigation experiments in VR with physiological sensors. The protocol lists the steps necessary for recruiting participants attaching the physiological sensors administering the experiment using EVE and assessing the collected data with EVE evaluation tools. Overall this protocol will facilitate future research by streamlining the design and implementation of VR experiments with physiological sensors.
