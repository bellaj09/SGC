Diffusion tensor imaging DTI and fractional-anisotropy FA maps in particular have shown promise in predicting areas of tumor recurrence in glioblastoma. However analysis of peritumoral edema where most recurrences occur is impeded by free-water contamination. In this study we evaluated the benefits of a novel deep-learning-based approach for the free-water correction FWC of DTI data for prediction of later recurrence. We investigated 35 glioblastoma cases from our prospective glioma cohort. A preoperative MR image and the first MR scan showing tumor recurrence were semiautomatically segmented into areas of contrast-enhancing tumor edema or recurrence of the tumor. The 10th 50th and 90th percentiles and mean of FA and mean-diffusivity MD values both for the original and FWC-DTI data were collected for areas with and without recurrence in the peritumoral edema. We found significant differences in the FWC-FA maps between areas of recurrence-free edema and areas with later tumor recurrence where differences in noncorrected FA maps were less pronounced. Consequently a generalized mixed-effect model had a significantly higher area under the curve when using FWC-FA maps AUC = 0.9 compared to noncorrected maps AUC = 0.77 p < 0.001. This may reflect tumor infiltration that is not visible in conventional imaging and may therefore reveal important information for personalized treatment decisions.
