Advanced display technologies have made the virtual exploration of relatively complex models feasible in many applications. Unfortunately only a few human interfaces allow natural interaction with the environment. Moreover in surgical applications such realistic interaction requires real-time rendering of volumetric data-placing an overwhelming performance burden on the system. We report on a collaboration of an interdisciplinary group developing a virtual reality system that provides intuitive interaction with volume data by employing real-time volume rendering and force feedback haptic sensations. We describe our rendering methods and the haptic devices and explain its utility of this system in the real-world application of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ESS simulation. A volumetric approach to virtual simulation of functional endoscopic sinus surgery.
