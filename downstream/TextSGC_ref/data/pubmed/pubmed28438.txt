A large proportion of individuals with stroke have persistent deficits for which current interventions have not restored normal motor behavior. Noninvasive brain computer interfaces BCIs have potential advantages for restoration of function. There are also potential advantages for combining BCI with functional electrical stimulation FES. We tested the feasibility of combined BCI + FES for motor learning after stroke. Feasibility of a new application of noninvasive Brain Computer Interface BCI: a case study of training for recovery of volitional motor control after stroke.
