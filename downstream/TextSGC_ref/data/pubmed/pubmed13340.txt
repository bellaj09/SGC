Classification of partially occluded images is a highly challenging computer vision problem even for the cutting-edge deep learning technologies. To achieve a robust image classification for occluded images this article proposes a novel scheme using the subspace decomposition-based estimation SDBE. The proposed SDBE-based classification scheme first employs a base convolutional neural network to extract the deep feature vector DFV and then utilizes the SDBE to compute the DFV of the original occlusion-free image for classification. The SDBE is performed by projecting the DFV of the occluded image onto the linear span of a class dictionary CD along the linear span of an occlusion error dictionary OED. The CD and OED are constructed respectively by concatenating the DFVs of a training set and the occlusion error vectors of an extra set of image pairs. Two implementations of the SDBE are studied in this article: 1 the l-norm and 2 the squared l-norm regularized least-squares estimates. By employing the ResNet-152 pretrained on the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 ILSVRC2012 training set as the base network the proposed SBDE-based classification scheme is extensively evaluated on the Caltech-101 and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SDBE-based scheme dramatically boosts the classification accuracy for occluded images and achieves around 22.25% increase in classification accuracy under 20% occlusion on the ILSVRC2012 dataset.
