The cyber-physical system CPS is a next-generation smart system that combines computing with physical space. It has been applied in various fields because the uncertainty of the physical world can be ideally controlled using cyber technology. In terms of environmental control studies have been conducted to enhance the effectiveness of the service by inducing ideal emotions in the service space. This paper proposes a CPS control system for inducing emotion based on multiple sensors. The CPS can expand the constrained environmental sensors of the physical space variously by combining the virtual space with the physical space. The cyber space is constructed in a Unity 3D space that can be experienced through virtual reality devices. We collect the temperature humidity dust concentration and current emotion in the physical space as an environmental control elements and the control illumination color temperature video sound and volume in the cyber space. The proposed system consists of an emotion prediction module using modular Bayesian networks and an optimal stimulus decision module for deriving the predicted emotion to the target emotion based on utility theory and reinforcement learning. To verify the system the performance is evaluated using the data collected from real situations. Sensor Information Fusion by Integrated AI to Control Public Emotion in a Cyber-Physical Environment.
