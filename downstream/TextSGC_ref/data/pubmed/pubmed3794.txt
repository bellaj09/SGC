An increasing number of studies have aimed to compare diffusion tensor imaging DTI-related parameters e.g. mean diffusivity MD fractional anisotropy FA radial diffusivity RD and axial diffusivity AD to complementary new indexes e.g. mean kurtosis MK/radial kurtosis RK/axial kurtosis AK derived through diffusion kurtosis imaging DKI in terms of their discriminative potential about tissue disease-related microstructural alterations. Given that the DTI and DKI models provide conceptually and quantitatively different estimates of the diffusion tensor which can also depend on fitting routine the aim of this study was to investigate model- and algorithm-dependent differences in MD/FA/RD/AD and anisotropy mode MO estimates in diffusion-weighted imaging of human brain white matter. Differences in Gaussian diffusion tensor imaging and non-Gaussian diffusion kurtosis imaging model-based estimates of diffusion tensor invariants in the human brain.
