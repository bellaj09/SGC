Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Currently in differential diagnosis of lung cancer accurate classification of cancer types adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma is required. However improving the accuracy and stability of diagnosis is challenging. In this study we developed an automated classification scheme for lung cancers presented in microscopic images using a deep convolutional neural network DCNN which is a major deep learning technique. The DCNN used for classification consists of three convolutional layers three pooling layers and two fully connected layers. In evaluation experiments conducted the DCNN was trained using our original database with a graphics processing unit. Microscopic images were first cropped and resampled to obtain images with resolution of 256  256 pixels and to prevent overfitting collected images were augmented via rotation flipping and filtering. The probabilities of three types of cancers were estimated using the developed scheme and its classification accuracy was evaluated using threefold cross validation. In the results obtained approximately 71% of the images were classified correctly which is on par with the accuracy of cytotechnologists and pathologists. Thus the developed scheme is useful for classification of lung cancers from microscopic images.
