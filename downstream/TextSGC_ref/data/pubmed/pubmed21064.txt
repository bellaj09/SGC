In laparoscopic surgery no external feedback on the magnitude of the force exerted is available. Hence surgeons and residents tend to exert excessive force which leads to tissue trauma. Ability of surgeons and residents to perceive their own force output without external feedback is a critical factor in laparoscopic force-skills training. Additionally existing methods of laparoscopic training do not effectively train residents and novices on force-skills. Hence there is growing need for the development of force-based training curriculum. Effects of laparoscopic instrument and finger on force perception: a first step towards laparoscopic force-skills training.
