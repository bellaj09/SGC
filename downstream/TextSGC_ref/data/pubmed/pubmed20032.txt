The INTERSTRESS project developed a completely new concept in the treatment of psychological stress: Interreality a concept that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with a hybrid closed-loop empowering experience bridging real and virtual worlds. This model provides the opportunity for individual citizens to become active participants in their own health and well-being. This article contains the results of the Marketing Trial and analysis of the opinions of individual consumers/end users of the INTERSTRESS product. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility efficacy and user acceptance of a novel mobile-based relaxation training tool in combination with biofeedback exercises and wearable biosensors. Relaxation was aided through immersion in a mobile virtual scenario a virtual island featuring pre-recorded audio narratives guiding a series of relaxation exercises. During biofeedback exercises a wearable biosensor system provided data which directly modified the virtual reality experience in real-time. Thirty-six participants evaluated the product and overall feedback from users was positive with some variation seen based on participant gender. A larger market study is now underway to understand if there are cultural variations in acceptability of the device. Marketing analysis of a positive technology app for the self-management of psychological stress.
