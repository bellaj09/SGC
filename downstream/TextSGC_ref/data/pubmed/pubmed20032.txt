Active learning techniques result in greater knowledge acquisition compared to passive methods. For medical students with limited hands-on operative experiences virtual reality platforms represent active learning and may enhance procedural training. We hypothesize that virtual reality simulators like Toolkit for Illustration of Procedures in Surgery TIPS are a more effective modality in teaching laparoscopic surgical techniques to medical students when compared to passive learning tools like videos. VR Simulation Leads to Enhanced Procedural Confidence for Surgical Trainees.
