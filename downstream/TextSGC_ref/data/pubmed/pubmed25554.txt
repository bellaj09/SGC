"We used a spiking neural network SNN to decode neural data recorded from a 96-electrode array in premotor/motor cortex while a rhesus monkey performed a point-to-point reaching arm movement task. We mapped a Kalman-filter neural prosthetic decode algorithm developed to predict the arms velocity on to the SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework and simulated it using Nengo a freely available software package. A 20000-neuron network matched the standard decoders prediction to within 0.03% normalized by maximum arm velocity. A 1600-neuron version of this network was within 0.27% and run in real-time on a 3GHz PC. These results demonstrate that a SNN can implement a statistical signal processing algorithm widely used as the decoder in high-performance neural prostheses Kalman filter and achieve similar results with just a few thousand neurons. Hardware SNN implementations-neuromorphic chips-may offer power savings essential for realizing fully-implantable cortically controlled prostheses."
