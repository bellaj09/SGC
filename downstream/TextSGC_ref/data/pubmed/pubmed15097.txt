"Oscillometric blood pressure BP monitors currently estimate a single point but do not identify variations in response to physiological characteristics. In this paper to analyze BPs normality based on oscillometric measurements we use statistical approaches including kurtosis skewness Kolmogorov-Smirnov and correlation tests. Then to mitigate uncertainties we use a deep learning method to determine the confidence limits CLs of BP measurements based on their normality. The proposed deep learning regression model decreases the standard deviation of error SDE of the mean error and the mean absolute error and reduces the uncertainties of the CLs and SDEs of the proposed technique. We validate the normality of the distribution of the BP estimation which fits the standard normal distribution very well. We use a rank test in the deep learning technique to demonstrate the independence of the artificial systolic BP and diastolic BP estimations. We perform statistical tests to verify the normality of the BP measurements for individual subjects. The proposed methodology provides accurate BP estimations and reduces the uncertainties associated with the CLs and SDEs using the deep learning algorithm."
