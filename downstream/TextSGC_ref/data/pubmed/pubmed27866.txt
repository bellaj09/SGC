Brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide a non-muscular communication channel for patients with late-stage motoneuron disease e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or otherwise motor impaired people and are also used for motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke. Differences in the ability to use a BCI vary from person to person and from session to session. A reliable predictor of aptitude would allow for the selection of suitable BCI paradigms. For this reason we investigated whether P300 BCI aptitude could be predicted from a short experiment with a standard auditory oddball. Prediction of auditory and visual p300 brain-computer interface aptitude.
