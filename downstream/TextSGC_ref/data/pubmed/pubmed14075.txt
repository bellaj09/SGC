Noncoding RNA ncRNA is a kind of RNA that plays an important role in many biological processes diseases and cancers while cannot translate into proteins. With the development of next-generation sequence technology thousands of novel RNAs with long open reading frames ORFs longest ORF length > 303 nt and short ORFs longest ORF length  303 nt have been discovered in a short time. How to identify ncRNAs more precisely from novel unannotated RNAs is an important step for RNA functional analysis RNA regulation etc. However most previous methods only utilize the information of sequence features. Meanwhile most of them have focused on long-ORF RNA sequences but not adapted to short-ORF RNA sequences. In this paper we propose a new reliable method called NCResNet. NCResNet employs 57 hybrid features of four categories as inputs including sequence protein RNA structure and RNA physicochemical properties and introduces feature enhancement and deep feature learning policies in a neural net model to adapt to this problem. The experiments on benchmark datasets of 8 species shows NCResNet has higher accuracy and higher Matthews correlation coefficient MCC compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Particularly on four short-ORF RNA sequence datasets specifically mouse Saccharomyces cerevisiae zebrafish and cow NCResNet achieves greater than 10 and 15% improvements over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and MCC. Meanwhile for long-ORF RNA sequence datasets NCResNet also has better accuracy and MCC than other state-of-the-art methods on most test datasets.
