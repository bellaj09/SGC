"Craving is considered the main variable associated with relapse after smoking cessation. Cue Exposure Therapy CET consists of controlled and repeated exposure to drug-related cues with the aim of extinguishing craving responses. Some virtual reality VR environments such as virtual bars or parties have previously shown their efficacy as tools for eliciting smoking craving. However in order to adapt this technology to smoking cessation interventions there is a need for more diverse environments that enhance the probability of generalization of extinction in real life. The main objective of this study was to identify frequent situations that produce smoking craving as well as detecting specific craving cues in those contexts. Participants were 154 smokers who responded to an ad hoc self-administered inventory for assessing craving level in 12 different situations. Results showed that having a drink in a bar/pub at night after having lunch/dinner in a restaurant and having a coffee in a cafe or after lunch/dinner at home were reported as the most craving-inducing scenarios. Some differences were found with regard to participants gender age and number of cigarettes smoked per day. Females younger people and heavier smokers reported higher levels of craving in most situations. In general the most widely cited specific cues across the contexts were people smoking having a coffee being with friends and having finished eating. These results are discussed with a view to their consideration in the design of valid and reliable VR environments that could be used in the treatment of nicotine addicts who wish to give up smoking."
