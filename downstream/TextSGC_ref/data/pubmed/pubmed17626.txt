People are suffering from various stress during daily living. Stress can cause a variety of symptoms and in severe cases it can lead to a dangerous disease. For this reason it is essential to develop a simple method to evaluate stress level precisely. Popularly heart rate variability HRV is used because it can reflect autonomic nervous system ANS activity. On the other hand virtual reality VR which can provide environments similar to reality is widely used in laboratory-based experiments. In this paper we analyzed the HRV of healthy people by using the photoplethysmogram PPG while providing diverse stress situations. To detect and classify the exact stress levels extracted HRV features and linear discriminant analysis LDA were utilized. As a result high multi-class classification accuracy was obtained: Baseline 74% mild stress 81% and severe stress 82%. Discrimination of multiple stress levels in virtual reality environments using heart rate variability.
