There is a need for effective and early functional rehabilitation of patients with gait and balance problems including those with spinal cord injury neurological diseases and recovering from hip fractures a common consequence of falls especially in the elderly population. Gait training in these patients using partial body weight support BWS on a treadmill a technique that involves unloading the subject through a harness improves walking better than training with full weight bearing. One problem with this technique not commonly acknowledged is that the harness provides external support that essentially eliminates associated postural adjustments APAs required for independent gait. We have developed a device to address this issue and conducted a training study for proof of concept of efficacy. A rehabilitation tool for functional balance using altered gravity and virtual reality.
