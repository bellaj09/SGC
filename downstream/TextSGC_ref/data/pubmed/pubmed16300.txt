As the number of PET/CT scanners increases and FDG PET/CT becomes a common imaging modality for oncology the demands for automated detection systems on artificial intelligence AI to prevent human oversight and misdiagnosis are rapidly growing. We aimed to develop a convolutional neural network CNN-based system that can classify whole-body FDG PET as 1 benign 2 malignant or 3 equivocal. A convolutional neural network-based system to classify patients using FDG PET/CT examinations.
