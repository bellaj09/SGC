Traumatic brain injury is a complex and diverse medical condition with a high frequency of intracranial abnormalities. These can typically be visualized on a computed tomography CT scan which provides important information for further patient management such as the need for operative intervention. In order to quantify the extent of acute intracranial lesions and associated secondary injuries such as midline shift and cisternal compression visual assessment of CT images has limitations including observer variability and lack of quantitative interpretation. Automated image analysis can quantify the extent of intracranial abnormalities and provide added value in routine clinical practice. In this article we present icobrain a fully automated method that reliably computes acute intracranial lesions volume based on deep learning cistern volume and midline shift on the noncontrast CT image of a patient. The accuracy of our method is evaluated on a subset of the multi-center data set from the CENTER-TBI Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury study for which expert annotations were used as a reference. Median volume differences between expert assessments and icobrain are 0.07\u2009mL for acute intracranial lesions and -0.01\u2009mL for cistern segmentation. Correlation between expert assessments and icobrain is 0.91 for volume of acute intracranial lesions and 0.94 for volume of the cisterns. For midline shift computations median error is -0.22\u2009mm with a correlation of 0.93 with expert assessments.
