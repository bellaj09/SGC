We present a novel virtual-reality P300-based Brain Computer Interface BCI paradigm using social cues to direct the focus of attention. We combined interactive immersive virtual-reality VR technology with the properties of P300 signals in a training tool which can be used in social attention disorders such as autism spectrum disorder ASD. A novel Brain Computer Interface for classification of social joint attention in autism and comparison of 3 experimental setups: A feasibility study.
