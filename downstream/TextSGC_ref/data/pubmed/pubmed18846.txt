Severe acquired brain injury SABI is damage to the brain occurring after birth from traumatic or non-traumatic causes and often resulting in deterioration of physical cognitive and emotional functions. Cognitive rehabilitation CR is aimed to help brain-injured or otherwise cognitively impaired individuals to restore normal functioning or to compensate for cognitive deficits. Over the last years the development of new technologies in the field of CR has led to a growing use of computer-based cognitive tools in patients with SABI. This review aims to investigate the efficacy of CR in individuals suffering from SABI and evaluates the role of virtual reality and other innovative technologies in improving behavioural and functional outcomes. The current evidence for CR in the treatment of SABI-related deficits does not allow conclusive results to be achieved\xa0and further research is needed to identity the patient and treatment factors that contribute to successful outcomes. Cognitive rehabilitation after severe acquired brain injury: current evidence and future directions.
