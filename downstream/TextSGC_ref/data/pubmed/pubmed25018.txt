Online analysis and classification of single electroencephalogram EEG trials during motor imagery were used for navigation in the virtual environment VE. The EEG was recorded bipolarly with electrode placement over the hand and foot representation areas. The aim of the study was to demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to move through a virtual street without muscular activity when the participant only imagines feet movements. This is achieved by exploiting a brain-computer interface BCI which transforms thought-modulated EEG signals into an output signal that controls events within the VE. The experiments were carried out in an immersive projection environment commonly referred to as a "Cave" Cruz-Neira C. Sandin D.J. DeFanti T.A.

Proceedings of the 20th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques ACM Press 1993 pp. 135-142 where participants were able to move through a virtual street by foot imagery only. Prior to the final experiments in the Cave the participants underwent an extensive BCI training. Walking from thought.
