Sensorimotor control engages cognitive processes such as prediction learning and multisensory integration. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these cognitive processes with arm reaching is challenging because we currently record only a fraction of the relevant neurons the arm has nonlinear dynamics and multiple modalities of sensory feedback contribute to control. A brain-computer interface BCI is a well-defined sensorimotor loop with key simplifying advantages that address each of these challenges while engaging similar cognitive processes. As a result BCI is becoming recognized as a powerful tool for basic scientific studies of sensorimotor control. Here we describe the benefits of BCI for basic scientific inquiries and review recent BCI studies that have uncovered new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control.
