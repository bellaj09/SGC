"Shared learning at undergraduate level provides a potential means of promoting a more multi-professional approach to maternity care. Interprofessional education uses shared interactive sessions to promote different professional groups understanding of each other and working together. This paper describes the use of a formative objective structured clinical examination as a method of interprofessional education. Mixed groups of student doctors and student midwives rotate through a series of clinical stations based on common labour ward scenarios. After completing each station they are given feedback by a facilitator on their problem-solving skills knowledge and attitude to team working. The interactive nature of the sessions encourages deep learning is student centred and promotes a positive attitude to multidisciplinary working. Both student groups felt they benefited from shared learning in this way and that the formative OSCE was an effective method of developing their clinical skills."
