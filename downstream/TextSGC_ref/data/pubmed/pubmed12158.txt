With the advent of the post genomic era the research for the genetic mechanism of the diseases has found to be increasingly depended on the studies of the genes the gene-networks and gene-protein interaction networks. To explore gene expression and regulation the researchers have carried out many studies on transcription factors and their binding sites TFBSs. Based on the large amount of transcription factor binding sites predicting values in the deep learning models further computation and analysis have been done to reveal the relationship between the gene mutation and the occurrence of the disease. It has been demonstrated that based on the deep learning methods the performances of the prediction for the functions of the noncoding variants are outperforming than those of the conventional methods. The research on the prediction for functions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms SNPs is expected to uncover the mechanism of the gene mutation affection on traits and diseases of human beings. Noncoding Variants Functional Prioritization Methods Based on Predicted Regulatory Factor Binding Sites.
