"Although durum wheat Triticum turgidum var. durum Desf. is a minor cereal crop representing just 5-7% of the worlds total wheat crop it is a staple food in Mediterranean countries where it is used to produce pasta couscous bulgur and bread. In this paper we cover multi-trait prediction of grain yield GY days to heading DH and plant height PH of 270 durum wheat lines that were evaluated in 43 environments country-location-year combinations across a broad range of water regimes in the Mediterranean Basin and other locations. Multi-trait prediction analyses were performed by implementing a multi-trait deep learning model MTDL with a feed-forward network topology and a rectified linear unit activation function with a grid search approach for the selection of hyper-parameters. The results of the multi-trait deep learning method were also compared with univariate predictions of the genomic best linear unbiased predictor GBLUP method and the univariate counterpart of the multi-trait deep learning method UDL. All models were implemented with and without the genotype  environment interaction term. We found that the best predictions were observed without the genotype  environment interaction term in the UDL and MTDL methods. However under the GBLUP method the best predictions were observed when the genotype  environment interaction term was taken into account. We also found that in general the best predictions were observed under the GBLUP model; however the predictions of the MTDL were very similar to those of the GBLUP model. This result provides more evidence that the GBLUP model is a powerful approach for genomic prediction but also that the deep learning method is a practical approach for predicting univariate and multivariate traits in the context of genomic selection."
