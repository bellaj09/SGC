The World Health Organization WHO grading system of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor PNET plays an important role in the clinical decision. The rarity of PNET often negatively affects the radiological application of deep learning algorithms due to the low availability of radiological images. We tried to investigate the feasibility of predicting WHO grades of PNET on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance MR images by deep learning algorithms. Deep learning for World Health Organization grades of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images: a preliminary study.
