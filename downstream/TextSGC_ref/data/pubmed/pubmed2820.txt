"Structural connections among the hubs of the revised Papez circuit remain to be elucidated in the human brain. As the original Papez circuit failed to explain functional imaging findings a more detailed investigation is needed to delineate connections among the circuits key hubs. Here we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging DSI from eight normal subjects and used data from the Human Connectome Project HCP to elucidate connections among hubs in the retrosplenial gyrus hippocampus mammillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei. Our results show that the ventral hippocampal commissure VHC was visualized in all eight individual DSI datasets as well as in the DSI and HCP group datasets but a strictly defined VHC was only visualized in one individual dataset. Thalamic fibers were observed to connect with both the posterior cingulate cortex PCC and retrosplenial cortex RSC. The RSC was mainly responsible for direct hippocampal connections while the PCC was not. This indicates that the RSC and PCC represent separate functional hubs in humans as also shown by previous primate axonal tracing studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations."
