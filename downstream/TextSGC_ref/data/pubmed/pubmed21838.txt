Genetic generalised epilepsy or epilepsy of unknown cause can remit before adolescence. In many children the disease does not interfere with their academic achievement. Although there are neuropsychological studies characterising the cognitive profile there are no studies in this population focused on spatial orientation abilities. In this study we compared children with genetic generalised epilepsy or epilepsy of unknown cause with a control group using a virtual spatial learning task. Children with epilepsy showed worse performance on the spatial orientation task although their visuo-spatial memory attention and working memory were normal. These results confirm that genetic generalised epilepsy or epilepsy of unknown cause is associated with more cognitive deficits. Virtual reality technologies can complement clinical assessment. Spatial memory alterations in children with epilepsy of genetic origin or unknown cause.
