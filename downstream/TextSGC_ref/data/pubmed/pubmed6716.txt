Brain vessel status is a promising biomarker for better prevention and treatment in cerebrovascular disease. However classic rule-based vessel segmentation algorithms need to be hand-crafted and are insufficiently validated. A specialized deep learning method-the U-net-is a promising alternative. Using labeled data from 66 patients with cerebrovascular disease the U-net framework was optimized and evaluated with three metrics: Dice coefficient 95% Hausdorff distance 95HD and average Hausdorff distance AVD. The model performance was compared with the traditional segmentation method of graph-cuts. Training and reconstruction was performed using 2D patches. A full and a reduced architecture with less parameters were trained. We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The U-net models yielded high performance for both the full and the reduced architecture: A Dice value of ~0.88 a 95HD of ~47 voxels and an AVD of ~0.4 voxels. The visual analysis revealed excellent performance in large vessels and sufficient performance in small vessels. Pathologies like cortical laminar necrosis and a rete mirabile led to limited segmentation performance in few patients. The U-net outperfomed the traditional graph-cuts method Dice ~0.76 95HD ~59 AVD ~1.97. Our work highly encourages the development of clinically applicable segmentation tools based on deep learning. Future works should focus on improved segmentation of small vessels and methodologies to deal with specific pathologies.
