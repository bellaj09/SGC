Ear-electroencephalography EEG is a promising tool for practical brain-computer interface BCI applications because it is more unobtrusive comfortable and mobile than a typical scalp-EEG system. However an ear-EEG has a natural constraint of electrode location e.g. limited in or around the ear for acquiring informative brain signals sufficiently. Achieving reliable performance of ear-EEG in specific BCI paradigms that do not utilize brain signals on the temporal lobe around the ear is difficult. For example steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs which are mainly generated in the occipital area have a significantly attenuated and distorted amplitude in ear-EEG. Therefore preserving the high level of decoding accuracy is challenging and essential for SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG. In this paper we first investigate linear and nonlinear regression methods to increase the decoding accuracy of ear-EEG regarding SSVEP paradigm by utilizing the estimated target EEG signals on the occipital area. Then we investigate an ensemble method to consider the prediction variability of the regression methods. Finally we propose an error correction regression ECR framework to reduce the prediction errors by adding an additional nonlinear regression process i.e. kernel ridge regression. We evaluate the ECR framework in terms of single session session-to-session transfer and subject-transfer decoding. We also validate the online decoding ability of the proposed framework with a short-time window size. The average accuracies are observed to be 91.119.14% 90.528.67% 86.9612.13% and 78.7912.59%. This paper demonstrates that SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG can achieve reliable performance with the proposed ECR framework.
