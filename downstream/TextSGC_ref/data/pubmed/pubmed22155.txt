"Obtaining a fast and reliable decision is an important issue in brain-computer interfaces BCI particularly in practical real-time applications such as wheelchair or neuroprosthetic control. In this study the EEG signals were firstly analyzed with a power projective base method. Then we were applied a decision-making model the sequential probability ratio testing SPRT for single-trial classification of motor imagery movement events. The unique strength of this proposed classification method lies in its accumulative process which increases the discriminative power as more and more evidence is observed over time. The properties of the method were illustrated on thirteen subjects recordings from three datasets. Results showed that our proposed power projective method outperformed two benchmark methods for every subject. Moreover with sequential classifier the accuracies across subjects were significantly higher than that with nonsequential ones. The average maximum accuracy of the SPRT method was 84.1% as compared with 82.3% accuracy for the sequential Bayesian SB method. The proposed SPRT method provides an explicit relationship between stopping time thresholds and error which is important for balancing the time-accuracy trade-off. These results suggest SPRT would be useful in speeding up decision-making while trading off errors in BCI."
