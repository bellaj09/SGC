Deep learning DL based solutions have been proposed for interpretation of several imaging modalities including radiography CT and MR. For chest radiographs DL algorithms have found success in the evaluation of abnormalities such as lung nodules pulmonary tuberculosis cystic fibrosis pneumoconiosis and location of peripherally inserted central catheters. Chest radiography represents the most commonly performed radiological test for a multitude of non-emergent and emergent clinical indications. This study aims to assess accuracy of deep learning DL algorithm for detection of abnormalities on routine frontal chest radiographs CXR and assessment of stability or change in findings over serial radiographs. Deep learning in chest radiography: Detection of findings and presence of change.
