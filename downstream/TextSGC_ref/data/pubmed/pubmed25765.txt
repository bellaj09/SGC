TelePathSM a telerobotic system utilizing virtual microscope concepts based on high quality still digital imaging and aimed at real-time support for surgery by remote diagnosis of frozen sections. Many hospitals and clinics have an application for the remote practice of pathology particularly in the area of reading frozen sections in support of surgery commonly called anatomic pathology. The goal is to project the expertise of the pathologist into the remote setting by giving the pathologist access to the microscope slides with an image quality and human interface comparable to what the pathologist would experience at a real rather than a virtual microscope. A working prototype of a virtual microscope has been defined and constructed which has the needed performance in both the image quality and human interface areas for a pathologist to work remotely. This is accomplished through the use of telerobotics and an image quality which provides the virtual microscope the same diagnostic capabilities as a real microscope. The examination of frozen sections is performed a two-dimensional world. The remote pathologist is in a virtual world with the same capabilities as a "real" microscope but response times may be slower depending on the specific computing and telecommunication environments. The TelePath system has capabilities far beyond a normal biological microscope such as the ability to create a low power image of the entire sample using multiple images digitally matched together; the ability to digitally retrace a viewing trajectory; and the ability to archive images using CD ROM and other mass storage devices.
