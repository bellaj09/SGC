"Clathrin is an adaptor protein that serves as the principal element of the vesicle-coating complex and is important for the membrane cleavage to dispense the invaginated vesicle from the plasma membrane. The functional loss of clathrins has been tied to a lot of human diseases i.e. neurodegenerative disorders cancer Alzheimers diseases and so on. Therefore creating a precise model to identify its functions is a crucial step towards understanding human diseases and designing drug targets." Identification of clathrin proteins by incorporating hyperparameter optimization in deep learning and PSSM profiles.
