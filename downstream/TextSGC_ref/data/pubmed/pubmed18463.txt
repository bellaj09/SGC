We have previously characterized a model of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD based on classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response NMR that focuses on 2 key PTSD-like features: conditioned responses to trauma-associated cues and hyperarousal. In addition to the development of conditioned NMRs CRs to a tone conditioned stimulus CS associated with a periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus US we have observed that rabbits also exhibit a conditioning-specific reflex modification CRM of the NMR that manifests as an exaggerated and more complex reflexive NMR to presentations of the US by itself particularly to intensities that elicited little response prior to conditioning. Previous work has demonstrated that unpaired presentations of the CS and US are successful at extinguishing CRs and CRM simultaneously even when a significantly weakened version of the US is utilized. In the current study additional extinction treatments were tested including continued pairings of the CS with a weakened US and exposure to the training context alone and these treatments were contrasted with the effects of unpaired extinction with a weakened US and remaining in home cages with no further treatment. Results showed that continued pairings only slightly decreased CRs and CRM while context exposure had no effect on CRs and marginal effects on reducing CRM. Unpaired extinction was still the most effective treatment for reducing both. Findings are discussed in terms of applications to cognitive-behavioral therapies for treatment of PTSD such as incorporating mild innately stressful stimuli into virtual reality therapy. Effects of extinction treatments on the reduction of conditioned responding and conditioned hyperarousal in a rabbit model of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD.
