A virtual-reality simulation tested prosthetic visual acuity for both rectangular and hexagonal phosphene grids. Thirteen normally sighted untrained subjects were required to identify the Landolt C optotype over ten sessions. Overall performance performance by filter setting image analysis and performance by size and orientation of the Landolt C optotype are reported. The results indicated that the hexagonal grid had a slight 4.1% but statistically significant p < 0.0001 performance advantage over the rectangular grid for correct identification of the testing symbol. It was also observed that both the phosphene grids had distinct performance profiles relating to their respective spatial orientation. Over the course of the ten sessions learning afforded subjects an averaged improved performance of 10%. Visual acuity measurement of prosthetic vision: a virtual-reality simulation study.
