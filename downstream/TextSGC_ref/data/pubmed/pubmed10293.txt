Understanding the coordinated activity underlying brain computations requires large-scale simultaneous recordings from distributed neuronal structures at a cellular-level resolution. One major hurdle to design high-bandwidth high-precision large-scale neural interfaces lies in the formidable data streams tens to hundreds of Gbps that are generated by the recorder chip and need to be online transferred to a remote computer. The data rates can require hundreds to thousands of I/O pads on the recorder chip and power consumption on the order of Watts for data streaming alone. One of the solutions is to reduce the bandwidth of neural signals before transmission. Deep compressive autoencoder for action potential compression in large-scale neural recording.
