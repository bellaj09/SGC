We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives O3D repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data derivatives and processing pipelines published together using a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data dMRI with diverse properties of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data we publish all processing pipelines also referred to as open cloud services. The pipelines utilize modern methods for neuroimaging data processing diffusion-signal modelling fiber tracking tractography evaluation white matter segmentation and structural connectome construction. The O3D open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new user-uploaded data. Open source code implementing all O3D services is also provided to allow computational and computer scientists to reuse and extend the processing methods. Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing pipeline promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and data upcycling by providing open access to the research assets for utilization by multiple scientific communities. The open diffusion data derivatives brain data upcycling via integrated publishing of derivatives and reproducible open cloud services.
