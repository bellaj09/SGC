Facial lipoatrophy can be obvious and stigmatising. Poly-L-lactic acid PLLA has been used widely for the correction of HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy. Analysis of the PLLA treatment protocols of 441 consecutive patients was undertaken. Product dilution product volume per session number of sessions time between sessions facial areas treated plane of injection and incidence of injection-site nodules were recorded. Assessments included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Appearance Satisfaction Questionnaire. During the learning curve 30 patients were treated every 2 weeks for a minimum of three sessions. A 3-ml dilution was used and a total of 5 ml was injected in the deep dermis of the buccal areas. The incidence of nodule formation was 31% and 52% of patients did not achieve resolution of their facial disfigurement. A total of 411 patients were treated every 4 weeks for a minimum of four sessions. A minimum 5-ml dilution was used and a minimum total of 10-ml was injected subcutaneously in the temporal infraorbital and buccal areas. The incidence of nodule formation was 2.9% and 10% of patients did not achieve resolution of their facial disfigurement. Patient anxiety and depression scores and appearance satisfaction scores improved significantly with treatment. The face of HIV and AIDS: can we erase the stigma?
