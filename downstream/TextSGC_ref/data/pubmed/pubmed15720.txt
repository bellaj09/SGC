"We examined Emmerts law by measuring the perceived size of an afterimage and the perceived distance of the surface on which the afterimage was projected in actual and virtual environments. The actual environment consisted of a corridor with ample cues as to distance and depth. The virtual environment was made from the CAVE of a virtual reality system. The afterimage disc-shaped and one degree in diameter was produced by flashing with an electric photoflash. The observers were asked to estimate the perceived distance to surfaces located at various physical distances 1 to 24 m by the magnitude estimation method and to estimate the perceived size of the afterimage projected on the surfaces by a matching method. The results show that the perceived size of the afterimage was directly proportional to the perceived distance in both environments; thus Emmerts law holds in virtual as well as actual environments. We suggest that Emmerts law is a specific case of a functional principle of distance scaling by the visual system." "Verification of Emmerts law in actual and virtual environments."
