The general uncertainty of epilepsy and its unpredictable seizures often affect badly the quality of life of people exposed to this disease. There are patients who can be considered fortunate in terms of prediction of any seizures. These are patients with epileptic auras. In this study it was aimed to evaluate pre-seizure warning symptoms of the electroencephalography EEG signals by a convolutional neural network CNN inspired by the epileptic auras defined in the medical field. In this context one-dimensional EEG signals were transformed into a spectrogram display form in the frequency-time domain by applying a short-time Fourier transform STFT. Systemic changes in pre-epileptic seizure have been described by applying the CNN approach to the EEG signals represented in the image form and the subjective EEG-Aura process has been tried to be determined for each patient. Considering all patients included in the evaluation it was determined that the 1-min interval covering the time from the second minute to the third minute before the seizure had the highest mean and the lowest variance to determine the systematic changes before the seizure. Thus the highest performing process is described as EEG-Aura. The average success for the EEG-Aura process was 90.38\u2009\u20096.28% 89.78\u2009\u20098.34% and 90.47\u2009\u20095.95% for accuracy specificity and sensitivity respectively. Through the proposed model epilepsy patients who do not respond to medical treatment methods are expected to maintain their lives in a more comfortable and integrated way.
