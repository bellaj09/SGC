Panicle density of cereal crops such as wheat and sorghum is one of the main components for plant breeders and agronomists in understanding the yield of their crops. To phenotype the panicle density effectively researchers agree there is a significant need for computer vision-based object detection techniques. Especially in recent times research in deep learning-based object detection shows promising results in various agricultural studies. However training such systems usually requires a lot of bounding-box labeled data. Since crops vary by both environmental and genetic conditions acquisition of huge amount of labeled image datasets for each crop is expensive and time-consuming. Thus to catalyze the widespread usage of automatic object detection for crop phenotyping a cost-effective method to develop such automated systems is essential.
