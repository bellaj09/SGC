Facet interventions continue to be used in pain management. Computed tomographic CT images can be registered into a virtual world that includes images generated by an ultrasound US probe tracked in real time permitting guidance of tracked needles. We acquired CT-generated 3-dimensional 3D images of 2 models and a cadaver. Three-dimensional representations of a US probe and needle were generated. A magnetic system tracked the needle and US probe. Using the US 3D CT images were registered to the model/cadaver. Images were fused on a single interface. Facet injections were performed in the models and cadaver with radio-opaque markers. A postprocedure CT image determined appropriate placement. The virtual reality system described demonstrates technical innovations that may lead to future advancements in the area of percutaneous interventions in the management of pain. Virtual reality imaging with real-time ultrasound guidance for facet joint injection: a proof of concept.
