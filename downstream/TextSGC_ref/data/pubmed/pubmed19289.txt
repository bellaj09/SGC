"Gait impairments are among the most common and disabling symptoms of Parkinsons disease. Nonetheless gait is not routinely assessed quantitatively but is described in general terms that are not sensitive to changes ensuing with disease progression. Quantifying multiple gait features eg speed variability and asymmetry under natural and more challenging conditions eg dual-tasking turning and daily living enhanced sensitivity of gait quantification. Studies of neural connectivity and structural network topology have provided information on the mechanisms of gait impairment. Advances in the understanding of the multifactorial origins of gait changes in patients with Parkinsons disease promoted the development of new intervention strategies such as neurostimulation and virtual reality aimed at alleviating gait impairments and enhancing functional mobility. For clinical applicability it is important to establish clear links between specific gait impairments their underlying mechanisms and disease progression to foster the acceptance and usability of quantitative gait measures as outcomes in future disease-modifying clinical trials."
