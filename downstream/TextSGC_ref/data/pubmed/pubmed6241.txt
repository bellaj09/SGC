One of the major challenges currently facing researchers in applying deep learning DL models to medical image analysis is the limited amount of annotated data. Collecting such ground-truth annotations requires domain knowledge cost and time making it infeasible for large-scale databases. Albarqouni et al. S5 presented a novel concept for learning DL models from noisy annotations collected through crowdsourcing platforms e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk and Crowdflower by introducing a robust aggregation layer to the convolutional neural networks Figure S2. Their proposed method was validated on a publicly available database on breast cancer histology images showing astonishing results of their robust aggregation method compared to the baseline of majority voting. In follow-up work Albarqouni et al. S6 introduced the novel concept of a translation from an image to a video game object for biomedical images. This technique allows medical images to be represented as star-shaped objects that can be easily embedded into a readily available game canvas. The proposed method reduces the necessity of domain knowledge for annotations. Exciting and promising results were reported compared to the conventional crowdsourcing platforms.
