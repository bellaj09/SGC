Functional connectivity density mapping FCDM is a newly developed data-driven technique that quantifies the number of local and global functional connections for each voxel in the brain. In this study we evaluated reproducibility sensitivity and specificity of both local functional connectivity density lFCD and global functional connectivity density gFCD. We compared these metrics using the human connectome project HCP compatible high-resolution 2\xa0mm isotropic TR\xa0=\xa00.8\xa0s multiband MB and more typical lower resolution 3.5\xa0mm isotropic TR\xa0=\xa02.0\xa0s single-band SB resting state functional MRI rs-fMRI acquisitions. Furthermore in order to be more clinically feasible only rs-fMRI scans that lasted seven minutes were tested. Subjects were scanned twice within a two-week span. We found sensitivity and specificity increased and reproducibility either increased or did not change for the MB compared to the SB acquisitions. The MB scans also showed improved gray matter/white matter contrast compared to the SB scans. The lFCD and gFCD patterns were similar across MB and SB scans and confined predominantly to gray matter. We also observed a strong spatial correlation of FCD between MB and SB scans indicating the two acquisitions provide similar information. These findings indicate high-resolution MB acquisitions improve the quality of FCD data and seven minute rs-fMRI scan can provide robust FCD measurements.
