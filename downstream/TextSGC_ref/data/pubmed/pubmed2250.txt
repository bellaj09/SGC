"Functional connectivity describes neural activity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI. This noninvasive modality is a promising imaging biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease AD where the connectome can be an indicator to assess and to understand the pathology. However it only provides noisy measurements of brain activity. As a consequence it has shown fairly limited discrimination power on clinical groups. So far the reference functional marker of AD is the fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG-PET. It gives a reliable quantification of metabolic activity but it is costly and invasive. Here our goal is to analyze AD populations solely based on rs-fMRI as functional connectivity is correlated to metabolism. We introduce transmodal learning: leveraging a prior from one modality to improve results of another modality on different subjects. A metabolic prior is learned from an independent FDG-PET dataset to improve functional connectivity-based prediction of AD. The prior acts as a regularization of connectivity learning and improves the estimation of discriminative patterns from distinct rs-fMRI datasets. Our approach is a two-stage classification strategy that combines several seed-based connectivity maps to cover a large number of functional networks that identify AD physiopathology. Experimental results show that our transmodal approach increases classification accuracy compared to pure rs-fMRI approaches without resorting to additional invasive acquisitions. The method successfully recovers brain regions known to be impacted by the disease." "Transmodal Learning of Functional Networks for Alzheimers Disease Prediction."
