"Limb prosthetics exoskeletons and neurorehabilitation devices can be intuitively controlled using myoelectric pattern recognition MPR to decode the subjects intended movement. In conventional MPR descriptive electromyography EMG features representing the intended movement are fed into a classification algorithm. The separability of the different movements in the feature space significantly affects the classification complexity. Classification complexity estimating algorithms CCEAs were studied in this work in order to improve feature selection predict MPR performance and inform on faulty data acquisition."
