In this communication a translational clinical brain-machine interface BMI roadmap for an EEG-based BMI to a robotic exoskeleton NeuroRex is presented. This multi-faceted project addresses important engineering and clinical challenges: It addresses the validation of an intelligent self-balancing robotic lower-body and trunk exoskeleton Rex augmented with EEG-based BMI capabilities to interpret user intent to assist a mobility-impaired person to walk independently. The goal is to improve the quality of life and health status of wheelchair-bounded persons by enabling standing and sitting walking and backing turning ascending and descending stairs/curbs and navigating sloping surfaces in a variety of conditions without the need for additional support or crutches.
