"This article is considered relevant because: 1 car driving is an everyday and safety-critical task; 2 simulators are used to an increasing extent for driver training related topics: training virtual reality human-machine interaction; 3 the article addresses relationships between performance in the simulator and driving test results--a relevant topic for those involved in driver training and the virtual reality industries; 4 this article provides new insights about individual differences in young drivers behaviour. Simulators are being used to an increasing extent for driver training allowing for the possibility of collecting objective data on driver proficiency under standardised conditions. However relatively little is known about how learner drivers simulator measures relate to on-road driving. This study proposes a theoretical framework that quantifies driver proficiency in terms of speed of task execution violations and errors. This study investigated the relationships between these three measures of learner drivers n=804 proficiency during initial simulation-based training and the result of the driving test on the road occurring an average of 6 months later. A higher chance of passing the driving test the first time was associated with making fewer steering errors on the simulator and could be predicted in regression analysis with a correlation of 0.18. Additionally in accordance with the theoretical framework a shorter duration of on-road training corresponded with faster task execution fewer violations and fewer steering errors predictive correlation 0.45. It is recommended that researchers conduct more large-scale studies into the reliability and validity of simulator measures and on-road driving tests."
