Extracting clinical entities and their attributes is a fundamental task of natural language processing NLP in the medical domain. This task is typically recognized as 2 sequential subtasks in a pipeline clinical entity or attribute recognition followed by entity-attribute relation extraction. One problem of pipeline methods is that errors from entity recognition are unavoidably passed to relation extraction. We propose a novel joint deep learning method to recognize clinical entities or attributes and extract entity-attribute relations simultaneously. Extracting entities with attributes in clinical text via joint deep learning.
