The aim of this study is to assess the performance of two machine-learning technologies namely deep learning DL and support vector machine SVM algorithms for detecting central retinal vein occlusion CRVO in ultrawide-field fundus images. Images from 125 CRVO patients n=125 images and 202 non-CRVO normal subjects n=238 images were included in this study. Training to construct the DL model using deep convolutional neural network algorithms was provided using ultrawide-field fundus images. The SVM uses scikit-learn library with a radial basis function kernel. The diagnostic abilities of DL and the SVM were compared by assessing their sensitivity specificity and area under the curve AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve for CRVO. For diagnosing CRVO the DL model had a sensitivity of 98.4% 95% confidence interval CI 94.3-99.8% and a specificity of 97.9% 95% CI 94.6-99.1% with an AUC of 0.989 95% CI 0.980-0.999. In contrast the SVM model had a sensitivity of 84.0% 95% CI 76.3-89.3% and a specificity of 87.5% 95% CI 82.7-91.1% with an AUC of 0.895 95% CI 0.859-0.931. Thus the DL model outperformed the SVM model in all indices assessed P < 0.001 for all. Our data suggest that a DL model derived using ultrawide-field fundus images could distinguish between normal and CRVO images with a high level of accuracy and that automatic CRVO detection in ultrawide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy is possible. This proposed DL-based model can also be used in ultrawide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy to accurately diagnose CRVO and improve medical care in remote locations where it is difficult for patients to attend an ophthalmic medical center.
