The stereotypical distribution of TAR DNA-binding 43 protein TDP-43 aggregates in frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD-TDP suggests that pathological TDP-43 spreads throughout the brain via cell-to-cell transmission and correlates with disease progression but no in vivo experimental data support this hypothesis. We first develop a doxycycline-inducible cell line expressing GFP-tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein iGFP-NLSm as a cell-based system to screen and identify seeding activity of human brain-derived pathological TDP-43 isolated from sporadic FTLD-TDP and familial cases with Granulin FTLD-TDP-GRN or C9orf72 repeat expansion mutations FTLD-TDP-C9+. We demonstrate that intracerebral injections of biologically active pathogenic FTLD-TDP seeds into transgenic mice expressing cytoplasmic human TDP-43 lines CamKIIa-hTDP-43NLSm rNLS8 and CamKIIa-208 and non-transgenic mice led to the induction of de-novo TDP-43 pathology. Moreover TDP-43 pathology progressively spreads throughout the brain in a time-dependent manner via the neuroanatomic connectome. Our study suggests that the progression of FTLD-TDP reflects the templated cell-to-cell transneuronal spread of pathological TDP-43. Patient-derived frontotemporal lobar degeneration brain extracts induce formation and spreading of TDP-43 pathology in vivo.
