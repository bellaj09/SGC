Virtual reality is new technology that is finding application in many facets of orthopaedics. We will describe an application of virtual reality in orthopaedic research. Component placement in total knee arthroplasty depends on identification of anatomic landmarks about the knee. We surmised significant interobserver variability occurs in the identification of landmarks of the distal femur used in total knee arthroplasty. The results tested in virtual space show that certain anatomic landmarks used in total knee arthroplasty are not reliable. The significance of this observation is that landmark identification an integral component of computer-assisted surgical navigation in total knee arthroplasty represents a source of method error in an otherwise accurate and precise computer-assisted technique. Variability of landmark identification in total knee arthroplasty.
