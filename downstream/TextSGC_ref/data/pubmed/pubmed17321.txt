Interest in artificial intelligence AI research has grown rapidly over the past few years in part thanks to the numerous successes of modern machine learning techniques such as deep learning the availability of large datasets and improvements in computing power. AI is proving to be increasingly applicable to healthcare and there is a growing list of tasks where algorithms have matched or surpassed physician performance. Despite the successes there remain significant concerns and challenges surrounding algorithm opacity trust and patient data security. Notwithstanding these challenges AI technologies will likely become increasingly integrated into emergency medicine in the coming years. This perspective presents an overview of current AI research relevant to emergency medicine. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in emergency medicine.
