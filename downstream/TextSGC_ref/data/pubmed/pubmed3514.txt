We investigated whether graphomotor organization during a digitized Clock Drawing Test dCDT would be associated with cognitive and/or brain structural differences detected with a tractography-derived structural connectome of the brain. 72 non-demented/non-depressed adults were categorized based on whether or not they used \anchor\ digits i.e. 12 3 6 9 before any other digits while completing dCDT instructions to "draw the face of a clock with all the numbers and set the hands to 10 after 11". \Anchorers\ were compared to \non-anchorers\ across dCDT additional cognitive measures and connectome-based metrics. In the context of grossly intact clock drawings anchorers required fewer strokes to complete the dCDT and outperformed non-anchorers on executive functioning and learning/memory/recognition tasks. Anchorers had higher local efficiency for the left medial orbitofrontal and transverse temporal cortices as well as the right rostral anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus versus non-anchorers suggesting better regional integration within local networks involving these regions; select aspects of which correlated with cognition. Results also revealed that anchorers\ exhibited a higher degree of modular integration among heteromodal regions of the ventral visual processing stream versus non-anchorers. Thus an easily observable graphomotor distinction was associated with 1 better performance in specific cognitive domains 2 higher local efficiency suggesting better regional integration and 3 more sophisticated modular integration involving the ventral \what\ visuospatial processing stream. Taken together these results enhance our knowledge of the brain-behavior relationships underlying unprompted graphomotor organization during dCDT. Cognitive and connectome properties detectable through individual differences in graphomotor organization.
