"Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis PMNE is a common developmental disorder in children. Previous literature has suggested that PMNE not only is a micturition disorder but also is characterized by cerebral structure abnormalities and dysfunction. However the biological mechanisms underlying the disease are not thoroughly understood. Graph theoretical analysis has provided a unique tool to reveal the intrinsic attributes of the connectivity patterns of a complex network from a global perspective. Resting-state fMRI was performed in 20 children with PMNE and 20 healthy controls. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearsons correlations for blood oxygenation level-dependent temporal fluctuations among the 2 groups followed by graph-based network analyses. The functional brain networks in the PMNE patients were characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient global and local efficiency and higher characteristic path length compared with controls. PMNE patients also showed a reduced nodal efficiency in the bilateral calcarine sulcus bilateral cuneus bilateral lingual gyri and right superior temporal gyrus. Our findings suggest that PMNE includes brain network alterations that may affect global communication and integration."
