The deep convolutional neural network has achieved outstanding performance on neonatal brain MRI tissue segmentation. However it may fail to produce reasonable results on unseen datasets that have different imaging appearance distributions with the training data. The main reason is that deep learning models tend to have a good fitting to the training dataset but do not lead to a good generalization on the unseen datasets. To address this problem we propose a multi-task learning method which simultaneously learns both tissue segmentation and geodesic distance regression to regularize a shared encoder network. Furthermore a dense attention gate is explored to force the network to learn rich contextual information. By using three neonatal brain datasets with different imaging protocols from different scanners our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method over the existing deep learning-based methods on the unseen datasets.
