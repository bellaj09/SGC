Despite their importance in reward motivation and learning there is only sparse anatomical knowledge about the human medial forebrain bundle MFB and the connectivity of the ventral tegmental area VTA. A thorough anatomical and microstructural description of the reward related PFC/OFC regions and their connection to the VTA - the superolateral branch of the MFB slMFB - is however mandatory to enable an interpretation of distinct therapeutic effects from different interventional treatment modalities in neuropsychiatric disorders DBS TMS etc.. This work aims at a normative description of the human MFB and more detailed the slMFB anatomy with respect to distant prefrontal connections and microstructural features. The anatomy of the human medial forebrain bundle: Ventral tegmental area connections to reward-associated subcortical and frontal lobe regions.
