The recent advent of individualized resting-state network mapping RSNM has revealed substantial interindividual variability in anatomical localization of brain networks identified by using resting-state functional MRI rsfMRI. RSNM enables personalized targeting of focal neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS. rTMS is believed to exert antidepressant efficacy by modulating connectivity between the stimulation site the default mode network DMN and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex sgACC. Personalized rTMS may be particularly useful after repetitive traumatic brain injury TBI which is associated with neurodegenerative tauopathy in medial temporal limbic structures. These degenerative changes are believed to be related to treatment-resistant neurobehavioral disturbances observed in many retired athletes.
