Recent publications in the Electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interface field suggest that this technology could be ready to go outside the research labs and enter the market as a new consumer product. This assumption is supported by the recent advantages obtained in terms of front-end graphical user interfaces back-end classification algorithms and technology improvement in terms of wearable devices and dry EEG sensors. This editorial paper aims at mentioning these aspects starting from the review paper "Brain-Computer Interface Spellers: A Review" Rezeika et al. 2018 published within the Brain Sciences journal and citing other relevant review papers that discussed these points. Brain-Computer Interfaces: Toward a Daily Life Employment.
