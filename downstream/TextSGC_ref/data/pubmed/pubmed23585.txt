Virtual reality VR has provided a new methodology for interacting with information. Since telemedicine is principally involved with transmitting medical information VR has the potential to enhance the telemedicine experience. The two principle ways in which VR can be applied are as an interface which enables a more intuitive manner of interacting with information and as an environment that enhances the feeling of presence during the interaction. Since there are no current clinical applications of VR in the telemedicine experience this report reviews concepts and experiences with the potential to enhance the delivery of telemedicine. Virtual reality and telemedicine: exploring advanced concepts.
