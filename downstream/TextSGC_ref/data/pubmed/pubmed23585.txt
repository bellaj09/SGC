Recent studies on visuomotor processes using virtual setups have suggested that actions are affected by similar biases as perceptual tasks. In particular a strong lack of depth constancy is revealed resembling biases in perceptual estimates of relative depth. With this study we aim to understand whether these findings are mostly caused by a lack of metric accuracy of the visuomotor system or by the limited cues provided by the use of virtual reality. We addressed this issue by comparing grasping movements towards a spherical object located at four distances 420 450 480 and 510 mm performed in three conditions: 1 virtual in which the target was a virtual object defined by binocular cues 2 glow-in-the-dark in which the object was painted with luminous paint but no other cue was provided and 3 full-cue in which the movement was performed with the lights on and all the environmental information was available. Results revealed a striking effect of object distance on grip aperture equally in all three conditions. Specifically grip aperture gradually decreased with increase in object distance proving a consistent lack of depth constancy. These findings clearly demonstrate that systematic biases in grasping actions are not induced by the use of virtual environments and that action and perception may involve the same visual information which does not engage a metric reconstruction of the scene. Lack of depth constancy for grasping movements in both virtual and real environments.
