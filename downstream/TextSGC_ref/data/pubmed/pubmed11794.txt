"Since the cell assembly CA was hypothesised it has gained substantial support and is believed to be the neural basis of psychological concepts. A CA is a relatively small set of connected neurons that through neural firing can sustain activation without stimulus from outside the CA and is formed by learning. Extensive evidence from multiple single unit recording and other techniques provides support for the existence of CAs that have these properties and that their neurons also spike with some degree of synchrony. Since the evidence is so broad and deep the review concludes that CAs are all but certain. A model of CAs is introduced that is informal but is broad enough to include e.g. synfire chains without including e.g. holographic reduced representation. CAs are found in most cortical areas and in some sub-cortical areas they are involved in psychological tasks including categorisation short-term memory and long-term memory and are central to other tasks including working memory. There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that CAs are the neural basis of all concepts. A range of models have been used to simulate CA behaviour including associative memory and more process- oriented tasks such as natural language parsing. Questions involving CAs e.g. memory persistence CAs complex interactions with brain waves and learning remain unanswered. CA research involves a wide range of disciplines including biology and psychology and this paper reviews literature directly related to the CA providing a basis of discussion for this interdisciplinary community on this important topic. Hopefully this discussion will lead to more formal and accurate models of CAs that are better linked to neuropsychological data." A review of cell assemblies.
