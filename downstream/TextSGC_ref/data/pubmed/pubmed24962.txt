Generally brain-computer interfaces BCIs require calibration before usage to ensure efficient performance. Therefore each BCI user has to attend a certain number of calibration sessions to be able to use the system. However such calibration requirements may be difficult to fulfill especially for patients with disabilities. In this paper we introduce a probabilistic transfer learning approach to reduce the calibration requirements of our EEG-fTCD hybrid BCI designed using motor imagery MI and flickering mental rotation MR/word generation WG paradigms. The proposed approach identifies the top similar datasets from previous BCI users to a small training dataset collected from a current BCI user and uses these datasets to augment the training data of the current BCI user. To achieve such an aim EEG and fTCD feature vectors of each trial were projected into scalar scores using support vector machines. EEG and fTCD class conditional distributions were learnt separately using the scores of each class. Bhattacharyya distance was used to identify similarities between class conditional distributions obtained using training trials of the current BCI user and those obtained using trials of previous users. A probabilistic approach for calibration time reduction in hybrid EEG-fTCD brain-computer interfaces.
