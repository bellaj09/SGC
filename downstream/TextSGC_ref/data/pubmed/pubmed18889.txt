"The reflection of passive arm displacement in a mirror is a powerful means of inducing a kinaesthetic illusion in the static arm hidden behind the mirror. Our recent research findings suggest that this illusion is not solely visual in origin but results from the combination of visual and proprioceptive signals from the two arms. To determine the respective contributions of visual and proprioceptive signals to this illusion we reproduced the mirror paradigm in virtual reality. As in the physical version of the mirror paradigm one of the participants arms the left arm in our study could be flexed or extended passively. This movement was combined with displacements of the avatars left and right forearms as viewed in a first-person perspective through a virtual reality headset. In order to distinguish between visual and proprioceptive contributions two unimodal conditions were applied separately: displacement of the avatars forearms in the absence of physical displacement of the left arm the visual condition and displacement of the left forearm while the avatars forearms were masked the proprioceptive condition. Of the 34 female participants included in the study 28 experienced a kinaesthetic mirror illusion in their static right arm. The strength of the illusion expressed in terms of speed and duration evoked by the bimodal condition was much higher than that observed in either of the two unimodal conditions. Our present results confirm that the involvement of visual signals in the mirror illusion-often considered as a prototypic visual illusion-has been overstated. The mirror illusion also involves non-visual signals bilateral proprioceptive-somaesthetic signals in fact that interact with the visual signals and strengthen the kinaesthetic effect." The respective contributions of visual and proprioceptive afferents to the mirror illusion in virtual reality.
