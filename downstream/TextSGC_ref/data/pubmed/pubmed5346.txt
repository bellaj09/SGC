"Recent studies have started to elucidate the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide LSD on the human brain but the underlying dynamics are not yet fully understood. Here we used connectome-harmonic decomposition a novel method to investigate the dynamical changes in brain states. We found that LSD alters the energy and the power of individual harmonic brain states in a frequency-selective manner. Remarkably this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality. Beyond the present findings these methods open up for a better understanding of the complex brain dynamics in health and disease." Connectome-harmonic decomposition of human brain activity reveals dynamical repertoire re-organization under LSD.
