Highly specific Cas9 nucleases derived from SpCas9 are valuable tools for genome editing but their wide applications are hampered by a lack of knowledge governing guide RNA gRNA activity. Here we perform a genome-scale screen to measure gRNA activity for two highly specific SpCas9 variants eSpCas91.1 and SpCas9-HF1 and wild-type SpCas9 WT-SpCas9 in human cells and obtain indel rates of over 50000 gRNAs for each nuclease covering ~20000 genes. We evaluate the contribution of 1031 features to gRNA activity and develope models for activity prediction. Our data reveals that a combination of RNN with important biological features outperforms other models for activity prediction. We further demonstrate that our model outperforms other popular gRNA design tools. Finally we develop an online design tool DeepHF for the three Cas9 nucleases. The database as well as the designer tool is freely accessible via a web server http://www.DeepHF.com/ . Optimized CRISPR guide RNA design for two high-fidelity Cas9 variants by deep learning.
