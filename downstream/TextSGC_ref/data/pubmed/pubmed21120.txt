Despite the 8-18.5% of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF Operation Enduring Freedom OEF and Operation New Dawn OND veterans who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD few receive empirically supported treatments. Among those that do the dropout rate is high and more than 50% retain their diagnosis after treatment. This study evaluated the efficacy of Trauma Management Therapy TMT delivered in a 3-week intensive outpatient IOP format. TMT combines virtual-reality augmented individual exposure therapy with a group intervention to address social isolation anger and depression. One hundred twelve 112 OIF/OEF/OND veterans and active duty personnel participated. Assessment included measures of PTSD sleep depression anger guilt and social isolation administered at post-treatment 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The effect size for TMT delivered in an IOP format was 2.06 with 65.9% no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD. There were similar positive effects in other domains and treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. The results are discussed regarding the need for efficacious multi-component interventions that can be delivered safely and rapidly and the potential of this approach towards that end.
