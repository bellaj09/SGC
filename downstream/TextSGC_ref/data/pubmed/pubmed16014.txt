To demonstrate accurate MR image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data using cross-domain convolutional neural networks CNNs METHODS: Cross-domain CNNs consist of 3 components: 1 a deep CNN operating on the k-space KCNN 2 a deep CNN operating on an image domain ICNN and 3 an interleaved data consistency operations. These components are alternately applied and each CNN is trained to minimize the loss between the reconstructed and corresponding fully sampled k-spaces. The final reconstructed image is obtained by forward-propagating the undersampled k-space data through the entire network.
