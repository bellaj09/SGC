Electrocorticogram ECoG recordings taken from electrodes placed on the surface of the cortex have been successfully implemented for control of brain machine interfaces BMIs. Optogenetics direct optical stimulation of neurons in brain tissue genetically modified to express channelrhodopsin-2 ChR2 enables targeting of specific types of neurons with sub-millisecond temporal precision. In this work we developed a BMI device called an Opto- ECoG array which combines ECoG recording and optogenetics-based stimulation to enable multichannel bi-directional interactions with neurons. The Opto- ECoG array comprises two sub-arrays each containing a 4  4 distribution of micro-epidural transparent electrodes   200 m diameter and embedded light-emitting diodes LEDs for optical neural stimulation on a 2.5  2.5 mm footprint to match the bilateral hemispherical area of the visual cortex in a rat. The transparent electrodes were fabricated with indium tin oxide ITO. Parylene-C served as the main structural and packaging material for flexibility and biocompatibility. Optical electrical and thermal characteristics of the fabricated device were investigated and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the device.
