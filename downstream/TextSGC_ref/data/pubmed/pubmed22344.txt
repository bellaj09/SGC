As their illness progresses patients with Multiple Sclerosis MS may suffer from motor impairments. In the present study we examined the effectiveness of three interventions for learning a bimanual coordination task: Virtual reality training VRT conventional physical training CPT and the combination of VRT and CPT COMB. A total of 45 women with MS were randomly assigned to one of the following study conditions: VRT CPT or COMB. Bimanual coordination was assessed at baseline eight weeks later at study completion and 4 weeks after that at follow-up. Bimanual coordination improved over time from baseline to study completion and to follow-up. Compared to the VRT and CPT conditions the COMB condition led to higher coordination accuracy and consistency. The combination thus appears to have the potential to speed up the recovery of motor control and rehabilitation of women with MS. Combined virtual reality and physical training improved the bimanual coordination of women with multiple sclerosis.
