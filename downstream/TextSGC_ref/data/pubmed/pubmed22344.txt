One of the important challenges in designing Brain-Machine Interfaces BMI is to build implantable systems that have the ability to reliably process the activity of large ensembles of cortical neurons. In this paper we report the design fabrication and testing of a polyimide-based microelectrode array integrated with a low-power amplifier as part of the Florida Wireless Integrated Recording Electrode FWIRE project at the University of Florida developing a fully implantable neural recording system for BMI applications. The electrode array was fabricated using planar micromachining MEMS processes and hybrid packaged with the amplifier die using a flip-chip bonding technique. The system was tested both on bench and in-vivo. Acute and chronic neural recordings were obtained from a rodent for a period of 42 days. The electrode-amplifier performance was analyzed over the chronic recording period with the observation of a noise floor of 4.5 microVrms and an average signal-to-noise ratio of 3.8.
