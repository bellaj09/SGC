"Conventionally the practice of neurosurgery has been characterized by the removal of pathology congenital or acquired. The emerging complement to the removal of pathology is surgery for the specific purpose of restoration of function. Advents in neuroscience technology and the understanding of neural circuitry are creating opportunities to intervene in disease processes in a reparative manner thereby advancing toward the long-sought-after concept of neurorestoration. Approaching the issue of neurorestoration from a biomedical engineering perspective is the rapidly growing arena of implantable devices. Implantable devices are becoming more common in medicine and are making significant advancements to improve a patients functional outcome. Devices such as deep brain stimulators vagus nerve stimulators and spinal cord stimulators are now becoming more commonplace in neurosurgery as we utilize our understanding of the nervous system to interpret neural activity and restore function. One of the most exciting prospects in neurosurgery is the technologically driven field of brain-machine interface also known as brain-computer interface or neuroprosthetics. The successful development of this technology will have far-reaching implications for patients suffering from a great number of diseases including but not limited to spinal cord injury paralysis stroke or loss of limb. This article provides an overview of the issues related to neurorestoration using implantable devices with a specific focus on brain-machine interface technology." A primer on brain-machine interfaces concepts and technology: a key element in the future of functional neurorestoration.
