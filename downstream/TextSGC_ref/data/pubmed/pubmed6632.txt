In the last decade deep learning techniques have further improved human activity recognition HAR performance on several benchmark datasets. This paper presents a novel framework to classify and analyze human activities. A new convolutional neural network CNN strategy is applied to a single user movement recognition using a smartphone. Three parallel CNNs are used for local feature extraction and latter they are fused in the classification task stage. The whole CNN scheme is based on a feature fusion of a fine-CNN a medium-CNN and a coarse-CNN. A tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope sensor embedded in a smartphone are used to record the acceleration and angle signals. Six human activities successfully classified are walking walking-upstairs walking-downstairs sitting standing and laying. Performance evaluation is presented for the proposed CNN. Coarse-Fine Convolutional Deep-Learning Strategy for Human Activity Recognition.
