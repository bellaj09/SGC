"This article describes the particular challenges encountered at a chronic kidney disease teaching event for nurses including the problems of coaching learners with varied experience and using appropriate teaching methods to ensure learners remain focused. The importance of different learning styles are also discussed in reference to the relevant research. The pros and cons of a lecture-type presentation are explored and an example of a more varied lecture-style is provided. The case is also made for a facilitative approach to teaching that encourages deep-level learning. It is suggested that using vivid examples such as case studies can facilitate engagement with the presented material encouraging learners to ask what-if questions that are designed to develop critical thinking. This approach assists learners to build their knowledge-base on both academic and real-life experience." The challenges of setting up a teaching event for health-care staff.
