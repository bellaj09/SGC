Virtual reality VR allows precise control and manipulation of rich dynamic stimuli that when coupled with on-line motion capture and neural monitoring can provide a powerful means both of understanding brain behavioral relations in the high dimensional world and of assessing and treating a variety of neural disorders. Here we present a system that combines state-of-the-art fully immersive 3D multi-modal VR with temporally aligned electroencephalographic EEG recordings. The VR system is dynamic and interactive across visual auditory and haptic interactions providing sight sound touch and force. Crucially it does so with simultaneous EEG recordings while subjects actively move about a 20  20 ft space. The overall end-to-end latency between real movement and its simulated movement in the VR is approximately 40 ms. Spatial precision of the various devices is on the order of millimeters. The temporal alignment with the neural recordings is accurate to within approximately 1 ms. This powerful combination of systems opens up a new window into brain-behavioral relations and a new means of assessment and rehabilitation of individuals with motor and other disorders.
