*Machines that dream the restless impulse for technical change that has marked radiology from its beginning and forays into deep neural networks will no doubt unsettle long-held institu- tional practices in radiology. *A willingness to collaborate and puzzle through machine intelligence has come from those who have not accepted the status quo. A certain form of scientific curiosity has been a guiding principle in their work. *In radiology machine intelligence has been extremely useful and built into just about every major technical innovation. But it has only been the last several years that a subfield of Al machine learning has begun to show remarkably fast development due to faster comput- er processing capabilities and advanced modeling and results emerging from the application of deep learning.
