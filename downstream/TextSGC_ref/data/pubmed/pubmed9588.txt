Deep brain stimulation DBS surgery is an option for patients experiencing medically resistant neurologic symptoms. DBS complications are rare; finding significant predictors requires a large number of surgeries. Machine learning algorithms may be used to effectively predict these outcomes. The aims of this study were to 1 investigate preoperative clinical risk factors and 2 build machine learning models to predict adverse outcomes.
