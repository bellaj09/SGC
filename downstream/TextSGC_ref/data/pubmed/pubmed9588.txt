"Visual stimuli from photographs and artworks raise corresponding emotional responses. It is a long process to prove whether the emotions that arise from photographs and artworks are different or not. We answer this question by employing electroencephalogram EEG-based biosignals and a deep convolutional neural network CNN-based emotion recognition model. We employ Russells emotion model which matches emotion keywords such as happy calm or sad to a coordinate system whose axes are valence and arousal respectively. We collect photographs and artwork images that match the emotion keywords and build eighteen one-minute video clips for nine emotion keywords for photographs and artwork. We hired forty subjects and executed tests about the emotional responses from the video clips. From the t-test on the results we concluded that the valence shows difference while the arousal does not."
