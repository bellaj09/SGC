Brain-computer interface BCI researchers have shown increasing interest in soliciting user experience UX feedback but the severe speech and physical impairments SSPI of potential users create barriers to effective implementation with existing feedback instruments. This article describes augmentative and alternative communication AAC-based techniques for obtaining feedback from this population and presents results from administration of a modified questionnaire to 12 individuals with SSPI after trials with a BCI spelling system. The proposed techniques facilitated successful questionnaire completion and provision of narrative feedback for all participants. Questionnaire administration required less than five minutes and minimal effort from participants. Results indicated that individual users may have very different reactions to the same system and that ratings of workload and comfort provide important information not available through objective performance measures. People with SSPI are critical stakeholders in the future development of BCI and appropriate adaptation of feedback questionnaires and administration techniques allows them to participate in shaping this assistive technology.
