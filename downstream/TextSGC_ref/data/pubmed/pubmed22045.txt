With the introduction of laparoscopy more than 20 years ago the surgeon has been confronted with several new challenges. First the loss of the depth perception two-dimensional 2D vision is a clear handicap during the initial learning curve. Then the reduced dexterity with the current available instruments remains a drawback of classic minimally invasive surgery. Since the beginning of the 2000s the advent of robotic surgery has given back the three-dimensional 3D vision thanks to the two camera channels. In addition the dexterity was restored with the "endowristed" technology Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvale CA. In parallel several groups have tested and evaluated new cameras for 3D laparoscopy with interesting results. Yet the real advantages have still to be proven. On the other hand restoring the 3D vision is clearly a step forward to all the possibilities associated with augmented reality. Reviewing the current literature this article shows the interest in the use of 3D technology for laparoscopic surgery. In addition future trends are explored especially those concerning augmented and virtual reality coupled with 3D technology. "Three-dimensional laparoscopy: a new tool in the surgeons armamentarium."
