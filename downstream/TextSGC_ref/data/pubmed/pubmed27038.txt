"Phase synchrony has extensively been studied for understanding neural coordination in health and disease. There are a few studies concerning the implications in the context of BCIs but its potential for establishing a communication channel in patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders remains totally unexplored. We investigate here this possibility by estimating the time-resolved phase connectivity patterns induced during a motor imagery MI task and adopting a supervised learning scheme to recover the subjects intention from the streaming data." Exploiting the heightened phase synchrony in patients with neuromuscular disease for the establishment of efficient motor imagery BCIs.
