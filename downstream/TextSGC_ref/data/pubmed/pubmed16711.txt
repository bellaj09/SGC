A 24-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism PTE and left common iliac vein thrombosis. She had used low-dose contraceptive pill for dysmenorrhea. Otherwise her laboratory data did not show any other thrombotic risk factors. Thrombus in the common iliac vein usually requires a permanent inferior vena cava IVC filter. However the use of long-term warfarin should have been avoided for her potential future pregnancy. A retrievable IVC filter was placed and catheter directed thrombolysis was performed for her deep vein thrombosis DVT. Local injection of monteplase from a pulse spray catheter was performed for 4 days. After the catheter-based treatment the thrombus resolved and the IVC filter was successfully removed on day 19. The patient was discharged on day 21. Warfarin therapy was discontinued 6 months after discharge. <Learning objective: Urokinase is recommended in the guideline of the Japanese Circulation Society. But the dose is much less than those stated in guidelines overseas. Several studies have shown that tissue-plasminogen activator t-PA might be more effective than urokinase. We report a case in which local injection of monteplase a type of long acting t-PA for DVT was effective in treating PTE and DVT.>.
