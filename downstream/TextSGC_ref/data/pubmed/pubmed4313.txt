"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation STN-DBS in Parkinsons disease PD not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non-motor DBS effects is not well-characterized. By focusing on the affective domain we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN-DBS which have been reported to improve worsen or remain unchanged."
