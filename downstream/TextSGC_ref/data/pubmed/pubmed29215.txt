Many stroke survivors have significant long-term gait impairment often involving foot drop. Current physiotherapies provide limited recovery. Orthoses substitute for ankle strength but they provide no lasting therapeutic effect. Brain-computer interface BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation FES is a novel rehabilitative approach that may generate permanent neurological improvements. This study explores the safety and feasibility of a foot-drop-targeted BCI-FES physiotherapy in chronic stroke survivors. Brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation therapy for gait rehabilitation after stroke: a safety study.
