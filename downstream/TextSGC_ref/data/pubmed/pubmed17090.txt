Conventional intelligent or adaptive tutoring online systems rely on domain-specific models of learner behavior based on rules deep domain knowledge and other resource-intensive methods. We have developed and studied a domain-independent methodology of adaptive tutoring based on domain-independent signal-processing approaches that obviate the need for the construction of explicit expert and student models. A key advantage of our method over conventional approaches is a lower barrier to entry for educators who want to develop adaptive online learning materials. An adaptive signal-processing approach to online adaptive tutoring.
