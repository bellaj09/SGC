The accurate recognition of fetal facial standard plane FFSP i.e. axial coronal and sagittal plane from ultrasound US images is quite essential for routine US examination. Since the labor-intensive and subjective measurement is too time-consuming and unreliable the development of the automatic FFSP recognition method is highly desirable. Different from the previous methods we leverage a general framework to recognize the FFSP from US images automatically. Specifically instead of using the previous hand-crafted visual features we utilize the recent developed deep learning approach via very deep convolutional networks DCNN architecture to represent fine-grained details of US image. Also very small 33 convolution filters are adopted to improve the performance. The evaluation of our FFSP dataset shows the superiority of our method over the previous studies and achieves the state-of-the-art FFSP recognition results.
