Children with cerebral palsy CP often show impaired selective motor control SMC that induces limitations in motor function. Children with CP can improve aspects of pathological gait in an immediate response to visual biofeedback. It is not known however how these gait adaptations are achieved at the neural level nor do we know the extent of SMC plasticity in CP.
