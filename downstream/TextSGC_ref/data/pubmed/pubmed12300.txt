The emergence of artificial intelligence AI in nuclear medicine and radiology has been accompanied by AI commentators and experts predicting that AI would make radiologists in particular extinct. More realistic perspectives suggest significant changes will occur in medical practice. There is no escaping the disruptive technology associated with AI neural networks and deep learning the most significant perhaps since the early days of Roentgen Becquerel and Curie. AI is an omen but it need not be foreshadowing a negative event; rather it is heralding great opportunity. The key to sustainability lies not in resisting AI but in having a deep understanding and exploiting the capabilities of AI in nuclear medicine while mastering those capabilities unique to the human resources.
