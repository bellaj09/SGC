The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic elucidated how a single highly infectious virus can overburden healthcare systems of even highly economically developed nations. A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit intensive care unit beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. While impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health in particular obesity. However measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises.
