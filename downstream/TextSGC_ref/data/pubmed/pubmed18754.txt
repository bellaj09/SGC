This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of the stereoscopic virtual reality display system with the conventional computed tomography CT workstation and three-dimensional rotational angiography 3DRA for intracranial aneurysm detection and characterization with a focus on small aneurysms and those near the bone. Use of the stereoscopic virtual reality display system for the detection and characterization of intracranial aneurysms: A Icomparison with conventional computed tomography workstation and 3D rotational angiography.
