To better control and manage harbor water quality is an important mission for coastal cities such as New York City NYC. To achieve this managers and governors need keep track of key quality indicators such as temperature pH and dissolved oxygen. Among these the Biochemical Oxygen Demand BOD over five days is a critical indicator that requires much time and effort to detect causing great inconvenience in both academia and industry. Existing experimental and statistical methods cannot effectively solve the detection time problem or provide limited accuracy. Also due to various human-made mistakes or facility issues the data used for BOD detection and prediction contain many missing values resulting in a sparse matrix. Few studies have addressed the sparse matrix problem while developing statistical detection methods. To address these gaps we propose a deep learning based model that combines Deep Matrix Factorization DMF and Deep Neural Network DNN. The model was able to solve the sparse matrix problem more intelligently and predict the BOD value more accurately. To test its effectiveness we conducted a case study on the NYC harbor water based on 32323 water samples. The results showed that the proposed method achieved 11.54%-17.23% lower RMSE than conventional matrix completion methods and 19.20%-25.16% lower RMSE than traditional machine learning algorithms.
