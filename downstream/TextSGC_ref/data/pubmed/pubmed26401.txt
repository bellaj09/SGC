Brain-computer interfaces have been proposed for stroke rehabilitation. Motor cortical activity derived from the electroencephalography EEG can trigger external devices that provide congruent sensory feedback. However many stroke patients regain residual muscle EMG: electromyography control due to spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation; therefore EEG may not be necessary as a control signal. In this paper a direct comparison was made between the induction of corticospinal plasticity using either EEG- or EMG-controlled electrical nerve stimulation. Twenty healthy participants participated in two intervention sessions consisting of EEG- and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation. The sessions consisted of 50 pairings between foot dorsiflexion movements decoded through either EEG or EMG and electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. Before immediately after and 30 minutes after the intervention 15 motor evoked potentials MEPs were elicited in tibialis anterior through transcranial magnetic stimulation. Increased MEPs were observed immediately after 62  26% 73  27% for EEG- and EMG-triggered electrical stimulation respectively and 30 minutes after each of the two interventions 79  26% and 72  27% compared to the pre-intervention measurement. There was no difference between the interventions. Both EEG- and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation can induce corticospinal plasticity which suggests that stroke patients with residual EMG can use that modality instead of EEG to trigger stimulation.
