"Stress is assumed to cause a shift from flexible cognitive memory to more rigid habit memory. In the spatial memory domain stress impairs place learning depending on the hippocampus whereas stimulus-response learning based on the striatum appears to be improved. While the neural basis of this shift is still unclear previous evidence in rodents points towards cortisol interacting with the mineralocorticoid receptor MR to affect amygdala functioning. The amygdala is in turn assumed to orchestrate the stress-induced shift in memory processing. However an integrative study testing these mechanisms in humans is lacking. Therefore we combined functional neuroimaging of a spatial memory task stress-induction and administration of an MR-antagonist in a full-factorial randomized placebo-controlled between-subjects design in 101 healthy males. We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in cortisol lead to enhanced stimulus-response learning accompanied by increased amygdala activity and connectivity to the striatum. Importantly this shift was prevented by an acute administration of the MR-antagonist spironolactone. Our findings support a model in which the MR and the amygdala play an important role in the stress-induced shift towards habit memory systems revealing a fundamental mechanism of adaptively allocating neural resources that may have implications for stress-related mental disorders."
