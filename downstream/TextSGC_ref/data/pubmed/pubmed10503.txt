In tandem mass spectrometry MS/MS-based proteomics search engines rely on comparison between an experimental MS/MS spectrum and the theoretical spectra of the candidate peptides. Hence accurate prediction of the theoretical spectra of peptides appears to be particularly important. Here we present pDeep a deep neural network-based model for the spectrum prediction of peptides. Using the bidirectional long short-term memory BiLSTM pDeep can predict higher-energy collisional dissociation electron-transfer dissociation and electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation MS/MS spectra of peptides with >0.9 median Pearson correlation coefficients. Further we showed that intermediate layer of the neural network could reveal physicochemical properties of amino acids for example the similarities of fragmentation behaviors between amino acids. We also showed the potential of pDeep to distinguish extremely similar peptides peptides that contain isobaric amino acids for example GG = N AG = Q or even I = L which were very difficult to distinguish using traditional search engines. pDeep: Predicting MS/MS Spectra of Peptides with Deep Learning.
