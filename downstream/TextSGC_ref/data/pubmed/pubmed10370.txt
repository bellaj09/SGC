Remarkable advances in biomedical research have led to the generation of large amounts of data. Using artificial intelligence it has become possible to extract meaningful information from large volumes of data in a shorter frame of time with very less human interference. In effect convolutional neural networks a deep learning method have been taught to recognize pathological lesions from images. Diabetes has high morbidity with millions of people who need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy DR. Deep neural networks offer a great advantage of screening for DR from retinal images in improved identification of DR lesions and risk factors for diseases with high accuracy and reliability. This review aims to compare the current evidences on various deep learning models for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy DR. Fundus photograph-based deep learning algorithms in detecting diabetic retinopathy.
