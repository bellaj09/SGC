The retinal fundus contains intricate vascular trees some of which are mutually intersected and overlapped. The intersection and overlapping of retinal vessels represent vascular junctions i.e. bifurcation and crossover in 2D retinal images. These junctions are important for analyzing vascular diseases and tracking the morphology of vessels. In this paper we propose a two-stage pipeline to detect and classify the junction points. Retinal vascular junction detection and classification via deep neural networks.
