The improvement of brain imaging technique brings about an opportunity for developing and investigating brain-computer interface BCI which is a way to interact with computer and environment. The measured brain activities usually constitute the signals of interest and noises. Applying the portable device and removing noise are the benefits to real-world BCI. In this study one portable electroencephalogram EEG system non-invasively acquired brain dynamics through wireless transmission while six subjects participated in the rapid serial visual presentation RSVP paradigm. The event-related potential ERP was traditionally estimated by ensemble averaging EA to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. One adaptive filter of data-reusing radial basis function network DR-RBFN was also utilized as the estimator. The results showed that this portable EEG system stably acquired brain activities. Furthermore the task-related potentials could be clearly explored from the limited samples of EEG data through DR-RBFN. According to the artifact-free data from the portable device this study demonstrated the potential to move the BCI from laboratory research to real-life application in the near future.
