"The studies of the simulation of acupuncture manipulation mainly focus on mechanical simulation and virtual simulation SIM. In terms of mechanical simulation the aim of the research is to develop the instruments of the simulation of acupuncture manipulation and to apply them to the simulation or a replacement of the manual acupuncture manipulation; while the virtual simulation applies the virtual reality technology to present the manipulation in 3D real-time on the computer screen. This paper is to summarize the recent research progress on computer simulation of acupuncture manipulation at home and abroad and thus concludes with the significance and the rising problems over the computer simulation of acupuncture manipulation. Therefore we put forward that the research on simulation manipulation should pay much attention to experts manipulation simulation as well as the verification studies on conformity and clinical effects." Thoughts on and probes into computer simulation of acupuncture manipulation.
