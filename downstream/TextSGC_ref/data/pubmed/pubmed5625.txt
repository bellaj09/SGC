"Brain activity is a dynamic combination of different sensory responses and thus brain activity/state is continuously changing over time. However the brains dynamical functional states recognition at fast time-scales in task fMRI data have been rarely explored. In this paper we propose a novel 5-layer deep sparse recurrent neural network DSRNN model to accurately recognize the brain states across the whole scan session. Specifically the DSRNN model includes an input layer one fully-connected layer two recurrent layers and a softmax output layer. The proposed framework has been tested on seven task fMRI data sets of Human Connectome Project. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DSRNN model can accurately identify the brains state in different task fMRI data sets and significantly outperforms other auto-correlation methods or non-temporal approaches in the dynamic brain state recognition accuracy. In general the proposed DSRNN offers a new methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research." Recognizing Brain States Using Deep Sparse Recurrent Neural Network.
