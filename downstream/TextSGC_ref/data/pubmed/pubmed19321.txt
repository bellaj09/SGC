Although minimally invasive surgery MIS has replaced many open procedures in visceral surgery technical and psychomotor obstacles remain a constant challenge for surgeons and trainees. However there are various training curricula enabling surgeons to acquire the visuospatial and psychomotor abilities additionally required when performing MIS. Currently accepted training modalities include box-trainers organ and animal models as well as completely simulated training environments realized in virtual reality VR trainers. All of these methods facilitate an adequate training prior to patient contact so patient safety can benefit as well. This study aims to evaluate the benefit of a structured multi-modality laparoscopy training curriculum. Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial on a multimodal training curriculum for laparoscopic cholecystectomy - LapTrain.
