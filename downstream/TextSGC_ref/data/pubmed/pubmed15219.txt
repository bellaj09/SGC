Mapping the architecture of the brain is essential for identifying the neural computations that affect behavior. Traditionally in histology stained objects in tissue slices are hand-marked under a microscope in a manually intensive time-consuming process. An integrated hardware and software system is needed to automate image acquisition image processing and object detection. Such a system would enable high throughput tissue analysis to rapidly map an entire brain.
