Large-scale functional networks have been extensively studied using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. However the pattern organization and function of fine-scale network activity remain largely unknown. Here we characterized the spontaneously emerging visual cortical activity by applying independent component IC analysis to resting state fMRI signals exclusively within the visual cortex. In this subsystem scale we observed about 50 spatially ICs that were reproducible within and across subjects and analyzed their spatial patterns and temporal relationships to reveal the intrinsic parcellation and organization of the visual cortex. The resulting visual cortical parcels were aligned with the steepest gradient of cortical myelination and were organized into functional modules segregated along the dorsal/ventral pathways and foveal/peripheral early visual areas. Cortical distance could partly explain intra-hemispherical functional connectivity but not interhemispherical connectivity; after discounting the effect of anatomical affinity the fine-scale functional connectivity still preserved a similar visual-stream-specific modular organization. Moreover cortical retinotopy folding and cytoarchitecture impose limited constraints to the organization of resting state activity. Given these findings we conclude that spontaneous activity patterns in the visual cortex are primarily organized by visual streams likely reflecting feedback network interactions.
