"In April 1988 following preliminary research Notre Dame Elementary School in Edmunston N.B. initiated a pilot project entitled Management of Childrens Stress. Using a three-dimensional process parents teachers and students collaborated to empower all students enrolled at the school to effectively manage their day-to-day stress. To prepare the children parents and teachers participated in nine- and 15-hour education sessions respectively. Various techniques including deep breathing exercises stretching relaxation techniques and listening to music were considered. Visualization maximizing the minds potential to envision relaxing images became the preferred technique. In addition to complementing other relaxation techniques used by the children visualization facilitated their learning; developed and improved their concentration motivation and self-confidence; gave them a positive self-image; and reduced health problems. The project has surpassed all expectations. In March 1993 it became part of a Quality of Life Education Project at the school." Stress in school-age children.
