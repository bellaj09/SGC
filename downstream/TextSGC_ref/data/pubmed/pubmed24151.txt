"It is not well understood how people perceive the difficulty of performing brain-computer interface BCI tasks which specific aspects of mental workload contribute the most and whether there is a difference in perceived workload between participants who are able-bodied and disabled. This study evaluated mental workload using the NASA Task Load Index TLX a multi-dimensional rating procedure with six subscales: Mental Demands Physical Demands Temporal Demands Performance Effort and Frustration. Able-bodied and motor disabled participants completed the survey after performing EEG-based BCI Fitts law target acquisition and phrase spelling tasks. The NASA-TLX scores were similar for able-bodied and disabled participants. For example overall workload scores range 0-100 for 1D horizontal tasks were 48.5 SD = 17.7 and 46.6 SD 10.3 respectively. The TLX can be used to inform the design of BCIs that will have greater usability by evaluating subjective workload between BCI tasks participant groups and control modalities."
