Unaccounted temporal dynamics of resting-state functional connectivity\xa0FC metrics challenges their potential as biomarkers for clinical applications in neuroscience. Here we studied the scan time required to reach stable values for various FC metrics including seed-voxel correlations\xa0and spatial independent component analyses sICA and for the local functional connectivity density lFCD a graph theory metric. By increasing the number of time points included in the analysis we assessed the effects of scan time on convergence of accuracy sensitivity specificity reproducibility and reliability of these FC metrics. The necessary scan time to attenuate the effects of the temporal dynamics by 80% varied across connectivity metrics and was shorter for lFCD 7 min than for FC 11 min or for sICA 10 min. Findings suggest that the scan time required to achieve stable FC is metric-dependent with lFCD being the most resilient metric to the effects of temporal dynamics. Thus the lFCD metric could be particularly useful for pediatric and patient populations who may not tolerate long scans.
