High-resolution diffusion imaging with submillimeter isotropic voxels requires long scan times that are usually clinically impractical. Even with those long scans the image quality can still suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio SNR and severe geometric distortion due to long echo spacing in echo-planar imaging sequences. In this study we proposed and validated the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art deep-learning method super-resolution convolutional neural network SRCNN to achieve submillimeter super-resolution diffusion-weighted DW images. The 2D-based deep-learning method was validated by comparing with the ground truth using numerical simulations and by studying region-of-interest ROI using real human data of three healthy volunteers. Furthermore we interrogated the proposed method under different real-life SNR conditions. The results demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning method was able to reproduce sufficient details in the anatomy that can only be detected using high-resolution diffusion imaging. The percentage errors in diffusion tensor imaging DTI derived metrics were less than 8% when the baseline SNR larger than 20. The ROI results demonstrated that the proposed method produced comparable values of diffusion metrics to the matched high-resolution diffusion metrics of real human data. Particularly the patterns of distributions of the subjects were similar between the proposed method and real data across whole-brain gray-matter and white-matter ROIs. A deep-learned submillimeter resolution of 0.625 mm diffusion directional image showed high image quality particularly in the cortical gray matter. We demonstrated the feasibility of using a deep-learning algorithm based on SRCNN in DTI. This approach can be a robust alternative when acquiring the true sub-millimeter diffusion MRI is not available. Super-Resolution Diffusion Tensor Imaging using SRCNN: A Feasibility Study.
