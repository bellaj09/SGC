Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effects of total dissolved gas TDG supersaturation on acute lethality and avoidance responses in juvenile rock carp Procypris rabaudi Tchang. The juvenile rock carp were exposed to water with different levels of supersaturation 105% 115% 120% 125% 130% 135% 140% and 145% and depth of 0.20 m at 25 C for 60 h. Median lethal time LT50 was used to assess the lethal responses corresponding to different levels of gas supersaturation. The results show that half of the juvenile rock carp died at the 120% 125% 130% 135% 140% and 145% levels of supersaturation and the LT50 corresponding to different levels of supersaturation was 18.7 15.4 8.2 6.6 3.5 and 1.7 h. When the level of supersaturated water is below 115% the mortality is negligible. Avoidance responses were observed 5 min after the fish were put into equilibrated water 99% 0.08 m deep and water with different supersaturated levels 105% 115% 125% 135% and 145% 0.08 m deep at 25 C. The fish exhibited strong avoidance responses in supersaturated water when the gas supersaturation was above 135%. However they exhibited an obvious preference to supersaturated water when the gas supersaturation was below 115%. Thus the juvenile rock carp can likely survive in water with a supersaturated level of 115%.
