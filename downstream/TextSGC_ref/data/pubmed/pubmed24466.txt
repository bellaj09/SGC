The first step toward increasing the level of patient safety in endoscopic surgery is for all endoscopic surgeons to acquire fundamental skills including psychomotor skills in the preoperation stage of training. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality VR simulator training and box training for training the fundamental skills of endoscopic surgery. Effectiveness of endoscopic surgery training for medical students using a virtual reality simulator versus a box trainer: a randomized controlled trial.
