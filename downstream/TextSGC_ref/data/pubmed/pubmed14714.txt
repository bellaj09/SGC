Evaluation of clinical images is essential for diagnosis in many specialties. Therefore the development of computer vision algorithms to help analyze biomedical images will be important. In ophthalmology optical coherence tomography OCT is critical for managing retinal conditions. We developed a convolutional neural network CNN that detects intraretinal fluid IRF on OCT in a manner indistinguishable from clinicians. Using 1289 OCT images the CNN segmented images with a 0.911 cross-validated Dice coefficient compared with segmentations by experts. Additionally the agreement between experts and between experts and CNN were similar. Our results reveal that CNN can be trained to perform automated segmentations of clinically relevant image features.
