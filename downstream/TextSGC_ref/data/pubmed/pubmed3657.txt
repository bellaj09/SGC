Variable effects limit the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS as a research and therapeutic tool. Conventional application of a fixed-dose of tDCS does not account for inter-individual differences in anatomy e.g. skull thickness which varies the amount of current reaching the brain. Individualised dose-control may reduce the variable effects of tDCS by reducing variability in electric field E-field intensities at a cortical target site. Dose-controlled tDCS reduces electric field intensity variability at a cortical target site.
