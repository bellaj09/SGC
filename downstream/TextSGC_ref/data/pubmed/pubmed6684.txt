Given its importance fault diagnosis has attracted considerable attention in the literature and several machine learning methods have been proposed to discover the characteristics of different aspects in fault diagnosis. In this paper we propose a Hybrid Deep Belief Network HDBN learning model that integrates data in different ways for intelligent fault diagnosis in motor drive systems such as a vehicle drive system. In particular we propose three data fusion methods: data union data join and data hybrid based on detailed data fusion research. Additionally the significance of the fusion is explained from the energy perspective of the signal. In particular the appropriate fusion methods and data structures suitable for model training requirements can help improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Moreover mixed-precision training is used as a special fusion method to further improve the performance of the model. Experiments with the datasets obtained from the simulation platform demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.
