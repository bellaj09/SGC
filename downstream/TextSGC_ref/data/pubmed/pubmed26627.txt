"Neural recording is important for a wide variety of clinical applications. Until recently recording from the surface of the brain even when using micro-electrocorticography ECoG arrays was not thought to enable recording from individual neurons. Recent results suggest that when the surface electrode contact size is sufficiently small it may be possible to record single neurons from the brains surface. In this study we use computational techniques to investigate the ability of surface electrodes to record the activity of single neurons."
