It is currently unclear whether objects have to be explicitly identified at encoding for reliable behavioral long-term object priming to occur. We conducted two experiments that investigated long-term object and non-object priming using a selective-attention encoding manipulation that reduces explicit object identification. In Experiment 1 participants either counted dots flashed within an object picture shallow encoding or engaged in an animacy task deep encoding at study whereas at test they performed an object-decision task. Priming as measured by reaction times RTs was observed for both types of encoding and was of equivalent magnitude. In Experiment 2 non-object priming faster RTs for studied relative to unstudied non-objects was also obtained under the same selective-attention encoding manipulation as in Experiment 1 and the magnitude of the priming effect was equivalent between experiments. In contrast we observed a linear decrement in recognition memory accuracy across conditions deep encoding of Experiment 1 > shallow encoding Experiment 1 > shallow encoding of Experiment 2 suggesting that priming was not contaminated by explicit memory strategies. We argue that our results are more consistent with the identification/production framework than the perceptual/conceptual distinction and we conclude that priming of pictures largely ignored at encoding can be subserved by the automatic retrieval of two types of instances: one at the motor level and another at an object-decision level. Does long-term object priming depend on the explicit detection of object identity at encoding?
