There have been many recent reports highlighting a crisis in replication and reliability of research in psychology neuroscience and neuroimaging. After a series of reports uncovered various methodological problems with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI research considerable attention has been given to principles and practices to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging findings including promotion of openness transparency and data sharing. However much less attention has been given to use of open access neuroimaging datasets to conduct replication studies. A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies is their high cost in money and labor and utilizing such datasets is an obvious solution for breaking down this barrier. The Human Connectome Project HCP is an open access dataset consisting of extensive neurological behavioral and genetics assessments and neuroimaging data from over 1100 individuals. In the present study findings supporting the replication of a highly cited neuroimaging study that showed correspondence between resting state and task brain networks and novel findings on activation of brain networks during task performance that arose with this exercise are presented as a demonstration of use of the HCP for replication studies. Replication of Resting State-Task Network Correspondence and Novel Findings on Brain Network Activation During Task fMRI in the Human Connectome Project Study.
