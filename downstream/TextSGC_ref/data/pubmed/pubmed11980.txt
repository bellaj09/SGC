The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many proteins variants statistically associated with human disease nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms for example protein-protein interactions PPIs. In this study we address this challenge using a recent machine learning advance-deep neural networks DNNs. We aim at improving the performance of PPIs prediction and propose a method called DeepPPI Deep neural networks for Protein-Protein Interactions prediction which employs deep neural networks to learn effectively the representations of proteins from common protein descriptors. The experimental results indicate that DeepPPI achieves superior performance on the test data set with an Accuracy of 92.50% Precision of 94.38% Recall of 90.56% Specificity of 94.49% Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 85.08% and Area Under the Curve of 97.43% respectively. Extensive experiments show that DeepPPI can learn useful features of proteins pairs by a layer-wise abstraction and thus achieves better prediction performance than existing methods.
