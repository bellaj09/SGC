Various devices are used to aid in the education of laparoscopic skills ranging from simple box trainers to sophisticated virtual reality trainers. Virtual reality system is an advanced and effective training method however it is yet to be adopted in India due to its cost and the advanced technology required for it. Therefore box trainers are being used to train laparoscopic skills. Hence this study was undertaken to assess the overall effectiveness of the box-training course. STUDY PROCEDURE: The study was conducted during six-day laparoscopic skills training workshops held during 2006. Twenty five surgeons; age range of 26 to 45 years of either sex who had not performed laparoscopic surgery before; attending the workshop were evaluated. Each participant was given a list of tasks to perform before beginning the box-training course on day one and was evaluated quantitatively by rating the successful completion of each test. Evaluation began when the subject placed the first tool into the cannula and ended with task completion. Two evaluation methods used to score the subject including a global rating scale and a task-specific checklist. After the subject completed all sessions of the workshop they were asked to perform the same tasks and were evaluated in the same manner. For each task completed by the subjects the difference in the scores between the second and first runs were calculated and interpreted as an improvement as a percentage of the initial score.
