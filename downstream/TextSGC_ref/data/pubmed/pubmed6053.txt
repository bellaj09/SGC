Recent technological and analytical progress in brain imaging has enabled the examination of brain organization and connectivity at unprecedented levels of detail. The Human Connectome Project in Development HCP-D is exploiting these tools to chart developmental changes in brain connectivity. When complete the HCP-D will comprise approximately 1750 open access datasets from 1300\xa0+\xa0healthy human participants ages 5-21 years acquired at four sites across the USA. The participants are from diverse geographical ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. While most participants are tested once others take part in a three-wave longitudinal component focused on the pubertal period ages 9-17 years. Brain imaging sessions are acquired on a 3\xa0T Siemens Prisma platform and include structural functional resting state and task-based diffusion and perfusion imaging physiological monitoring and a battery of cognitive tasks and self-reports. For minors parents additionally complete a battery of instruments to characterize cognitive and emotional development and environmental variables relevant to development. Participants provide biological samples of blood saliva and hair enabling assays of pubertal hormones health markers and banked DNA samples. This paper outlines the overarching aims of the project the approach taken to acquire maximally informative data while minimizing participant burden preliminary analyses and discussion of the intended uses and limitations of the dataset.
