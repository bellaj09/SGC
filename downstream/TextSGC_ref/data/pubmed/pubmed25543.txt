This paper demonstrates a synergy-based brain-machine interface that uses low-dimensional command signals to control a high dimensional virtual hand. First temporal postural synergies were extracted from the angular velocities of finger joints of five healthy subjects when they performed hand movements that were similar to activities of daily living. Two synergies inspired from the extracted synergies namely two-finger pinch and whole-hand grasp were used in real-time brain control where a virtual hand with 10 degrees of freedom was controlled to grasp or pinch virtual objects. These two synergies were controlled by electrocorticographic ECoG signals recorded from two electrodes of an electrode array that spanned motor and speech areas of an individual with intractable epilepsy thus demonstrating closed loop control of a synergy-based brain-machine interface.
