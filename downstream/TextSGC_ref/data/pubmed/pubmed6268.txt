Infantile nystagmus syndrome INS is one of the leading causes of significant vision loss in children and affects about 1 in 1000 to 6000 births. In the present study we are the first to investigate the structural pathways of patients and controls using diffusion tensor imaging DTI. Specifically three female INS patients from the same family were scanned two sisters and a mother. Six regions of interest ROIs were created manually to analyze the number of tracks. Additionally three ROI masks were analyzed using TBSS Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. The number of fiber tracks was reduced in INS subjects compared to normal subjects by 15.9% 13.9% 9.2% 18.6% 5.3% and 2.5% for the pons cerebellum right and left brainstem cerebrum and thalamus. Furthermore TBSS results indicated that the fractional anisotropy FA values for the patients were lower in the superior ventral aspects of the pons of the brainstem than in those of the controls. We have identified some brain regions that may be actively involved in INS. These novel findings would be beneficial to the neuroimaging clinical and research community as they will give them new direction in further pursuing neurological studies related to oculomotor function and provide a rational approach to studying INS.
