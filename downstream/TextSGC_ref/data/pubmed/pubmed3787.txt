"The cerebral cortex is well known to display a large variation in excitatory and inhibitory chemoarchitecture but the effect of this variation on global scale functional neural communication and synchronization patterns remains less well understood. Here we provide evidence of the chemoarchitecture of cortical regions to be associated with large-scale region-to-region resting-state functional connectivity. We assessed the excitatory versus inhibitory chemoarchitecture of cortical areas as an ExIn ratio between receptor density mappings of excitatory AMPA M1  and inhibitory GABAA  M2  receptors computed on the basis of data collated from pioneering studies of autoradiography mappings as present in literature of the human 2 datasets and macaque 1 dataset cortex. Cortical variation in ExIn ratio significantly correlated with total level of functional connectivity as derived from resting-state functional connectivity recordings of cortical areas across all three datasets human I: P\u2009=\u20090.0004; human II: P\u2009=\u20090.0008; macaque: P\u2009=\u20090.0007 suggesting cortical areas with an overall more excitatory character to show higher levels of intrinsic functional connectivity during resting-state. Our findings are indicative of the microscale chemoarchitecture of cortical regions to be related to resting-state fMRI connectivity patterns at the global systems level of connectome organization.
