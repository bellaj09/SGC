Surgical proficiency is highly dependent on continuous and efficient training. However efficacy of training hinges on questions such as accessibility and how intuitively the training can be translated into reality. Minimally invasive surgery MIS in particular relies on adequate training modalities in order to compensate for its additional psychomotor and visuospatial challenges. The increasing demand for MIS procedures longs for further enhancement of training and steep learning curves. We are investigating a nouveau training concept that continuously utilizes the first person view as addendum to laparoscopic view. We hypothesize this approach to be more intuitive thus faster and more naturally to apprehend than a laparoscopic view only and aim to establish a new standard to implement into training curricula.
