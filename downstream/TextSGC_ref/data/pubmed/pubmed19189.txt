Deterioration of physical and psychological health is an important issue in older adults aged 65 years or more. This study aimed to determine whether a virtual kayak paddling VKP exercise could improve postural balance muscle performance and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to the VKP n = 30 or control group n = 30. Participants in the VKP group performed the paddling exercise in a virtual environment for 60 min twice a week for 6 weeks while those in the control group performed home exercises. Postural balance p < .05 muscle performance p < .05 and cognitive function p < .05 were significantly improved in the VKP group and were superior to those in the control group p < .05. Thus our findings indicate that VKP exercise improves postural balance muscle performance and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
