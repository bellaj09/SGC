Computerized Dynamic Posturography CDPwas developed by the American space program to assess imbalance in astronauts and eventually evolved into a clinical diagnostic tool. However it is not a specific measure of vestibular function. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential testing VEMPs is a new clinical tool which is sensitive and specific for measuring otolithic pathology especially in the atypical vestibular patient. Computerized Dynamic Posturography does not detect measured CVEMP and OVEMP abnormalities.
