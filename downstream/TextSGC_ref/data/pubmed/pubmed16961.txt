E-health is opening new prospects in the management of mental disorders. Virtual reality VR-based interventions which provide a safe nonjudging environment may improve symptoms awareness in patients with depressive disorders. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of a novel VR software the VRight in depressive patients. Adult outpatients with depressive disorders presenting to our mental health clinic during December 2018 were invited to participate in the study. Participants completed a satisfaction survey at the end of the session including questions about user-friendliness and about usefulness of the software. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9 was administered to participants before and after the VR-based intervention to assess depressive symptoms severity. We explored the correlation between the score difference and the variables: age gender and initial score. Twenty-eight patients 71.4 percent women mean age: 51.18\u2009\u200916.13 years were recruited. Thirteen subjects had major depressive disorder 46.4 percent. Most of the patients n\u2009=\u200926 were satisfied with the VR experience which they found to be helpful. PHQ-9 score difference and the initial score correlated positively at a significant level. There was no significant correlation between score difference and age or gender. VRight was well accepted among depressive patients showing high levels of satisfaction. The VRight could contribute to increase depressive symptoms awareness which is of clinical relevance given the association of greater insight with positive outcomes in depression. Further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of VRight as a psychoeducational tool in clinical practice.
