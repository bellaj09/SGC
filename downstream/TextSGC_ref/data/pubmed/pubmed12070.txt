"Artificial intelligence AI has been studied in ophthalmology since availability of digital information in ophthalmic care. The significant turning point was availability of commercial digital color fundus photography in the late 1990s which caused digital screening for diabetic retinopathy DR to take off. Automated Retinal Disease Assessment software was then developed using machine learning to detect abnormal lesions in fundus to screen DR. The use of this version of AI had not been generalized because the specificity at 45% was not high enough although the sensitivity reached 90%. The recent breakthrough in machine learning is the invent of deep learning which accelerates its performance to be on par with experts. The first 2 breakthrough studies on deep learning for screening DR were conducted in Asia. The first represented collaboration of datasets between Asia and the United States for algorithms development whereas the second represented algorithms developed in Asia but validated in different populations across the world. Both found accuracy for detecting referable DR of >95%. Diversity and variety are unique strengths of Asia for AI studies. There are many more studies of AI ongoing in Asia not only as prospective deployments in DR but in glaucoma age-related macular degeneration cataract and systemic disease such as Alzheimers disease. Some Asian countries have laid out plans for digital health care system using AI as one of the puzzle pieces for solving blindness. More studies on AI and digital health are expected to come from Asia in this new decade." Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology: Evolutions in Asia.
