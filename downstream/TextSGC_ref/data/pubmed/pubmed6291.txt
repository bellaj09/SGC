Early fMRI studies suggested that brain areas processing self-related and other-related information were highly overlapping. Hypothesising functional localisation of the cortex researchers have tried to locate "self-specific" and "other-specific" regions within these overlapping areas by subtracting suspected confounding signals in task-based fMRI experiments. Inspired by recent advances in whole-brain dynamic modelling we instead explored an alternative hypothesis that similar spatial activation patterns could be associated with different processing modes in the form of different synchronisation patterns. Combining an automated synthesis of fMRI data with a presumption-free diffusion spectrum image DSI fibre-tracking algorithm we isolated a network putatively composed of brain areas and white matter tracts involved in self-other processing. We sampled synchronisation patterns from the dynamical systems of this network using various combinations of physiological parameters. Our results showed that the self-other processing network with simulated gamma-band activity tended to stabilise at a number of distinct synchronisation patterns. This phenomenon termed "multistability" could serve as an alternative model in theorising the mechanism of processing self-other information.
