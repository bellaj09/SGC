At least 90% of individuals of limb amputees experience phantom limb pain PLP. Recent clinical research suggests that providing patients with the mirror image representation of the amputated limb may alleviate PLP. However mirror therapy cannot be used with bilateral amputees as visual feedback is dependent on the movement of the intact limb. To overcome this limitation we designed a novel myoelectric-controlled virtual reality VR system for the treatment of phantom limb pain in trans-radial upper extremity amputees. The proposed system allows the patient to directly control the virtual limb by recognizing stump muscle patterns recorded with EMG sensors. The hypothesis behind this strategy is that the VR image of the amputated limb induces better limb imagery than the reflected image of their intact limb and therefore is more effective in reducing PLP. A research protocol to test this hypothesis is described.
