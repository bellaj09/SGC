Virtual reality VR-based therapy for motor rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy CP is growing in prevalence. Although mainstream active videogames typically offer children an appealing user experience they are not designed for therapeutic relevance. Conversely rehabilitation-specific games often struggle to provide an immersive experience that sustains interest. This study aims to design and evaluate two VR-based therapy games for upper and lower limb rehabilitation and to evaluate their efficacy with dual focus on therapeutic relevance and user experience. Design and Evaluation of Virtual Reality-Based Therapy Games with Dual Focus on Therapeutic Relevance and User Experience for Children with Cerebral Palsy.
