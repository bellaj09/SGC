Individuals who suffer from anxiety and/or depression face difficulty in adaptively managing emotional responses while accumulating evidence suggests impaired emotion regulation is a transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology. Effectual regulation in the context of negative stimuli is characterized by engagement of the prefrontal cortex PFC coupled with reduced amygdala reactivity. In anxiety disorders and major depression PFC underengagement and atypical PFC-amygdala connectivity has been observed although patient findings based on case-control studies have been mixed with regard to magnitude locality and extent of dysfunction. As anxiety disorders and major depression are heterogeneous disorders and frequently comorbid with one another delineating relationships between reappraise-related substrates and symptoms may advance our understanding of emotion dysregulation in these populations. Transdiagnostic neural correlates of volitional emotion regulation in anxiety and depression.
