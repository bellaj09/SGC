Accurate identification of compound-protein interactions CPIs in silico may deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug action and thus remarkably facilitate drug discovery and development. Conventional similarity- or docking-based computational methods for predicting CPIs rarely exploit latent features from currently available large-scale unlabeled compound and protein data and often limit their usage to relatively small-scale datasets. In the present study we propose DeepCPI a novel general and scalable computational framework that combines effective feature embedding a technique of representation learning with powerful deep learning methods to accurately predict CPIs at a large scale. DeepCPI automatically learns the implicit yet expressive low-dimensional features of compounds and proteins from a massive amount of unlabeled data. Evaluations of the measured CPIs in large-scale databases such as ChEMBL and BindingDB as well as of the known drug-target interactions from DrugBank demonstrated the superior predictive performance of DeepCPI. Furthermore several interactions among small-molecule compounds and three G protein-coupled receptor targets glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor glucagon receptor and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor predicted using DeepCPI were experimentally validated. The present study suggests that DeepCPI is a useful and powerful tool for drug discovery and repositioning. The source code of DeepCPI can be downloaded from https://github.com/FangpingWan/DeepCPI.
