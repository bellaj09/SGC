Marketing scholars and practitioners are showing increasing interest in Extended Reality XR technologies XRs such as virtual reality VR augmented reality AR and mixed reality MR as very promising technological tools for producing satisfactory consumer experiences that mirror those experienced in physical stores. However most of the studies published to date lack a certain measure of methodological rigor in their characterization of XR technologies and in the assessment techniques used to characterize the consumer experience which limits the generalization of the results. We argue that it is necessary to define a rigorous methodological framework for the use of XRs in marketing. This article reviews the literature on XRs in marketing and provides a conceptual framework to organize this disparate body of work. Virtual Reality in Marketing: A Framework Review and Research Agenda.
