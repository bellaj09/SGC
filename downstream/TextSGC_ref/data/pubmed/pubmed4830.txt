Anosognosia for hemiplegia AHP is known to be associated with lesions to the motor system combined with varying lesions to the right insula premotor cortex parietal lobe or hippocampus. Due to this widespread cortical lesion distribution AHP can be understood best as a network disorder. We used lesion maps and behavioral data n\xa0\u200b=\xa0\u200b49 from two previous studies on AHP and performed a lesion network-symptom-mapping LNSM analysis. This new approach permits the identification of relationships between behavior and regions connected to the lesion site based on normative functional connectome data. In a first step using ordinary voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping we found an association of AHP with lesions in the right posterior insula. This is in accordance with previous studies. Applying LNSM we were able to additionally identify a region in the right posterior hippocampus where AHP was associated with significantly higher normative lesion connectivity. Notably this region was spared by infarction in all patients. We therefore argue that remote neuronal dysfunction caused by disrupted functional connections between the lesion site and the hippocampus i.e. diaschisis contributed to the phenotype of AHP. An indirect affection of the hippocampus may lead to memory deficits which in turn impair the stable encoding of updated beliefs on the bodily state thus contributing to the multifactorial phenomenon of AHP. Hippocampal diaschisis contributes to anosognosia for hemiplegia: Evidence from lesion network-symptom-mapping.
