Electroanalytical techniques are useful for detection and identification because the instrumentation is simple and can support a wide variety of assays. One example is cyclic square wave voltammetry CSWV a practical detection technique for different classes of compounds including explosives herbicides/pesticides industrial compounds and heavy metals. A key barrier to the widespread application of CSWV for chemical identification is the necessity of a high performance generalizable classification algorithm. Here machine and deep learning models were developed for classifying samples based on voltammograms alone. The highest performing models were Long Short-Term Memory LSTM and Fully Convolutional Networks FCNs depending on the dataset against which performance was assessed. When compared to other algorithms previously used for classification of CSWV and other similar data our LSTM and FCN-based neural networks achieve higher sensitivity and specificity with the area under the curve values from receiver operating characteristic ROC analyses greater than 0.99 for several datasets. Class activation maps were paired with CSWV scans to assist in understanding the decision-making process of the networks and their ability to utilize this information was examined. The best-performing models were then successfully applied to new or holdout experimental data. An automated method for processing CSWV data training machine learning models and evaluating their prediction performance is described and the tools generated provide support for the identification of compounds using CSWV from samples in the field.
