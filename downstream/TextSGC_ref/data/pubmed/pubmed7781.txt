Machine learning classifiers are shown to outperform conventional matched field processing for a deep water 600\u2009m depth ocean acoustic-based ship range estimation problem in the Santa Barbara Channel Experiment when limited environmental information is known. Recordings of three different ships of opportunity on a vertical array were used as training and test data for the feed-forward neural network and support vector machine classifiers demonstrating the feasibility of machine learning methods to locate unseen sources. The classifiers perform well up to 10\u2009km range whereas the conventional matched field processing fails at about 4\u2009km range without accurate environmental information.
