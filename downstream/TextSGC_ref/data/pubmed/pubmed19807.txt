"With the advent of an aging society stroke makes a heavy burden for our society. Stroke can damage the motor and sensory neural system and block the closed loop between the brain and the body. Due to the neural plasticity this closed loop can be rebuilt through training. Users actively engagement can help expedite functional recovery. Therefore we propose an EEG-driven Lower Limb Rehabilitation Training System LLRTS that can achieve Active and Passive Co-stimulation APC. Virtual Reality VR BCI and robot are introduced into the system. When users have motor intentions this system could automatically support corresponding visual and somatic sensory feedback. That is to say active and passive stimulations are controlled by users mind. This paper reports the idea and construction of this rehabilitation system. Preliminary experimental results support the concept." An EEG-driven Lower Limb Rehabilitation Training System for Active and Passive Co-stimulation.
