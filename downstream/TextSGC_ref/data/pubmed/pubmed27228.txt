Epidural electrocorticography ECoG activity may be more reliable and stable than single-unit-activity or local field potential. Invasive brain computer interface BCI devices are limited by mechanical mismatching and cellular reactive responses due to differences in the elastic modulus and the motion of stiff electrodes. We propose a mesh-shaped electrode to enhance the contactability between surface of dura and electrode. A thin film polyimide mesh microelectrode for chronic epidural electrocorticography recording with enhanced contactability.
