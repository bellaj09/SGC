"Deep classical graph-theoretical parameters like the size of the minimum vertex cover the chromatic number or the eigengap of the adjacency matrix of the graph were studied widely by mathematicians in the last century. Most researchers today study much simpler parameters of braingraphs or connectomes which were defined in the last twenty years for enormous networks-like the graph of the World Wide Web-with hundreds of millions of nodes. Since the connectomes describing the connections of the human brain typically contain several hundred vertices today one can compute and analyze the much deeper harder-to-compute classical graph parameters for these relatively small graphs of the brain. This deeper approach has proven to be very successful in the comparison of the connectomes of the sexes in our earlier works: we have shown that graph parameters deeply characterizing the graph connectivity are significantly better in womens connectomes than in mens. In the present contribution we compare numerous graph parameters in the three largest lobes-frontal parietal temporal-and in both hemispheres of the human brain. We apply the diffusion weighted imaging data of 423 subjects of the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project and present some findings never described before including that the right parietal lobe contains significantly more edges has higher average degree density larger minimum vertex cover and Hoffman bound than the left parietal lobe. Similar advantages in the deep graph connectivity properties are held for the left frontal versus the right frontal and the right temporal versus the left temporal lobes."
