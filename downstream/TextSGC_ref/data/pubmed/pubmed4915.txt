Brain imaging plays an important role in the study of Alzheimer\s disease AD where atrophy has been found to occur in the hippocampal formation during the very early disease stages and to progress in parallel with the disease\s evolution. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible correlation between "Small World" characteristics of the brain connectivity architecture-as extracted from EEG recordings-and hippocampal volume in AD patients. A dataset of 144 subjects including 110\xa0AD MMSE 21.3 and 34 healthy Nold MMSE 29.8 individuals was evaluated. Weighted and undirected networks were built by the eLORETA solutions of the cortical sources\ activities moving from EEG recordings. The evaluation of the hippocampal volume was carried out on a subgroup of 60\xa0AD patients who received a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence and underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software. Results showed that quantitatively more correlation was observed in the right hemisphere but the same trend was seen in both hemispheres. Alpha band connectivity was negatively correlated while slow delta and fast-frequency beta gamma bands positively correlated with hippocampal volume. Namely the larger the hippocampal volume the lower the alpha and the higher the delta beta and gamma Small World characteristics of connectivity. Accordingly the Small World connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection.
