Accurate motion capture plays an important role in sports analysis the medical field and virtual reality. Current methods for motion capture often suffer from occlusions which limits the accuracy of their pose estimation. In this paper we propose a complete system to measure the pose parameters of the human body accurately. Different from previous monocular depth camera systems we leverage two Kinect sensors to acquire more information about human movements which ensures that we can still get an accurate estimation even when significant occlusion occurs. Because human motion is temporally constant we adopt a learning analysis to mine the temporal information across the posture variations. Using this information we estimate human pose parameters accurately regardless of rapid movement. Our experimental results show that our system can perform an accurate pose estimation of the human body with the constraint of information from the temporal domain.
