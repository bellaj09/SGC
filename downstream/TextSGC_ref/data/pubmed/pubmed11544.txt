The quality of input data in deep learning is tightly associated with the ultimate performance of the machine learner. Taking advantage of the unique merits of surface-enhanced Raman scattering SERS methodology in the collection and construction of a database e.g. abundant intrinsic fingerprint information noninvasive data acquisition process strong anti-interfering ability etc. herein we set up a SERS-based database of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA suitable for artificial intelligence AI-based sensing applications. The database is collected and analyzed by silver nanoparticles Ag NPs-decorated silicon wafer Ag NPs@Si SERS chip followed by training with a deep neural network DNN. As proof-of-concept applications three kinds of representative tumor suppressor genes i.e. p16 p21 and p53 fragments are readily discriminated in a label-free manner. Prominent and reproducible SERS spectra of these DNA molecules are collected and employed as input data for DNN learning and training which enables selective discrimination of DNA targets. The accuracy rate for the recognition of specific DNA target reached 90.28%.
