Cardiovascular resonance CMR imaging is a standard imaging modality for assessing cardiovascular diseases CVDs the leading cause of death globally. CMR enables accurate quantification of the cardiac chamber volume ejection fraction and myocardial mass providing information for diagnosis and monitoring of CVDs. However for years clinicians have been relying on manual approaches for CMR image analysis which is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. It is a major clinical challenge to automatically derive quantitative and clinically relevant information from CMR images.
