In this study we aimed to understand how whole-brain neural networks compute sensory information integration based on the olfactory and visual system. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data was obtained during unimodal and bimodal sensory stimulation. Based on the identification of multisensory integration processing MIP specific hub-like network nodes analyzed with network-based statistics using region-of-interest based connectivity matrices we conclude the following brain areas to be important for processing the presented bimodal sensory information: right precuneus connected contralaterally to the supramarginal gyrus for memory-related imagery and phonology retrieval and the left middle occipital gyrus connected ipsilaterally to the inferior frontal gyrus via the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus including functional aspects of working memory. Applied graph theory for quantification of the resulting complex network topologies indicates a significantly increased global efficiency and clustering coefficient in networks including aspects of MIP reflecting a simultaneous better integration and segregation. Graph theoretical analysis of positive and negative network correlations allowing for inferences about excitatory and inhibitory network architectures revealed-not significant but very consistent-that MIP-specific neural networks are dominated by inhibitory relationships between brain regions involved in stimulus processing.
