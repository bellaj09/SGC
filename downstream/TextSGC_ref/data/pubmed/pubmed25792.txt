This paper describes a method for the acquisition and integrative processing of laparoscopic and endoluminal ultrasound images. We used a stepping motor attached to a stabilizing rig interfaced to the laparoscope or the ultrasound probe. 360 degrees laparoscopic scenes were constructed during minimally invasive surgery and three-dimensional reconstructions were made of related ultrasound data. Integration of 360 degrees panoramas with geometric ultrasound models could be displayed as interactive scenes. This resulted in a better demonstration of the surgical field and topographic anatomy. In conclusion this type of visualizations may be used in virtual reality simulations for documentation education and in operative planning. Virtual reality in surgical practice in vitro and in vivo evaluations.
