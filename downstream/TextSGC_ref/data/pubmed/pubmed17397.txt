Hand rehabilitation is fundamental after stroke or surgery. Traditional rehabilitation requires a therapist and implies high costs stress for the patient and subjective evaluation of the therapy effectiveness. Alternative approaches based on mechanical and tracking-based gloves can be really effective when used in virtual reality VR environments. Mechanical devices are often expensive cumbersome patient specific and hand specific while tracking-based devices are not affected by these limitations but especially if based on a single tracking sensor could suffer from occlusions. In this paper the implementation of a multi-sensors approach the Virtual Glove VG based on the simultaneous use of two orthogonal LEAP motion controllers is described. The VG is calibrated and static positioning measurements are compared with those collected with an accurate spatial positioning system. The positioning error is lower than 6 mm in a cylindrical region of interest of radius 10 cm and height 21 cm. Real-time hand tracking measurements are also performed analysed and reported. Hand tracking measurements show that VG operated in real-time 60 fps reduced occlusions and managed two LEAP sensors correctly without any temporal and spatial discontinuity when skipping from one sensor to the other. A video demonstrating the good performance of VG is also collected and presented in the Supplementary Materials. Results are promising but further work must be done to allow the calculation of the forces exerted by each finger when constrained by mechanical tools e.g. peg-boards and for reducing occlusions when grasping these tools. Although the VG is proposed for rehabilitation purposes it could also be used for tele-operation of tools and robots and for other VR applications.
