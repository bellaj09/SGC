Virtual reality 3 dimensional modelling of the human body has developed as a convergence of advancing digital imaging modalities and computer graphics technologies. With this method endoscopic simulations of cavitary organs are feasible. Virtual bronchoscopy was initially described in 1993. The authors selected patient with previously detected stenosis of the trachea or the main bronchi with bronchofiberscope. They performed targeted thin-slice helical computer tomography of the lesions. These data were transferred to a workstation and the virtual endoscopic models of the airways were generated using dedicated software. Based on cases the authors describe their preliminary experience with the method. The findings were compared with those of bronchofiberscopy. Analyzing these results and the literature the potential clinical applications of virtual bronchoscopy are discussed. Virtual bronchoscopy: a new non-invasive diagnostic method in pulmonology.
