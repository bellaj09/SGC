The demand for mobile data communication has been increasing owing to the diversification of its purposes and the increase in the number of mobile devices accessing mobile networks. Users are experiencing a degradation in communication quality due to mobile network congestion. Therefore improving the bandwidth utilization efficiency of cellular infrastructure is crucial. We previously proposed a mobile data offloading protocol MDOP for improving the bandwidth utilization efficiency. Although this method balances a load of evolved node B by taking into consideration the content delay tolerance accurately balancing the load is challenging. In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to MDOP to solve the temporal locality of a traffic. Moreover we examine and evaluate the concrete processing while considering a delay tolerance. A comparison of the proposed method and bandwidth utilization efficiency of MDOP showed that the proposed method reduced the network traffic in excess of the control target value by 35% as compared with the MDOP. Furthermore the proposed method improved the data transmission ratio by the delay tolerance range. Consequently the proposed method improved the bandwidth utilization efficiency by learning how to provide the bandwidth to the user equipment when MDOP cannot be used to appropriately balance a load.
