The Deep Convolutional Neural Network DCNN is one of the most powerful and successful deep learning approaches. DCNNs have already provided superior performance in different modalities of medical imaging including breast cancer classification segmentation and detection. Breast cancer is one of the most common and dangerous cancers impacting women worldwide. In this paper we have proposed a method for breast cancer classification with the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network IRRCNN model. The IRRCNN is a powerful DCNN model that combines the strength of the Inception Network Inception-v4 the Residual Network ResNet and the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network RCNN. The IRRCNN shows superior performance against equivalent Inception Networks Residual Networks and RCNNs for object recognition tasks. In this paper the IRRCNN approach is applied for breast cancer classification on two publicly available datasets including BreakHis and Breast Cancer BC classification challenge 2015. The experimental results are compared against the existing machine learning and deep learning-based approaches with respect to image-based patch-based image-level and patient-level classification. The IRRCNN model provides superior classification performance in terms of sensitivity area under the curve AUC the ROC curve and global accuracy compared to existing approaches for both datasets.
