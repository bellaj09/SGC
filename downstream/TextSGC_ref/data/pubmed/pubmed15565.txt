Automatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing NLP technology that unlocks information embedded in clinical narratives. Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these\xa0human efforts.
