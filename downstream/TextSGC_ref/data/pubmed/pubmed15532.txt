Some evidence suggests that experiencing a given scenario using virtual reality VR may engage greater attentional resources than experiencing the same scenario on a 2D computer monitor. However the underlying neural processes associated with these VR-related effects especially those pertaining to current consumer-friendly head-mounted displays of virtual reality HMD-VR remain unclear. Here two experiments were conducted to compare task performance and EEG-based neural metrics captured during a perceptual discrimination task presented on two different viewing platforms. Forty participants 20-25 years old completed this task using both an HMD-VR and traditional computer monitor in a within-group randomized design. Although Experiment I n = 20 was solely behavioral in design Experiment II n = 20 utilized combined EEG recordings to interrogate the neural correlates underlying potential performance differences across platforms. These experiments revealed that 1 there was no significant difference in the amount of arousal measured between platforms and 2 selective attention abilities in HMD-VR environment were enhanced from both a behavioral and neural perspective. These findings suggest that the allocation of attentional resources in HMD-VR may be superior to approaches more typically used to assess these abilities e.g. desktop/laptop/tablet computers with 2D screens.
