Machine learning ML involves algorithms learning patterns in large complex datasets to predict and classify. Algorithms include neural networks NN logistic regression LR and support vector machines SVM. ML may generate substantial improvements in neurosurgery. This systematic review assessed the current state of neurosurgical ML applications and the performance of algorithms applied. Our systematic search strategy yielded 6866 results 70 of which met inclusion criteria. Performance statistics analyzed included area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUC accuracy sensitivity and specificity. Natural language processing NLP was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation planning and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN LR and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy F219\u2009=\u20096.56 p\u2009<\u20090.01 and specificity F216\u2009=\u20095.57 p\u2009<\u20090.01 of NN LR and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN LR and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics which were defined by modeling approach surgery type and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future neurosurgical ML research.
