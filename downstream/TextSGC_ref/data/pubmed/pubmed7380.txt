Photoreceptor ellipsoid zone EZ defects visible on optical coherence tomography OCT are important imaging biomarkers for the onset and progression of macular diseases. As such accurate quantification of EZ defects is paramount to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy over time. We developed and trained a novel deep learning-based method called Deep OCT Atrophy Detection DOCTAD to automatically segment EZ defect areas by classifying 3-dimensional A-scan clusters as normal or defective. Furthermore we introduce a longitudinal transfer learning paradigm in which the algorithm learns from segmentation errors on images obtained at one time point to segment subsequent images with higher accuracy. We evaluated the performance of this method on 134 eyes of 67 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial of a novel macular telangiectasia type 2 MacTel2 therapeutic agent. Our method compared favorably to other deep learning-based and non-deep learning-based methods in matching expert manual segmentations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first automatic segmentation method developed for EZ defects on OCT images of MacTel2. Deep longitudinal transfer learning-based automatic segmentation of photoreceptor ellipsoid zone defects on optical coherence tomography images of macular telangiectasia type 2.
