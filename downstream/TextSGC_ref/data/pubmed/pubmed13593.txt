This paper proposes a novel continuous sparse autoencoder CSAE which can be used in unsupervised feature learning. The CSAE adds Gaussian stochastic unit into activation function to extract features of nonlinear data. In this paper CSAE is applied to solve the problem of transformer fault recognition. Firstly based on dissolved gas analysis method IEC three ratios are calculated by the concentrations of dissolved gases. Then IEC three ratios data is normalized to reduce data singularity and improve training speed. Secondly deep belief network is established by two layers of CSAE and one layer of back propagation BP\xa0network. Thirdly CSAE is adopted to unsupervised training and getting features. Then BP network is used for supervised training and getting transformer fault. Finally the experimental data from IEC TC 10 dataset aims to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. Comparative experiments clearly show that CSAE can extract features from the original data and achieve a superior correct differentiation rate on transformer fault diagnosis.
