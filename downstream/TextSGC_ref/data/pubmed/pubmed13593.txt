This paper aims to present an improved bicoherence spectrum IBS combined with cyclic modulation spectrum CMS and cross-correlation that is suitable for classification of hydrophone signals involving deep learning DL. First the proposed feature utilizes the all-phase fast Fourier transform to modify the spectrum leakage caused by CMS; this can be used to detect line spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios SNRs. Second the cross-correlation and bispectrum are both exploited to suppress non-periodic line spectra interference from CMS. Based on numerous numerical simulations and experimental verification compared with CMS and conventional bispectrum the prominent characteristics of IBS include: detecting higher-precision periodic harmonics without single-line interference superior robustness under low SNR and greatly reducing the data redundancy. In addition to test the performance of IBS for DL application three deep belief network DBN-based classifiers-DBN-softmax DBN-support vector machine and DBN-random forest-are introduced and employed for five experimental scenarios including ships and underwater source. The results indicate that benefiting from DBN pre-training the IBS classification accuracy of DBN-based models is generally higher than 80%. Deep learning classification for improved bicoherence feature based on cyclic modulation and cross-correlation.
