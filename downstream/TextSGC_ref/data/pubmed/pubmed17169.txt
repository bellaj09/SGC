In the domain of self-recognition voice is a critical feature for self/other distinction. The aim of this study was to explore if people have an implicit and/or explicit knowledge of their voice. A group of healthy participants were submitted to an implicit and an explicit self-voice recognition task. They listened to pairs of pre-recorded auditory stimuli words or pseudowords pronounced by themselves by a familiar or an unfamiliar person. Afterwards in the "Implicit task" participants had to judge whether the pair of stimuli were pronounced by same or different speakers; in the "Explicit task" they had to identify if one of the stimuli was or not their own voice. Results showed a difference between Implicit and Explicit tasks since participants were more accurate in implicit than explicit self voice-recognition. Moreover in the Implicit task participants had the same level of accuracy when they had to judge stimuli pronounced with self or others\ voice whereas when an explicit voice-recognition was required they were less accurate with self than with others\ voice. Who is speaking? Implicit and explicit self and other voice recognition.
