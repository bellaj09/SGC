"Auditory verbal hallucinations are hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia and are amongst the most disturbing symptoms of the disorder. Although not entirely understood the relationship between the voice hearer and their voices has been shown to be an important treatment target. Understanding voice hearers standpoints through qualitative analysis is central to apprehend a deeper comprehension of their experience and further explore the relevance of interpersonal interventions. Compared with other dialogical intervention virtual reality-assisted therapy Avatar Therapy enables patients to be in a tangible relation with a representation of their persecutory voice. This novel therapy has shown favourable results though the therapeutic processes remain equivocal. We consequently sought to begin by characterizing the main themes emerging during the therapy by exploring the hearers discussion with their avatar. The therapy sessions of 12 of our referrals were transcribed and the patients responses were analysed using content analysis methods. Five themes emerged from data saturation: emotional responses to the voices beliefs about voices and schizophrenia self-perceptions coping mechanisms and aspirations. All patients had at least one element within each of these themes. Our analyses also enabled us to identify changes that were either verbalized by the patients or noted by the raters throughout therapy sessions. These findings are relevant as they allowed to identify key themes that are hypothesized to be related to therapeutic targets in a novel relational therapy using virtual reality. Future studies to further explore the processes implicated within Avatar Therapy are necessary."
