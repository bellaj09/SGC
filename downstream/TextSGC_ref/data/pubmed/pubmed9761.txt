"The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility of using deep learning such as artificial intelligence AI to classify cervical squamous epithelial lesions SILs from colposcopy images combined with human papilloma virus HPV types. Among 330 patients who underwent colposcopy and biopsy performed by gynecological oncologists a total of 253 patients with confirmed HPV typing tests were enrolled in the present study. Of these patients 210 were diagnosed with high-grade SIL HSIL and 43 were diagnosed with low-grade SIL LSIL. An original AI classifier with a convolutional neural network catenating with an HPV tensor was developed and trained. The accuracy of the AI classifier and gynecological oncologists was 0.941 and 0.843 respectively. The AI classifier performed better compared with the oncologists although not significantly. The sensitivity specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value Youdens J index and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve  standard error for AI colposcopy combined with HPV types and pathological results were 0.956 43/45 0.833 5/6 0.977 43/44 0.714 5/7 0.789 and 0.9630.026 respectively. Although further study is required the clinical use of AI for the classification of HSIL/LSIL by both colposcopy and HPV type may be feasible."
