A high efficient time-shift correlation algorithm was proposed to deal with the peak time uncertainty of P300 evoked potential for a P300-based brain-computer interface BCI. The time-shift correlation series data were collected as the input nodes of an artificial neural network ANN and the classification of four LED visual stimuli was selected as the output node. Two operating modes including fast-recognition mode FM and accuracy-recognition mode AM were realized. The proposed BCI system was implemented on an embedded system for commanding an adult-size humanoid robot to evaluate the performance from investigating the ground truth trajectories of the humanoid robot. When the humanoid robot walked in a spacious area the FM was used to control the robot with a higher information transfer rate ITR. When the robot walked in a crowded area the AM was used for high accuracy of recognition to reduce the risk of collision. The experimental results showed that in 100 trials the accuracy rate of FM was 87.8% and the average ITR was 52.73 bits/min. In addition the accuracy rate was improved to 92% for the AM and the average ITR decreased to 31.27 bits/min. due to strict recognition constraints.
