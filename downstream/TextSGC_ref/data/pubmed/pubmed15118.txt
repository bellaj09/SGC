Recent progress in cardiac catheterization and devices has allowed the development of new therapies for severe cardiac diseases like arrhythmias and heart failure. The skills required for such interventions are very challenging to learn and are typically acquired over several years. Virtual reality simulators may reduce this burden by allowing trainees to practice such procedures without risk to patients. In this paper we propose the first training system dedicated to cardiac electrophysiology including pacing and ablation procedures. Our framework involves the simulation of a catheter navigation that reproduces issues intrinsic to intra-cardiac catheterization and a graphics processing unit GPU-based electrophysiological model. A multithreading approach is proposed to compute both physical simulations navigation and electrophysiology asynchronously. With this method we reach computational performances that account for user interactions in real-time. Based on a scenario of cardiac arrhythmia we demonstrate the ability of the user-guided simulator to navigate inside vessels and cardiac cavities with a catheter and to reproduce an ablation procedure involving: extra-cellular potential measurements endocardial surface reconstruction electrophysiology mapping radio-frequency RF ablation as well as electrical stimulation. A clinical evaluation assessing the different aspects of the simulation is presented. This works is a step towards computerized medical learning curriculum.
