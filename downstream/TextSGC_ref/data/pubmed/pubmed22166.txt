Phantom limb pain is a debilitating condition for which no effective treatment has been found. We hypothesised that re-engagement of central and peripheral circuitry involved in motor execution could reduce phantom limb pain via competitive plasticity and reversal of cortical reorganisation. Phantom motor execution facilitated by machine learning and augmented reality as treatment for phantom limb pain: a single group clinical trial in patients with chronic intractable phantom limb pain.
