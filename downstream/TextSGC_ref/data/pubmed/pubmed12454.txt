Protein glycosylation is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications that plays an important role in immune responses intercellular signaling inflammation and host-pathogen interactions. However due to the poor ionization efficiency and microheterogeneity of glycopeptides identifying glycosylation sites is a challenging task and there is a demand for computational methods. Here we constructed the largest dataset of human and mouse glycosylation sites to train deep learning neural networks and support vector machine classifiers to predict N-/O-linked glycosylation sites respectively.
