Can we train the computer to beat experienced traders for financial assert trading? In this paper we try to address this challenge by introducing a recurrent deep neural network NN for real-time financial signal representation and trading. Our model is inspired by two biological-related learning concepts of deep learning DL and reinforcement learning RL. In the framework the DL part automatically senses the dynamic market condition for informative feature learning. Then the RL module interacts with deep representations and makes trading decisions to accumulate the ultimate rewards in an unknown environment. The learning system is implemented in a complex NN that exhibits both the deep and recurrent structures. Hence we propose a task-aware backpropagation through time method to cope with the gradient vanishing issue in deep training. The robustness of the neural system is verified on both the stock and the commodity future markets under broad testing conditions.
