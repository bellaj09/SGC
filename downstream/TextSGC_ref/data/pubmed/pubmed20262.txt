Impaired balance is disabling for children with cerebral palsy CPc especially for CPc who recently underwent lower limb surgery. Positive results of using virtual reality VR in balance rehabilitation have been published in several outpatient populations. We investigated the feasibility of applying additional VR training focused on sitting balance in CP inpatients of a rehabilitation center after lower limb surgery. Additionally we investigated the rate of enjoyment of VR training compared with conventional physiotherapy.
