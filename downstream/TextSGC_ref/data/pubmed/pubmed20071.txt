When we experience our environment we do so by combining sensory inputs with expectations derived from our prior knowledge which can lead to surprising perceptual effects such as small objects feeling heavier than equally weighted large objects the size-weight illusion SWI. Interestingly there is evidence that the way in which the volume of an object is experienced can affect the strength of the illusion with a SWI induced by exclusively haptic volume cues feeling stronger than a SWI induced with only visual volume cues. Furthermore visual cues appear to add nothing over and above haptic size cues in terms of the strength of the induced weight illusion-findings which are difficult to reconcile with work using cue-conflict paradigms where visual cues usually dominate haptic cues. Here virtual reality was used to place these senses in conflict with one another. Participants N\u2009=\u200922 judged the heaviness of identically weighted cylinders across three conditions: 1 objects appeared different sizes but were physically the same size 2 objects were physically different sizes but appeared to be the same size or 3 objects which looked and felt different sizes from one another. Consistent with prior work haptic size cues induced a larger SWI than that induced by visual size differences. In contrast to prior work however congruent vision and haptic size cues yielded a larger still SWI. These findings not only add to our understanding of how different modalities combine to influence our hedonic perception but also showcase how virtual reality can develop novel cue-conflict paradigms.
