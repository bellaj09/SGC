The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between two measures of multiple sclerosis severity the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and minor driving errors in a virtual reality driving simulator. The Relationship Between Multiple Sclerosis Symptom Severity Measures and Performance on Driving Variability Metrics in a Virtual Reality Simulator.
