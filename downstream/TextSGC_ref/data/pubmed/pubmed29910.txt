We consider the problem of multiclass adaptive classification for brain-computer interfaces and propose the use of multiclass pooled mean linear discriminant analysis MPMLDA a multiclass generalization of the adaptation rule introduced by Vidaurre Kawanabe von Bnau Blankertz and Mller 2010 for the binary class setting. Using publicly available EEG data sets and tangent space mapping Barachant Bonnet Congedo & Jutten 2012 as a feature extractor we demonstrate that MPMLDA can significantly outperform state-of-the-art multiclass static and adaptive methods. Furthermore efficient learning rates can be achieved using data from different subjects. Adaptive multiclass classification for brain computer interfaces.
