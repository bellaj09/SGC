"Cell membrane proteins play an essentially significant function in manipulating the behaviour of cells. Examination of amino acid sequences can put forward useful insights into the tertiary structures of proteins and their biological functions. One of the important problems in amino acid analysis is the uncertainty to establish a digital coding system to better reflect the properties of amino acids and their degeneracy. In order to overcome the demerits the proposed method is a novel representation of protein sequences that incorporates a new feature named 2-gram subgroup intra pattern. The functional types of membrane protein classification will be supportive to explain the biological functions of membrane proteins. For classification Stacked Auto Encoder Deep learning method is applied. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark data sets. The results were experimented using the Self-consistency test Accuracy Specificity Sensitivity Mathews correlation coefficient Jackknife test and Independent data set are the tests in which the proposed method outperformed other existing techniques generally used in literatures."
