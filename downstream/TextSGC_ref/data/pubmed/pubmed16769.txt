"Rehabilitation robots have become increasingly popular for stroke rehabilitation. However the high cost of robots hampers their implementation on a large scale. This paper implements the concept of a modular and reconfigurable robot reducing its cost and size by adopting different therapeutic end effectors for different training movements using a single robot. The challenge is to increase the robots portability and identify appropriate kinds of modular tools and configurations. Because literature on the effectiveness of this kind of rehabilitation robot is still scarce this paper presents the design of a portable and reconfigurable rehabilitation robot and describes its use with a group of post-stroke patients for wrist and forearm training. Seven stroke subjects received training using a reconfigurable robot for 30 sessions lasting 30 min per session. Post-training statistical analysis showed significant improvement of 3.29 points 16.20% p = 0.027 on the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale for forearm and wrist components. Significant improvement of active range of motion was detected in both pronation-supination 75.59% p = 0.018 and wrist flexion-extension 56.12% p = 0.018 after the training. These preliminary results demonstrate that the developed reconfigurable robot could improve subjects wrist and forearm movement."
