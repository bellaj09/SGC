Relatively long learning curves and therefore initially longer operating times compared to conventional procedures are still a matter of debate. Today there are numerous possibilities for learning laparoscopic techniques and establishing one\s own laparoscopic programs including various pelvitrainers and virtual reality computer programs. One useful and realistic way involves "wet lab" training programs for ablative and reconstructive procedures using the pig model. Today laparoscopic urological surgery includes procedures with low e.g. laparoscopy for undescended testicles intermediate laparoscopic pyeloplasty and high level laparoscopic/endoscopic prostatectomy complexity. Therefore laparoscopy should be an integral part of training in urology. A defined number of possibly multi-institutional training centers with well structured educational programs are needed. The main goal should be the standardization of surgical procedures as well as educational training programs in order to shorten individual learning curves and generate common quality standards.
