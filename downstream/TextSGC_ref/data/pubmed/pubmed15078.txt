This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of technology-assisted interventions for individuals with social anxiety disorder SAD. A systematic literature search in the databases Medline PsychInfo and Web of Science revealed 37 randomized controlled trials 2991 participants that were grouped into internet delivered cognitive behavior therapy ICBT; 21 trials virtual reality exposure therapy VRET; 3 trials and cognitive bias modification CBM; 13 trials. Patients undergoing ICBT and VRET showed significantly less SAD symptoms at postassessment than passive control conditions g=0.84 and 0.82 respectively. Compared to active control conditions ICBT had a small advantage g=0.38 and VRET showed comparable effects p>0.05. CBM was not more effective than passive control conditions except when delivered in the laboratory g=0.35. While the efficacy of CBM was limited substantial evidence for ICBT and preliminary evidence for VRET suggests that both can effectively reduce SAD symptoms indicating the potential of technology-assisted interventions for SAD.
