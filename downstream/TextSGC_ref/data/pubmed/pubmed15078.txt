Accurate and automatic segmentation of infant hippocampal subfields from magnetic resonance MR images is an important step for studying memory related infant neurological diseases. However existing hippocampal subfield segmentation methods were generally designed based on adult subjects and would compromise performance when applied to infant subjects due to insufficient tissue contrast and fast changing structural patterns of early hippocampal development. In this paper we propose a new fully convolutional network FCN for infant hippocampal subfield segmentation by embedding the dilated dense network in the U-net namely DUnet. The embedded dilated dense network can generate multi-scale features while keeping high spatial resolution which is useful in fusing the low-level features in the contracting path with the high-level features in the expanding path. To further improve the performance we group every pair of convolutional layers with one residual connection in the DUnet and obtain the Residual DUnet ResDUnet. Experimental results show that our proposed DUnet and ResDUnet improve the average Dice coefficient by 2.1 and 2.5% for infant hippocampal subfield segmentation respectively when compared with the classic 3D U-net. The results also demonstrate that our methods outperform other state-of-the-art methods. Dilated Dense U-Net for Infant Hippocampus Subfield Segmentation.
