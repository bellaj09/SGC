After stroke patients who suffer from hemiparesis tend to suppress the use of the affected extremity a condition called learned non-use. Consequently the lack of training may lead to the progressive deterioration of motor function. Although Constraint-Induced Movement Therapies CIMT have shown to be effective in treating this condition the method presents several limitations and the high intensity of its protocols severely compromises its adherence. We propose a novel rehabilitation approach called Reinforcement-Induced Movement Therapy RIMT which proposes to restore motor function through maximizing arm use. This is achieved by exposing the patient to amplified goal-oriented movements in VR that match the intended actions of the patient. We hypothesize that through this method we can increase the patients self-efficacy reverse learned non-use and induce long-term motor improvements. Counteracting learned non-use in chronic stroke patients with reinforcement-induced movement therapy.
