The aim of the study was to check the anatomical veracity of the model of wax no. 262 from the Delmas Orfila and Rouvire museums 45 rue des Saints Pres Paris 6th made by Tramond M.D. entitled "nerves of the face". We successively took several numerical photographs with several view angles; anatomically described the nerves of the face as they were represented on this model; correlated the anatomical veracity of this representation with the classical textbooks\ data; approached the technical bases of fabrication; and collected successive photographs of the model every 5 degrees  all along 180 degrees  thus allowing an animated rotation on computer using the QuickTime Virtual Reality program. The oversize of the model excluded a set on a real human skeleton. The building technique of the model was deduced from known data but could not be completely reported. The anatomical veracity of the sample was excellent. The difficulties of realization in wax of an oversized model of the nerves of the human face were solved in the late 19th century in Paris by Tramond\s factory. They remained unequalled.
