"The Epilepsy Connectome Project examines the differences in connectomes between temporal lobe epilepsy TLE patients and healthy controls. Using these data the effective connectivity of the default mode network DMN in patients with left TLE compared with healthy controls was investigated using spectral dynamic causal modeling spDCM of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Group comparisons were made using two parametric empirical Bayes PEB models. The first level of each PEB model consisted of each participants spDCM. Two different second-level models were constructed: the first comparing effective connectivity of the groups directly and the second using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test RAVLT delayed free recall index as a covariate at the second level to assess effective connectivity controlling for the poor memory performance of left TLE patients. After an automated search over the nested parameter space and thresholding parameters at 95% posterior probability both models revealed numerous connections in the DMN which lead to inhibition of the left hippocampal formation. Left hippocampal formation inhibition may be an inherent result of the left temporal epileptogenic focus as memory differences were controlled for in one model and the same connections remained. An excitatory connection from the posterior cingulate cortex to the medial prefrontal cortex was found to be concomitant with left hippocampal formation inhibition in TLE patients when including RAVLT delayed free recall at the second level."
