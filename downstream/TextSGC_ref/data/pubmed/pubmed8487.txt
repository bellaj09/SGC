Powdery mildew is a common disease in plants and it is also one of the main diseases in the middle and final stages of cucumber Cucumis sativus. Powdery mildew on plant leaves affects the photosynthesis which may reduce the plant yield. Therefore it is of great significance to automatically identify powdery mildew. Currently most image-based models commonly regard the powdery mildew identification problem as a dichotomy case yielding a true or false classification assertion. However quantitative assessment of disease resistance traits plays an important role in the screening of breeders for plant varieties. Therefore there is an urgent need to exploit the extent to which leaves are infected which can be obtained by the area of diseases regions. In order to tackle these challenges we propose a semantic segmentation model based on convolutional neural networks CNN to segment the powdery mildew on cucumber leaf images at pixel level achieving an average pixel accuracy of 96.08% intersection over union of 72.11% and Dice accuracy of 83.45% on twenty test samples. This outperforms the existing segmentation methods K-means Random forest and GBDT methods. In conclusion the proposed model is capable of segmenting the powdery mildew on cucumber leaves at pixel level which makes a valuable tool for cucumber breeders to assess the severity of powdery mildew.
