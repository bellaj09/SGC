"Knowledge of protein subcellular locations can help decipher a proteins biological function. This work proposes new features: sequence-based: Hybrid Amino Acid Pair HAAP and two structure-based: Secondary Structural Element Composition SSEC and solvent accessibility state frequency. A multi-class Support Vector Machine is developed to predict the locations. Testing on two established data sets yields better prediction accuracies than the best available systems. Comparisons with existing methods show comparable results to ESLPred2. When StruLocPred is applied to the entire Arabidopsis proteome over 77% of proteins with known locations match the prediction results. An implementation of this system is at http://wgzhou.ece. iastate.edu/StruLocPred/." StruLocPred: structure-based protein subcellular localisation prediction using multi-class support vector machine.
