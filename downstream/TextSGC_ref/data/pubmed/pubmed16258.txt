This article proposes an end-to-end framework for solving multiobjective optimization problems MOPs using deep reinforcement learning DRL that we call DRL-based multiobjective optimization algorithm DRL-MOA. The idea of decomposition is adopted to decompose the MOP into a set of scalar optimization subproblems. Then each subproblem is modeled as a neural network. Model parameters of all the subproblems are optimized collaboratively according to a neighborhood-based parameter-transfer strategy and the DRL training algorithm. Pareto-optimal solutions can be directly obtained through the trained neural-network models. Specifically the multiobjective traveling salesman problem MOTSP is solved in this article using the DRL-MOA method by modeling the subproblem as a Pointer Network. Extensive experiments have been conducted to study the DRL-MOA and various benchmark methods are compared with it. It is found that once the trained model is available it can scale to newly encountered problems with no need for retraining the model. The solutions can be directly obtained by a simple forward calculation of the neural network; thereby no iteration is required and the MOP can be always solved in a reasonable time. The proposed method provides a new way of solving the MOP by means of DRL. It has shown a set of new characteristics for example strong generalization ability and fast solving speed in comparison with the existing methods for multiobjective optimizations. The experimental results show the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method in terms of model performance and running time. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multiobjective Optimization.
