Flexible electronics that can form tight interfaces with neural tissues hold great promise for improving the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders and advancing brain/machine interfaces. Here the facile fabrication of a novel flexible micropillar electrode array PEA is described based on a biotemplate method. The flexible and compliant PEA can readily integrate with the soft surface of a rat cerebral cortex. Moreover the recording sites of the PEA consist of protruding micropillars with nanoscale surface roughness that ensure tight interfacing and efficient electrical coupling with the nervous system. As a result the flexible PEA allows for in vivo multichannel recordings of epileptiform activity with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 252  35. The ease of preparation high flexibility and biocompatibility make the PEA an attractive tool for in vivo spatiotemporal mapping of neural activity.
