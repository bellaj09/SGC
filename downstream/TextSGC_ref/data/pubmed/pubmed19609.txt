Developments over the past 2 years in virtual reality VR augmented sensorimotor rehabilitation of upper limb use and gait post-stroke were reviewed. Studies were included if they evaluated comparative efficacy between VR and standard of care and or differences in VR delivery methods; and were CEBM center for evidence based medicine level 2 or higher. Eight upper limb and two gait studies were included and described using the following categories hardware input and output software virtual task and feedback and presentation intervention progression and dose and outcomes. Trends in the field were commented on gaps in knowledge identified and areas of future research and translation of VR to practice were suggested. Virtual Reality for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Post-Stroke: The Promise and Current State of the Field.
