With rapid progress and significant successes in a wide spectrum of applications deep learning is being applied in many safety-critical environments. However deep neural networks DNNs have been recently found vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples. Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible to human but can easily fool DNNs in the testing/deploying stage. The vulnerability to adversarial examples becomes one of the major risks for applying DNNs in safety-critical environments. Therefore attacks and defenses on adversarial examples draw great attention. In this paper we review recent findings on adversarial examples for DNNs summarize the methods for generating adversarial examples and propose a taxonomy of these methods. Under the taxonomy applications for adversarial examples are investigated. We further elaborate on countermeasures for adversarial examples. In addition three major challenges in adversarial examples and the potential solutions are discussed. Adversarial Examples: Attacks and Defenses for Deep Learning.
