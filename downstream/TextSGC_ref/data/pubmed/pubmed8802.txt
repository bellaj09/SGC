Recently we have been concerned with locating and tracking vehicles in aerial videos. Vehicles in aerial videos usually have small sizes due to use of cameras from a remote distance. However most of the current methods use a fixed bounding box region as the input of tracking. For the purpose of target locating and tracking in our system detecting the contour of the target is utilized and can help with improving the accuracy of target tracking because a shape-adaptive template segmented by object contour contains the most useful information and the least background for object tracking. In this paper we propose a new start-up of tracking by clicking on the target and implement the whole tracking process by modifying and combining a contour detection network and a fully convolutional Siamese tracking network. The experimental results show that our algorithm has significantly improved tracking accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art regarding vehicle images in both OTB100 and DARPA datasets. We propose utilizing our method in real time tracking and guidance systems. Siamese Tracking from Single Point Initialization.
