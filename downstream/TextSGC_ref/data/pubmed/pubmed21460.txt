In this paper we propose a set of wavelet-based combined feature vectors and a Gaussian mixture model GMM-supervector to enhance training speed and classification accuracy in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces. The proposed method is configured as follows: first wavelet transforms are applied to extract the feature vectors for identification of motor imagery electroencephalography EEG and principal component analyses are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and linearly combine them. Subsequently the GMM universal background model is trained by the expectation-maximization EM algorithm to purify the training data and reduce its size. Finally a purified and reduced GMM-supervector is used to train the support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated for three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy kappa mutual information and computation time and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results from the study indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with a small amount of training data compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in motor imagery EEG classification.
