It is estimated that the demand for transvenous lead extraction TLE has reached an annual extraction rate of nearly 24000 patients worldwide. Despite technologic advances TLE still has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Complication rates with TLE directly parallel operator experience. However obtaining adequate training during and postfellowship can be difficult. Given the potential for catastrophic complications and the steep learning curve up to 300 cases associated with this procedure we sought to validate a virtual reality VR lead extraction simulator as an innovative training and evaluation tool for physicians new to TLE. Virtual reality lead extraction as a method for training new physicians: a pilot study.
