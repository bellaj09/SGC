Hysteroscopy is performed often and in many indications but is challenging to learn. Hands-on training in live patients faces ethical legal and economic obstacles. Virtual reality simulation may hold promise as a hysteroscopy training tool. No validated curriculum specific in hysteroscopy exists. The aim of this study was to develop a hysteroscopy curriculum using the Delphi method to identify skill requirements. Standardizing hysteroscopy teaching: development of a curriculum using the Delphi method.
