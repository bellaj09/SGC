Preoperative simulation of liver resection to visualize the intraoperative cutting process including liver deformation may help surgeons to more accurately implement hepatectomy. We developed a novel simulation software called Resection Process Map RPM. The present study was performed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of RPM as a tool for preoperative simulation and surgical education for liver surgery. A clinical pilot study of Resection Process Map: A novel virtual hepatectomy software to visualize the resection process case series.
