"Brain connectivity and structure-function relationships are analyzed from a physical perspective in place of common graph-theoretic and statistical approaches that overwhelmingly ignore the brains physical structure and geometry. Field theory is used to define connectivity tensors in terms of bare and dressed propagators and discretized representations are implemented that respect the physical nature and dimensionality of the quantities involved retain the correct continuum limit and enable diagrammatic analysis. Eigenfunction analysis is used to simultaneously characterize and probe patterns of brain connectivity and activity in place of statistical or phenomenological patterns. Physically based measures that characterize the connectivity are then developed in coordinate and spectral domains; some of which generalize or rectify graph-theoretic measures to implement correct dimensionality and continuum limits and some replace graph-theoretic quantities. Traditional graph-based measures are shown to be highly prone to artifacts introduced by discretization and threshold often because essential physical constraints have not been imposed dimensionality has not been included and/or distinctions between scalar vector and tensor quantities have not been considered. The results can replace them in ways that converge correctly and measure properties of brain structure rather than of its discretization and thus potentially enable physical interpretation of the many phenomenological results in the literature. Geometric effects are shown to dominate in determining many brain properties and care must be taken not to interpret geometric differences as differences in intrinsic neural connectivity. The results demonstrate the need to use systematic physical methods to analyze the brain and the potential of such methods to obtain new insights from data make new predictions for experimental test and go beyond phenomenological classification to dynamics and mechanisms."
