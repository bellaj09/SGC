Mental tasks classification such as motor imagery based on EEG signals is an important problem in brain computer interface systems BCI. One of the major concerns in BCI is to have a high classification accuracy. The other concerning one is with the favorable result is guaranteed how to improve the computational efficiency. In this paper Mu/Beta rhythm was obtained by bandpass filter from EEG signal. And the classical linear discriminant analysis LDA was used for deciding which rhythm can give the better classification performance. During this the common spatial pattern CSP was used to project data subject to the ratio of projected energy of one class to that of the other class was maximized. The optimal projection dimension was determined corresponding to the maximum of area under the curve AUC for each participant. Eventually regularized linear discriminant analysis RLDA is possible to decode the imagined motor sensed using electroencephalogram EEG. Results show that higher classification accuracy can be provided by RLDA. And optimal projection dimensions determined by LDA and RLDA are of consistent solution this improves computational efficiency of CSP-RLDA method without computation of projection dimension.
