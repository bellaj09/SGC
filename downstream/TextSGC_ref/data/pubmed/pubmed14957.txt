"A critical need exists for rehabilitation for improving older adults physical abilities especially in the field of fall prevention. Although virtual reality and ambient-assistive technology-based approaches are promising they are cost intensive and frequently face significant obstacles during the developmental process. The authors of the current article developed a motivational interactive training system for fall prevention and stroke rehabilitation and planned a pilot study to measure its usability user acceptance and effect on physical abilities and quality of life. Usability results from a field trial are presented. The purpose of the current article is to describe the technological and organizational problems during the development process and field trial. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers are described. These experiences should be taken into account when planning further field trials with assistive technology and older adults." Implementation of a home-based interactive training system for fall prevention: requirements and challenges.
