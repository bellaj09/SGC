Within Internet of Things IoT sensors the challenge is how to dig out the potentially valuable information from the collected data to support decision making. This paper proposes a method based on machine learning to predict long cycle maintenance time of wind turbines for efficient management in the power company. Long cycle maintenance time prediction makes the power company operate wind turbines as cost-effectively as possible to maximize the profit. Sensor data including operation data maintenance time data and event codes are collected from 31 wind turbines in two wind farms. Data aggregation is performed to filter out some errors and get significant information from the data. Then the hybrid network is built to train the predictive model based on the convolutional neural network CNN and support vector machine SVM. The experimental results show that the prediction of the proposed method reaches high accuracy which helps drive up the efficiency of wind turbine maintenance.
