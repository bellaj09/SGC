"We introduce a deep learning architecture hierarchical self-attention networks HiSANs designed for classifying pathology reports and show how its unique architecture leads to a new state-of-the-art in accuracy faster training and clear interpretability. We evaluate performance on a corpus of 374899 pathology reports obtained from the National Cancer Institutes NCI Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER program. Each pathology report is associated with five clinical classification tasks - site laterality behavior histology and grade. We compare the performance of the HiSAN against other machine learning and deep learning approaches commonly used on medical text data - Naive Bayes logistic regression convolutional neural networks and hierarchical attention networks the previous state-of-the-art. We show that HiSANs are superior to other machine learning and deep learning text classifiers in both accuracy and macro F-score across all five classification tasks. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art hierarchical attention networks HiSANs not only are an order of magnitude faster to train but also achieve about 1% better relative accuracy and 5% better relative macro F-score."
