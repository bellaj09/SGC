"Motor imagery MI based brain computer interfaces BCI detect changes in brain activity associated with imaginary limb movements and translate them into device commands. MI based BCIs require training during which the user gradually learns how to control his or her brain activity with the help of feedback. Additionally machine learning techniques are frequently used to boost BCI performance and to adapt the decoding algorithm to the users brain. Thus both the brain and the machine need to adapt in order to improve performance. To study the utility of co-adaptive training in the BCI paradigm and the time scales involved we investigated the performance of two groups of subjects in a 4-day MI experiment using EEG recordings. One group control n = 9 subjects performed the BCI task using a fixed classifier based on MI data from day 1. In the second group experimental n = 9 subjects the classifier was regularly adapted based on brain activity patterns during the experiment days. We found that the experimental group showed a significantly larger change in performance following training compared to the control group. Specifically although the experimental group exhibited a decrease in performance between days it showed an increase in performance within each day which compensated for the decrease. The control group showed decreases both within and between days. A correlation analysis in subjects who had a notable improvement in performance following training showed that performance was mainly associated with modulation of power in the  frequency band. To conclude continuous updating of the classification algorithm improves the performance of subjects in longitudinal BCI training."
