Many studies over the past two decades have shown that people can use brain signals to convey their intent to a computer using brain-computer interfaces BCIs. BCI systems extract specific features of brain activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output. Recently a category of BCIs that are built on the rhythmic activity recorded over the sensorimotor cortex i.e. the sensorimotor rhythm SMR has attracted considerable attention among the BCIs that use noninvasive neural recordings e.g. electroencephalography EEG and have demonstrated the capability of multidimensional prosthesis control. This paper reviews the current state and future perspectives of SMR-based BCI and its clinical applications in particular focusing on the EEG SMR. The characteristic features of SMR from the human brain are described and their underlying neural sources are discussed. The functional components of SMR-based BCI together with its current clinical applications are reviewed. Finally limitations of SMR-BCIs and future outlooks are also discussed.
