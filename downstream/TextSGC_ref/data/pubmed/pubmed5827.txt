Optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA is a relatively new imaging modality that generates microvasculature map. Meanwhile deep learning has been recently attracting considerable attention in image-to-image translation such as image denoising super-resolution and prediction. In this paper we propose a deep learning based pipeline for OCTA. This pipeline consists of three parts: training data preparation model learning and OCTA predicting using the trained model. To be mentioned the datasets used in this work were automatically generated by a conventional system setup without any expert labeling. Promising results have been validated by in-vivo animal experiments which demonstrate that deep learning is able to outperform traditional OCTA methods. The image quality is improved in not only higher signal-to-noise ratio but also better vasculature connectivity by laser speckle eliminating showing potential in clinical use.
