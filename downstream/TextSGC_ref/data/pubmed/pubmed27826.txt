"Canonically mirror neurons are cells in area F5 of the ventral premotor cortex that are active during both observation and execution of goal-directed movements. Recently cells with similar properties have been observed in a number of other areas in the motor system including the primary motor cortex. Mirror neurons are a part of a system whose function is thought to involve the prediction and interpretation of the sensory consequences of our own actions as well as the actions of others. Mirror-like responses are relevant to the development of brain-machine interfaces BMIs because they provide a robust way to map neural activity to behavior and because they represent high-level information about goals and intentions that may have utility in future BMI applications." Observation-based learning for brain-machine interfaces.
