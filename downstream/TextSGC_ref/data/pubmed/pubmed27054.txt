A new implantable capacitive electrode array for electrocorticography signal recording is developed with ferroelectric ceramic/polymer composite. This ultrathin and electrically safe capacitive electrode array is capable of attaching to the biological tissue conformably. The barium titanate/polyimide BaTiO3 /PI nanocomposite with high dielectric constant is successfully synthesized and employed as the ultrathin dielectric layer of the capacitive BaTiO3 /PI electrode array. The performance of the capacitive BaTiO3 /PI electrode array is evaluated by electrical characterization and 3D finite-element modeling. In vivo neural experiments on the visual cortex of rats show the reliability of the capacitive BaTiO3 /PI electrode array. This work shows the potentials of capacitive BaTiO3 /PI electrode array in the field of brain/computer interfaces.
