WDR45/WIPI4 encoding a WD40 repeat-containing PtdIns3P binding protein is essential for the basal autophagy pathway. Mutations in WDR45 cause the neurodegenerative disease -propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration BPAN a subtype of NBIA. We generated CNS-specific Wdr45 knockout mice which exhibit poor motor coordination greatly impaired learning and memory and extensive axon swelling with numerous axon spheroids. Autophagic flux is defective and SQSTM1 sequestosome-1/p62 and ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates accumulate in neurons and swollen axons. Nes-Wdr45fl/Y mice recapitulate some hallmarks of BPAN including cognitive impairment and defective axonal homeostasis providing a model for revealing the disease pathogenesis of BPAN and also for investigating the possible role of autophagy in axon maintenance. The autophagy gene Wdr45/Wipi4 regulates learning and memory function and axonal homeostasis.
