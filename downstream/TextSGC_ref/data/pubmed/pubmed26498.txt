The common spatial pattern CSP and other spatiospectral feature extraction methods have become the most effective and successful approaches to solve the problem of motor imagery electroencephalography MI-EEG pattern recognition from multichannel neural activity in recent years. However these methods need a lot of preprocessing and postprocessing such as filtering demean and spatiospectral feature fusion which influence the classification accuracy easily. In this paper we utilize linear dynamical systems LDSs for EEG signals feature extraction and classification. LDSs model has lots of advantages such as simultaneous spatial and temporal feature matrix generation free of preprocessing or postprocessing and low cost. Furthermore a low-rank matrix decomposition approach is introduced to get rid of noise and resting state component in order to improve the robustness of the system. Then we propose a low-rank LDSs algorithm to decompose feature subspace of LDSs on finite Grassmannian and obtain a better performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on public dataset from "BCI Competition III Dataset IVa" and "BCI Competition IV Database 2a." The results show that our proposed three methods yield higher accuracies compared with prevailing approaches such as CSP and CSSP. Low-Rank Linear Dynamical Systems for Motor Imagery EEG.
