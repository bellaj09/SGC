How does cognition emerge from neural dynamics? The dominant hypothesis states that interactions among distributed brain regions through phase synchronization give basis for cognitive processing. Such phase-synchronized networks are transient and dynamic established on the timescale of milliseconds in order to perform specific cognitive operations. But unlike resting-state networks the complex organization of transient cognitive networks is typically not characterized within the graph theory framework. Thus it is not known whether cognitive processing merely changes the strength of functional connections or conversely requires qualitatively new topological arrangements of functional networks. To address this question we recorded high-density EEG while subjects performed a visual discrimination task. We conducted an event-related network analysis ERNA where source-space weighted functional networks were characterized with graph measures. ERNA revealed rapid transient and frequency-specific reorganization of the network\s topology during cognition. Specifically cognitive networks were characterized by strong clustering low modularity and strong interactions between hub-nodes. Our findings suggest that dense and clustered connectivity between the hub nodes belonging to different modules is the "network fingerprint" of cognition. Such reorganization patterns might facilitate global integration of information and provide a substrate for a "global workspace" necessary for cognition and consciousness to occur. Thus characterizing topology of the event-related networks opens new vistas to interpret cognitive dynamics in the broader conceptual framework of graph theory.
