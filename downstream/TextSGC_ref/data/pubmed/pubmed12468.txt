Recently released large-scale neuron morphological data has greatly facilitated the research in neuroinformatics. However the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for efficient and accurate neuron exploration. In this paper we propose an effective retrieval framework to address these problems based on frontier techniques of deep learning and binary coding. For the first time we develop a deep learning based feature representation method for the neuron morphological data where the 3D neurons are first projected into binary images and then learned features using an unsupervised deep neural network i.e. stacked convolutional autoencoders SCAEs. The deep features are subsequently fused with the hand-crafted features for more accurate representation. Considering the exhaustive search is usually very time-consuming in large-scale databases we employ a novel binary coding method to compress feature vectors into short binary codes. Our framework is validated on a public data set including 58000 neurons showing promising retrieval precision and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition we develop a novel neuron visualization program based on the techniques of augmented reality AR which can help users take a deep exploration of neuron morphologies in an interactive and immersive manner.
