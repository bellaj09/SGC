Rice lodging severely affects harvest yield. Traditional evaluation methods and manual on-site measurement are found to be time-consuming labor-intensive and cost-intensive. In this study a new method for rice lodging assessment based on a deep learning UNet U-shaped Network architecture was proposed. The UAV unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a high-resolution digital camera and a three-band multispectral camera synchronously was used to collect lodged and non-lodged rice images at an altitude of 100 m. After splicing and cropping the original images the datasets with the lodged and non-lodged rice image samples were established by augmenting for building a UNet model. The research results showed that the dice coefficients in RGB Red Green and Blue image and multispectral image test set were 0.9442 and 0.9284 respectively. The rice lodging recognition effect using the RGB images without feature extraction is better than that of multispectral images. The findings of this study are useful for rice lodging investigations by different optical sensors which can provide an important method for large-area high-efficiency and low-cost rice lodging monitoring research.
