Researching the origin of the terms that we use to identify neuroanatomical structures is a helpful and fascinating exercise. It can provide neuroscientists with a better insight and understanding of the macroscopic anatomy of the cranium and its contents. It can also help the novice to this discipline to become acquainted with structures whose three dimensional anatomy is often difficult to appreciate. The purpose of this article was to investigate the etymology of some of the terms referring to the macroscopic anatomical structures of the skull and the intracranial cavity. We observed how each name unravels an interesting story sometimes linked to mythological creatures other times to the shape of animals or objects and tools of everyday life. We conclude that even without a deep knowledge of the Greek Latin or Arabic language learning who described a particular structure and how they decided to name it makes the study of neuroanatomy more complete and fulfilling. Retracing the etymology of terms in neuroanatomy.
