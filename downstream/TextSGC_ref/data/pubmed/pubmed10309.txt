Extranodal extension ENE is a well-established poor prognosticator and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC. Identification of ENE on pretreatment imaging represents a diagnostic challenge that limits its clinical utility. We previously developed a deep learning algorithm that identifies ENE on pretreatment computed tomography CT imaging in patients with HNSCC. We sought to validate our algorithm performance for patients from a diverse set of institutions and compare its diagnostic ability to that of expert diagnosticians.
