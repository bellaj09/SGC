The\xa0coronavirus disease 2019\xa0COVID-19 is a highly transmissible acute respiratory disease that is caused by the\xa0Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2\xa0SARS-CoV-2 a beta coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan China in late 2019. COVID-19 has been spreading swiftly globally and as of March 2020 has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO. One of the challenges in managing COVID-19 is the identification of a swift accessible and reliable diagnostic modality that could serve as an alternative to a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR. As of the writing of this paper RT-PCR is still the recommended tool in diagnosing COVID-19 but the notion of a more prompt and accurate diagnostic tool is a possibility worth looking into. The objective of this case study is to investigate the importance and utility of chest computed tomography CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as increasing pieces of evidence suggest that chest CT could prove useful in the clinical pathway in diagnosing COVID-19. The Importance of Chest CT Scan in COVID-19.
