Optimizing rendering performance is critical for a wide variety of virtual reality VR applications. Foveated rendering is emerging as an indispensable technique for reconciling interactive frame rates with ever-higher head-mounted display resolutions. Here we present a simple yet effective technique for further reducing the cost of foveated rendering by leveraging ocular dominance - the tendency of the human visual system to prefer scene perception from one eye over the other. Our new approach eye-dominance-guided foveated rendering EFR renders the scene at a lower foveation level with higher detail for the dominant eye than the non-dominant eye. Compared with traditional foveated rendering EFR can be expected to provide superior rendering performance while preserving the same level of perceived visual quality.
