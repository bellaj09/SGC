For the sake of establishing the neural correlates of phrase quadrature perception in harmonic rhythm a musical experiment has been designed to induce music-evoked stimuli related to one important aspect of harmonic rhythm namely the phrase quadrature. Brain activity is translated to action through electroencephalography EEG by using a brain-computer interface. The power spectral value of each EEG channel is estimated to obtain how power variance distributes as a function of frequency. The results of processing the acquired signals are in line with previous studies that use different musical parameters to induce emotions. Indeed our experiment shows statistical differences in theta and alpha bands between the fulfillment and break of phrase quadrature an important cue of harmonic rhythm in two classical sonatas.
