The brain connectome collects the complex network architectures looking at both static and dynamic functional connectivity. The former normally requires stationary signals and connections. However the human brain activity and connections are most likely time dependent and dynamic and related to ongoing rhythmic activity. We developed an open-source MATLAB toolbox DynamicBC with user-friendly graphical user interfaces implementing both dynamic functional and effective connectivity for tracking brain dynamics from functional MRI. We provided two strategies for dynamic analysis: 1 the commonly utilized sliding-window analysis and 2 the flexible least squares based time-varying parameter regression strategy. The toolbox also implements multiple functional measures including seed-to-voxel analysis region of interest ROI-to-ROI analysis and voxel-to-voxel analysis. We describe the principles of the implemented algorithms and then present representative results from simulations and empirical data applications. We believe that this toolbox will help neuroscientists and neurologists to easily map dynamic brain connectomics. DynamicBC: a MATLAB toolbox for dynamic brain connectome analysis.
