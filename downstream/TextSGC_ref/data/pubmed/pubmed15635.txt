"We assessed the feasibility of a data-driven imaging biomarker based on weakly supervised learning DIB; an imaging biomarker derived from large-scale medical image data with deep learning technology in mammography DIB-MG. A total of 29107 digital mammograms from five institutions 4339 cancer cases and 24768 normal cases were included. After matching patients age breast density and equipment 1238 and 1238 cases were chosen as validation and test sets respectively and the remainder were used for training. The core algorithm of DIB-MG is a deep convolutional neural network; a deep learning algorithm specialized for images. Each sample case is an exam composed of 4-view images RCC RMLO LCC and LMLO. For each case in a training set the cancer probability inferred from DIB-MG is compared with the per-case ground-truth label. Then the model parameters in DIB-MG are updated based on the error between the prediction and the ground-truth. At the operating point threshold of 0.5 sensitivity was 75.6% and 76.1% when specificity was 90.2% and 88.5% and AUC was 0.903 and 0.906 for the validation and test sets respectively. This research showed the potential of DIB-MG as a screening tool for breast cancer." Applying Data-driven Imaging Biomarker in Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening: Preliminary Study.
