Cell counting from cell cultures is required in multiple biological and biomedical research applications. Especially accurate brightfield-based cell counting methods are needed for cell growth analysis. With deep learning cells can be detected with high accuracy but manually annotated training data is required. We propose a method for cell detection that requires annotated training data for one cell line only and generalizes to other unseen cell lines. Iterative unsupervised domain adaptation for generalized cell detection from brightfield z-stacks.
