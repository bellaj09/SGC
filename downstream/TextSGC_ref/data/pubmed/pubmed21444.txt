People with schizophrenia often have functional limitations that affect their daily activities due to executive function deficits. One way to assess these deficits is through the use of virtual reality programmes that reproduce real-life instrumental activities of daily living IADLs. One such programme is the Virtual Action Planning-Supermarket VAP-S. This exploratory study aimed to examine the ecological validity of this programme specifically how task performance in both virtual and natural environments compares. Case studies were used and involved five participants with schizophrenia who were familiar with grocery shopping. They were assessed during both the VAP-S shopping task and a real-life grocery shopping task using an observational assessment tool the Perceive Recall Plan and Perform PRPP System of Task Analysis. The results show that when difficulties were present in the virtual task difficulties were also observed in the real-life task. For some participants greater difficulties were observed in the virtual task. These difficulties could be explained by the presence of perceptual deficits and problems remembering the required sequenced actions in the virtual task. In conclusion performance on the VAP-S by these five participants was generally comparable to the performance in a natural environment.
