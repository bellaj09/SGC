This study examined the effect of computer generated virtual reality graded exposure on the physiological and psychological responses of performing musicians. Three upper division undergraduate saxophonists two female and one male performed while immersed in four virtual environments each designed to gradually increase the expected anxiety level of the performer. Heart rates and subjective measurements were taken throughout the exposure period. Results of this study indicated that virtual reality graded exposure did elicit physiological and psychological indications of increased anxiety in musical performance environments designed for that purpose. Findings also corroborated previous research that found gender to be a predictor of heart rate during performance.
