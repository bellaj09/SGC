"Microsofts Kinect for Xbox 360 virtual reality VR video games are promising rehabilitation options because they involve motivating full-body movement practice. However these games were designed for recreational use which creates challenges for clinical implementation. Busy clinicians require decision-making support to inform game selection and implementation that address individual therapeutic goals. This article describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a knowledge translation KT resource to support clinical decision making about selection and use of Kinect games in physical therapy. The knowledge-to-action framework guided the development of the Kinecting With Clinicians KWiC resource. Five physical therapists with VR and video game expertise analyzed the Kinect Adventure games. A consensus-building method was used to arrive at categories to organize clinically relevant attributes guiding game selection and game play. The process and results of an exploratory usability evaluation of the KWiC resource by clinicians through interviews and focus groups at 4 clinical sites is described. Subsequent steps in the evaluation and KT process are proposed including making the KWiC resource Web-based and evaluating the utility of the online resource in clinical practice."
