Transferring the brain computer interface BCI from laboratory condition to meet the real world application needs BCI to be applied asynchronously without any time constraint. High level of dynamism in the electroencephalogram EEG signal reasons us to look toward evolutionary algorithm EA. Motivated by these two facts in this work a hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering technique has been used to distinguish two class motor imagery MI tasks. The proposed hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering is found to outperform genetic algorithm GA and particle swarm optimization PSO based K-means clustering techniques in terms of both accuracy and execution time. The lesser execution time of hybrid GA-PSO technique makes it suitable for real time BCI application. Time frequency representation TFR techniques have been used to extract the feature of the signal under investigation. TFRs based features are extracted and relying on the concept of event related synchronization ERD and desynchronization ERD feature vector is formed.
