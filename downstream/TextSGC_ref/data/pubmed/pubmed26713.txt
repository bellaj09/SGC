This report summarizes our recent efforts to deliver real-time data extraction preprocessing artifact rejection source reconstruction multivariate dynamical system analysis including spectral Granger causality and 3D visualization as well as classification within the open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes. We report the application of such a pipeline to simulated data and real EEG data obtained from a novel wearable high-density 64-channel dry EEG system. Real-time modeling and 3D visualization of source dynamics and connectivity using wearable EEG.
