"Using a single integrated analysis we examined the relationship between brain networks and molecular pathways in a cohort of elderly individuals at risk for Alzheimers disease. In 205 subjective memory complainers 124 females mean age: 75.7  3.4 individual functional connectome was computed for a total of 3081 functional connections set A and 6 core plasma biomarkers of Alzheimers disease set B were assessed. Partial least squares correlation analysis identified one dimension of population covariation between the 2 sets p < 0.006 which we named bioneural mode. Five core plasma biomarkers and 190 functional connections presented bootstrap ratios greater than the critical value |1.96|. T-tau protein showed a trend toward significance bootstrap resampling\xa0= 1.64. The salience the language the visuospatial and the default mode networks were the strongest significant networks. We detected a strong association between network dynamics and core pathophysiological blood biomarkers. Innovative composite biomarkers such as the bioneural mode are promising to provide outcomes and better inform drug development and clinical practice for neurodegenerative diseases." Association of brain network dynamics with plasma biomarkers in subjective memory complainers.
