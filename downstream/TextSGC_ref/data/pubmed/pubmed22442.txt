"Training on a video trainer or computer-based minimally invasive surgery trainer leads to improved benchtop laparoscopic skill. Recently improved operative performance from practice on a video trainer was reported. The purpose of this study was three fold: a to compare psychomotor skill improvement after training on a virtual reality VR system with that after training on a video-trainer VT b to evaluate whether skills learned on the one training system are transferable to the other and c to evaluate whether VR or VT training improves operative performance. For the study 50 junior surgery residents completed baseline skill testing on both the VR and VT systems. These subjects then were randomized to either a VR or VT structured training group. After practice the subjects were tested again on their VR and VT skills. To assess the effect of practice on operative performance all second-year residents n = 19 were evaluated on their operative performance during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy before and after skill training. Data are expressed as percentage of improvement in mean score/time. Analysis was performed by Students paired t-test. The VR training group showed improvement of 54% on the VR posttest as compared with 55% improvement by the VT group. The VR training group improved more on the VT posttest tasks 36% than the VT training group improved on the VR posttest tasks 17% p <0.05. Operative performance improved only in the VR training group p <0.05. Psychomotor skills improve after training on both VR and VT and skills may be transferable. Furthermore training on a minimally invasive surgery trainer virtual reality system may improve operative performance during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
