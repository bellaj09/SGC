Applying deep learning methods in materials science research is an important way of solving the time-consuming problems of typical ab initio quantum chemistry methodology but due to the size of large molecules large and uncharted fields still exist. Implementing symmetry information can significantly reduce the calculation complexity of structures as they can be simplified to the minimum symmetric units. Because there are few quantum chemistry databases that include symmetry information we constructed a new one named QM-sym by designing an algorithm to generate 135k organic molecules with the Cnh symmetry composite. Those generated molecules were optimized to a stable state using Gaussian 09. The geometric electronic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the molecules were calculated including their orbital degeneracy states and orbital symmetry around the HOMO-LUMO. The basic symmetric units were also included. This database p rovides consistent and comprehensive quantum chemical properties for structures with Cnh symmetries. QM-sym can be used as a benchmark for machine learning models in quantum chemistry or as a dataset for training new symmetry-based models. QM-sym a symmetrized quantum chemistry database of 135 kilo molecules.
