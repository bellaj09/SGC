"Drones allow exploring dangerous or impassable areas safely from a distant point of view. However flight control from an egocentric view in narrow or constrained environments can be challenging. Arguably an exocentric view would afford a better overview and thus more intuitive flight control of the drone. Unfortunately such an exocentric view is unavailable when exploring indoor environments. This paper investigates the potential of drone-augmented human vision i.e. of exploring the environment and controlling the drone indirectly from an exocentric viewpoint. If used with a see-through display this approach can simulate X-ray vision to provide a natural view into an otherwise occluded environment. The users view is synthesized from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the indoor environment using image-based rendering. This user interface is designed to reduce the cognitive load of the drones flight control. The user can concentrate on the exploration of the inaccessible space while flight control is largely delegated to the drones autopilot system. We assess our system with a first experiment showing how drone-augmented human vision supports spatial understanding and improves natural interaction with the drone."
