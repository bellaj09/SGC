"Executive planning the ability to direct and sustain attention language and several types of memory may be compromised by conditions such as stroke traumatic brain injury cancer autism cerebral palsy and Alzheimers disease. No medical devices are currently available to help restore these cognitive functions. Recent findings about the neurophysiology of these conditions in humans coupled with progress in engineering devices to treat refractory neurological conditions imply that the time has arrived to consider the design and evaluation of a new class of devices. Like their neuromotor counterparts neurocognitive prostheses might sense or modulate neural function in a non-invasive manner or by means of implanted electrodes. In order to paint a vision for future device development it is essential to first review what can be achieved using behavioral and external modulatory techniques. While non-invasive approaches might strengthen a patients remaining intact cognitive abilities neurocognitive prosthetics comprised of direct brain-computer interfaces could in theory physically reconstitute and augment the substrate of cognition itself."
