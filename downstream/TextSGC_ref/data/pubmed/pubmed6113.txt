"Understanding complex systems such as the human brain requires characterization of the systems architecture across multiple levels of organization - from neurons to local circuits to brain regions and ultimately large-scale brain networks. Here we focus on characterizing the human brains large-scale network organization as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently-identified networks including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex revealing 358 highly-organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels 360. This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease."
