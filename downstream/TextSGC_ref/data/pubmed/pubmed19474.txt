Virtual reality VR has emerged as a novel and effective non-pharmacologic therapy for pain and there is growing interest to use VR in the acute hospital setting. We sought to explore the cost and effectiveness thresholds VR therapy must meet to be cost-saving as an inpatient pain management program. The result is a framework for hospital administrators to evaluate the return on investment of implementing inpatient VR programs of varying effectiveness and cost. Utilizing decision analysis software we compared adjuvant VR therapy for pain management vs. usual care among hospitalized patients. In the VR strategy we analyzed potential cost-savings from reductions in opioid utilization and hospital length of stay LOS as well as increased reimbursements from higher patient satisfaction as measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems HCAHPS survey. The average overall hospitalization cost-savings per patient for the VR program vs. usual care was $5.39 95% confidence interval -$11.00 to $156.17. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis across 1000 hypothetical hospitals of varying size and staffing VR remained cost-saving in 89.2% of trials. The VR program was cost-saving so long as it reduced LOS by 14.6%; the model was not sensitive to differences in opioid use or HCAHPS. We conclude that inpatient VR therapy may be cost-saving for a hospital system primarily if it reduces LOS. In isolation cost-savings from reductions in opioid utilization and increased HCAHPS-related reimbursements are not sufficient to overcome the costs of VR.
