In this paper we solve the problem of mitosis event localization and its stage localization in time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy images. Our method contains three steps: first we formulate a Low-Rank Matrix Recovery LRMR model to find salient regions from microscopy images and extract candidate patch sequences which potentially contain mitosis events; second we classify each candidate patch sequence by our proposed Hierarchical Convolution Neural Network HCNN with visual appearance and motion cues; third for the detected mitosis sequences we further segment them into four temporal stages by our proposed Two-stream Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory TS-BLSTM. In the experiments we validate our system LRMR HCNN and TS-BLSTM and evaluate the mitosis event localization and stage localization performance. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts by achieving 99.2% precision and 98.0% recall for mitosis event localization and 0.62 frame error on average for mitosis stage localization in five challenging image sequences.
