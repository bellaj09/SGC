Feedback plays an important role when learning to use a brain computer interface BCI particularly in the case of synchronous feedback that relies on the interaction subject. In this preliminary study we investigate the role of combined auditory-visual feedback during synchronous  rhythm-based BCI sessions to help the subject to remain focused on the selected imaginary task. This new combined feedback now integrated within the general purpose BCI2000 software has been tested on eight untrained and three trained subjects during a monodimensional left-right control task. In order to reduce the setup burden and maximize subject comfort an electroencephalographic device suitable for dry electrodes that required no skin preparation was used. Quality and index of improvement was evaluated based on a personal self-assessment questionnaire from each subject and quantitative data based on subject performance. Results for this preliminary study show that the combined feedback was well tolerated by the subjects and improved performance in 75% of the nave subjects compared with visual feedback alone.
