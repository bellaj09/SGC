Considerable resources have been invested in low- and high-fidelity simulators in surgical training. To our knowledge no investigation has compared the 2 head to head for operative assessment purposes. The purpose of this study was to assess the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS low-fidelity video trainer and LapVR high-fidelity virtual-reality simulator for 1 construct and 2 predictive validity using a human cholecystectomy model. Does laparoscopic simulation predict intraoperative performance? A comparison between the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery and LapVR evaluation metrics.
