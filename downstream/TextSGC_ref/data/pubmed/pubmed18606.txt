It is evident that surface electromyography sEMG based human-machine interfaces HMI have inherent difficulty in predicting dexterous musculoskeletal movements such as finger motions. This paper is an attempt to investigate a plausible alternative to sEMG ultrasound-driven HMI for dexterous motion recognition due to its characteristic of detecting morphological changes of deep muscles and tendons. A multi-channel A-mode ultrasound lightweight device is adopted to evaluate the performance of finger motion recognition; an experiment is designed for both widely acceptable offline and online algorithms with eight able-bodied subjects employed. The experiment result presents that the offline recognition accuracy is up to 98.83%  0.79%. The real-time motion completion rate is 95.4%  8.7% and online motion selection time is 0.243  0.127 s. The outcomes confirm the feasibility of A-mode ultrasound based wearable HMI and its prosperous applications in prosthetic devices virtual reality and remote manipulation.
