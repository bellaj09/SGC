"This off-line study aims to assess the performance of five classifiers commonly used in the brain-computer interface BCI community when applied to a gaze-independent P300-based BCI. In particular we compared the results of four linear classifiers and one nonlinear: Fishers linear discriminant analysis LDA stepwise linear discriminant analysis SWLDA Bayesian linear discriminant analysis BLDA linear support vector machine LSVM and Gaussian supported vector machine GSVM. Moreover different values for the decimation of the training dataset were tested. The results were evaluated both in terms of accuracy and written symbol rate with the data of 19 healthy subjects. No significant differences among the considered classifiers were found. The optimal decimation factor spanned a range from 3 to 24 12 to 94 ms long bins. Nevertheless performance on individually optimized classification parameters is not significantly different from a classification with general parameters i.e. using an LDA classifier about 48 ms long bins."
