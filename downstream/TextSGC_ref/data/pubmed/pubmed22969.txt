To date cognitive flexibility has been measured only using neuropsychological tasks and has not been tested using more ecologically valid task due to methodological limitations. In this study a virtual reality task was developed to evaluate cognitive flexibility in a real life situation and performance on this task was compared between 30 healthy individuals and 30 schizophrenia patients. Compared to healthy controls a greater number of schizophrenia patients made concrete decisions and their decision-making times were negatively correlated with the severity of their negative symptoms. These findings indicate that virtual reality can be an ecologically valid measurement of cognitive flexibility. Assessment of cognitive flexibility in real life using virtual reality: a comparison of healthy individuals and schizophrenia patients.
