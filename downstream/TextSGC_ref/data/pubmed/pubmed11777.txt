To improve the robustness and to reduce the energy consumption of facial expression recognition this study proposed a facial expression recognition method based on improved deep residual networks ResNets. Residual learning has solved the degradation problem of deep Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs; therefore in theory a ResNet can consist of infinite number of neural layers. On the one hand ResNets benefit from better performance on artificial intelligence AI tasks thanks to its deeper network structure; meanwhile on the other hand it faces a severe problem of energy consumption especially on mobile devices. Hence this study employs a novel activation function the Noisy Softplus NSP to replace rectified linear units ReLU to get improved ResNets. NSP is a biologically plausible activation function which was first proposed in training Spiking Neural Networks SNNs; thus NSP-trained models can be directly implemented on ultra-low-power neuromorphic hardware. We built an 18-layered ResNet using NSP to perform facial expression recognition across datasets Cohn-Kanade CK+ Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces KDEF and GENKI-4K. The results achieved better anti-noise ability than ResNet using the activation function ReLU and showed low energy consumption running on neuromorphic hardware. This study not only contributes a solution for robust facial expression recognition but also consolidates the low energy cost of their implementation on neuromorphic devices which could pave the way for high-performance noise-robust and energy-efficient vision applications on mobile hardware. Robust and energy-efficient expression recognition based on improved deep ResNets.
