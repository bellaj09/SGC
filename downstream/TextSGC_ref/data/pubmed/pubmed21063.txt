Very preterm births prevent a complete development of the nervous system. The hippocampus is especially vulnerable in this population since the perinatal period is critical for its growth and development. Learning and memory abilities like spatial memory depend on the hippocampal integrity. In this study we applied virtual-reality-based tasks to assess spatial memory in a sample of 20 very preterm children of 7 and 8 years of age. Two different conditions of difficulty were used. Very preterm children performed poorly in the task in comparison with the control group. They committed more errors than controls searching for the rewarded positions. However no significant differences were observed in the mean speed an index of the motor abilities and joystick handling. These results suggest that the hippocampal function is affected in this sample. Nevertheless other variables to consider are discussed. Spatial learning in a virtual reality-based task is altered in very preterm children.
