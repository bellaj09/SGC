As an effective technology near infrared spectroscopy NIRS can be widely applied to analysis of active ingredients in medicinal fungi. Multiple regression methods are used to compute the relationship between spectral vectors and ingredient contents. In this paper an autonomous feature extraction method by using attention based residual network ABRN to model original NIRS vectors is introduced. Attention module in ABRN is employed to enhance feature wave bands and to decay noise. Different from traditional NIRS analysis methods ABRN does not require any preprocessing of artificial feature selections which rely on expert experience. The experiments test ABRN by analyzing original spectrums of medicinal fungi Antrodia Camphorata and Matsutake which are from 800 nm to 2500 nm and predicting active ingredients within them. We compare ABRN with other popular NIRS analysis methods. The root mean square error of Antrodia Camphorata training set RMSET and validation set RMSEV are 0.0229 gg and 0.0349 gg for polysaccharide and 0.0173 gg and 0.0189 gg for triterpene. The RMSET and RMSEV of Matsutake are 0.1343 gg and 0.2472 gg for polysaccharide and 0.0328 gg and 0.0445 gg for ergosterol. The coefficient of determination of these four ingredients are 0.711 0.753 0.847 and 0.807. The results indicate that ABRN has better performance in autonomously extracting feature wave bands from original NIRS vectors which can decrease the loss of tiny feature peaks.
