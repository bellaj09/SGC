Recently virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR have received increasing attention with the development of VR/AR devices such as head-mounted displays haptic devices and AR glasses. Medicine is considered to be one of the most effective applications of VR/AR. In this article we describe a systematic literature review conducted to investigate the state-of-the-art VR/AR technology relevant to plastic surgery. The 35 studies that were ultimately selected were categorized into 3 representative topics: VR/AR-based preoperative planning navigation and training. In addition future trends of VR/AR technology associated with plastic surgery and related fields are discussed. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in Plastic Surgery: A Review.
