Research on brain machine interface BMI has been developed very fast in recent years. Numerous feature extraction methods have successfully been applied to electroencephalogram EEG classification in various experiments. However little effort has been spent on EEG based BMI systems regarding familiarity of human faces cognition. In this work we have implemented and compared the classification performances of four common feature extraction methods namely common spatial pattern principal component analysis wavelet transform and interval features. High resolution EEG signals were collected from fifteen healthy subjects stimulated by equal number of familiar and novel faces. Principal component analysis outperforms other methods with average classification accuracy reaching 94.2% leading to possible real life applications. Our findings thereby may contribute to the BMI systems for face recognition. Single trial EEG classification applied to a face recognition experiment using different feature extraction methods.
