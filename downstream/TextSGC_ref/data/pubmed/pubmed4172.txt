"Reading comprehension is a crucial reading skill for learning and putatively contains 2 key components: reading decoding and linguistic comprehension. Current understanding of the neural mechanism underlying these reading comprehension components is lacking and whether and how neuroanatomical features can be used to predict these 2 skills remain largely unexplored. In the present study we analyzed a large sample from the Human Connectome Project HCP dataset and successfully built multivariate predictive models for these 2 skills using whole-brain gray matter volume features. The results showed that these models effectively captured individual differences in these 2 skills and were able to significantly predict these components of reading comprehension for unseen individuals. The strict cross-validation using the HCP cohort and another independent cohort of children demonstrated the model generalizability. The identified gray matter regions contributing to the skill prediction consisted of a wide range of regions covering the putative reading cerebellum and subcortical systems. Interestingly there were gender differences in the predictive models with the female-specific model overestimating the males abilities. Moreover the identified contributing gray matter regions for the female-specific and male-specific models exhibited considerable differences supporting a gender-dependent neuroanatomical substrate for reading comprehension."
