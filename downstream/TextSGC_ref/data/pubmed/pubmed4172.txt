There is significant interest in using resting-state functional connectivity RSFC to predict human behavior. Good behavioral prediction should in theory require RSFC to be sufficiently distinct across participants; if RSFC were the same across participants then behavioral prediction would obviously be poor. Therefore we hypothesize that removing common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI signals that are shared across participants would improve behavioral prediction. Here we considered 803 participants from the human connectome project HCP with four rs-fMRI runs. We applied the common and orthogonal basis extraction COBE technique to decompose each HCP run into two subspaces: a common group-level subspace shared across all participants and a subject-specific subspace. We found that the first common COBE component of the first HCP run was localized to the visual cortex and was unique to the run. On the other hand the second common COBE component of the first HCP run and the first common COBE component of the remaining HCP runs were highly similar and localized to regions within the default network including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Overall this suggests the presence of run-specific state-specific effects that were shared across participants. By removing the first and second common COBE components from the first HCP run and the first common COBE component from the remaining HCP runs the resulting RSFC improves behavioral prediction by an average of 11.7% across 58 behavioral measures spanning cognition emotion and personality. Individual-specific fMRI-Subspaces improve functional connectivity prediction of behavior.
