Nutrition literacy is linked to health via its influence on dietary intake. There is a need for a tool to assess nutrition literacy in research and dietetic practice. We sought guidance from nutrition professionals on topic areas and features of an electronic nutrition literacy assessment tool for Australian adults. 28 experienced nutrition professionals engaged in a range of nutrition and dietetic work areas participated in six focus groups using a semi-structured interview schedule. Data were analysed using an inductive approach using NVivo 10 QSR International Pty Ltd. Doncaster Australia 2012. Key areas identified to assess nutrition literacy included specific nutrients versus foods labels and packaging construction of the diet knowledge of the Australian Dietary Guidelines and Australian Guide to Healthy Eating understanding of serve and portion sizes ability to select healthier foods and demographics such as belief systems and culture. Exploitation of electronic features to enhance visual and auditory displays including interactive animations such as "drag and drop" and virtual reality situations were discussed. This study provided insight into the most relevant topic areas and presentation format to assess the nutrition literacy of adult Australians. The visual auditory and interactive capacity of the available technology could enhance the assessment of nutrition literacy.
