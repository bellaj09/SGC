Full-body motion capture typically requires sensors/markers to be placed on each rigid body segment which results in long setup times and is obtrusive. The number of sensors/markers can be reduced using deep learning or offline methods. However this requires large training datasets and/or sufficient computational resources. Therefore we investigate the following research question: "What is the performance of a shallow approach compared to a deep learning one for estimating time coherent full-body poses using only five inertial sensors?". We propose to incorporate past/future inertial sensor information into a stacked input vector which is fed to a shallow neural network for estimating full-body poses. Shallow and deep learning approaches are compared using the same input vector configurations. Additionally the inclusion of acceleration input is evaluated. The results show that a shallow learning approach can estimate full-body poses with a similar accuracy ~6 cm to that of a deep learning approach ~7 cm. However the jerk errors are smaller using the deep learning approach which can be the effect of explicit recurrent modelling. Furthermore it is shown that the delay using a shallow learning approach 72 ms is smaller than that of a deep learning approach 117 ms.
