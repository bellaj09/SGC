Signal classification is an important issue in brain computer interface BCI systems. Deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data. However the number of studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals. A novel deep learning approach for classification of EEG motor imagery signals.
