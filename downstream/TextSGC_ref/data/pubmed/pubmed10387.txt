In this paper the problem of multi-view embedding from different visual cues and modalities is considered. We propose a unified solution for subspace learning methods using the Rayleigh quotient which is extensible for multiple views supervised learning and nonlinear embeddings. Numerous methods including canonical correlation analysis partial least square regression and linear discriminant analysis are studied using specific intrinsic and penalty graphs within the same framework. Nonlinear extensions based on kernels and deep neural networks are derived achieving better performance than the linear ones. Moreover a novel multi-view modular discriminant analysis is proposed by taking the view difference into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view embedding methods on visual object recognition and cross-modal image retrieval and obtain superior results in both applications compared to related methods.
