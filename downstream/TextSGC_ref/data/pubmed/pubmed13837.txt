The advent of high-throughput experimental techniques paved the way to genome-wide computational analysis and predictive annotation studies. When considering the joint annotation of a large set of related entities like all proteins of a certain genome many candidate annotations could be inconsistent or very unlikely given the existing knowledge. A sound predictive framework capable of accounting for this type of constraints in making predictions could substantially contribute to the quality of machine-generated annotations at a genomic scale. Combining learning and constraints for genome-wide protein annotation.
