This paper presents a deep-learning-based CADx for the differential diagnosis of embryonal ERMS and alveolar ARMS subtypes of rhabdomysarcoma RMS solely by analyzing multiparametric MR images. We formulated an automated pipeline that creates a comprehensive representation of tumor by performing a fusion of diffusion-weighted MR scans DWI and gadolinium chelate-enhanced T1-weighted MR scans MRI. Finally we adapted transfer learning approach where a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network has been fine-tuned based on the fused images for performing classification of the two RMS subtypes. We achieved 85% cross validation prediction accuracy from the fine-tuned deep CNN model. Our system can be exploited to provide a fast efficient and reproducible diagnosis of RMS subtypes with less human interaction. The framework offers an efficient integration between advanced image processing methods and cutting-edge deep learning techniques which can be extended to deal with other clinical domains that involve multimodal imaging for disease diagnosis.
