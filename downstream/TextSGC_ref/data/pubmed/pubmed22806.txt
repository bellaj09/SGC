The l1 -norm-based common spatial patterns CSP-L1 approach is a recently developed technique for optimizing spatial filters in the field of electroencephalogram EEG-based brain computer interfaces. The l1 -norm-based expression of dispersion in CSP-L1 alleviates the negative impact of outliers. In this paper we further improve the robustness of CSP-L1 by taking into account noise which does not necessarily have as large a deviation as with outliers. The noise modelling is formulated by using the waveform length of the EEG time course. With the noise modelling we then regularize the objective function of CSP-L1 in which the l1-norm is used in two folds: one is the dispersion and the other is the waveform length. An iterative algorithm is designed to resolve the optimization problem of the regularized objective function. A toy illustration and the experiments of classification on real EEG data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Regularized Filters for L1-Norm-Based Common Spatial Patterns.
