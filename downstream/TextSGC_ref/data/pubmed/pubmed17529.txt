"Research with college students has supported a model of writing approaches that defines the relationship between a writer and writing task along a deep and surface process continuum Biggs 1988. Based on that model Lavelle 1993 developed the Inventory of Processes in College Composition which reflects students motives and strategies as related to writing outcomes. It is also important to define the approaches of secondary students to better understand writing processes at that level and development in written composition."
