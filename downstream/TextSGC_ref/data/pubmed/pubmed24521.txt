This review aimed to identify the potential role of integrative medicine in interventional oncology. The music therapy; stress management techniques; guided imagery including virtual reality; clinical hypnosis; and digital sedation may all be efficient on anxiety and pain during procedures performed in interventional oncology. Beyond pharmacological sedation the implementation of integrative medicine to interventional oncology may therefore improve the support and care of cancer patients which may further create a virtuous alliance.
