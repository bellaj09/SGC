"Surgical training which was traditionally based on the apprentice model is undergoing a fundamental change since the introduction of virtual reality simulators into the training program of surgical residents. With the introduction of these simulators we can expect to see an improvement in the surgical abilities of new surgeons and a decrease in costs--as seen in the aviation world. Virtual reality simulators include a visual and tactile interface which is meant to train young surgeons in full procedure before the actual surgery. The available operation encompasses a multitude of surgical disciplines--gynecology urology orthopedics vascular surgery general surgery and more. The simulator allows the surgeon to practice complicated procedures and to be exposed to emergency situations without risking the patients life. We opened in the Carmel Medical Center a multi disciplinary simulation center 18 months ago. The center includes simulators for gynecology orthopedics urology general surgery vascular surgery and advanced cardiac life support. The center cooperates with the Faculty of Medicine at the Technion in order to train young surgeons in all surgical disciplines. In this period of time we followed the improvement in the endoscopic abilities of the basic skills course participants." THE ROLE OF SIMULATION IN SURGICAL TRAINING--A NEW ERA.
