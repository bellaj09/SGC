A new human coronavirus HCoV which has been designated SARS-CoV-2 began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012 respectively. Thus far 11268 deaths have been reported from the 258842 confirmed infections in 168 countries.
