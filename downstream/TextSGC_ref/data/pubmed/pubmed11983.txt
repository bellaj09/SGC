In the last decade advanced functional genomics approaches and deep sequencing have allowed large-scale mapping of histone modifications and other epigenetic marks highlighting functional relationships between chromatin organization and genome function. Here we propose a novel approach to explore functional interactions between different epigenetic modifications and extract combinatorial profiles that can be used to annotate the chromatin in a finite number of functional classes. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization NMF an unsupervised learning technique originally employed to decompose high-dimensional data in a reduced number of meaningful patterns. We applied the NMF algorithm to a set of different epigenetic marks consisting of ChIP-seq assays for multiple histone modifications Pol II binding and chromatin accessibility assays from human H1 cells. A computational approach for the functional classification of the epigenome.
