The use of virtual reality games known as "exergaming" as a neurorehabilitation tool is gaining interest. Therefore we aim to collate evidence for the effects of exergaming on the balance and postural control of older adults and people with idiopathic Parkinson\s disease IPD. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2015 to identify relevant studies. Standardized mean differences SMDs and 95% confidence intervals CI were used to calculate effect sizes between experimental and control groups. I 2 statistics were used to determine levels of heterogeneity. 325 older adults and 56 people with IPD who were assessed across 11\u2009-studies. The results showed that exergaming improved static balance SMD 1.069 95% CI 0.563-1.576 postural control SMD 0.826 95% CI 0.481-1.170 and dynamic balance SMD -0.808 95% CI -1.192 to -0.424 in healthy older adults. Two IPD studies showed an improvement in static balance SMD 0.124 95% CI -0.581 to 0.828 and postural control SMD 2.576 95% CI 1.534-3.599. Our findings suggest that exergaming might be an appropriate therapeutic tool for improving balance and postural control in older adults but more -large-scale trials are needed to determine if the same is true for people with IPD.
