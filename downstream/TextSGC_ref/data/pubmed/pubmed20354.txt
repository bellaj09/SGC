"At MMVR 2007 we presented NeuroVR http://www.neurovr.org a free virtual reality platform based on open-source software. The software allows non-expert users to adapt the content of 14 pre-designed virtual environments to the specific needs of the clinical or experimental setting. Following the feedbacks of the 2000 users who downloaded the first versions 1 and 1.5 we developed a new version--NeuroVR 2 http://www.neurovr2.org--that improves the possibility for the therapist to enhance the patients feeling of familiarity and intimacy with the virtual scene by using external sounds photos or videos. More when running a simulation the system offers a set of standard features that contribute to increase the realism of the simulated scene. These include collision detection to control movements in the environment realistic walk-style motion advanced lighting techniques for enhanced image quality and streaming of video textures using alpha channel for transparency."
