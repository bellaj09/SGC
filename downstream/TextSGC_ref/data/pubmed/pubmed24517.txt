The intraday robustness of brain-machine interfaces BMIs is important to their clinical viability. In particular BMIs must be robust to intraday perturbations in neuron firing rates which may arise from several factors including recording loss and external noise. Using a state-of-the-art decode algorithm the Recalibrated Feedback Intention Trained Kalman filter ReFIT-KF we introduce two novel modifications: 1 a normalization of the firing rates and 2 a reduction of the dimensionality of the data via principal component analysis PCA. We demonstrate in online studies that a ReFIT-KF equipped with normalization and PCA NPC-ReFIT-KF 1 achieves comparable performance to a standard ReFIT-KF when at least 60% of the neural variance is captured and 2 is more robust to the undetected loss of channels. We present intuition as to how both modifications may increase the robustness of BMIs and investigate the contribution of each modification to robustness. These advances which lead to a decoder achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness are important for the clinical viability of BMI systems. Investigating the role of firing-rate normalization and dimensionality reduction in brain-machine interface robustness.
