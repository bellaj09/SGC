Despite the seemingly ubiquitous presence of audiovisual stimuli in modern exercise facilities there is a dearth of research examining the effects of audiovisual stimuli in combination during exercise. Accordingly we examined the influence of a range of audiovisual stimuli on the improvement of affective perceptual and enjoyment responses to cycle ergometer exercise at the ventilatory threshold VT an intensity that is associated with the most affect-related interindividual variability. A within-subject design was employed and participants N\xa0=\xa018 completed a 25-minute protocol that consisted of 2\xa0minutes of seated rest 5\xa0minutes of warm-up 10\xa0minutes of exercise at VT 5\xa0minutes of cooldown and 3\xa0minutes of seated rest. Participants exercised at VT under music video music-video 360-degree video 360-degree video with music and control conditions. The results revealed a condition\xa0\xa0time interaction for perceived activation and a main effect of condition for state attention and perceived enjoyment. The 360-degree video with music condition elicited the most positive affective valence greatest perceived activation most dissociative thoughts and highest ratings of perceived enjoyment. The present findings indicate that audiovisual stimuli can influence affective perceptual and enjoyment responses to cycle ergometer exercise at the VT. Given the emerging support pertaining to a positive relationship between affective responses and exercise adherence audiovisual stimuli such as 360-degree video with music should be considered as a means by which to promote an enjoyable exercise experience. Effects of music video and 360-degree video on cycle ergometer exercise at the ventilatory threshold.
