Magnetic resonance imaging MRI-based cell tracking has emerged as a useful tool for identifying the location of transplanted cells and even their migration. Magnetically labeled cells appear as dark contrast in T2*-weighted MRI with sensitivities of individual cells. One key hurdle to the widespread use of MRI-based cell tracking is the inability to determine the number of transplanted cells based on this contrast feature. In the case of single cell detection manual enumeration of spots in three-dimensional 3D MRI in principle is possible; however it is a tedious and time-consuming task that is prone to subjectivity and inaccuracy on a large scale. This research presents the first comprehensive study on how a computer-based intelligent automatic and accurate cell quantification approach can be designed for spot detection in MRI scans. Intelligent and automatic in vivo detection and quantification of transplanted cells in MRI.
