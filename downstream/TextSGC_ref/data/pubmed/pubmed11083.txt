Currently all solid enhancing renal masses without microscopic fat are considered malignant until proven otherwise and there is substantial overlap in the imaging findings of benign and malignant renal masses particularly between clear cell RCC ccRCC and benign oncocytoma ONC. Radiomics has attracted increased attention for its utility in pre-operative work-up on routine clinical images. Radiomics based approaches have converted medical images into mineable data and identified prognostic imaging signatures that machine learning algorithms can use to construct predictive models by learning the decision boundaries of the underlying data distribution. The TensorFlow framework from Google is a state-of-the-art open-source software library that can be used for training deep learning neural networks for performing machine learning tasks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value and feasibility of a deep learning-based renal lesion classifier using open-source Google TensorFlow Inception in differentiating ccRCC from ONC on routine four-phase MDCT in patients with pathologically confirmed renal masses. Deep learning and radiomics: the utility of Google TensorFlow Inception in classifying clear cell renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma on multiphasic CT.
