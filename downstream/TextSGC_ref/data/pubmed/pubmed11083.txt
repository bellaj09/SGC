Face recognition using a single reference image per subject is challenging above all when referring to a large gallery of subjects. Furthermore the problem hardness seriously increases when the images are acquired in unconstrained conditions. In this paper we address the challenging Single Sample Per Person SSPP problem considering large datasets of images acquired in the wild thus possibly featuring illumination pose face expression partial occlusions and low-resolution hurdles. The proposed technique alternates a sparse dictionary learning technique based on the method of optimal direction and the iterative  0 -norm minimization algorithm called k-LiMapS. It works on robust deep-learned features provided that the image variability is extended by standard augmentation techniques. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method against the hardness introduced above: first we report extensive experiments on the unconstrained LFW dataset when referring to large galleries up to 1680 subjects; second we present experiments on very low-resolution test images up to 8  8 pixels; third tests on the AR dataset are analyzed against specific disguises such as partial occlusions facial expressions and illumination problems. In all the three scenarios our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches adopting similar configurations.
