Nineteen boys aged 8 to 14 with a diagnosis of ADHD and 16 age-matched controls were compared in a virtual reality VR classroom version of a continuous performance task CPT with a second standard CPT presentation using the same projection display dome system. The Virtual Classroom included simulated "real-world" auditory and visual distracters. Parent ratings of attention hyperactivity internalizing problems and adaptive skills on the Behavior Assessment System for Children BASC Monitor for ADHD confirmed that the ADHD children had more problems in these areas than controls. The difference between the ADHD group who performed worse and the control group approached significance p = .05; adjusted p = .02 in the Virtual Classroom presentation and the classification rate of the Virtual Classroom was better than when the standard CPT was used 87.5% versus 68.8%. Children with ADHD were more affected by distractions in the VR classroom than those without ADHD. Results are discussed in relation to distractibility in ADHD.
