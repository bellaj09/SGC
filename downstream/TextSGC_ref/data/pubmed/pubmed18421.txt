Due to the complexity of large production systems maintenance events are diverse simultaneous and dynamic. Appropriate maintenance management of complex large production systems can guarantee high availability and save maintenance costs. However current maintenance decision-making methods mainly focus on the maintenance events of single-components and series connection multi-components; little research pays attention to the combination maintenance of different maintenance events. Therefore this paper proposes a multi-event combination maintenance model based on event correlation. First the maintenance downtime and cost of three types of maintenance events under different maintenance beginning times and degrees are analysed. Then shared maintenance downtime and cost models are established by maintenance event correlations. In addition a multi-event combination maintenance model is constructed to achieve the goal of the highest availability and the lowest cost rate in both the decision-making cycle and the remaining life. Moreover a particle swarm optimization algorithm based on interval segmentation for model solving is designed. Finally a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model.
