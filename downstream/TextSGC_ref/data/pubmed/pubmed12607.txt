"An increasing number of doctor reviews are being generated by patients on the internet. These reviews address a diverse set of topics features including wait time office staff doctors skills and bedside manners. Most previous work on automatic analysis of Web-based customer reviews assumes that 1 product features are described unambiguously by a small number of keywords for example battery for phones and 2 the opinion for each feature has a positive or negative sentiment. However in the domain of doctor reviews this setting is too restrictive: a feature such as visit duration for doctor reviews may be expressed in many ways and does not necessarily have a positive or negative sentiment."
