Image processing technologies and computer-aided diagnosis are medical technologies used to support decision-making processes of radiologists and medical professionals who provide treatment for lung disease. These methods involve using chest X-ray images to diagnose and detect lung lesions but sometimes there are abnormal cases that take some time to occur. This experiment used 5810 images for training and validation with the MobileNet Densenet-121 and Resnet-50 models which are popular networks used to classify the accuracy of images and utilized a rotational technique to adjust the lung disease dataset to support learning with these convolutional neural network models. The results of the convolutional neural network model evaluation showed that Densenet-121 with a state-of-the-art Mish activation function and Nadam-optimized performance. All the rates for accuracy recall precision and F1 measures totaled 98.88%. We then used this model to test 10% of the total images from the non-dataset training and validation. The accuracy rate was 98.97% for the result which provided significant components for the development of a computer-aided diagnosis system to yield the best performance for the detection of lung lesions.
