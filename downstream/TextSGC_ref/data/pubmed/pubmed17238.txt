During recent years blind image quality assessment BIQA has been intensively studied with different machine learning tools. Existing BIQA metrics however do not design for stereoscopic images. We believe this problem can be resolved by separating 3D images and capturing the essential attributes of images via deep neural network. In this paper we propose a blind deep quality evaluator DQE for stereoscopic images denoted by 3D-DQE based on monocular and binocular interactions. The key technical steps in the proposed 3D-DQE are to train two separate 2D deep neural networks 2D-DNNs from 2D monocular images and cyclopean images to model the process of monocular and binocular quality predictions and combine the measured 2D monocular and cyclopean quality scores using different weighting schemes. Experimental results on four public 3D image quality assessment databases demonstrate that in comparison with the existing methods the devised algorithm achieves high consistent alignment with subjective assessment.
