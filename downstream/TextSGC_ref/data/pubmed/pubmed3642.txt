Resting-state and task-based functional connectivity matrices or connectomes are powerful predictors of individual differences in phenotypic measures. However most of the current state-of-the-art algorithms only build predictive models based on a single connectome for each individual. This approach neglects the complementary information contained in connectomes from different sources and reduces prediction performance. In order to combine different task connectomes into a single predictive model in a principled way we propose a novel prediction framework termed multidimensional connectome-based predictive modeling. Two specific algorithms are developed and implemented under this framework. Using two large open-source datasets with multiple tasks-the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort we validate and compare our framework against performing connectome-based predictive modeling CPM on each task connectome independently CPM on a general functional connectivity matrix created by averaging together all task connectomes for an individual and CPM with a nave extension to multiple connectomes where each edge for each task is selected independently. Our framework exhibits superior performance in prediction compared with the other competing methods. We found that different tasks contribute differentially to the final predictive model suggesting that the battery of tasks used in prediction is an important consideration. This work makes two major contributions: First two methods for combining multiple connectomes from different task conditions in one predictive model are demonstrated; Second we show that these models outperform a previously validated single connectome-based predictive model approach. Combining multiple connectomes improves predictive modeling of phenotypic measures.
