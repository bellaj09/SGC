"Path integration refers to a process of integrating information regarding self-motion to estimate ones current position and orientation. Here we reported two experiments designed to investigate whether and if so how human path integration could be influenced by route decision-making and previous experience. Using head-mounted display virtual reality and hallway mazes we asked participants to travel along several hallways and then to directly return to the starting point namely a path completion task. We created an active condition in which the participants had the opportunity to voluntarily select the structure of outbound paths and a passive condition in which they followed the outbound paths chosen by others. Each participant was required to take part in the study on two consecutive days and they performed the task under different in Experiment 1 or the same conditions in Experiment 2 on these two days. The results of both experiments revealed a facilitation effect of route decision-making on the participants performance on the first day. The results also revealed that both their performance and path selection strategies on the second day were subject to their experience obtained from the first day. Collectively these findings suggest that human path integration may be improved by having the opportunity to make decisions on the structure of outbound paths and/or more experience with the task."
