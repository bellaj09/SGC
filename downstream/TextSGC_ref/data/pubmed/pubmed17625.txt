Animals just like humans can freely move. They do so for various important reasons such as finding food and escaping predators. Observing these behaviors can inform us about the underlying cognitive processes. In addition while humans can convey complicated information easily through speaking animals need to move their bodies to communicate. This has prompted many creative solutions by animal neuroscientists to enable studying the brain during movement. In this review we first summarize how animal researchers record from the brain while an animal is moving by describing the most common neural recording techniques in animals and how they were adapted to record during movement. We further discuss the challenge of controlling or monitoring sensory input during free movement. However not only is free movement a necessity to reflect the outcome of certain internal cognitive processes in animals it is also a fascinating field of research since certain crucial behavioral patterns can only be observed and studied during free movement. Therefore in a second part of the review we focus on some key findings in animal research that specifically address the interaction between free movement and brain activity. First focusing on walking as a fundamental form of free movement we discuss how important such intentional movements are for understanding processes as diverse as spatial navigation active sensing and complex motor planning. Second we propose the idea of regarding free movement as the expression of a behavioral state. This view can help to understand the general influence of movement on brain function. Together the technological advancements towards recording from the brain during movement and the scientific questions asked about the brain engaged in movement make animal research highly valuable to research into the human "moving brain".
