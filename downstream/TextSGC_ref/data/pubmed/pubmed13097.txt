Bone age assessment BAA is an essential topic in the clinical practice of evaluating the biological maturity of children. Because the manual method is time-consuming and prone to observer variability it is attractive to develop computer-aided and automated methods for BAA. In this paper we present a fully automatic BAA method. To eliminate noise in a raw X-ray image we start with using U-Net to precisely segment hand mask image from a raw X-ray image. Even though U-Net can perform the segmentation with high precision it needs a bigger annotated dataset. To alleviate the annotation burden we propose to use deep active learning AL to select unlabeled data samples with sufficient information intentionally. These samples are given to Oracle for annotation. After that they are then used for subsequential training. In the beginning only 300 data are manually annotated and then the improved U-Net within the AL framework can robustly segment all the 12611 images in RSNA dataset. The AL segmentation model achieved a Dice score at 0.95 in the annotated testing set. To optimize the learning process we employ six off-the-shell deep Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs with pretrained weights on ImageNet. We use them to extract features of preprocessed hand images with a transfer learning technique. In the end a variety of ensemble regression algorithms are applied to perform BAA. Besides we choose a specific CNN to extract features and explain why we select that CNN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved discrepancy between manual and predicted bone age of about 6.96 and 7.35 months for male and female cohorts respectively on the RSNA dataset. These accuracies are comparable to state-of-the-art performance. Fully Automated Bone Age Assessment on Large-Scale Hand X-Ray Dataset.
