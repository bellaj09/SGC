"This preliminary case report explored the use of hypnosis induced through a 3-dimensional immersive computer-generated virtual reality VR world as a means to control pain and anxiety in a patient with a severe burn injury. On hospitalization Day 40 after reports of uncontrollable pain and anxiety the patient underwent hypnotic induction while immersed in a virtual world and received posthypnotic suggestions for decreased pain and anxiety during subsequent wound-care sessions. The patients pain and anxiety each dropped 40% after VR hypnosis on a Graphic Rating Scale for his Day 41 wound care. Pain dropped similar levels on Day 42 with an audio-only version of the intervention and then returned to baseline without intervention on Day 43." Virtual reality hypnosis: a case report.
