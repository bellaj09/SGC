"Food waste is one of the main problems in our society. This is mainly caused by peoples behaviors and attitudes which influence the whole food chain from production to final consumption. In fact food is generally perceived as a commodity by adults who transmit this behavior to children who in turn do not develop any consciousness about foods source. One way to reduce the problem seems to be by changing consumers attitudes which develop during the early years of childhood. Research has shown that after attending school garden classes childrens food-related behavior changes. Growing crops is not always easy--it cant be done in the domestic space and this lead to a loss of the long term positive effects. This paper presents a project that tries to teach children how to grow their own food indoors and outdoors mixing real and virtual reality connecting something natural like a plant to the Internet of Things or IOT a network of physical objects virtually connected to each other and to the web. The use of sensors related to an app makes this process more fun and useful for educational purposes. The aim of the project is to change childrens attitude towards food increasing their knowledge about production and consumption in order to reduce waste on a long term basis. The research has been developed in collaboration with Cisco NL and MediaLAB Amsterdam. The user testing has been executed with Dutch children in Amsterdam." Grt: A Gardening Sensor Kit for Children.
