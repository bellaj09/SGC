In this paper we introduce a novel hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system that measures electrical brain activity as well as cerebral blood velocity using electroencephalography EEG and functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound fTCD respectively in response to flickering mental rotation MR and flickering word generation WG cognitive tasks as well as a fixation cross that represents the baseline. This work extends our previous approach in which we showed that motor imagery induces simultaneous changes in EEG and fTCD to enable task discrimination; and hence provides a design approach for a hybrid BCI. Here we show that instead of using motor imagery the proposed visual stimulation technique enables the design of an EEG-fTCD based BCI with higher accuracy. Towards optimal visual presentation design for hybrid EEG-fTCD brain-computer interfaces.
