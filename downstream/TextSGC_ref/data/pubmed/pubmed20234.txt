"A brain-computer interface BCI decodes the brain signals representing a desire to do something and transforms those signals into a control command. However only a limited number of mental tasks have been previously investigated and classified. This study aimed to investigate two motor imagery MI commands moving forward and moving backward using a small number of EEG channels to be used in a neurofeedback context. This study also aimed to simulate a BCI and investigate the offline classification between MI movements in forward and backward directions using different features and classification methods. Ten healthy people participated in a two-session 48\u2009min each experiment. This experiment investigated neurofeedback of navigation in a virtual tunnel. Each session consisted of 320 trials where subjects were asked to imagine themselves moving in the tunnel in a forward or backward motion after a randomly presented forward versus backward command on the screen. Three electrodes were mounted bilaterally over the motor cortex. Trials were conducted with feedback. Data from session 1 were analyzed offline to train classifiers and to calculate thresholds for both tasks. These thresholds were used to form control signals that were later used online in session 2 in neurofeedback training to trigger the virtual tunnel to move in the direction requested by the users brain signals. After 96\u2009min of training the online band-power neurofeedback training achieved an average classification of 76% while the offline BCI simulation using power spectral density asymmetrical ratio and AR-modeled band power as features and using LDA and SVM as classifiers achieved an average classification of 80%."
