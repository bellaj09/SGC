Precision health PH applied to autoimmune disease will need paradigm shifts in the use and application of autoantibodies and other biomarkers. For example autoantibodies combined with other multi-analyte "omic" profiles will form the basis of disease prediction allowing for earlier intervention linked to disease prevention strategies as well as earlier effective and personalized interventions for established disease. As medical intervention moves to disease prediction and a model of "intent to PREVENT" diagnostics will include an early symptom/risk-based as opposed to a disease-based approach. Newer diagnostic platforms that utilize emerging megatrends such as deep learning and artificial intelligence and close the gaps in autoantibody diagnostics will benefit from paradigm shifts thereby facilitating the PH agenda.
