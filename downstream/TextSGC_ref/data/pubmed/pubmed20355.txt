As persons with disabilities age progressive declines in health and medical status can challenge the adaptive resources required to maintain functional independence and quality of life 1. These challenges are further compounded by economic factors medication side effects loss of a spouse or caregiver and psychosocial disorders 1-2. With the gradual loss of functional independence and increased reliance on others for transportation access to general medical and rehabilitation care can be jeopardized 2. The combination of these factors when seen in the context of the average increase in lifespan in industrialized societies has lead to a growing crisis that is truly global in proportion. While research indicates that functional motor capacity can be improved maintained or recovered via consistent participation in a motor exercise and rehabilitation regimen 3 independent adherence to such preventative and/or rehabilitative programming outside the clinic setting is notoriously low 1. This state of affairs has produced a compelling and ethical motivation to address the needs of individuals who are aging with disabilities by promoting home-based access to low-cost interactive virtual reality VR systems designed to engage and motivate individuals to participate with "game"-driven physical activities and rehabilitation programming. The creation of such systems could serve to enhance maintain and rehabilitate the sensorimotor processes that are needed to maximize independence and quality of life. This is the theme of the research to be presented at this MMVR workshop. Virtual reality applications for addressing the needs of those aging with disability.
