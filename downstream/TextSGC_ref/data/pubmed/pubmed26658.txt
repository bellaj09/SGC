Brain signals measured over a series of experiments have inherent variability because of different physical and mental conditions among multiple subjects and sessions. Such variability complicates the analysis of data from multiple subjects and sessions in a consistent way and degrades the performance of subject-transfer decoding in a brain-machine interface BMI. To accommodate the variability in brain signals we propose 1 a method for extracting spatial bases or a dictionary shared by multiple subjects by employing a signal-processing technique of dictionary learning modified to compensate for variations between subjects and sessions and 2 an approach to subject-transfer decoding that uses the resting-state activity of a previously unseen target subject as calibration data for compensating for variations eliminating the need for a standard calibration based on task sessions. Applying our methodology to a dataset of electroencephalography EEG recordings during a selective visual-spatial attention task from multiple subjects and sessions where the variability compensation was essential for reducing the redundancy of the dictionary we found that the extracted common brain activities were reasonable in the light of neuroscience knowledge. The applicability to subject-transfer decoding was confirmed by improved performance over existing decoding methods. These results suggest that analyzing multisubject brain activities on common bases by the proposed method enables information sharing across subjects with low-burden resting calibration and is effective for practical use of BMI in variable environments.
