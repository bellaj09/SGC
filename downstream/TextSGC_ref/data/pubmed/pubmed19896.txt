"Purpose The aim of present study was to identify the impact that recent virtual reality training programs used in a variety of fields have had on the ankles static and dynamic senses of balance among subjects with functional ankle instability. Subjects and Methods This study randomly divided research subjects into two groups a strengthening exercise group Group I and a balance exercise group Group II with each group consisting of 10 people. A virtual reality program was performed three times a week for four weeks. Exercises from the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus program were applied to each group for twenty minutes along with ten minutes of warming up and wrap-up exercises. Results Group II showed a significant decrease of post-intervention static and dynamic balance overall in the anterior-posterior and mediolateral directions compared with the pre-intervention test results. In comparison of post-intervention static and dynamic balance between Group I and Group II a significant decrease was observed overall. Conclusion Virtual reality programs improved the static balance and dynamic balance of subjects with functional ankle instability. Virtual reality programs can be used more safely and efficiently if they are implemented under appropriate monitoring by a physiotherapist."
