Recovery of voluntary movement is a main rehabilitation goal. Efforts to identify effective upper limb UL interventions after stroke have been unsatisfactory. This study includes personalized impairment-based UL reaching training in virtual reality VR combined with non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance motor learning. The approach is guided by limiting reaching training to the angular zone in which active control is preserved "active control zone" after identification of a "spasticity zone". Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation a-tDCS is used to facilitate activation of the affected hemisphere and enhance inter-hemispheric balance. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of personalized reaching training with and without a-tDCS to increase the range of active elbow control and improve UL function. Personalized upper limb training combined with anodal-tDCS for sensorimotor recovery in spastic hemiparesis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
