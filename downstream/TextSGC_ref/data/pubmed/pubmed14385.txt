Accurate identification of axillary lymph node ALN involvement in patients with early-stage breast cancer is important for determining appropriate axillary treatment options and therefore avoiding unnecessary axillary surgery and complications. Here we report deep learning radiomics DLR of conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography of breast cancer for predicting ALN status preoperatively in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical parameter combined DLR yields the best diagnostic performance in predicting ALN status between disease-free axilla and any axillary metastasis with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC of 0.902 95% confidence interval CI: 0.843 0.961 in the test cohort. This clinical parameter combined DLR can also discriminate between low and heavy metastatic burden of axillary disease with AUC of 0.905 95% CI: 0.814 0.996 in the test cohort. Our study offers a noninvasive imaging biomarker to predict the metastatic extent of ALN for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Deep learning radiomics can predict axillary lymph node status in early-stage breast cancer.
