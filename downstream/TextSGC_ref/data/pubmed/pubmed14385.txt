In order to reduce the potential radiation risk low-dose CT has attracted an increasing attention. However simply lowering the radiation dose will significantly degrade the image quality. In this paper we propose a new noise reduction method for low-dose CT via deep learning without accessing original projection data. A deep convolutional neural network is here used to map low-dose CT images towards its corresponding normal-dose counterparts in a patch-by-patch fashion. Qualitative results demonstrate a great potential of the proposed method on artifact reduction and structure preservation. In terms of the quantitative metrics the proposed method has showed a substantial improvement on PSNR RMSE and SSIM than the competing state-of-art methods. Furthermore the speed of our method is one order of magnitude faster than the iterative reconstruction and patch-based image denoising methods. Low-dose CT via convolutional neural network.
