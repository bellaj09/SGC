Construct validity of virtual laparoscopic simulators for basic laparoscopic skills has been proposed; however it is not yet clear whether the simulators can identify the actual experience of surgeons in more complex procedures such as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This study tested the ability of the Lap Mentor simulator to recognize the experience in advanced laparoscopic procedures and to assess its role in the certification of bariatric surgeons. Can virtual reality simulators be a certification tool for bariatric surgeons?
