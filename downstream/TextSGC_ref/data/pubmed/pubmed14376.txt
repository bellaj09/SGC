"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus STN DBS significantly improves clinical motor symptoms as well as intensive aspects of movement like velocity and amplitude in patients with Parkinsons disease PD. However the effects of bilateral STN DBS on integrative and coordinative aspects of motor control are equivocal. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bilateral STN DBS on integrative and coordinative aspects of movement using a memory-guided sequential reaching task. The primary outcomes were eye and finger velocity and end-point error. We expected that bilateral STN DBS would increase reaching velocity. More importantly we hypothesized that bilateral STN DBS would increase eye and finger end-point error and this would not simply be the result of a speed accuracy trade-off. Ten patients with PD and bilaterally implanted subthalamic stimulators performed a memory-guided sequential reaching task under four stimulator conditions DBS-OFF DBS-LEFT DBS-RIGHT and DBS-BILATERAL over 4\xa0days. DBS-BILATERAL significantly increased eye velocity compared to DBS-OFF DBS-LEFT and DBS-RIGHT. It also increased finger velocity compared to DBS-OFF and DBS-RIGHT. DBS-BILATERAL did not change eye end-point error. The novel finding was that DBS-BILATERAL increased finger end-point error compared to DBS-OFF DBS-LEFT and DBS-RIGHT even after adjusting for differences in velocity. We conclude that bilateral STN DBS may facilitate basal ganglia-cortical networks that underlie intensive aspects of movement like velocity but it may disrupt selective basal ganglia-cortical networks that underlie certain integrative and coordinative aspects of movement such as spatial accuracy." Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus increases pointing error during memory-guided sequential reaching.
