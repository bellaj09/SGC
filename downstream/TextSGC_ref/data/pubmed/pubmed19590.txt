"We describe an experiment that explores the contribution of auditory and other features to the illusion of plausibility in a virtual environment that depicts the performance of a string quartet. Plausibility refers to the component of presence that is the illusion that the perceived events in the virtual environment are really happening. The features studied were: Gaze the musicians ignored the participant the musicians sometimes looked towards and followed the participants movements Sound Spatialization Mono Stereo Spatial Auralization no sound reflections reflections corresponding to a room larger than the one perceived reflections that exactly matched the virtual room and Environment no sound from outside of the room birdsong and wind corresponding to the outside scene. We adopted the methodology based on color matching theory where 20 participants were first able to assess their feeling of plausibility in the environment with each of the four features at their highest setting. Then five times participants started from a low setting on all features and were able to make transitions from one system configuration to another until they matched their original feeling of plausibility. From these transitions a Markov transition matrix was constructed and also probabilities of a match conditional on feature configuration. The results show that Environment and Gaze were individually the most important factors influencing the level of plausibility. The highest probability transitions were to improve Environment and Gaze and then Auralization and Spatialization. We present this work as both a contribution to the methodology of assessing presence without questionnaires and showing how various aspects of a musical performance can influence plausibility."
