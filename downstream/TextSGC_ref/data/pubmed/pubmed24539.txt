"Attention during exercise is known to affect performance; however the attentional demand inherent to virtual reality VR-based exercise is not well understood. We used a dual-task paradigm to compare the attentional demands of VR-based and non-VR-based conventional real-world exercise: 22 non-disabled older adults performed a primary reaching task to virtual and real targets in a counterbalanced block order while verbally responding to an unanticipated auditory tone in one third of the trials. The attentional demand of the primary reaching task was inferred from the voice response time VRT to the auditory tone. Participants engagement level and task experience were also obtained using questionnaires. The virtual target condition was more attention demanding significantly longer VRT than the real target condition. Secondary analyses revealed a significant interaction between engagement level and target condition on attentional demand. For participants who were highly engaged attentional demand was high and independent of target condition. However for those who were less engaged attentional demand was low and depended on target condition i.e. virtual > real. These findings add important knowledge to the growing body of research pertaining to the development and application of technology-enhanced exercise for elders and for rehabilitation purposes."
