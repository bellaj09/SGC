Coordinating this mixed workforce necessitates an approach to governance that is responsive to the opportunities and challenges presented by this diversity. This article discusses some of these opportunities and challenges for LMICs in general and illustrates them through three case studies from different Asian country settings. Governing the mixed health workforce: learning from Asian experiences.
