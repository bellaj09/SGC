Glaucoma is an eye condition which leads to permanent blindness when the disease progresses to an advanced stage. It occurs due to inappropriate intraocular pressure within the eye resulting in damage to the optic nerve. Glaucoma does not exhibit any symptoms in its nascent stage and thus it is important to diagnose early to prevent blindness. Fundus photography is widely used by ophthalmologists to assist in diagnosis of glaucoma and is cost-effective. Computer-aided diagnosis of glaucoma using fundus images: A review.
