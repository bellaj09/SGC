This paper presents a study of metric learning systems on pairwise identity verification including pairwise face verification and pairwise speaker verification respectively. These problems are challenging because the individuals in training and testing are mutually exclusive and also due to the probable setting of limited training data. For such pairwise verification problems we present a general framework of metric learning systems and employ the stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the optimization solution. We have studied both similarity metric learning and distance metric learning systems of either a linear or shallow nonlinear model under both restricted and unrestricted training settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with limited training pairs learning a linear system on similar pairs only is preferable due to its simplicity and superiority i.e. it generally achieves competitive performance on both the labeled faces in the wild face dataset and the NIST speaker dataset. It is also found that a pretrained deep nonlinear model helps to improve the face verification results significantly. Pairwise Identity Verification via Linear Concentrative Metric Learning.
