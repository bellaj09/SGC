"We present a design of a contact lens display which features an array of collimated light-emitting diodes and a contact lens for the augmented reality. By building the infrastructure directly on top of the eye eye is allowed to move or rotate freely without the need of exit pupil expansion nor eye tracking. The resolution of light-emitting diodes is foveated to match with the density of cones on the retina. In this manner the total number of pixels as well as the latency of image processing can be significantly reduced. Based on the simulation the device performance is quantitatively analyzed. For the real image modulation transfer functions is 0.669757 at 30 cycle/degree contrast ratio is 5 and distortion is 10%. For the virtual image the field of view is 82 best angular resolution is 0.38 modulation transfer function is above 0.999999 at 30 cycle/degree contrast ratio is 4988 and distortion is 6%."
