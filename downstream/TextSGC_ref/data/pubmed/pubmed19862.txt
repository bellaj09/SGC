Reducing costs is a pragmatic method for promoting the widespread usage of indoor localization technology. Conventional indoor localization systems ILSs exploit relatively expensive wireless chips to measure received signal strength for positioning. Our work is based on a cheap and widely-used commercial off-the-shelf COTS wireless chip i.e. the Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LE1 which has only several output power levels and proposes a new power level based-ILS called Plils. The localization procedure incorporates two phases: an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase a self-organizing map SOM is utilized for dividing a target area into k subregions wherein their grids in the same subregion have similar fingerprints. In the online localization phase the support vector machine SVM and back propagation BP neural network methods are adopted to identify which subregion a tagged object is located in and calculate its exact location respectively. The reasonable value for k has been discussed as well. Our experiments show that Plils achieves 75 cm accuracy on average and is robust to indoor obstacles.
