"Kymographs are graphical representations of spatial position over time which are often used in biology to visualise the motion of fluorescent particles molecules vesicles or organelles moving along a predictable path. Although in kymographs tracks of individual particles are qualitatively easily distinguished their automated quantitative analysis is much more challenging. Kymographs often exhibit low signal-to-noise-ratios SNRs and available tools that automate their analysis usually require manual supervision. Here we developed KymoButler a Deep Learning-based software to automatically track dynamic processes in kymographs. We demonstrate that KymoButler performs as well as expert manual data analysis on kymographs with complex particle trajectories from a variety of different biological systems. The software was packaged in a web-based one-click application for use by the wider scientific community http://kymobutler.deepmirror.ai. Our approach significantly speeds up data analysis avoids unconscious bias and represents another step towards the widespread adaptation of Machine Learning techniques in biological data analysis."
