The tibial drill-guide angle in anterior cruciate ligament ACL reconstruction influences the tunnel placement and graft-tunnel force and is potentially associated with post-operative tunnel widening. This study aimed to examine the effect of the drill-guide angle on the stress redistribution at the tibial tunnel aperture after anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction. Effect of tibial drill-guide angle on the mechanical environment at bone tunnel aperture after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
