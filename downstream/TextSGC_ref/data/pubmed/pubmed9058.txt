An application of explainable artificial intelligence on medical data is presented. There is an increasing demand in machine learning literature for such explainable models in health-related applications. This work aims to generate explanations on how a Convolutional Neural Network CNN detects tumor tissue in patches extracted from histology whole slide images. This is achieved using the "locally-interpretable model-agnostic explanations" methodology. Two publicly-available convolutional neural networks trained on the Patch Camelyon Benchmark are analyzed. Three common segmentation algorithms are compared for superpixel generation and a fourth simpler parameter-free segmentation algorithm is proposed. The main characteristics of the explanations are discussed as well as the key patterns identified in true positive predictions. The results are compared to medical annotations and literature and suggest that the CNN predictions follow at least some aspects of human expert knowledge.
