Atrial fibrillation AF is one of the most common arrhythmias. The automatic AF detection is of great clinical significance but at the same time it remains a big problem to researchers. In this study a novel deep learning method to detect AF was proposed. For a 10 s length single lead electrocardiogram ECG signal the continuous wavelet transform CWT was used to obtain the wavelet coefficient matrix and then a convolutional neural network CNN with a specific architecture was trained to discriminate the rhythm of the signal. The ECG data in multiple databases were divided into 4 classes according to the rhythm annotation: normal sinus rhythm NSR atrial fibrillation AF other types of arrhythmia except AF OTHER and noise signal NOISE. The method was evaluated using three different wavelet bases. The experiment showed promising results when using a Morlet wavelet with an overall accuracy of 97.56% an average sensitivity of 97.56% an average specificity of 99.19%. Besides the area under curve AUC value is 0.9983 which showed that the proposed method was effective for detecting AF.
