"We propose an approach to represent neuronal network dynamics as a probabilistic graphical model PGM. To construct the PGM we collect time series of neuronal responses produced by the neuronal network and use singular value decomposition to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the time-series data. We then extract dominant patterns from the projections to get pairwise dependency information and create a graphical model for the full network. The outcome model is a functional connectome that captures how stimuli propagate through the network and thus represents causal dependencies between neurons and stimuli. We apply our methodology to a model of the Caenorhabditis elegans somatic nervous system to validate and show an example of our approach. The structure and dynamics of the C. elegans nervous system are well studied and a model that generates neuronal responses is available. The resulting PGM enables us to obtain and verify underlying neuronal pathways for known behavioural scenarios and detect possible pathways for novel scenarios.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution."
