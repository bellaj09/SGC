"Brain-computer interfaces based on steady-state visual evoked potentials are promising communication systems for people with speech and motor disabilities. However reliable SSVEP response requires users attention which degrades over time due to significant eye-fatigue when low-frequency visual stimuli 5-15 Hz are used. Previous studies have shown that eye-fatigue can be reduced using high-frequency flickering stimuli >25 Hz. Here it is quantitatively demonstrated that the performance of a high-frequency SSVEP BCI decreases over time but this amount of decrease can be compensated effectively by using two proposed adaptive algorithms. This leaded to a robust alternative communication system for practical applications. The asynchronous spelling system implemented in this study uses a threshold-based version of LASSO algorithm for frequency recognition. In long online experiments when participants typed a sentence with the BCI system for 16 times accuracy of the system was close to its maximum along the experiment. However regression analysis on typing speed of each sentence demonstrated a significant decrease in all 7 subjects   when thresholds obtained from a calibration test were kept fixed over the experiment. In comparison no significant change in typing speed was observed when the proposed adaptive algorithms were used. The analysis of variances revealed that the average typing speed of the last four sentences when using adaptive relational algorithm 8.7 char/min was significantly higher than the tolerance-based algorithm 8.1 char/min and significantly above 6 char/min when the fixed thresholds were used. Therefore the relational algorithm proposed in this paper could successfully compensate for the effect of fatigue on performance of the SSVEP BCI system."
