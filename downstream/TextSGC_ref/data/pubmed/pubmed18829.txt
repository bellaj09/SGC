Significant efforts have been dedicated to minimizing invasiveness associated with surgical interventions most of which have been possible thanks to the developments in medical imaging surgical navigation visualization and display technologies. Image-guided interventions have promised to dramatically change the way therapies are delivered to many organs. However in spite of the development of many sophisticated technologies over the past two decades other than some isolated examples of successful implementations minimally invasive therapy is far from enjoying the wide acceptance once envisioned. This paper provides a large-scale overview of the state-of-the-art developments identifies several barriers thought to have hampered the wider adoption of image-guided navigation and suggests areas of research that may potentially advance the field. Image-guided interventions and computer-integrated therapy: Quo vadis?
