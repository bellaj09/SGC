One of the most interesting applications of brain computer interfaces BCIs is movement prediction. With the development of invasive recording techniques and decoding algorithms in the past ten years many single neuron-based and electrocorticography ECoG-based studies have been able to decode trajectories of limb movements. As the output variables are continuous in these studies a regression model is commonly used. However the decoding of limb movements is not a pure regression problem because the trajectories can be apparently classified into a motion state and a resting state which result in a binary property overlooked by previous studies. In this paper we propose an algorithm called logistic-weighted regression to make use of the property and apply the algorithm to a BCI system decoding flexion of human fingers from ECoG signals. Our results show that the application of logistic-weighted regression improves decoding performance compared to the application of linear regression or pace regression. The proposed algorithm is also immensely valuable in the other BCIs decoding continuous movements. Logistic-weighted regression improves decoding of finger flexion from electrocorticographic signals.
