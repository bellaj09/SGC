A steady-state visual-evoked potential SSVEP is a brain response to visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies; it has been widely used in electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interface research. However there are few published SSVEP datasets for brain-computer interface. In this study we obtained a new SSVEP dataset based on measurements from 30 participants performed on 2 days; our dataset complements existing SSVEP datasets: i multi-band SSVEP datasets are provided and all 3 possible frequency bands low middle and high were used for SSVEP stimulation; ii multi-day datasets are included; and iii the EEG datasets include simultaneously obtained physiological measurements such as respiration electrocardiography electromyography and head motion accelerator. A multi-day and multi-band dataset for a steady-state visual-evoked potential-based brain-computer interface.
