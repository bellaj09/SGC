Deep learning has proven itself to be able to reduce the scanning time of Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI and to improve the image reconstruction quality since it was introduced into Compressed Sensing MRI CS-MRI. However the requirement of using large high-quality and patient-based datasets for network training procedures is always a challenge in clinical applications. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning based compressed sensing MR image reconstruction method that does not require any pre-training procedure or training dataset thereby largely reducing clinician dependence on patient-based datasets. The proposed method is based on the Deep Image Prior DIP framework and uses a high-resolution reference MR image as the input of the convolutional neural network in order to induce the structural prior in the learning procedure. This reference-driven strategy improves the efficiency and effect of network learning. We then add the k-space data correction step to enforce the consistency of the k-space data with the measurements which further improve the image reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on in vivo MR datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve more accurate reconstruction results from undersampled k-space data.
