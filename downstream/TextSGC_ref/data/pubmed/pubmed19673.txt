The significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall makes preoperative imaging essential when raising a DIEP deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap due to the potential for maximizing operative success reducing intraoperative error and minimizing operative complications. Variability in perforator anatomy makes DIEP flap surgery a suitable candidate for computer and virtual reality bio models. In this context a study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of CTA-guided by VirSSPA application. VirSSPA is a virtual reality tool developed in our Hospital for surgical planning and training. This application allows surgeons to generate the three-dimensional 3D model of the patient. The virtual reality tool VirSSPA in planning DIEP microsurgical breast reconstruction.
