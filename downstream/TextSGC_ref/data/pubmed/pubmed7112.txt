While cardiovascular diseases CVDs are commonly diagnosed by cardiologists via inspecting electrocardiogram ECG waveforms these decisions can be supported by a data-driven approach which may automate this process. An automatic diagnostic approach often employs hand-crafted features extracted from ECG waveforms. These features however do not generalise well challenged by variation in acquisition settings such as sampling rate and mounting points. Existing deep learning DL approaches on the other hand extract features from ECG automatically but require construction of dedicated networks that require huge data and computational resource if trained from scratch. Here we propose an end-to-end trainable cross-domain transfer learning for CVD classification from ECG waveforms by utilising existing vision-based CNN frameworks as feature extractors followed by ECG feature learning layers. Because these frameworks are designed for image inputs we employ a stacked spectrogram representation of multi-lead ECG waveforms as a preprocessing step. We also proposed a fusion of multiple ECG leads using plausible stacking arrangements of the spectrograms to encode their spatial relations. The proposed approach is validated on multiple ECG datasets and competitive performance is achieved. Cardiovascular disease diagnosis using cross-domain transfer learning.
