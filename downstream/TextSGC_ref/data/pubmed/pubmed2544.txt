G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine quinine other sulphonamide-containing medicines and chloroquine which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease COVID-19. We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana a malaria-endemic country.
