"Behet syndrome BS is a variable vessel vasculitis that has pleiotropic manifestations. A 43-year-old male with a previous diagnosis of Crohns disease CD presented with deep venous thrombosis and bilateral superficial femoral artery aneurysms. A diagnosis of BS was made and the patient was treated aggressively with immunosuppressive therapy and bilateral bypass surgery attaining a favourable outcome. CD has many features that overlap with BS and it may be challenging to distinguish between these two conditions as our case illustrates. Nonetheless the combination of venous thrombosis and arterial aneurysms should point the clinician towards a diagnosis of BS." "Behet Syndrome and Crohns Disease: What Are the Differences?"
