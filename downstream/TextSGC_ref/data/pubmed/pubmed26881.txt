Brain machine interfaces BMIs that decode control signals from motor cortex have developed tremendously in the past decade but virtually all rely exclusively on vision to provide feedback. There is now increasing interest in developing an afferent interface to replace natural somatosensation much as the cochlear implant has done for the sense of hearing. Preliminary experiments toward a somatosensory neuroprosthesis have mostly addressed the sense of touch but proprioception the sense of limb position and movement is also critical for the control of movement. However proprioceptive areas of cortex lack the precise somatotopy of tactile areas. We showed previously that there is only a weak tendency for neighboring neurons in area 2 to signal similar directions of hand movement. Consequently stimulation with the relatively large currents used in many studies is likely to activate a rather heterogeneous set of neurons. Multi-electrode stimulation in somatosensory cortex increases probability of detection.
