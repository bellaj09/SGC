Important advances are afoot in the field of neurosurgery-particularly in the realms of deep brain stimulation DBS deep brain manipulation DBM and the newly introduced refinement "closed-loop" deep brain stimulation CLDBS. Use of closed-loop technology will make both DBS and DBM more precise as procedures and will broaden their indications. CLDBS utilizes as feedback a variety of sources of electrophysiological and neurochemical afferent information about the function of the brain structures to be treated or studied. The efferent actions will be either electric i.e. the classic excitatory or inhibitory ones or micro-injection of such things as neural proteins and transmitters neural grafts implants of pluripotent stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells and some variants of gene therapy. The pathologies to be treated beside Parkinson\s disease and movement disorders include repair of neural tissues neurodegenerative pathologies psychiatric and behavioral dysfunctions i.e. schizophrenia in its various guises bipolar disorders obesity anorexia drug addiction and alcoholism. The possibility of using these new modalities to treat a number of cognitive dysfunctions is also under consideration. Because the DBS-CLDBS technology brings about a cross-fertilization between scientific investigation and surgical practice it will also contribute to an enhanced understanding of brain function. Neurosurgery of the future: Deep brain stimulations and manipulations.
