"A majority of studies examining repetitive task practice facilitated by robots for the treatment of upper extremity paresis utilize standardized protocols applied to large groups. This study will describe a virtually simulated robot-based intervention customized to match the goals and clinical presentation of a gentleman with upper extremity hemiparesis secondary to stroke. MP the subject of this case is an 85-year-old man with left hemiparesis secondary to an intracerebral hemorrhage 5 years prior to examination. Outcomes were measured before and after a 1-month period of home therapy and after a 1-month virtually simulated robotic intervention. The intervention was designed to address specific impairments identified during his PT examination. When necessary activities were modified based on MPs response to his first week of treatment. MPs home training program produced a 3-s decline in Wolf Motor Function Test WMFT time and a 5-s improvement in Jebsen Test of Hand Function JTHF time. He demonstrated an additional 35-s improvement in JTHF and an additional 44-s improvement in WMFT subsequent to the robotic training intervention. A 24-h activity measurement and the Hand and Activities of Daily Living scales of the Stroke Impact Scale improved following the robotic intervention. Based on his responses to training we feel that we have established that a customized program of virtually simulated robotically facilitated rehabilitation was feasible and resulted in larger improvements than an intensive home training program in several measurements of upper extremity function in our patient with chronic hemiparesis." Robotic/virtual reality intervention program individualized to meet the specific sensorimotor impairments of an individual patient: a case study.
