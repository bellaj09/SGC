Recent deep learning models have shown remarkable accuracy for the diagnostic classification. However they have limitations in clinical application due to the gap between the training cohorts and real-world data. We aimed to develop a model trained only by normal brain PET data with an unsupervised manner to identify an abnormality in various disorders as imaging data of the clinical routine. Deep learning only by normal brain PET identify unheralded brain anomalies.
