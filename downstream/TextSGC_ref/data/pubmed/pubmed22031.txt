"We show how a combination of virtual reality and robotics can be used to beam a physical representation of a person to a distant location and describe an application of this system in the context of journalism. Full body motion capture data of a person is streamed and mapped in real time onto the limbs of a humanoid robot present at the remote location. A pair of cameras in the robots eyes stream stereoscopic video back to the HMD worn by the visitor and a two-way audio connection allows the visitor to talk to people in the remote destination. By fusing the multisensory data of the visitor with the robot the visitors consciousness is transformed to the robots body. This system was used by a journalist to interview a neuroscientist and a chef 900 miles distant about food for the brain resulting in an article published in the popular press."
