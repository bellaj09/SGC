Mature neocortex adapts to altered sensory input by changing neural activity in cortical circuits. The underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. We used blood oxygen level-dependent BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to show reorganization in somatosensory cortex elicited by altered whisker sensory input. We found that there was rapid expansion followed by retraction of whisker cortical maps. The cellular basis for the reorganization in primary somatosensory cortex was investigated with paired electrophysiological recordings in the periphery of the expanded whisker representation. During map expansion the chance of finding a monosynaptic connection between pairs of pyramidal neurons increased 3-fold. Despite the rapid increase in local excitatory connectivity the average strength and synaptic dynamics did not change which suggests that new excitatory connections rapidly acquire the properties of established excitatory connections. During map retraction entire excitatory connections between pyramidal neurons were lost. In contrast connectivity between pyramidal neurons and fast spiking interneurons was unchanged. Hence the changes in local excitatory connectivity did not occur in all circuits involving pyramidal neurons. Our data show that pyramidal neurons are recruited to and eliminated from local excitatory networks over days. These findings suggest that the local excitatory connectome is dynamic in mature neocortex. Rapid Bidirectional Reorganization of Cortical Microcircuits.
