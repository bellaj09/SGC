A group of 21 autistic children were studied for determining the relationship between the anatomic AC versus functional FC connectivity considering short-range and long-range brain networks. AC was assessed by the DW-MRI technique and FC by EEG coherence calculation in three experimental conditions: basal watching a popular cartoon with audio V-A and with muted audio track VwA. For short-range connections basal records statistical significant correlations were found for all EEG bands in the left hemisphere but no significant correlations were found for fast EEG frequencies in the right hemisphere. For the V-A condition significant correlations were mainly diminished for the left hemisphere; for the right hemisphere no significant correlations were found for the fast EEG frequency bands. For the VwA condition significant correlations for the rapid EEG frequencies mainly disappeared for the right hemisphere. For long-range connections basal records showed similar correlations for both hemispheres. For the right hemisphere significant correlations incremented to all EEG bands for the V-A condition but these significant correlations disappeared for the fast EEG frequencies in the VwA condition. It appears that in a resting-state condition AC is better associated with functional connectivity for short-range connections in the left hemisphere. The V-A experimental condition enriches the AC and FC association for long-range connections in the right hemisphere. This might be related to an effective connectivity improvement due to full video stimulation visual and auditory. An impaired audiovisual interaction in the right hemisphere might explain why significant correlations disappeared for the fast EEG frequencies in the VwA experimental condition.
