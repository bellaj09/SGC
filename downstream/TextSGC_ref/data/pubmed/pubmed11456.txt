As biomedical imaging datasets expand deep neural networks are considered vital for image processing yet community access is still limited by setting up complex computational environments and availability of high-performance computing resources. We address these bottlenecks with CDeep3M a ready-to-use image segmentation solution employing a cloud-based deep convolutional neural network. We benchmark CDeep3M on large and complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging datasets from light X-ray and electron microscopy. CDeep3M-Plug-and-Play cloud-based deep learning for image segmentation.
