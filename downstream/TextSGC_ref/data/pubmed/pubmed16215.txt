"In this article we examine the relationships between supervisor-level factors and abusive supervision. Drawing from social learning theory Bandura 1973 we argue that supervisors history of family aggression indirectly impacts abusive supervision via both hostile cognitions and hostile affect with angry rumination functioning as a first-stage moderator. Using multisource data we tested the proposed relationships in a series of 4 studies each providing evidence of constructive replication. In Study 1 we found positive relationships between supervisors history of family aggression hostile affect explicit hostile cognitions and abusive supervision. We obtained the same pattern of results in Studies 2 3 and 4 using an implicit measure of hostile cognitions and controlling for previously established antecedents of abusive supervision. Angry rumination moderated the indirect relationship between supervisors history of family aggression and abusive supervision via hostile affect only. Overall the results highlight the important role of supervisor-level factors in the abusive supervision dynamics."
