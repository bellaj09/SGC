A central principle for understanding the cerebral cortex is that macroscale anatomy reflects a functional hierarchy from primary to transmodal processing. In contrast the central axis of motor and nonmotor macroscale organization in the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we applied diffusion map embedding to resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project dataset n = 1003 and show for the first time that cerebellar functional regions follow a gradual organization which progresses from primary motor to transmodal DMN task-unfocused regions. A secondary axis extends from task-unfocused to task-focused processing. Further these two principal gradients revealed novel functional properties of the well-established cerebellar double motor representation lobules I-VI and VIII and its relationship with the recently described triple nonmotor representation lobules VI/Crus I Crus II/VIIB IX/X. Functional differences exist not only between the two motor but also between the three nonmotor representations and second motor representation might share functional similarities with third nonmotor representation.
