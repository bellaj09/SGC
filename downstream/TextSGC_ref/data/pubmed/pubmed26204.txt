Recently transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS has attracted increasing attention in the field of neuro-modulation because of its capacity to modulate cortical excitability noninvasively. Previous findings have demonstrated its effectiveness in visual studies. However few studies have referred to steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP a promising visual evoked potential that has been widely used in brain-computer interfaces. The present work investigated the effects of tDCS on SSVEPs. Sham and 1 mA real tDCS anodal and cathodal in a PO7-PO8 montage were administered for 15 min in 12 healthy subjects. Compared with sham conditions both anodal and cathodal tDCS significantly decreased 7-Hz SSVEP power. Also anodal tDCS increased 10-Hz SSVEP power. Our study demonstrated that tDCS over occipital areas altered brain activity evoked by visual stimuli. Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on steady-state visual evoked potentials.
