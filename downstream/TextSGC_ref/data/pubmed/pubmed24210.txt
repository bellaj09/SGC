Assessment of physiological tremor during neurosurgical procedures may provide further insights into the composites of surgical expertise. Virtual reality platforms may provide a mechanism for the quantitative assessment of physiological tremor. In this study a virtual reality simulator providing haptic feedback was used to study physiological tremor in a simulated tumor resection task with participants from a "skilled" group and a "novice" group.
