Falls are a prevalent problem in actual society. Some falls result in injuries and the cost associated with their treatment is high. This is a complex problem that requires several steps in order to be tackled. Firstly it is crucial to develop strategies that recognize the locomotion mode indicating the state of the subject in various situations. This article aims to develop a strategy capable of identifying normal gait the pre-fall condition and the fall situation based on a wearable system IMUs-based. This system was used to collect data from healthy subjects that mimicked falls. The strategy consists essentially in the construction and use of classifiers as tools for recognizing the locomotion modes. Two approaches were explored. Associative Skill Memories ASMs based classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network CNN classifier based on deep learning. Finally these classifiers were compared providing for a tool with a good accuracy in recognizing the locomotion modes. Results have shown that the accuracy of the classifiers was quite acceptable. The CNN presented the best results with 92.71% of accuracy considering the pre-fall step different from normal steps and 100% when not considering. Development of a Strategy to Predict and Detect Falls Using Wearable Sensors.
