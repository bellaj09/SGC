In our current research we examine the application of visuo-haptic augmented reality setups in medical training. To this end highly accurate calibration system stability and low latency are indispensable prerequisites. These are necessary to maintain user immersion and avoid breaks in presence which potentially diminish the training outcome. In this paper we describe the developed calibration methods for visuo-haptic integration the hybrid tracking technique for stable alignment of the augmentation and the distributed framework ensuring low latency and component synchronization. Finally we outline an early prototype system based on the multimodal augmented reality framework. The latter allows colocated visuo-haptic interaction with real and virtual scene components in a simplified open surgery setting. Calibration registration and synchronization for high precision augmented reality haptics.
