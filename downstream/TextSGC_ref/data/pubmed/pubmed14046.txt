Angelman syndrome AS is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by severe learning difficulties ataxia a seizure disorder with a characteristic EEG subtle dysmorphic facial features and a happy sociable disposition. Most children present with delay in developmental milestones and slowing of head growth during the first year of life. In the majority of cases speech does not develop. Patients with AS have a characteristic behavioural phenotype with jerky movements frequent and sometimes inappropriate laughter a love of water and sleep disorder. The facial features are subtle and include a wide smiling mouth prominent chin and deep set eyes. It is caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities involving the chromosome 15q11-13 region which is subject to genomic imprinting. These include maternal deletion paternal uniparental disomy imprinting defects and point mutations or small deletions within the UBE3A gene which lies within this region. UBE3A shows tissue specific imprinting being expressed exclusively from the maternal allele in brain. The genetic mechanisms identified so far in AS are found in 85-90% of those with the clinical phenotype and all interfere with UBE3A expression.
