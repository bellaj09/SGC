"Computer-based training simulators have been used extensively most notably in flight simulation. Over the past 20 years surgical simulators have been developed initially for training of minimally invasive surgery and more recently for open surgical simulation. The key effort in todays surgical simulation field is to develop metrics to evaluate how well the skills learned in a simulator translate to improvement in real surgical skills execution of procedures and team cooperation in the operating room. The American College of Surgeons has begun implementing a phased approach to introduce simulation in training and education for general surgery. The authors believe that a similar training plan should be mandated for plastic surgery to take advantage of the use of computers virtual reality and simulation in the training of plastic surgery residents and to explore the value of this technology for continuing medical education and maintenance of certification. This article gives a brief background and history of surgical simulation and its technology followed by a detailed description of the three phases of the American College of Surgeons plan and how the authors propose that each phase be implemented with modifications as applicable for trainees in plastic surgery." Simulation in plastic surgery training and education: the path forward.
