Virtual reality can help to learn basic laparoscopic tasks. However no haptic feedback which alerts for tissue slippage is provided by most simulators although it might be of influence for the decrease of errors. This study explored whether visual or tactile feedback can be used to alert the surgeon of tissue slippage. Twenty-four participants performed a laparoscopic grasping task and where provided with either visual or tactile feedback about tissue slippage. The reaction time with the visual feedback was compared to the reaction time with tactile feedback signal. The results showed that when tissue slippage is simulated tactile feedback shows significant faster reaction times 269ms than visual feedback signals 398ms. Tactile feedback exceeds visual feedback to display tissue slippage in a laparoscopic grasper.
