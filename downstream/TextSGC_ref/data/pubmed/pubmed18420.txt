Human anatomical specimen museums are commonly used by medical nursing and paramedical students. Through dissection and prosection the specimens housed in these museums allow students to appreciate the complex relationships of organs and structures in more detail than textbooks could provide. However it may be difficult for students particularly novices to identify the various parts of these anatomical structures without additional explanations from a docent or supplemental illustrations. Recently augmented reality AR has been used in many museum exhibits to display virtual objects in videos captured from the real world. This technology can significantly enhance the learning experience. In this study three AR-based support systems for tours in medical specimen museums were developed and their usability and effectiveness for learning were examined. The first system was constructed using an AR marker. This system could display virtual label information for specimens by capturing AR markers using a tablet camera. Individual AR markers were required for all specimens but their presence in and on the prosected specimens could also be obtrusive. The second system was developed to set the specimen image itself as an image marker as most specimens were displayed in cross section. Visitors could then obtain the label information presented by AR without any markers intruding on the display or anatomical specimens. The third system was comprised of a head-mounted display combined with a natural click interface. The system could provide visitors with an environment for the natural manipulation of virtual objects with future scalability. The Use of Augmented Reality Technology in Medical Specimen Museum Tours.
