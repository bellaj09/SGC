Deep learning DL methods have been used increasingly widely such as in the fields of speech and image recognition. However how to design an appropriate DL model to accurately and efficiently classify electroencephalogram EEG signals is still a challenge mainly because EEG signals are characterized by significant differences between two different subjects or vary over time within a single subject non-stability strong randomness low signal-to-noise ratio. SincNet is an efficient classifier for speaker recognition but it has some drawbacks in dealing with EEG signals classification. In this paper we improve and propose a SincNet-based classifier SincNet-R which consists of three convolutional layers and three deep neural network DNN layers. We then make use of SincNet-R to test the classification accuracy and robustness by emotional EEG signals. The comparable results with original SincNet model and other traditional classifiers such as CNN LSTM and SVM show that our proposed SincNet-R model has higher classification accuracy and better algorithm robustness.
