The restricted Boltzmann machine RBM is an essential constituent of deep learning but it is hard to train by using maximum likelihood ML learning which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler KL divergence. Instead contrastive divergence CD learning has been developed as an approximation of ML learning and widely used in practice. To clarify the performance of CD learning in this paper we analytically derive the fixed points where ML and CDn learning rules converge in two types of RBMs: one with Gaussian visible and Gaussian hidden units and the other with Gaussian visible and Bernoulli hidden units. In addition we analyze the stability of the fixed points. As a result we find that the stable points of CDn learning rule coincide with those of ML learning rule in a Gaussian-Gaussian RBM. We also reveal that larger principal components of the input data are extracted at the stable points. Moreover in a Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM we find that both ML and CDn learning can extract independent components at one of stable points. Our analysis demonstrates that the same feature components as those extracted by ML learning are extracted simply by performing CD1 learning. Expanding this study should elucidate the specific solutions obtained by CD learning in other types of RBMs or in deep networks.
