Noninvasive three-dimensional and longitudinal imaging of cerebral blood flow CBF in small animal models and ultimately in humans has implications for fundamental research and clinical applications. It enables the study of phenomena such as brain development and learning and the effects of pathologies with a clear vision for translation to humans. Speckle contrast optical tomography SCOT is an emerging optical method that aims to achieve this goal by directly measuring three-dimensional blood flow maps in deep tissue with a relatively inexpensive and simple system. High-density SCOT is developed to follow CBF changes in response to somatosensory cortex stimulation. Measurements are carried out through the intact skull on the rat brain. SCOT is able to follow individual trials in each brain hemisphere where signal averaging resulted in comparable cortical images to those of functional magnetic resonance images in spatial extent location and depth. Sham stimuli are utilized to demonstrate that the observed response is indeed due to local changes in the brain induced by forepaw stimulation. In developing and demonstrating the method algorithms and analysis methods are developed. The results pave the way for longitudinal nondestructive imaging in preclinical rodent models that can readily be translated to the human brain.
