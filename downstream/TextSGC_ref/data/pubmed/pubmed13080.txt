In developed countries colorectal cancer is the second cause of cancer-related mortality. Chemotherapy is considered a standard treatment for colorectal liver metastases CLM. Among patients who develop CLM the assessment of patient response to chemotherapy is often required to determine the need for second-line chemotherapy and eligibility for surgery. However while FOLFOX-based regimens are typically used for CLM treatment the identification of responsive patients remains elusive. Computer-aided diagnosis systems may provide insight in the classification of liver metastases identified on diagnostic images. In this paper we propose a fully automated framework based on deep convolutional neural networks DCNN which first differentiates treated and untreated lesions to identify new lesions appearing on CT scans followed by a fully connected neural networks to predict from untreated lesions in pre-treatment computed tomography CT for patients with CLM undergoing chemotherapy their response to a FOLFOX with Bevacizumab regimen as first-line of treatment. The ground truth for assessment of treatment response was histopathology-determined tumor regression grade. Our DCNN approach trained on 444 lesions from 202 patients achieved accuracies of 91% for differentiating treated and untreated lesions and 78% for predicting the response to FOLFOX-based chemotherapy regimen. Experimental results showed that our method outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms and may allow for the early detection of non-responsive patients.
