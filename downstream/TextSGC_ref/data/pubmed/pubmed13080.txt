The prognosis of esophageal cancer is relatively poor. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment. Recently artificial intelligence AI using deep learning has made remarkable progress in medicine. However there are no reports on its application for diagnosing esophageal cancer. Here we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Diagnostic outcomes of esophageal cancer by artificial intelligence using convolutional neural networks.
