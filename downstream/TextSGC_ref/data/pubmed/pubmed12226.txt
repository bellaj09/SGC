Due to the recent developments of both hardware and software technologies multimodality medical imaging techniques have been increasingly applied in clinical practice and research studies. Previously the application of multimodality imaging in oncology has been mainly related to combining anatomical and functional imaging to improve diagnostic specificity and/or target definition such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT and single-photon emission CT SPECT/CT. More recently the fusion of various images such as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging MRI sequences different PET tracer images PET/MRI has become more prevalent which has enabled more comprehensive characterization of the tumor phenotype. In order to take advantage of these valuable multimodal data for clinical decision making using radiomics we present two ways to implement the multimodal image analysis namely radiomic handcrafted feature based and deep learning machine learned feature based methods. Applying advanced machine deep learning algorithms across multimodality images have shown better results compared with single modality modeling for prognostic and/or prediction of clinical outcomes. This holds great potentials for providing more personalized treatment for patients and achieve better outcomes. Machine learning for radiomics-based multimodality and multiparametric modeling.
