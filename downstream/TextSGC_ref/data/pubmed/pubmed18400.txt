This study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the embodied metaphor "breaking the rules" and how it affects creativity by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. To embody the metaphor "breaking the rules" we created a circumstance in which participants can experience "breaking the walls" through virtual reality VR technology. Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: the "break-wall" condition where they broke the walls to move forward; the "auto-wall" condition where the barrier wall opened automatically; and the "no-wall" condition where no barrier walls appeared. While walking in the virtual scenes participants were asked to solve a creativity-demanding problem and to wear the fNIRS device to record their neural activities. It was found that participants showed better creative performance in the "break-wall" condition than in the other conditions. Weaker activations were found in the frontopolar cortex the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the somatosensory association cortex under the "break-wall" condition which may be associated with rule-breaking behaviors creative performance and sense of embodiment. These findings may indicate that physical actions of "breaking the wall" activate the conceptual metaphor of "breaking the rules" which triggers brain activities related to rule-breaking thus affecting creative performance. How does the embodied metaphor affect creative thinking?
