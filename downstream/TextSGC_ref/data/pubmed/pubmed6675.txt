The mainstream method used for the analysis of task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI data is to obtain task-related active brain regions based on generalized linear models. Machine learning as a data-driven technical method is increasingly used in fMRI data analysis. The language task data including math task and story task of the Human Connectome Project HCP was used in this work. We chose a linear support vector machine as a classifier to classify math and story tasks and compared them with the activated brain regions of a SPM statistical analysis. As a result 13 of the 25 regions used for classification in SVM were activated regions and 12 were non-activated regions. In particular the right Paracentral Lobule and right Rolandic Operculum which belong to non-activated regions contributed most to the classification. Therefore the differences found in machine learning can provide a new understanding of the physiological mechanisms of brain regions under different tasks.
