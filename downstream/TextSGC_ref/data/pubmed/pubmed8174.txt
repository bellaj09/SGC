White matter damage is an important consequence of traumatic brain injury TBI in humans. Unlike rodents ferrets have a substantial amount of white matter and a gyrencephalic brain; therefore they may represent an ideal small mammal model to study human-pertinent consequences of TBI. Here we report immunohistochemical and behavioral results after a controlled cortical impact CCI injury to the sensorimotor cortex of adult male ferrets. We assessed inflammation in the neocortex and white matter and behavior at 1 day post injury and 1 4 and 16 weeks post injury WPI. CCI in the ferret produced inflammation that originated in the neocortex near the site of the injury and progressed deep into the white matter with time. The density of microglia and astrocytes increased in the neocortex near the injury peaking at 4WPI and remaining elevated at 16WPI. Microglial morphology in the neocortex was significantly altered in the first 4 weeks but showed a return toward normal at 16 weeks. Clusters of microglial cells in the white matter persisted until 16WPI. We assessed motor and cognitive behavior using the open field novel object recognition T-maze and gait tests. A transient deficit in memory occurred at 4WPI with a reduction of rearing and motor ability at 12 and 16WPI. Behavioral impairments coincide with features of the inflammatory changes in the neocortex revealed by immunohistochemistry. The ferret represents an important animal model to explore ongoing damage in the white matter and cerebral cortex after TBI.
