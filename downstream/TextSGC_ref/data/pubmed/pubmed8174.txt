Artificial Intelligence AI applications have already invaded our everyday life and the last 10 years have seen the emergence of very promising applications in the field of medicine. However the literature dealing with the potential applications of IA in Orthognathic Surgery is remarkably poor to date. Yet it is very likely that due to its amazing power in image recognition AI will find tremendous applications in dento-facial deformities recognition in a near future. In this article we point out the state-of-the-art AI applications in medicine and its potential applications in the field of orthognathic surgery. AI is a very powerful tool and it is the responsibility of the entire medical profession to achieve a positive symbiosis between clinical sense and AI. Artificial Intelligence: Applications in orthognathic surgery.
