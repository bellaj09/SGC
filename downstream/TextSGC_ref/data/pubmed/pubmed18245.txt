This review aims to provide a framework for evaluating the utility of virtual reality VR as a distraction intervention to alleviate pain and distress during medical procedures. We first describe the theoretical bases underlying the VR analgesic and anxiolytic effects and define the main factors contributing to its efficacy which largely emerged from studies on healthy volunteers. Then we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials using VR distraction during different medical procedures such as burn injury treatments chemotherapy surgery dental treatment and other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
