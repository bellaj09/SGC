"Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the effects of virtual reality-based balance training on balance of the elderly. Methods The subjects were 32 healthy elderly people aged between 65 and 80 who were divided into a VR virtual reality training group n=17 and a control group n=15. The VR training group engaged in a 30-minute exercise session using Wii Fit three times a week for eight weeks while the control group received no intervention. The balance of the two groups was measured before and after the intervention. Results According to the Romberg Test conducted to examine the effects of the training on balance both the area covered by the bodys center of pressure movement and movement distances per unit area of the bodys center of pressure envelope significantly decreased in the VR training group. Moreover the two groups showed significant differences in balance. Conclusion Virtual reality training is effective at improving the balance of the healthy elderly. Thus virtual reality training can be proposed as a form of fall prevention exercise for the elderly." The Effects of Virtual Reality-based Balance Training on Balance of the Elderly.
