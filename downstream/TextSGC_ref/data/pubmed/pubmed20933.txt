"Brain damage is a major cause of disability that often leads to deficits in Executive Functions EF with dramatic consequences on activities of daily living. While rehabilitation approaches of the dysexecutive syndrome are still limited Virtual Reality VR has shown its potential to propose innovative intervention strategies based on ecologically valid functional tasks. The purpose of this paper is to present the design process of the Therapeutic Virtual Kitchen TVK in which ecological and adaptable virtual tasks may be configured by the therapists for patients assessment and rehabilitation. The outcomes of a preliminary test of feasibility among members of our laboratory and Kerpape Rehabilitation Center are reported and discussed."
