In this paper a new brain computer interface BCI speller named DTU BCI speller is introduced. It is based on the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP and features dictionary support. The system focuses on simplicity and user friendliness by using a single electrode for the signal acquisition and displays stimuli on a liquid crystal display LCD. Nine healthy subjects participated in writing full sentences after a five minutes introduction to the system and obtained an information transfer rate ITR of 21.94  15.63 bits/min. The average amount of characters written per minute CPM is 4.90  3.84 with a best case of 8.74 CPM. All subjects reported systematically on different user friendliness measures and the overall results indicated the potentials of the DTU BCI Speller system. For subjects with high classification accuracies the introduced dictionary approach greatly reduced the time it took to write full sentences. DTU BCI speller: an SSVEP-based spelling system with dictionary support.
