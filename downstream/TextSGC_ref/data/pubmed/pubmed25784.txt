"Interventional video tomography IVT a new imaging modality achieves virtual visualization of anatomic structures in three dimensions for intraoperative stereotactic navigation. Partial immersion into a virtual data space which is orthotopically coregistered to the surgical field enhances by means of a see-through head-mounted display HMD the surgeons visual perception and technique by providing visual access to nonvisual data of anatomy physiology and function. The presented cases document the potential of augmented reality environments in maxillofacial surgery." Image-guided surgery.
