Standard animal behavior paradigms incompletely mimic nature and thus limit our understanding of behavior and brain function. Virtual reality VR can help but it poses challenges. Typical VR systems require movement restrictions but disrupt sensorimotor experience causing neuronal and behavioral alterations. We report the development of FreemoVR a VR system for freely moving animals. We validate immersive VR for mice flies and zebrafish. FreemoVR allows instant disruption-free environmental reconfigurations and interactions between real organisms and computer-controlled agents. Using the FreemoVR platform we established a height-aversion assay in mice and studied visuomotor effects in Drosophila and zebrafish. Furthermore by photorealistically mimicking zebrafish we discovered that effective social influence depends on a prospective leader balancing its internally preferred directional choice with social interaction. FreemoVR technology facilitates detailed investigations into neural function and behavior through the precise manipulation of sensorimotor feedback loops in unrestrained animals.
