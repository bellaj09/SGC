There has been a great deal of recent interest in human models of contextual fear learning particularly due to the use of such paradigms for investigating neural mechanisms related to the etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. However the construct of "context" in fear conditioning research is broad and the operational definitions and methods used to investigate contextual fear learning in humans are wide ranging and lack specificity making it difficult to interpret findings about neural activity. Here we will review neuroimaging studies of contextual fear acquisition in humans. We will discuss the methodology associated with four broad categories of how contextual fear learning is manipulated in imaging studies colored backgrounds static picture backgrounds virtual reality and configural stimuli and highlight findings for the primary neural circuitry involved in each paradigm. Additionally we will offer methodological recommendations for human studies of contextual fear acquisition including using stimuli that distinguish configural learning from discrete cue associations and clarifying how context is experimentally operationalized.
