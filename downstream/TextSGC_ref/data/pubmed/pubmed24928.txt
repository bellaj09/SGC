We present a case of urinary tuberculosis investigated initially by ultrasound and multidetector computed tomography MDCT. The MDCT-derived volumetric data were used to generate virtual cystoscopy VC images which revealed a bladder ulcer. The presence of this ulcer was confirmed by conventional cystoscopy-guided biopsy and there was good agreement regarding various features of the ulcer such as the site size and shape as detected by virtual and conventional cystoscopies. VC a result of simple postprocessing of preacquired MDCT data proved valuable in the characterization of the bladder lesion in conjunction with CT and ultrasound images. Although a larger study is warranted in our case these en face VC representations of the ulcer served as useful precursors to conventional cystoscopic biopsy. Virtual cystoscopy: reality in imaging of bladder tuberculosis.
