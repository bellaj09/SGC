We present the first purely event-based energy-efficient approach for dynamic object detection and categorization with a freely moving event camera. Compared to traditional cameras event-based object recognition systems are considerably behind in terms of accuracy and algorithmic maturity. To this end this paper presents an event-based feature extraction method devised by accumulating local activity across the image frame and then applying principal component analysis PCA to the normalized neighborhood region. Subsequently we propose a backtracking-free k-d tree mechanism for efficient feature matching by taking advantage of the low-dimensionality of the feature representation. Additionally the proposed k-d tree mechanism allows for feature selection to obtain a lower-dimensional object representation when hardware resources are limited to implement PCA. Consequently the proposed system can be realized on a field-programmable gate array FPGA device leading to high performance over resource ratio. The proposed system is tested on real-world event-based datasets for object categorization showing superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally we verified the real-time FPGA performance of the proposed object detection method trained with limited data as opposed to deep learning methods under a closed-loop aerial vehicle flight mode. We also compare the proposed object categorization framework to pre-trained convolutional neural networks using transfer learning and highlight the drawbacks of using frame-based sensors under dynamic camera motion. Finally we provide critical insights about the feature extraction method and the classification parameters on the system performance which aids in understanding the framework to suit various low-power less than a few watts application scenarios.
