"The ability to combine physiology and engineering analyses with computer sciences has opened the door to the possibility of creating the Virtual Human reality. This paper presents a broad foundation for a full-featured biomechanical simulator for the human musculoskeletal system physiology. This simulation technology unites the expertise in biomechanical analysis and graphic modeling to investigate joint and connective tissue mechanics at the structural level and to visualize the results in both static and animated forms together with the model. Adaptable anatomical models including prosthetic implants and fracture fixation devices and a robust computational infrastructure for static kinematic kinetic and stress analyses under varying boundary and loading conditions are incorporated on a common platform the VIMS Virtual Interactive Musculoskeletal System. Within this software system a manageable database containing long bone dimensions connective tissue material properties and a library of skeletal joint system functional activities and loading conditions are also available and they can easily be modified updated and expanded. Application software is also available to allow end-users to perform biomechanical analyses interactively. This paper details the design capabilities and features of the VIMS development at Johns Hopkins University an effort possible only through academic and commercial collaborations. Examples using these models and the computational algorithms in a virtual laboratory environment are used to demonstrate the utility of this unique database and simulation technology. This integrated system will impact on medical education basic research device development and application and clinical patient care related to musculoskeletal diseases trauma and rehabilitation."
