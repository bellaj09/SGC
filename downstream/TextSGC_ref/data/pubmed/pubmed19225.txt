"Telepresence" is an interesting field that includes virtual reality implementations with human-system interfaces communication technologies and robotics. This paper describes the development of a telepresence robot called Telepresence Robot for Interpersonal Communication TRIC for the purpose of interpersonal communication with the elderly in a home environment. The main aim behind TRIC\s development is to allow elderly populations to remain in their home environments while loved ones and caregivers are able to maintain a higher level of communication and monitoring than via traditional methods. TRIC aims to be a low-cost lightweight robot which can be easily implemented in the home environment. Under this goal decisions on the design elements included are discussed. In particular the implementation of key autonomous behaviors in TRIC to increase the user\s capability of projection of self and operation of the telepresence robot in addition to increasing the interactive capability of the participant as a dialogist are emphasized. The technical development and integration of the modules in TRIC as well as human factors considerations are then described. Preliminary functional tests show that new users were able to effectively navigate TRIC and easily locate visual targets. Finally the future developments of TRIC especially the possibility of using TRIC for home tele-health monitoring and tele-homecare visits are discussed.
