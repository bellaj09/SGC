We examined whether altered connectivity in functional networks during working memory performance persists following conclusion of that performance into a subsequent resting state. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI in 50 young adults during an initial resting state followed by an N-back working memory task and a subsequent resting state in order to examine changes in functional connectivity within and between the default-mode network DMN and the task-positive network TPN across the three states. We found that alterations in connectivity observed during the N-back task persisted into the subsequent resting state within the TPN and between the DMN and TPN but not within the DMN. Further both speed of working memory performance and TPN connectivity strength during the N-back task predicted connectivity strength in the subsequent resting state. Finally DMN connectivity measured before and during the N-back task predicted individual differences in self-reported inattentiveness but this association was not found during the post-task resting state. Together these findings have important implications for models of how the brain recovers following effortful cognition as well as for experimental designs using resting and task scans. Working memory-related changes in functional connectivity persist beyond task disengagement.
