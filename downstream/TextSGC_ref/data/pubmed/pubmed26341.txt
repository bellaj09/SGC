Brain-computer interface BCI systems provide an alternative communication and control approach for people with limited motor function. Therefore the feature extraction and classification approach should differentiate the relative unusual state of motion intention from a common resting state. In this paper we sought a novel approach for multi-class classification in BCI applications. We collected electroencephalographic EEG signals registered by electrodes placed over the scalp during left hand motor imagery right hand motor imagery and resting state for ten healthy human subjects. We proposed using the Kolmogorov complexity Kc for feature extraction and a multi-class Adaboost classifier with extreme learning machine as base classifier for classification in order to classify the three-class EEG samples. An average classification accuracy of 79.5% was obtained for ten subjects which greatly outperformed commonly used approaches. Thus it is concluded that the proposed method could improve the performance for classification of motor imagery tasks for multi-class samples. It could be applied in further studies to generate the control commands to initiate the movement of a robotic exoskeleton or orthosis which finally facilitates the rehabilitation of disabled people.
