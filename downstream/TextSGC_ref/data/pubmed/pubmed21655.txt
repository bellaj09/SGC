We demonstrate a novel phase-only modulation mode based on the pre-transitional effect of the antiferroelectric liquid crystal. 2 phase modulation without changing the polarization state of the incident light is achieved with a low field 1.8\xa0V/m. This phase modulation mode also shows an ultrafast response time less than 300\xa0s and a uniform optical texture with an easy fabrication process. This phase modulator can be applied to laser beam steering virtual reality and holograms etc. in the future.
