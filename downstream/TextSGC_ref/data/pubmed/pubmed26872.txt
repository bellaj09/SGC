"The emergence of mobile electroencephalogram EEG platforms have expanded the use cases of brain-computer interfaces BCIs from laboratory-oriented experiments to our daily life. In challenging situations where humans natural behaviors such as head movements are unrestrained various artifacts could deteriorate the performance of BCI applications. This paper explored the effect of muscular artifacts generated by participants head movements on the signal characteristics and classification performance of steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs." Robustness analysis of decoding SSVEPs in humans with head movements using a moving visual flicker.
