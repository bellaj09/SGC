Purpose We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a community-based virtual reality treadmill training CVRTT program on static balance abilities in patients with stroke. Subjects and Methods Patients n = 20 who suffered a stroke at least 6 months prior to the study were recruited. All subjects underwent conventional physical therapy for 60\u2005min/day 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Additionally the CVRTT group underwent community-based virtual reality scene exposure combined with treadmill training for 30\u2005min/day 3 days/week for 4 weeks whereas the control group underwent conventional physical therapy including muscle strengthening balance training and indoor and outdoor gait training for 30\u2005min/day 3 days/week for 4 weeks. Outcome measurements included the anteroposterior mediolateral and total postural sway path lengths and speed which were recorded using the Balancia Software on a Wii Fit balance board. Results The postural sway speed and anteroposterior and total postural sway path lengths were significantly decreased in the CVRTT group. Overall the CVRTT group showed significantly greater improvement than the control group. Conclusions The present study results can be used to support the use of CVRTT for effectively improving balance in stroke patients. Moreover we determined that a CVRTT program for stroke patients is both feasible and suitable.
