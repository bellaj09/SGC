"Digitization of glass slides and delivery of so-called virtual slides VS emulating a real microscope over the Internet have become reality due to recent improvements in technology. We have implemented a virtual microscope for instruction of medical students and for continuing medical education. Up to 30000 images per slide are captured using a microscope with an automated stage. The images are post-processed and then served by a plain hypertext transfer protocol http-server. A virtual slide client vMic based on Macromedias Flash MX a highly accepted technology available on every modern Web browser has been developed. All necessary virtual slide parameters are stored in an XML file together with the image. Evaluation of the courses by questionnaire indicated that most students and many but not all pathologists regard virtual slides as an adequate replacement for traditional slides. All our virtual slides are publicly accessible over the World Wide Web WWW at http://vmic.unibas.ch . Recently several commercially available virtual slide acquisition systems VSAS have been developed that use various technologies to acquire and distribute virtual slides. These systems differ in speed image quality compatibility viewer functionalities and price. This paper gives an overview of the factors to keep in mind when introducing virtual microscopy."
