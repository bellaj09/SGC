Action potentials and local field potentials LFPs recorded in primary motor cortex contain information about the direction of movement. LFPs are assumed to be more robust to signal instabilities than action potentials which makes LFPs along with action potentials a promising signal source for brain-computer interface applications. Still relatively little research has directly compared the utility of LFPs to action potentials in decoding movement direction in human motor cortex. Reliability of directional information in unsorted spikes and local field potentials recorded in human motor cortex.
