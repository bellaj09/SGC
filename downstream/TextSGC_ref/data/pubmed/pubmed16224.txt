The levels of processing paradigm has been a powerful research framework in the study of memory for close to a quarter century. However an objective index of depth of processing is still lacking. Two experiments using lists of words presented to male subjects wee performed to compare the effects of depth of processing rate of presentation and task incentive on recognition memory performance self-reported workload and cardiovascular responding. Memory performance results from the two experiments demonstrated higher recognition levels associated with deeper processing and slower presentation rates. Deeply encoded items were associated with faster recognition latencies. Self-reported workload levels were higher for deeper processing and faster presentation rates. Cardiovascular responses were generally amplified with the addition of a task incentive. Increased blood pressure was associated with faster presentation rates. Increased heart rate and decreased T-wave amplitude i.e. increased sympathetic activity were uniquely associated with the deep encoding of information presented at the fastest rate. This particular encoding condition was associated with increased recognition levels. Deeply encoded items were associated with increased suppression of heart rate variability during recognition. This combination of behavioral and cardiovascular measures may provide the basis for an objective index of depth of processing.
