Segmentation of the left ventricle LV from three-dimensional echocardiography 3DE plays a key role in the clinical diagnosis of the LV function. In this work we proposed a new automatic method for the segmentation of LV based on the fully convolutional networks FCN and deformable model. This method implemented a coarse-to-fine framework. Firstly a new deep fusion network based on feature fusion and transfer learning combining the residual modules was proposed to achieve coarse segmentation of LV on 3DE. Secondly we proposed a method of geometrical model initialization for a deformable model based on the results of coarse segmentation. Thirdly the deformable model was implemented to further optimize the segmentation results with a regularization item to avoid the leakage between left atria and left ventricle to achieve the goal of fine segmentation of LV. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging CETUS benchmark in the segmentation accuracy and has a potential for practical applications.
