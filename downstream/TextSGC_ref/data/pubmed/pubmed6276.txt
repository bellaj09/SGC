"A number of studies have indicated that disorders of consciousness result from multifocal injuries as well as from the impaired functional and anatomical connectivity between various anterior forebrain regions. However the specific causal mechanism linking these regions remains unclear. In this study we used spectral dynamic causal modeling to assess how the effective connections ECs between various regions differ between individuals. Next we used connectome-based predictive modeling to evaluate the performance of the ECs in predicting the clinical scores of DOC patients. We found increased ECs from the striatum to the globus pallidus as well as from the globus pallidus to the posterior cingulate cortex and decreased ECs from the globus pallidus to the thalamus and from the medial prefrontal cortex to the striatum in DOC patients as compared to healthy controls. Prediction of the patients outcome was effective using the negative ECs as features. In summary the present study highlights a key role of the thalamo-basal ganglia-cortical loop in DOCs and supports the anterior forebrain mesocircuit hypothesis. Furthermore EC could be potentially used to assess the consciousness level." Abnormal Effective Connectivity of the Anterior Forebrain Regions in Disorders of Consciousness.
