Dual-energy chest radiography DECR is a medical imaging technology that can improve diagnostic accuracy. This technique can decompose single-energy chest radiography SECR images into separate bone- and soft tissue-only images. This can however double the radiation exposure to the patient. To address this limitation we developed an algorithm for the synthesis of DECR from a SECR through deep learning. To predict high resolution images we developed a novel deep learning architecture by modifying a conventional U-net to take advantage of the high frequency-dominant information that propagates from the encoding part to the decoding part. In addition we used the anticorrelated relationship ACR of DECR for improving the quality of the predicted images. For training data 300 pairs of SECR and their corresponding DECR images were used. To test the trained model 50 DECR images from Yonsei University Severance Hospital and 662 publicly accessible SECRs were used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we compared DECR and predicted images using a structural similarity approach SSIM. In addition we quantitatively evaluated image quality calculating the modulation transfer function and coefficient of variation. The proposed model selectively predicted the bone- and soft tissue-only CR images from an SECR image. The strategy for improving the spatial resolution by ACR was effective. Quantitative evaluation showed that the proposed method with ACR showed relatively high SSIM over 0.85. In addition predicted images with the proposed ACR model achieved better image quality measures than those of U-net. In conclusion the proposed method can obtain high-quality bone- and soft tissue-only CR images without the need for additional hardware for double x-ray exposures in clinical practice.
