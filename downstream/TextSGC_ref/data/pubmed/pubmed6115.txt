Inspired by recent advances in deep learning we propose a framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of 2-D cardiac magnetic resonance MR images from undersampled data using a deep cascade of convolutional neural networks CNNs to accelerate the data acquisition process. In particular we address the case where data are acquired using aggressive Cartesian undersampling. First we show that when each 2-D image frame is reconstructed independently the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2-D compressed sensing approaches such as dictionary learning-based MR image reconstruction in terms of reconstruction error and reconstruction speed. Second when reconstructing the frames of the sequences jointly we demonstrate that CNNs can learn spatio-temporal correlations efficiently by combining convolution and data sharing approaches. We show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is capable of preserving anatomical structure more faithfully up to 11-fold undersampling. Moreover reconstruction is very fast: each complete dynamic sequence can be reconstructed in less than 10 s and for the 2-D case each image frame can be reconstructed in 23 ms enabling real-time applications.
