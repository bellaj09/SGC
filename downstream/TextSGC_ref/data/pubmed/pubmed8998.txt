"In this article we present a complete automated system for spotting a particular slice in a complete 3D Computed Tomography exam CT scan. Our approach does not require any assumptions on which part of the patients body is covered by the scan. It relies on an original machine learning regression approach. Our models are learned using the transfer learning trick by exploiting deep architectures that have been pre-trained on imageNet database and therefore it requires very little annotation for its training. The whole pipeline consists of three steps: i conversion of the CT scans into Maximum Intensity Projection MIP images ii prediction from a Convolutional Neural Network CNN applied in a sliding window fashion over the MIP image and iii robust analysis of the prediction sequence to predict the height of the desired slice within the whole CT scan. Our approach is applied to the detection of the third lumbar vertebra L3 slice that has been found to be representative to the whole body composition. Our system is evaluated on a database collected in our clinical center containing 642 CT scans from different patients. We obtained an average localization error of 1.912.69 slices less than 5\xa0mm in an average time of less than 2.5\xa0s/CT scan allowing integration of the proposed system into daily clinical routines."
