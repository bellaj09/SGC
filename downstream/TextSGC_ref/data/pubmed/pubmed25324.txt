Contamination of the electroencephalogram EEG by artifacts greatly reduces the quality of the recorded signals. There is a need for automated artifact removal methods. However such methods are rarely evaluated against one another via rigorous criteria with results often presented based upon visual inspection alone. This work presents a comparative study of automatic methods for removing blink electrocardiographic and electromyographic artifacts from the EEG. Three methods are considered; wavelet blind source separation BSS and multivariate singular spectrum analysis MSSA-based correction. These are applied to data sets containing mixtures of artifacts. Metrics are devised to measure the performance of each method. The BSS method is seen to be the best approach for artifacts of high signal to noise ratio SNR. By contrast MSSA performs well at low SNRs but at the expense of a large number of false positive corrections. Automated artifact removal from the electroencephalogram: a comparative study.
