Protein secondary structure prediction can provide important information for protein 3D structure prediction and protein functions. Deep learning offers a new opportunity to significantly improve prediction accuracy. In this article a new deep neural network architecture named the Deep inception-inside-inception Deep3I network is proposed for protein secondary structure prediction and implemented as a software tool MUFOLD-SS. The input to MUFOLD-SS is a carefully designed feature matrix corresponding to the primary amino acid sequence of a protein which consists of a rich set of information derived from individual amino acid as well as the context of the protein sequence. Specifically the feature matrix is a composition of physio-chemical properties of amino acids PSI-BLAST profile and HHBlits profile. MUFOLD-SS is composed of a sequence of nested inception modules and maps the input matrix to either eight states or three states of secondary structures. The architecture of MUFOLD-SS enables effective processing of local and global interactions between amino acids in making accurate prediction. In extensive experiments on multiple datasets MUFOLD-SS outperformed the best existing methods and other deep neural networks significantly.
