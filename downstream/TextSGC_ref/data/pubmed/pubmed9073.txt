Electrocardiogram ECG delineation is a process to detect multiple characteristic points which contain critical diagnostic information about cardiac diseases. We treat the ECG delineation task as an one-dimensional segmentation problem and propose a novel end-to-end deep learning method to segment sections of ECG signal. Our neural network consists of two parts: a segmentation network composed of multiple 1D Convolutional Neural Networks CNN and a postprocessing network composed of a sequential Conditional Random Field CRF. Our method is trained and validated on QT database. The experimental results show that our method yields competitive overall performance compared with other state-of-the-art works and outperform them on onset of the P wave and offset of the T wave.
