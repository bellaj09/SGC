The prospective identification of children likely to develop schizophrenia is a vital tool to support early interventions that can mitigate the risk of progression to clinical psychosis. Electroencephalographic EEG patterns from brain activity and deep learning techniques are valuable resources in achieving this identification. We propose automated techniques that can process raw EEG waveforms to identify children who may have an increased risk of schizophrenia compared to typically developing children. We also analyse abnormal features that remain during developmental follow-up over a period of ~4 years in children with a vulnerability to schizophrenia initially assessed when aged 9 to 12 years. EEG data from participants were captured during the recording of a passive auditory oddball paradigm. We undertake a holistic study to identify brain abnormalities first by exploring traditional machine learning algorithms using classification methods applied to hand-engineered features event-related potential components. Then we compare the performance of these methods with end-to-end deep learning techniques applied to raw data. We demonstrate via average cross-validation performance measures that recurrent deep convolutional neural networks can outperform traditional machine learning methods for sequence modeling. We illustrate the intuitive salient information of the model with the location of the most relevant attributes of a post-stimulus window. This baseline identification system in the area of mental illness supports the evidence of developmental and disease effects in a pre-prodromal phase of psychosis. These results reinforce the benefits of deep learning to support psychiatric classification and neuroscientific research more broadly.
