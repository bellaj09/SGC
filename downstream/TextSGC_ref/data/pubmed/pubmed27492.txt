"Integrating information across sensory systems is a critical step toward building a cohesive representation of the environment and ones body and as illustrated by numerous illusions scaffolds subjective experience of the world and self. In the last years classic principles of multisensory integration elucidated in the subcortex have been translated into the language of statistical inference understood by the neocortical mantle. Most importantly a mechanistic systems-level description of multisensory computations via probabilistic population coding and divisive normalization is actively being put forward. In parallel by describing and understanding bodily illusions researchers have suggested multisensory integration of bodily inputs within the peripersonal space as a key mechanism in bodily self-consciousness. Importantly certain aspects of bodily self-consciousness although still very much a minority have been recently casted under the light of modern computational understandings of multisensory integration. In doing so we argue the field of bodily self-consciousness may borrow mechanistic descriptions regarding the neural implementation of inference computations outlined by the multisensory field. This computational approach leveraged on the understanding of multisensory processes generally promises to advance scientific comprehension regarding one of the most mysterious questions puzzling humankind that is how our brain creates the experience of a self in interaction with the environment." From multisensory integration in peripersonal space to bodily self-consciousness: from statistical regularities to statistical inference.
