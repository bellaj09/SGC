Although virtual reality VR is a promising tool for the investigation of episodic memory phenomena to date there has been relatively little examination of how learning mechanisms operate in VR and how these processes might compare or contrast with learning that occurs in real life. Moreover the existing literature on this topic is spread across several disciplines and uses various distinct apparatuses thus obscuring whether the differences that exist between studies might be due to genuine theoretical discrepancies or may be more simply explained by accounting for methodological variations. The current review is designed to address and elucidate several issues relevant to psychological researchers interested in understanding and/or using this technological approach to study episodic memory phenomena. The principle objectives of the review are as follows: a defining and discussing the various VR systems currently used for research purposes b compiling research of episodic memory effects in VR as they have been studied across several disciplines and c surveying major topics in this body of literature e.g. how virtual immersion has an impact on memory; transfer effects from VR to the real world. The content of this review is designed to serve as a resource for psychologists interested in learning more about the current state of research in this field and is intended to highlight the capabilities and constraints associated with using this technological approach in episodic memory research.
