Deep learning networks have been recently utilized for fault detection and diagnosis FDD due to its effectiveness in handling industrial process data which are often with high nonlinearities and strong correlations. However the valuable information in the raw data may be filtered with the layer-wise feature compression in traditional deep networks. This cannot benefit for the subsequent fine-tuning phase of fault classification. To alleviate this problem an extended deep belief network EDBN is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the raw data in which raw data is combined with the hidden features as inputs to each extended restricted Boltzmann machine ERBM during the pre-training phase. Then a dynamic EDBN-based fault classifier is constructed to take the dynamic characteristics of process data into consideration. Finally to test the performance of the proposed method it is applied to the Tennessee Eastman TE process for fault classification. By comparing EDBN and DBN under different network structures the results show that EDBN has better feature extraction and fault classification performance than traditional DBN.
