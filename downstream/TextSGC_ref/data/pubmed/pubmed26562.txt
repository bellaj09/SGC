"Successful implementation of a brain-computer interface depends critically on the subjects ability to learn how to modulate the neurons controlling the device. However the subjects learning process is probably the least understood aspect of the control loop. How should training be adjusted to facilitate dexterous control of a prosthetic device? An effective training schedule should manipulate the difficulty of the task to provide enough information to guide improvement without overwhelming the subject. In this paper we introduce a bayesian framework for modeling the closed-loop BCI learning process that treats the subject as a bandwidth-limited communication channel. We then develop an adaptive algorithm to find the optimal difficulty-schedule for performance improvement. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm yields faster learning rates than several other heuristic training schedules and provides insight into the factors that might affect the learning process."
