In the context of epilepsy monitoring electroencephalography EEG remains the modality of choice. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is a relatively innovative modality that cannot only characterize hemodynamic profiles of seizures but also allow for long-term recordings. We employ deep learning methods to investigate the benefits of integrating fNIRS measures for seizure detection. We designed a deep recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and subsequently validated it using the CHBMIT scalp EEG database-a compendium of 896\xa0h of surface EEG seizure recordings. After validating our network using EEG fNIRS and multimodal data comprising a corpus of 89 seizures from 40 refractory epileptic patients was used as model input to evaluate the integration of fNIRS measures. Following heuristic hyperparameter optimization multimodal EEG-fNIRS data provide superior performance metrics sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% and 95.5% respectively in a seizure detection task with low generalization errors and loss. False detection rates are generally low with 11.8% and 5.6% for EEG and multimodal data respectively. Employing multimodal neuroimaging particularly EEG-fNIRS in epileptic patients can enhance seizure detection performance. Furthermore the neural network model proposed and characterized herein offers a promising framework for future multimodal investigations in seizure detection and prediction. fNIRS improves seizure detection in multimodal EEG-fNIRS recordings.
