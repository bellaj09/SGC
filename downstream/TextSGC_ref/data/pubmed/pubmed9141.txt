This paper proposes a new discriminative deep quantization hashing DDQH approach for large-scale face image retrieval by learning discriminative and compact binary codes. It jointly explores the discrete code learning batch normalization quantization BNQ module and end-to-end learning in one unified framework which can guarantee the optimal compatibility of hash coding and feature learning. To learn multiscale and robust facial features a deep network properly stacking several convolution-pooling layers and pooling layers is designed and the facial features are obtained by fusing the outputs of the last convolutional layer and the last pooling layer. Besides the prediction errors of the learned binary codes are minimized to learn discriminative binary codes of images. To obtain higher retrieval accuracies a BNQ module is utilized to control quantization at a moderate level. Experiments are conducted on two widely used data sets and the proposed DDQH method achieves encouraging improvements over some state-of-the-art hashing approaches.
