Although several studies have demonstrated that facial-affect recognition impairment is common following moderate-severe traumatic brain injury TBI and that there are diffuse alterations in large-scale functional brain networks in TBI populations little is known about the relationship between the two. Here in a sample of 26 participants with TBI and 20 healthy comparison participants HC we measured facial-affect recognition abilities and resting-state functional connectivity rs-FC using fMRI. We then used network-based statistics to examine A the presence of rs-FC differences between individuals with TBI and HC within the facial-affect processing network and B the association between inter-individual differences in emotion recognition skills and rs-FC within the facial-affect processing network. We found that participants with TBI showed significantly lower rs-FC in a component comprising homotopic and within-hemisphere anterior-posterior connections within the facial-affect processing network. In addition within the TBI group participants with higher emotion-labeling skills showed stronger rs-FC within a network comprised of intra- and inter-hemispheric bilateral connections. Findings indicate that the ability to successfully recognize facial-affect after TBI is related to rs-FC within components of facial-affective networks and provide new evidence that further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying emotion recognition impairment in TBI. Relationship between individual differences in functional connectivity and facial-emotion recognition abilities in adults with traumatic brain injury.
