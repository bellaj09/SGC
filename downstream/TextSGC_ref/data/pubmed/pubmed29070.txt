Feature extraction and classification is a vital part in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface BCI system. Traditional deep learning DL methods usually perform better with more labeled training samples. Unfortunately the labeled samples are usually scarce for electroencephalography EEG data while unlabeled samples are available in large quantity and easy to collect. In addition traditional DL algorithms are notoriously time-consuming for the training process. To address these issues a novel method of hierarchical semi-supervised extreme learning machine HSS-ELM is proposed in this paper and applied for motor imagery MI task classification. Firstly the deep architecture of hierarchical ELM H-ELM approach is employed for feature learning automatically and then these new high-level features are classified using the semi-supervised ELM SS-ELM algorithm which can exploit the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments were conducted on some benchmark datasets and EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods including SVM ELM SAE H-ELM and SS-ELM our HSS-ELM method can achieve better classification accuracy a mean kappa value of 0.7945 and 0.5701 across all subjects in the training and evaluation sessions of BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a respectively. Finally it comes to the conclusion that the proposed method has achieved superior performance for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals.
