The use of emerging virtual reality technology for surgical skill training has recently attracted a lot of attention. Computerized surgical simulators offer a significant potential for providing a realistic and configurable training environment that bridges the gap between basic training and performing the actual interventions on patients. This paper summarizes the current state of this rapidly developing field and analyses the major problems to be addressed in order to make this technology an indispensable tool for routine clinical training and education.
