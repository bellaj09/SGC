"The ability to detect and diagnose neurocognitive disorders at the earliest possible moment is key to a better prognosis for the patient. Two of the earliest indicators of potential neurocognitive problems are motor and visual dysfunction. Motor disorders and problems in visual cognition can be seen in many neurocognitive disorders resulting in abnormal physical reactions to visual stimuli. Analyzing physical behaviors when presented with such stimuli can provide insights into the visual perception and motor abilities of an individual yet there is currently no unbiased objective general-purpose tool that analyzes attention and motor behavior to assess neurocognitive function. We propose a novel method of neurocognitive function assessment that tests the patients cognition using virtual reality with eye tracking and motion analysis. By placing the patient in a controlled virtual environment and analyzing their movements we can evoke certain physical responses from subjects for neurocognitive assessment. We have developed a prototype system that places the subject in a virtual baseball field and captures their full body motion as they try to catch baseballs. This scenario tests the subjects ability to determine the landing time and position of the ball as well as the test subjects balance motor skills attention and memory. Preliminary tests with 20 healthy normal individuals demonstrate the ability of this tool to assess the test subjects balance memory attention and reaction to visual stimuli. This platform has a twofold contribution: it is used to assess several neurocognitive constructs that affect visual and motor capability neutrally and objectively based on controlled stimuli and it enables objective comparison between different neurocognitive disorders research in this field."
