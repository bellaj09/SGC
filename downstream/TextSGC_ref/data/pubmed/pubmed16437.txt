"In the exploration of a persons self-image in the Internet it seems that there is one representing profile. But is it coherent with the real self? Today we are able to perform counseling and therapeutic practices and we can affect and change the human self and mindset in virtual spaces. Using the connection between neuroscience and philosophy we show that there are different types of the self people adopt in cyberspace. By showing how their disposition changes many questions can be answered. What mind state provokes addictive impulses and enables therapy? How does the sense and concept of reality change? Can we transfer the experiences we gain in the virtual into real life? By investigating how the virtual affects us in a positive or negative way support to successful treatment applications are possible. The goal of this study is to find answers for the virtual space usage as a treatment tool and to see what the future holds for such therapeutic tendencies." The similarity between the virtual and the real self--how the virtual self can help the real self.
