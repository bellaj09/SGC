Monte Carlo-based iterative reconstruction to correct for photon scatter and collimator effects has been proven to be superior over analytical correction schemes in single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT/CT but it is currently not commonly used in daily clinical practice due to the long associated reconstruction times. We propose to use a convolutional neural network CNN to upgrade fast filtered back projection FBP image quality so that reconstructions comparable in quality to the Monte Carlo-based reconstruction can be obtained within seconds. Accelerated SPECT image reconstruction with FBP and an image enhancement convolutional neural network.
