Pedagogical strategies have been experimentally applied in large-enrollment biology courses in an attempt to amplify what teachers do best in effecting deep learning thus more closely approximating a one-on-one interaction with students. Carefully orchestrated in-class formative assessments were conducted to provide frequent high-quality feedback that allows students to accurately diagnose the current state of their understanding of fundamental biological concepts and make specific plans to remedy any deficiencies. Teachers can also assume responsibility to guide out-of-class study among classmates by promoting Elaborative Questioning an inquiry exchange that permits misconceptions to be identified and corrected and that promotes long-lasting metacognitive and analytical thinking skills. Data are presented that demonstrate the positive impact of these innovations on student performance and affect. Cloning the professor an alternative to ineffective teaching in a large course.
