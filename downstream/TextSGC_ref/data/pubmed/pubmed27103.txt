Decoding of directional information in the motor cortex traditionally utilizes only firing rate information. However information from other features could be extracted and combined with firing rate in order to increase classification accuracy. This study proposes the combination of firing rate and spike-train synchrony information in the decoding of motor cortical activity. Synchrony measures used are Event Synchronization ES SPIKE-Distance and ISI-Distance. All data used for analyses were obtained from implanted electrode recordings of the primary motor cortex of a monkey that was trained to manipulate a motorized vehicle with 4 degrees of freedom left right front and stop via joystick control. Firstly synchrony features could decode time periods which were otherwise incorrectly decoded by firing rate alone above chance levels. Secondly using an ensemble classifier design for offline analysis combining firing rate and ISI-distance information increases overall decoding accuracy by 1.1%. These results show that synchrony features in spike-trains do contain information not carried in firing rate. In addition these results also demonstrate the feasibility of combining synchrony and firing rate for improving the classification accuracy of invasive brain-machine interface BMI in the control of neural prosthetics.
