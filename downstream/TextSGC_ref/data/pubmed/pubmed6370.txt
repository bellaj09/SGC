Boosting transitions of rare events is critical to simulations of chemical and biophysical dynamic systems in order to close the time scale gaps between theoretical modeling and experiments. We present a novel approach called targeted adversarial learning optimized sampling TALOS to modify the potential energy surface in order to drive the system to a user-defined target distribution where the free-energy barrier is lowered. Combining statistical mechanics and generative learning TALOS formulates a competing game between a sampling engine and a virtual discriminator enables unsupervised construction of bias potentials and seeks for an optimal transport plan that transforms the system into a target. Through multiple experiments we show that on-the-fly training of TALOS benefits from the state-of-art optimization techniques in deep learning and thus is efficient robust and interpretable. TALOS is also closely connected to the actor-critic reinforcement learning and hence leads to a new way of flexibly manipulating the many-body Hamiltonian systems.
