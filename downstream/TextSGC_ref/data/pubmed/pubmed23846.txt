This paper presents a new method for calibrating a video 3D stereo-photogrammetric system. The external parameters and the focal lengths of the cameras are determined from the epipolar constraint and the principal points are computed through the minimisation of a cost function carried out through an evolutionary optimisation. The method has been made more robust with a deterministic annealing procedure of the search region amplitude. Calibration is carried out by moving a rigid bar carrying two markers on its extremities inside the working volume. The distance between the two markers is the only measure required. Tests on real data are reported which show that the obtained accuracy is comparable to the one achieved calibrating with control points of known 3D coordinates.
