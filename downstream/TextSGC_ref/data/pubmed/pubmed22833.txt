A complete glove-based master-slave tactile feedback system was developed to provide users with a remote sense of touch. The system features a force-sensing master glove with piezoresistive force sensors mounted at each finger tip and a pressure-transmitting slave glove with silicone-based pneumatically controlled balloon actuators mounted at each finger tip on another hand. A control system translates forces detected on the master glove either worn by a user or mounted on a robotic hand to discrete pressure levels at the fingers of another user. System tests demonstrated that users could accurately identify the correct finger and detect three simultaneous finger stimuli with 99.3% and 90.2% accuracy respectively when the subjects were located in separate rooms. The glove-based tactile feedback system may have application to virtual reality rehabilitation remote surgery medical simulation robotic assembly and military robotics.
