Fragile X syndrome is a common heritable form of mental retardation in humans. Recent neuroanatomical studies indicate an apparent immature appearance of neurons in fragile X syndrome patients and fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP-knockout mice an animal model of this condition. In this work we investigated possible alterations in synaptic plasticity in the neocortex of FMRP-knockout mice. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the deep-layer visual neocortex. Long-term potentiation LTP was severely attenuated in brain slices from knockout mice relative to that observed in slices from wild-type mice. Considering that neocortical LTP can involve both NMDA receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms we attempted to distinguish the nature of LTP attenuated in the knockout condition. In slices from wild-type mice LTP was partially attenuated by the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-+/--2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl-propyl-1-phosphate CPP; however the general metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR antagonist alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine MCPG strongly attenuated LTP resulting in a response indistinguishable from that observed in slices from knockout mice. The selective mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine MPEP attenuated LTP to a similar degree as did MCPG in wild-type slices but MPEP did not alter the reduced potentiation in knockout slices. Our results suggest that LTP in layer V visual neocortex depends primarily on mGluR5 activation. Our data also indicate that mGluR5-mediated synaptic plasticity is absent in the neocortex of FMRP-knockout mice. Such an alteration may contribute to the cognitive and learning deficits exhibited in these mice as well as in fragile X syndrome.
