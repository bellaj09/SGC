Purpose The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single session of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with virtual reality training on the balance of children with cerebral palsy. Subjetcs and Methods Children with cerebral palsy between four and 12\u2005years of age were randomly allocated to two groups: an experimental group which performed a single session of mobility training with virtual reality combined with active transcranial direct current stimulation; and a control group which performed a single session of mobility training with virtual reality combined with placebo transcranial direct current stimulation. The children were evaluated before and after the training protocols. Static balance sway area displacement velocity and frequency of oscillations of the center of pressure on the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes was evaluated using a force plate under four conditions 30-second measurements for each condition: feet on the force plate with the eyes open and with the eyes closed; feet on a foam mat with the eyes open and with the eyes closed. Results An increase in sway velocity was the only significant difference found. Conclusion A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation combined with mobility training elicited to lead to an increase in the body sway velocity of children with cerebral palsy. Effect of a single session of transcranial direct-current stimulation combined with virtual reality training on the balance of children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled double-blind trial.
