Neuromodulation-based interventions continue to be evaluated across an array of appetitive disorders but broader implementation of these approaches remains limited due to variable treatment outcomes. We hypothesize that individual variation in treatment outcomes may be linked to differences in the networks underlying these disorders. Here Sprague-Dawley rats received deep brain stimulation separately within each nucleus accumbens NAc sub-region core and shell using a within-animal crossover design in a rat model of binge eating. Significant reductions in binge size were observed with stimulation of either target but with significant variation in effectiveness across individuals. When features of local field potentials LFPs recorded from the NAc were used to classify the pre-defined stimulation outcomes response or non-response from each rat using a machine-learning approach lasso stimulation outcomes could be classified with greater accuracy than expected by chance effect sizes: core = 1.13 shell = 1.05. Further these LFP features could be used to identify the best stimulation target for each animal core vs. shell with an effect size = 0.96. These data suggest that individual differences in underlying network activity may relate to the variable outcomes of circuit based interventions and measures of network activity could have the potential to individually guide the selection of an optimal stimulation target to improve overall treatment response rates.
