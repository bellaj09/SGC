Nucleus recognition is a critical yet challenging step in histopathology image analysis for example in Ki67 immunohistochemistry stained images. Although many automated methods have been proposed most use a multi-stage processing pipeline to categorize nuclei leading to cumbersome low-throughput and error-prone assessments. To address this issue we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network for single-stage nucleus recognition.
