"Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical sensory and mental capacities while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions e.g. frailty mild cognitive impairment metabolic syndrome and age-related diseases e.g. Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease cancer sarcopenia cardiovascular and respiratory diseases affect older people. Virtual reality VR is a novel and promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis PRISMA guidelines concerning the usability of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR with particular attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach qualitative and quantitative tools together is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance models are the most applied theoretical frameworks however senior adapted models are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions VR-USOP provided by our analysis."
