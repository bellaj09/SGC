Despite the rise of virtual reality VR-based interventions in stroke rehabilitation over the past decade no consensus has been reached on its efficacy. This ostensibly puzzling outcome might not be that surprising given that VR is intrinsically neutral to its use-that is an intervention is effective because of its ability to mobilize recovery mechanisms not its technology. As VR systems specifically built for rehabilitation might capitalize better on the advantages of technology to implement neuroscientifically grounded protocols they might be more effective than those designed for recreational gaming.
