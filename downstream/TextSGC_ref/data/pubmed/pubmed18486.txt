The study of neuromuscular control of movement in humans is accomplished with numerous technologies. Non-invasive methods for investigating neuromuscular function include transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and three-dimensional motion capture. The advent of readily available and cost-effective virtual reality solutions has expanded the capabilities of researchers in recreating "real-world" environments and movements in a laboratory setting. Naturalistic movement analysis will not only garner a greater understanding of motor control in healthy individuals but also permit the design of experiments and rehabilitation strategies that target specific motor impairments e.g. stroke. The combined use of these tools will lead to increasingly deeper understanding of neural mechanisms of motor control. A key requirement when combining these data acquisition systems is fine temporal correspondence between the various data streams. This protocol describes a multifunctional system\s overall connectivity intersystem signaling and the temporal synchronization of recorded data. Synchronization of the component systems is primarily accomplished through the use of a customizable circuit readily made with off the shelf components and minimal electronics assembly skills.
