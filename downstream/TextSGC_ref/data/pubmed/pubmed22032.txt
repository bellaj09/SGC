The feature extraction and classification of brain signal is very significant in brain-computer interface BCI. In this study we describe an algorithm for motor imagery MI classification of electrocorticogram ECoG-based BCI. The proposed approach employs multi-resolution fractal measures and local binary pattern LBP operators to form a combined feature for characterizing an ECoG epoch recording from the right hemisphere of the brain. A classifier is trained by using the gradient boosting in conjunction with ordinary least squares OLS method. The fractal intercept lacunarity and LBP features are extracted to classify imagined movements of either the left small finger or the tongue. Experimental results on dataset I of BCI competition III demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The cross-validation accuracy and accuracy is 90.6% and 95% respectively. Furthermore the low computational burden of this method makes it a promising candidate for real-time BCI systems.
