"Electronic signals govern the function of both nervous systems and computers albeit in different ways. As such hybridizing both systems to create an iono-electric brain-computer interface is a realistic goal; and one that promises exciting advances in both heterotic computing and neuroprosthetics capable of circumventing devastating neuropathology. Neural networks were in the 1980s viewed naively as a potential panacea for all computational problems that did not fit well with conventional computing. The field bifurcated during the 1990s into a highly successful and much more realistic machine learning community and an equally pragmatic biologically oriented neuromorphic computing community. Algorithms found in nature that use the non-synchronous spiking nature of neuronal signals have been found to be i implementable efficiently in silicon and ii computationally useful. As a result interest has grown in techniques that could create mixed siliconeural computers. Here we discuss potential approaches and focus on one particular platform using parylene-patterned silicon dioxide." "Towards a siliconeural computer: technological successes and challenges."
