A scientific study of consciousness should take into consideration both objective and subjective measures of conscious experiences. To this date very few studies have tried to integrate third-person data or data about the neurophysiological correlates of conscious states with first-person data or data about subjective experience. Inspired by Morel\s invention Casares 1940 a literary machine capable of reproducing sensory-dependent external reality this article suggests that combination of virtual reality techniques and brain reading technologies that is decoding of conscious states by brain activity alone can offer this integration. It is also proposed that the multimodal simulating and integrative capacities of the dreaming brain render it an "endogenous" Morel\s machine which can potentially be used in studying consciousness but not always in a reliable way. Both the literary machine and dreaming could contribute to a better understanding of conscious states. Consciousness and the invention of Morel.
