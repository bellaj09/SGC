 Changes to working hours new technologies and increased accountability have rendered the need for alternative training environments for urologists.  Simulation offers a promising arena for learning to take place in a safe realistic setting.  Despite its benefits the incorporation of simulation into urological training programmes remains minimal.  The current status and future directions of simulation for training in technical and non-technical skills are reviewed as they pertain to urology.  A framework is presented for how simulation-based training could be incorporated into the entire urological curriculum. Framework for incorporating simulation into urology training.
