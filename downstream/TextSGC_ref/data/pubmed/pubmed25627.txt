Cataract is one of the most common geriatric diseases and surgery is known to be the best treatment. Despite the increasing demand for cataract surgery the opportunity for novice residents to practice cataract surgery is gradually diminishing as the patient and animal ethics become strict. Therefore there have been many attempts to overcome the lack of experience by using virtual reality training system. So far most of the surgical training simulation devices so far focused on visual training and when they have a haptic sense they are tethered to a fixed station which is different from the feeling of moving the actual surgical tool. In this study we have developed a haptic surgical training tool with sensory substitution and virtual-reality-based cataract surgery simulator. To assess and reproduce the tactile senses during surgery we prepared viscoelastic lens dummies and measured vibrations in contact and motion required during Continuous Circular Capsulorhexis CCC. Based on measurement we designed vibration models for haptic sensory substitution and applied them to virtual reality simulator. With complete virtual reality training system the contact vibration was successfully implemented for virtual contacts to reproduced realistic haptic senses.
