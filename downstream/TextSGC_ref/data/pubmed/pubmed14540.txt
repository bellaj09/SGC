Studies indicate that the majority of students in undergraduate biochemistry take a surface approach to learning associated with rote memorization of material rather than a deep approach which implies higher cognitive processing. This behavior relates to poorer outcomes including impaired course performance and reduced knowledge retention. The use of case-based learning CBL into biochemistry teaching may facilitate deep learning by increasing student engagement and interest. Abundant literature on CBL exists but clear guidance on how to design and implement case studies is not readily available. This guide provides a representative review of CBL uses in science and describes the process of developing CBL modules to be used in biochemistry. Included is a framework to implement a directed CBL assisted with lectures in a content-driven biochemistry course regardless of class size. Moreover this guide can facilitate adopting CBL to other courses. Consequently the information presented herein will be of value to undergraduate science educators with an interest in active learning pedagogies. A guide to using case-based learning in biochemistry education.
