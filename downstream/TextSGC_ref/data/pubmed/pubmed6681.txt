"Artificial intelligence AI has gained major attention with a rapid increase in the number of published articles mostly recently. This review provides a general understanding of how AI can or will be useful to the musculoskeletal radiologist. After a brief technical background on AI machine learning and deep learning we illustrate through examples from the musculoskeletal literature potential AI applications in the various steps of the radiologists workflow from managing the request to communication of results. The implementation of AI solutions does not go without challenges and limitations. These are also discussed as well as the trends and perspectives."
