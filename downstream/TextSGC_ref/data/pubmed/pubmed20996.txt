Simulation in anesthesia is a field that has revolutionized the teaching outlook. The uncommon grave situations are no more unseen. The ability of these devices to test and give a taste of nerves to an anesthetist is actually preparing him for a safe future management when the need be. The role of simulation in testing a new device for its likely success in clinical world can be foreseen. Mastering a difficult skill no longer subjects a patient to danger. These advanced methods not only see how anesthetist responds to environment but also how the OT environment reacts to him. The review highlights how technology will help us become technically sound clinicians for tomorrow. Virtual reality in anesthesia "simulation".
