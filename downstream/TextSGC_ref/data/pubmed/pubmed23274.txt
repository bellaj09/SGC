Classification of various cognitive and motor tasks using electroencephalogram EEG signals is necessary for building Brain Computer Interfaces BCI that are noninvasive. However achieving high classification accuracy in a multi-subject multitask scenario is a challenge. A noticeable reduction in accuracy is observed when the subjects between train and test are mismatched. Drawing a similarity from speaker adaptation approaches in speech we propose a method to perform subject-wise adaptation of EEG in order to improve the task classification performance. A Common Spatial Pattern CSP approach is employed for feature extraction. Gaussian Mixture Model GMM based subject-specific models are built for each of the tasks. Maximum a-posterior MAP adaptation is performed and an absolute improvement of 1.22-7.26% is observed in the average accuracy. Level-wise Subject adaptation to improve classification of motor and mental EEG tasks.
