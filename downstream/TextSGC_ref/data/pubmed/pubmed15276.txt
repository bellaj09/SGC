Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence of around 1.6% in the adult population. The analysis of the electrocardiogram ECG data acquired in the UK Biobank represents an opportunity to screen for AF in a large sub-population in the UK. The main objective of this paper is to assess ten machine-learning methods for automated detection of subjects with AF in the UK Biobank dataset. Identification of patients with atrial fibrillation: a big data exploratory analysis of the UK Biobank.
