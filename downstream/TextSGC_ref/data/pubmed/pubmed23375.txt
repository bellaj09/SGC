"After severe injury or neurodegenerative disorders patients often experience long-term functional deficits resulting in a reduction o performance in activities of daily living ADL. Given their direct relevance to everyday functioning and quality of life neurorehabilitative programs using simulated ADLs have seen increased interest recently. One of the core elements in simulated ADLs is the interface between the user and the virtual environment which has a high impact on the therapeutic outcome. The aim of this study was to nalyze the feasibility of a simple virtual ADL tea preparation task using two different input devices. The tea preparation task setup consisted of a computer rendering the virtual environment a head-mounted display HMD to visually present the ADL and two input devices mouse and handheld controller to guide virtual hands in the virtual environment. A total of 24 healthyyoung adults performed the tea preparation task after which workload usability immersion and presence was rated. The handheld controller was rated significantly lower workload and higher usability than the mouse input device. Also the sense of being there immersion and spatial presence ratings for the task and setup were close to the maximum score of 5. Thus the handheld controller outperformed the mouse suggesting that user interaction in the virtual environment with the handheld controller is similar to the real world and intuitive to use. Overall the simulated ADL implemented with VR technology is feasible for diagnostic and rehabilitative purposes in patients experiencing long-term functional deficits."
