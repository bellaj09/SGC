The research goal at the Craniofacial Virtual Reality Laboratory of the School of Dentistry in conjunction with the Integrated Media Systems Center School of Engineering University of Southern California is to develop computer methods to accurately visualize patients in three dimensions using advanced imaging and data acquisition devices such as cone-beam computerized tomography CT and mandibular motion capture. Data from these devices were integrated for three-dimensional 3D patient-specific visualization modeling and animation. Generic methods are in development that can be used with common CT image format DICOM mesh format STL and motion data 3D position over time. This paper presents preliminary descriptive studies on: 1 segmentation of the lower and upper jaws with two types of CT data--a traditional whole head CT data and b the new dental Newtom CT; 2 manual integration of accurate 3D tooth crowns with the segmented lower jaw 3D model; 3 realistic patient-specific 3D animation of the lower jaw. Three-dimensional visualization of the craniofacial patient: volume segmentation data integration and animation.
