"This article examines some of the challenges in nursing practice experienced by patients and nurses in the UK and Ireland and considers some of the associated stressors in the system. Nurses must respond to these challenges by crafting their own practice and the article offers a blueprint for developing personal nursing practice through acceptance paying detailed attention to patients taking time with patients and personal reflection. It draws on innovations in learning disability practice to suggest that care should be jointly thought through and co-created by patients and nurses and that this process of thoughtful engagement constitutes deep nursing." Deep nursing: a thoughtful co-created nursing process.
