The ability to precisely visualize the atomic geometry of the interactions between a drug and its protein target in structural models is critical in predicting the correct modifications in previously identified inhibitors to create more effective next generation drugs. It is currently common practice among medicinal chemists while attempting the above to access the information contained in three-dimensional structures by using two-dimensional projections which can preclude disclosure of useful features. A more accessible and intuitive visualization of the three-dimensional configuration of the atomic geometry in the models can be achieved through the implementation of immersive virtual reality VR. While bespoke commercial VR suites are available in this work we present a freely available software pipeline for visualising protein structures through VR. New consumer hardware such as the HTC VIVE and the OCULUS RIFT utilized in this study are available at reasonable prices. As an instructive example we have combined VR visualization with fast algorithms for simulating intramolecular motions of protein flexibility in an effort to further improve structure-led drug design by exposing molecular interactions that might be hidden in the less informative static models. This is a paradigmatic test case scenario for many similar applications in computer-aided molecular studies and design.
