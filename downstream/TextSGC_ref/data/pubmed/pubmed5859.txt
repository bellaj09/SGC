White matter WM alterations have been consistently described in patients with schizophrenia and correlated with the severity of psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Obesity has been reported in over 40% of patients with schizophrenia and has been associated with cognitive deficits cardiovascular diseases metabolic alterations and overall mortality. Moreover studies among healthy subjects and subjects at risk for psychosis reported an influence of Body Mass Index BMI on structural connectivity. We therefore hypothesized that obesity and overweight could further disrupt WM integrity of patients affected by schizophrenia. Obesity influences white matter integrity in schizophrenia.
