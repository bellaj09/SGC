Virtual reality VR is an emerging tool to help treat posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. Previously published studies have shown that VR graded exposure therapy VR-GET treatment can result in improvements in PTSD symptoms. Less is known about the impact on depression general anxiety and neuropsychological functioning in patients with PTSD. This study examined changes in self-reports of PTSD depression and anxiety before and after treatment and also examined neuropsychological functioning as assessed by a computerized test of simple reaction time procedural reaction time and performance on the congruent incongruent emotional and neutral match the color of the "nonsense word" Stroop tests. Results showed that subjects treated with VR-GET showed significant reductions in PTSD and anxiety severity and significant improvements on the emotional Stroop test. Changes in depression and other measures of neuropsychological function were not significant. Change scores on the emotional Stroop test did not correlate with changes in self-report measures of PTSD. Overall these findings support the use of VR-GET as a treatment for PTSD but indicate that benefits may be narrowly focused. Additional treatments may be needed after or alongside VR-GET for service members with neuropsychological impairments. Effect of virtual reality PTSD treatment on mood and neurocognitive outcomes.
