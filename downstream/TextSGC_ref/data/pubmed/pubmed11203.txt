"Scalp electroencephalogram EEG a recording of the brains electrical activity has been used to diagnose and detect epileptic seizures for a long time. However most researchers have implemented seizure detectors by manually hand-engineering features from observed EEG data and used them in seizure detection which might not scale well to new patterns of seizures. In this paper we investigate the possibility of utilising unsupervised feature learning the recent development of deep learning to automatically learn features from raw unlabelled EEG data that are representative enough to be used in seizure detection. We develop patient-specific seizure detectors by using stacked autoencoders and logistic classifiers. A two-step training consisting of the greedy layer-wise and the global fine-tuning was used to train our detectors. The evaluation was performed by using labelled dataset from the CHB-MIT database and the results showed that all of the test seizures were detected with a mean latency of 3.36 seconds and a low false detection rate."
