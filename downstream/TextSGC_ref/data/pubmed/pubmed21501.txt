Many patients residing in forensic psychiatric centers have difficulties regulating their aggression in an adequate manner. Therefore they are frequently involved in conflicts. Evidenced-based aggression therapies in forensic psychiatry are scarce and due to the highly secured environment it is hard to practice real-life provocations. We have developed a Virtual Reality aggression prevention training VRAPT providing safe virtual environments in which patients can practice controlling their aggressive behaviors in an adequate way. The main objective of this study is to examine whether VRAPT is effective in reducing aggression among forensic psychiatric inpatients. Effect of virtual reality aggression prevention training for forensic psychiatric patients VRAPT: study protocol of a multi-center RCT.
