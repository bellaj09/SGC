"A brain-computer interface BCI is a hardware and software communications system that permits cerebral activity alone to control computers or external devices. The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or locked in by neurological neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain stem stroke or spinal cord injury. Here we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition preprocessing or signal enhancement feature extraction classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages drawbacks and latest advances and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical magnetic or metabolic activity. Second the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions which can be detected in brain activity. Third the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally the review provides an overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices." Brain computer interfaces a review.
