"Searching through studies of schizophrenic delusions with a view to the new media we came across the case of a young woman who integrated the Internet in her delusional system. Analysing the story she told we recognised a psychotic symptom which we preliminarily called perception broadcast. Perception broadcast shows a more complex structure than the related first rank symptom thought broadcast described by Kurt Schneider. In our view the existence of a structure like perception broadcast depends on the existence of new technologies such as the World Wide Web and virtual reality creating new cultural patterns which themselves are associated with collective perceptions of derealisation."
