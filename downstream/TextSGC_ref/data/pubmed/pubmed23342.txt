The Trier Social Stress Test TSST is a widely used protocol to induce stress in laboratory settings. Briefly in the TSST the test participant is asked to hold a speech and to do an arithmetic task in front of an audience. In the present pilot study we examined endocrine and autonomic reactivity and habituation to repeated stress provocations using a virtual reality VR version of TSST. The VR system was a CAVE system with three rear projected walls 4 m3 m and one floor projection. The system also included a head tracking system and passive stereoscopy. The virtual audience consisted of one woman and two men. Ten healthy men mean age 28.3 years 24-38 years were confronted with the test twice 1 week between sessions during which salivary cortisol heart rate HR high frequency heart rate variability HF-HRV parasympathetic activity and T-wave amplitude TWA suggested to be related to sympathetic influence on myocardial performance were assessed. Cortisol secretion showed a marked increase 88% vs. baseline during the first stress provocation but habituated in the second session. The magnitude of HR and TWA reactivity during stress provocation was approximately the same at both sessions implying a stable increase in sympathetic activity. Heart rate showed a maximum increase of 40% at the first session and 32% at the second. TWA showed a maximum decrease of 42% at the first session and 39% at the second. The results resemble those obtained in prior studies using the real-life TSST. If these results can be replicated with larger samples VR technology may be used as a simple and standardized tool for social stress induction in experimental settings.
