We present a new 3D digital brain atlas of the non-human primate common marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus with MRI and coregistered Nissl histology data. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive digital 3D brain atlas of the common marmoset having normalized multi-modal data cortical and sub-cortical segmentation and in a common file format NIfTI. The atlas can be registered to new data is useful for connectomics functional studies simulation and as a reference. The atlas was based on previously published work but we provide several critical improvements to make this release valuable for researchers. Nissl histology images were processed to remove illumination and shape artifacts and then normalized to the MRI data. Brain region segmentation is provided for both hemispheres. The data is in the NIfTI format making it easy to integrate into neuroscience pipelines whereas the previous atlas was in an inaccessible file format. We also provide cortical mid-cortical and white matter boundary segmentations useful for visualization and analysis. The Brain/MINDS 3D digital marmoset brain atlas.
