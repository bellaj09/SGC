Accurate lesion segmentation is important for measurements of lesion load and atrophy in subjects with multiple sclerosis MS. International MS lesion challenges show a preference of convolutional neural networks CNN strategies such as nicMSlesions. However since the software is trained on fairly homogenous training data we aimed to test the performance of nicMSlesions in an independent dataset with manual and other automatic lesion segmentations to determine whether this method is suitable for larger multi-center studies. Comparing lesion segmentation methods in multiple sclerosis: Input from one manually delineated subject is sufficient for accurate lesion segmentation.
