Individual differences in mind and behavior are believed to reflect the functional variability of the human brain. Due to the lack of a large-scale longitudinal dataset the full landscape of variability within and between individual functional connectomes is largely unknown. We collected 300 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rfMRI datasets from 30 healthy participants who were scanned every three days for one month. With these data both intra- and inter-individual variability of six common rfMRI metrics as well as their test-retest reliability were estimated across multiple spatial scales. Global metrics were more dynamic than local regional metrics. Cognitive components involving working memory inhibition attention language and related neural networks exhibited high intra-individual variability. In contrast inter-individual variability demonstrated a more complex picture across the multiple scales of metrics. Limbic default frontoparietal and visual networks and their related cognitive components were more differentiable than somatomotor and attention networks across the participants. Analyzing both intra- and inter-individual variability revealed a set of high-resolution maps on test-retest reliability of the multi-scale connectomic metrics. These findings represent the first collection of individual differences in multi-scale and multi-metric characterization of the human functional connectomes in-vivo serving as normal references for the field to guide the use of common functional metrics in rfMRI-based applications.
