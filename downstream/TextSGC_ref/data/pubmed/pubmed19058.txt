Pedestrian injury is among the leading causes of pediatric death in the United States and much of the world. This paper is divided into two sections. First we review the literature on behavioral risk factors for child injury. Cognitive and perceptual development risks are discussed. The roles of distraction temperament and personality and social influences from parents and peers are presented. We conclude the first section with brief reviews of environmental risks pedestrian safety among special populations and the role of sleep and fatigue on pediatric pedestrian safety. The second section of the review considers child pedestrian injury prevention strategies. Categorized by mode of presentation we discuss parent instruction strategies school-based instruction strategies including crossing guards and streetside training techniques. Technology-based training strategies using video internet and virtual reality are reviewed. We conclude the section on prevention with discussion of community-based interventions.
