"Based on an image dataset of 88 in-vivo dental images taken with an intra-oral camera we show that a Deep Learning model Mask R-CNN can detect and classify dental caries on occlusal surfaces across the whole 7-class ICDAS International Caries Detection and Assessment System scale. This is accomplished without any image pre-processing method and by utilizing superpixels segmentation for the experts annotations and the evaluation of the classifier. In the proposed methodology transfer learning and data augmentation are employed during the training of the model. The paper discusses technical details provides initial results and denotes points for further improvement by fine-tuning the classifier along with an extended dataset."
