Morphometric similarity networks MSNs estimate organization of the cortex as a biologically meaningful set of similarities between anatomical features at the macro- and microstructural level derived from multiple structural MRI sMRI sequences. These networks are clinically relevant predicting 40% variance in IQ. However the sequences required T1w T2w DWI to produce these networks are longer acquisitions less feasible in some populations. Thus estimating MSNs using features from T1w sMRI is attractive to clinical and developmental neuroscience. We studied whether reduced-feature approaches approximate the original MSN model as a potential tool to investigate brain structure. In a large homogenous dataset of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project HCP we extended previous investigations of reduced-feature MSNs by comparing not only T1w-derived networks but also additional MSNs generated with fewer MR sequences to their full acquisition counterparts. We produce MSNs that are highly similar at the edge level to those generated with multimodal imaging; however the nodal topology of the networks differed. These networks had limited predictive validity of generalized cognitive ability. Overall when multimodal imaging is not available or appropriate T1w-restricted MSN construction is feasible provides an appropriate estimate of the MSN and could be a useful approach to examine outcomes in future studies. Clinically feasible brain morphometric similarity network construction approaches with restricted magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions.
