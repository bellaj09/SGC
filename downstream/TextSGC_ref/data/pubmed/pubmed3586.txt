Understanding neurocognitive computations will require not just localizing cognitive information distributed throughout the brain but also determining how that information got there. We review recent advances in linking empirical and simulated brain network organization with cognitive information processing. Building on these advances we offer a new framework for understanding the role of connectivity in cognition: network coding encoding/decoding models. These models utilize connectivity to specify the transfer of information via neural activity flow processes successfully predicting the formation of cognitive representations in empirical neural data. The success of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions mechanistically emerge are computed from distributed activity flow processes that are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.
