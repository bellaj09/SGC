Conventional nighttime face detection studies mostly use near-infrared NIR light cameras or thermal cameras which are robust to environmental illumination variation and low illumination. However for the NIR camera it is difficult to adjust the intensity and angle of the additional NIR illuminator according to its distance from an object. As for the thermal camera it is expensive to use as a surveillance camera. For these reasons we propose a nighttime face detection method based on deep learning using a single visible-light camera. In a long-distance night image it is difficult to detect faces directly from the entire image due to noise and image blur. Therefore we propose Two-Step Faster region-based convolutional neural network R-CNN based on the image preprocessed by histogram equalization HE. As a two-step scheme our method sequentially performs the detectors of body and face areas and locates the face inside a limited body area. By using our two-step method the processing time by Faster R-CNN can be reduced while maintaining the accuracy of face detection by Faster R-CNN. Using a self-constructed database called Dongguk Nighttime Face Detection database DNFD-DB1 and an open database of Fudan University we proved that the proposed method performs better compared to other existing face detectors. In addition the proposed Two-Step Faster R-CNN outperformed single Faster R-CNN and our method with HE showed higher accuracies than those without our preprocessing in nighttime face detection.
