"Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy VBMEG is a MATLAB toolbox that estimates distributed source currents from magnetoencephalography MEG/electroencephalography EEG data by integrating functional MRI fMRI https://vbmeg.atr.jp/. VBMEG also estimates whole-brain connectome dynamics using anatomical connectivity derived from a diffusion MRI dMRI. In this paper we introduce the VBMEG toolbox and demonstrate its usefulness. By collaborating with VBMEGs tutorial page https://vbmeg.atr.jp/docs/v2/static/vbmeg2_tutorial_neuromag.html we show its full pipeline using an open dataset recorded by Wakeman and Henson 2015. We import the MEG data and preprocess them to estimate the source currents. From the estimated source currents we perform a group analysis and examine the differences of current amplitudes between conditions by controlling the false discovery rate FDR which yields results consistent with previous studies. We highlight VBMEGs characteristics by comparing these results with those obtained by other source imaging methods: weighted minimum norm estimate wMNE dynamic statistical parametric mapping dSPM and linearly constrained minimum variance LCMV beamformer. We also estimate source currents from the EEG data and the whole-brain connectome dynamics from the MEG data and dMRI. The observed results indicate the reliability characteristics and usefulness of VBMEG." MEG Source Imaging and Group Analysis Using VBMEG.
