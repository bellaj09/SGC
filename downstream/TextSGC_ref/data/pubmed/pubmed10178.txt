Lateral flow assay tests are nowadays becoming powerful low-cost diagnostic tools. Obtaining a result is usually subject to visual interpretation of colored areas on the test by a human operator introducing subjectivity and the possibility of errors in the extraction of the results. While automated test readers providing a result-consistent solution are widely available they usually lack portability. In this paper we present a smartphone-based automated reader for drug-of-abuse lateral flow assay tests consisting of an inexpensive light box and a smartphone device. Test images captured with the smartphone camera are processed in the device using computer vision and machine learning techniques to perform automatic extraction of the results. A deep validation of the system has been carried out showing the high accuracy of the system. The proposed approach applicable to any line-based or color-based lateral flow test in the market effectively reduces the manufacturing costs of the reader and makes it portable and massively available while providing accurate reliable results.
