Muscle synergies analysis can provide a deep understanding of motor impairment after stroke and of changes after rehabilitation. In this study the neuro-mechanical analysis of leg cycling was used to longitudinally investigate the motor recovery process coupled with cycling training augmented by Functional Electrical Stimulation FES in subacute stroke survivors. Changes in leg cycling muscle synergies after training augmented by functional electrical stimulation in subacute stroke survivors: a pilot study.
