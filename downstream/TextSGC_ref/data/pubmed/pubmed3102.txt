"Resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI opens a window on large-scale organization of brain function. However establishing relationships between resting-state brain activity and cognitive or clinical scores is still a difficult task in particular in terms of prediction as would be meaningful for clinical applications such as early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. In this work we employed partial least square regression under cross-validation scheme to predict episodic memory performance from functional connectivity FC patterns in a set of fifty-five MCI subjects for whom rs-fMRI acquisition and neuropsychological evaluation was carried out. We show that a newly introduced FC measure capturing the moments of anti-correlation between brain areas discordance contains key information to predict long-term memory scores in MCI patients and performs better than standard measures of correlation to do so. Our results highlighted that stronger discordance within default mode network DMN areas as well as across DMN attentional and limbic networks favor episodic memory performance in MCI."
