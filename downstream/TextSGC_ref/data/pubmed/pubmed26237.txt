Although 3D heart and torso model with realistic geometry are basis of simulation computation in LFX virtual cardiac model the simulation results are mostly output in 2D format. To solve such a problem and enhance the virtual reality of LFX virtual cardiac model the methods of voxel mapping and vertex project mapping were presented. With these methods excitation isochrone map EIM was mapped from heart model with realistic geometry to real visible man heart model and body surface potential map BSPM was mapped from torso model with realistic geometry to real visible man body surface. By visualizing in the 4Dview which is a real-time 3D medical image visualization platform the visualization results of EIM and BSPM simulation data before and after mapping were also provided. According to the visualization results the output format of EIM and BSPM simulation data of LFX virtual cardiac model were extended from 2D to 4D spatio-temporal and from cardiac model with realistic geometry to real cardiac model and more realistic and effective simulation was achieved.
