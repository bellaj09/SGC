Manual screening using fundus photographs has however involved considerable costs for patients clinicians and national health systems which has limited its application particularly in less-developed countries. The advent of artificial intelligence and in particular deep learning techniques has however raised the possibility of widespread automated screening. Different fundus imaging modalities and technical factors in AI screening for diabetic retinopathy: a review.
