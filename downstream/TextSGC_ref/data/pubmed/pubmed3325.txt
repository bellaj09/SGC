Deep Brain Stimulation DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that can reduce symptoms in medically intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. Conceptually DBS of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum VC/VS region targets reciprocal excitatory connections between the orbitofrontal cortex OFC and thalamus decreasing abnormal reverberant activity within the OFC-caudate-pallidal-thalamic circuit. In this study we investigated these connections using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI on human connectome datasets of twenty-nine healthy young-adult volunteers with two-tensor unscented Kalman filter based tractography. We studied the morphology of the lateral and medial orbitofrontothalamic connections and estimated their topographic variability within the VC/VS region. Our results showed that the morphology of the individual orbitofrontothalamic fibers of passage in the VC/VS region is complex and inter-individual variability in their topography is high. We applied this method to an example OCD patient case who underwent DBS surgery formulating an initial proof of concept for a tractography-guided patient-specific approach in DBS for medically intractable OCD. This may improve on current surgical practice which involves implanting all patients at identical stereotactic coordinates within the VC/VS region. Variability and anatomical specificity of the orbitofrontothalamic fibers of passage in the ventral capsule/ventral striatum VC/VS: precision care for patient-specific tractography-guided targeting of deep brain stimulation DBS in obsessive compulsive disorder OCD.
