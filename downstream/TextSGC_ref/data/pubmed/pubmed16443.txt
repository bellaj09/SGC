High-throughput microscopy of many single cells generates high-dimensional data that are far from straightforward to analyze. One important problem is automatically detecting the cellular compartment where a fluorescently-tagged protein resides a task relatively simple for an experienced human but difficult to automate on a computer. Here we train an 11-layer neural network on data from mapping thousands of yeast proteins achieving per cell localization classification accuracy of 91% and per protein accuracy of 99% on held-out images. We confirm that low-level network features correspond to basic image characteristics while deeper layers separate localization classes. Using this network as a feature calculator we train standard classifiers that assign proteins to previously unseen compartments after observing only a small number of training examples. Our results are the most accurate subcellular localization classifications to date and demonstrate the usefulness of deep learning for high-throughput microscopy.
