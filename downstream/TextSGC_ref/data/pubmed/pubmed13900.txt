"Atom probe tomography is known for its accurate compositional analysis at the nanoscale. However the patterns created by successive hits on the single particle detector during experiments often contain complementary information about the specimens crystallography including structure and orientation. This information remains in most cases unexploited because it is up to now retrieved predominantly manually. Here we propose an approach combining image analysis techniques for feature selection and deep-learning to automatically interpret the patterns. Application of unsupervised machine learning techniques allows to build and train a deep neural network based on a library generated from theoretically known crystallographic angular relationships. This approach enables direct interpretation of the detector hit maps as shown here on the example of numerous pure-Al and is robust enough to function under various conditions of base temperature pulsing mode and pulse fraction. We benchmark our approach against recent attempts to automate the pattern identification via Hough-transform and discuss the current limitations of our approach. This new automated approach renders crystallographic atom probe tomography analysis more efficient feature-sensitive robust user-independent and reliable. With that deep-learning algorithms show a great potential to give access to combined atom probe crystallographic and compositional analysis to a large community of users."
