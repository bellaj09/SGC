Histopathology is a method used for breast cancer diagnosis. Machine learning ML methods have achieved success for supervised learning tasks in the medical domain. In this article we investigate the impact of ML for the diagnosis of breast cancer using histopathology images of conventional photomicroscopy. Cancer diagnosis is the identification of images as cancer or noncancer and this involves image preprocessing feature extraction classification and performance analysis. In this article different approaches to perform these necessary steps are reviewed. We find that most ML research for breast cancer diagnosis has been focused on deep learning. Based on inferences from the recent research activities we discuss how ML methods can benefit conventional microscopy-based breast cancer diagnosis. Finally we discuss the research gaps of ML approaches for the implementation in a real pathology environment and propose future research guidelines.
