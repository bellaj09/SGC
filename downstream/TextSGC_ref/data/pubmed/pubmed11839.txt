Although dose prediction for intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT has been accomplished by a deep learning approach delineation of some structures is needed for the prediction. We sought to develop a fully automated dose-generation framework for IMRT of prostate cancer by entering the patient CT datasets without the contour information into a generative adversarial network GAN and to compare its prediction performance to a conventional prediction model trained from patient contours. Fully automated dose prediction using generative adversarial networks in prostate cancer patients.
