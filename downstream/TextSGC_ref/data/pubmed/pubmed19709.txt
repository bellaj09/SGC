"In social communication the gaze direction of other persons provides important information to perceive and interpret their emotional response. Previous research investigated the influence of gaze by manipulating mutual eye contact. Therefore gaze and body direction have been changed as a whole resulting in only congruent gaze and body directions averted or directed of another person. Here we aimed to disentangle these effects by using short animated sequences of virtual agents posing with either direct or averted body or gaze. Attention allocation by means of eye movements facial muscle response and emotional experience to agents of different gender and facial expressions were investigated. Eye movement data revealed longer fixation durations i.e. a stronger allocation of attention when gaze and body direction were not congruent with each other or when both were directed towards the observer. This suggests that direct interaction as well as incongruous signals increase the demands of attentional resources in the observer. For the facial muscle response only the reaction of muscle zygomaticus major revealed an effect of body direction expressed by stronger activity in response to happy expressions for direct compared to averted gaze when the virtual characters body was directed towards the observer. Finally body direction also influenced the emotional experience ratings towards happy expressions. While earlier findings suggested that mutual eye contact is the main source for increased emotional responding and attentional allocation the present results indicate that direction of the virtual agents body and head also plays a minor but significant role."
