Patients are typically debriefed by their healthcare provider after any medical procedure or surgery to discuss their findings and any next steps involving medication or treatment instructions. However without any medical or scientific background knowledge it can feel overwhelming and esoteric for a\xa0patient to listen to a\xa0physician describe a\xa0complex operation. Instead providing patients with engaging visuals and a\xa0virtual reality VR simulation of their individual clinical findings could lead to more effective transfer of medical knowledge and comprehension of treatment information. A\xa0newly developed VR technology is described called HealthVoyager which is designed to help facilitate this knowledge transfer between physicians and patients. The platform represents a\xa0customizable VR software system utilizing a\xa0smartphone or tablet computer to portray personalized surgical or procedural findings as well as representations of normal anatomy. The use of such technology for eliciting medical understanding and patient satisfaction can have many practical and clinical applications for a\xa0variety of disease states and patient populations. Using mobile virtual reality to enhance medical comprehension and satisfaction in patients and their families.
