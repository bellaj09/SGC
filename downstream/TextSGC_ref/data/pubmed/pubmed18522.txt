The authors examined the resolution of a discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive estimates of arm position in 10\xa0participants. The participants fixed their right shoulder at 0 30 or 60 of transverse adduction while they viewed a video on a head-mounted display that showed their right arm extended in front of the trunk for 30\xa0min. The perceived arm position more closely approached the seen arm position on the display as the difference between the actual and visually displayed arm positions increased. In the extreme case of a 90 discrepancy the seen arm position on the display was very gradually perceived as approaching the actual arm position. The magnitude of changes in sensory estimates was larger for proprioception 20% than for vision < 10%. Visual and Proprioceptive Adaptation of Arm Position in a Virtual Environment.
