Accurate segmentation of prostate and surrounding organs at risk is important for prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment planning. We present a fully automated workflow for male pelvic CT image segmentation using deep learning. The architecture consists of a 2D organ volume localization network followed by a 3D segmentation network for volumetric segmentation of prostate bladder rectum and femoral heads. We used a multi-channel 2D U-Net followed by a 3D U-Net with encoding arm modified with aggregated residual networks known as ResNeXt. The models were trained and tested on a pelvic CT image dataset comprising 136 patients. Test results show that 3D U-Net based segmentation achieves mean SD Dice coefficient values of 90 2.0% 96 3.0% 95 1.3% 95 1.5% and 84 3.7% for prostate left femoral head right femoral head bladder and rectum respectively using the proposed fully automated segmentation method.
