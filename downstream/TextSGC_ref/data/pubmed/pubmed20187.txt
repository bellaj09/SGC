"Virtual reality environments can introduce multiple and sometimes conflicting accommodative stimuli. For instance with the high-powered lenses commonly used in head-mounted displays small discrepancies in screen lens placement caused by manufacturer error or user adjustment focus error can change the focal depths of the image by a couple of diopters. This can introduce a binocular accommodative stimulus or if the displacement between the two screens is unequal an unequal anisometropic accommodative stimulus for the two eyes. Systems that allow simultaneous viewing of virtual and real images can also introduce a conflict in accommodative stimuli: When real and virtual images are at different focal planes both cannot be in focus at the same time though they may appear to be in similar locations in space. In this paper four unique designs are described that minimize the range of accommodative stimuli and maximize the visual systems ability to cope efficiently with the focus conflicts that remain: pinhole optics monocular lens addition combined with aniso-accommodation chromatic bifocal and bifocal lens system. The advantages and disadvantages of each design are described and recommendation for design choice is given after consideration of the end use of the virtual reality system e.g. low or high end entertainment technical or medical use. The appropriate design modifications should allow greater user comfort and better performance." Multiaccommodative stimuli in VR systems: problems & solutions.
