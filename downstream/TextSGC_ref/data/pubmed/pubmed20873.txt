The aim of this paper is to provide a first review of studies related to auditorily-induced self-motion vection. These studies have been scarce and scattered over the years and over several research communities including clinical audiology multisensory perception of self-motion and its neural correlates ergonomics and virtual reality. The reviewed studies provide evidence that auditorily-induced vection has behavioral physiological and neural correlates. Although the sound contribution to self-motion perception appears to be weaker than the visual modality specific acoustic cues appear to be instrumental for a number of domains including posture prosthesis navigation in unusual gravitoinertial environments in the air in space or underwater non-visual navigation and multisensory integration during self-motion. A number of open research questions are highlighted opening avenue for more active and systematic studies in this area. Auditorily-induced illusory self-motion: a review.
