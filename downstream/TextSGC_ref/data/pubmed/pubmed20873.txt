Existing evidence suggests that the default-mode network DMN and fronto-pariatal network FPN play an important role in altered states of consciousness. However the brain mechanisms underlying impaired consciousness and the specific network interactions involved are not well understood. We studied the topological properties of brain functional networks using resting-state functional MRI data acquired from 18 patients 11 vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome VS/UWS and 7 minimally conscious state MCS and compared these properties with those of healthy controls. We identified that the topological properties in DMN and FPN are anti-correlated which comes in part from the contribution of interactions between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the FPN and precuneus of the DMN. Notably altered nodal connectivity strength was distance-dependent with most disruptions appearing in long-distance connections within the FPN but in short-distance connections within the DMN. A multivariate pattern-classification analysis revealed that combination of topological patterns between the FPN and DMN could predict conscious state more effectively than connectivity within either network. Taken together our results imply distinct interactions between the FPN and DMN which may mediate conscious state.
