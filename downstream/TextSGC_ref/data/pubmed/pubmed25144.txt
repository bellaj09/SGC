"We recorded motor cortical activity using highdensity electrocorticogram ECoG from three patients during awake craniotomy. Subjects repeatedly executed hand flexion/extension tasks according to auditory instructions. Clear event-related desynchronization ERD in beta band 8-32 Hz and event-related synchronization ERS in gamma band 60-200 Hz were observed. High frequency band HFB: 60-200 Hz activation was found to be more localized compared to low frequency band LFB: 8-32 Hz activation in all subjects. Local spatial correlation maps in LFB and HFB were constructed by computing the correlation between channels. Local spatial correlation dropped more in the ERD/ERS areas consistently in two subjects. The results indicate that ERD/ERS patterns are more spatially uncorrelated and denser ECoG electrode is necessary within these areas to map uncorrelated `sources. High resolution electrodes might improve both clinical functional mapping and brain machine interface outcomes in the near future."
