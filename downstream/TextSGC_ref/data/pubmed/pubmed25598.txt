One of the most recent trends in technology field is the 360 technology. In order to investigate its potentiality for the evaluation of memory function we compared participants\ performance in two memory tasks between an encoding delivered through an immersive 360 environment and a non-immersive 360 one. Specifically we investigated if the immersive 360 environment would facilitate memory encoding in comparison to the non-immersive 360 one. Forty-two participants visualized two 360 pictures of a bedroom containing specific items and items shared by the two rooms either in the "non-immersive  immersive" order or in the "immersive  non-immersive" one. Results showed that the immersive set-up was able to strengthen the mnestic trace only when participants performed the tasks in the "non-immersive  immersive" order. A possible explanation is a potential familiarity with the technologies used to explore the 360 environments. Overall these results only partially supported the effectiveness of immersive 360 technology in facilitating episodic memory encoding; future studies should further explore the potentiality of this innovative technology.
