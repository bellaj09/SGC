"The brains body representation is amenable to rapid change even though we tend to think of our bodies as relatively fixed and stable. For example it has been shown that a life-sized body perceived in virtual reality as substituting the participants real body can be felt as if it were their own and that the body type can induce perceptual attitudinal and behavioral changes. Here we show that changes can also occur in cognitive processing and specifically executive functioning. Fifteen male participants were embodied in a virtual body that signifies super-intelligence Einstein and 15 in a Normal virtual body of similar age to their own. The Einstein body participants performed better on a cognitive task than the Normal body considering prior cognitive ability IQ with the improvement greatest for those with low self-esteem. Einstein embodiment also reduced implicit bias against older people. Hence virtual body ownership may additionally be used to enhance executive functioning." Virtually Being Einstein Results in an Improvement in Cognitive Task Performance and a Decrease in Age Bias.
