The task of discriminating the motor imagery of different movements within the same limb using electroencephalography EEG signals is challenging because these imaginary movements have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. There is however a pressing need to succeed in this task. The reason is that the ability to classify different same-limb imaginary movements could increase the number of control dimensions of a brain-computer interface BCI. In this paper we propose a 3-class BCI system that discriminates EEG signals corresponding to rest imaginary grasp movements and imaginary elbow movements. Besides the differences between simple motor imagery and goal-oriented motor imagery in terms of their topographical distributions and classification accuracies are also being investigated. To the best of our knowledge both problems have not been explored in the literature. Based on the EEG data recorded from 12 able-bodied individuals we have demonstrated that same-limb motor imagery classification is possible. For the binary classification of imaginary grasp and elbow goal-oriented movements the average accuracy achieved is 66.9%. For the 3-class problem of discriminating rest against imaginary grasp and elbow movements the average classification accuracy achieved is 60.7% which is greater than the random classification accuracy of 33.3%. Our results also show that goal-oriented imaginary elbow movements lead to a better classification performance compared to simple imaginary elbow movements. This proposed BCI system could potentially be used in controlling a robotic rehabilitation system which can assist stroke patients in performing task-specific exercises.
