Spatial or temporal aspects of neural organization are known to be important indices of how cognition is organized. However measurements and estimations are often noisy and many of the algorithms used are probabilistic which in combination have been argued to limit studies exploring the neural basis of specific aspects of cognition. Focusing on static and dynamic functional connectivity estimations we propose to leverage this variability to improve statistical efficiency in relating these estimations to behavior. To achieve this goal we use a procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process which can be repeated multiple times referred to as replications. Focusing on functional connectivity this noisy process can be: a computational for example when using an approximate inference algorithm for which different runs can produce different results or b observational if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of some underlying truth. In both cases we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process generating each replication. In this note we show how results can be combined instead of choosing just one of the estimated models. Using both simulations and real data we show the benefits of this approach in practice.
