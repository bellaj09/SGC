Objective: Axillary lymph node ALN metastasis status is important in guiding treatment in breast cancer. The aims were to assess how deep convolutional neural network CNN performed compared with radiomics analysis in predicting ALN metastasis using breast ultrasound and to investigate the value of both intratumoral and peritumoral regions in ALN metastasis prediction. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 479 breast cancer patients with 2395 breast ultrasound images. Based on the intratumoral peritumoral and combined intra- and peritumoral regions three CNNs were built using DenseNet and three radiomics models were built using random forest respectively. By combining the molecular subtype another three CNNs and three radiomics models were built. All models were built on training cohort 343 patients 1715 images and evaluated on testing cohort 136 patients 680 images with ROC analysis. Another prospective cohort of 16 patients was enrolled to further test the models. Results: AUCs of image-only CNNs in both training/testing cohorts were 0.957/0.912 for combined region 0.944/0.775 for peritumoral region and 0.937/0.748 for intratumoral region which were numerically higher than their corresponding radiomics models with AUCs of 0.940/0.886 0.920/0.724 and 0.913/0.693. The overall performance of image-molecular CNNs in terms of AUCs on training/testing cohorts slightly increased to 0.962/0.933 0.951/0.813 and 0.931/0.794 respectively. AUCs of both CNNs and radiomics models built on combined region were significantly better than those on either intratumoral or peritumoral region on the testing cohort p < 0.05. In the prospective study the CNN model built on combined region achieved the highest AUC of 0.95 among all image-only models. Conclusions: CNNs showed numerically better overall performance compared with radiomics models in predicting ALN metastasis in breast cancer. For both CNNs and radiomics models combining intratumoral and peritumoral regions achieved significantly better performance.
