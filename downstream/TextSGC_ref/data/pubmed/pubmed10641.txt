"The basolateral amygdala BLA and ventral hippocampal CA1 vCA1 are cellularly and functionally diverse along their anterior-posterior and superficial-deep axes. Here we find that anterior BLA aBLA and posterior BLA pBLA innervate deep-layer calbindin1-negative Calb1- and superficial-layer calbindin1-positive neurons Calb1+ in vCA1 respectively. Photostimulation of pBLA-vCA1 inputs has an anxiolytic effect in mice promoting approach behaviours during conflict exploratory tasks. By contrast stimulating aBLA-vCA1 inputs induces anxiety-like behaviour resulting in fewer approaches. During conflict stages of the elevated plus maze task vCA1Calb1+ neurons are preferentially activated at the open-to-closed arm transition and photostimulation of vCA1Calb1+ neurons at decision-making zones promotes approach with fewer retreats. In the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers disease which shows anxiety-like behaviour photostimulating the\xa0pBLA-vCA1Calb1+ circuit ameliorates the anxiety in a\xa0Calb1-dependent manner. These findings suggest the\xa0pBLA-vCA1Calb1+ circuit from heterogeneous BLA-vCA1 connections drives approach behaviour to reduce anxiety-like behaviour." Posterior basolateral amygdala to ventral hippocampal CA1 drives approach behaviour to exert an anxiolytic effect.
