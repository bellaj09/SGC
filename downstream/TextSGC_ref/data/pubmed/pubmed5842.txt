The use of resting-state functional MRI rsfMRI in preclinical research is expanding progressively with the majority of resting-state imaging performed in anesthetized animals. Since anesthesia may change the physiology and in particular the neuronal activity of an animal considerably it may also affect rsfMRI findings. Therefore this study compared rsfMRI data from awake mice with rsfMRI results obtained from mice anesthetized with -chloralose 120 mg/kg urethane 2.5 g/kg or isoflurane 1%. Different anesthesia regimes modulate the functional connectivity outcome in mice.
