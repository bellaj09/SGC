"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF modulates neuropeptide levels in hippocampus and cortex of young adult rats. Neuropeptide levels are altered in some age-related disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons Disease. BDNF may be able to rectify peptide abnormalities but because plasticity decreases with age BDNF may not alter peptide levels as readily in aged animals. To determine if BDNF would regulate peptide levels in aged rats young aged memory-impaired and unimpaired rats were infused with BDNF or vehicle into hippocampus and cortex. Cell profile counts cell profile areas fiber counts and/or fiber terminal densities were measured for sections immunostained for neuropeptide Y NPY somatostatin SOM cholecystokinin-8 CCK and dynorphin A1-8 DYN. Results showed that BDNF upregulated cortical NPY-immunoreactivity ir and SOM-ir upregulated hippocampal NPY-ir and downregulated hippocampal DYN-ir in both aged and young rats. In addition BDNF significantly and selectively normalized the areas of atrophied deep cortical CCK-ir cell profiles in aged-impaired rats. Finally decreased CCK-ir fiber density was found in the hippocampal formation of aged memory-impaired rats."
