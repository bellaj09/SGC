"We propose that human reasoning relies on an inherence heuristic an implicit cognitive process that leads people to explain observed patterns e.g. girls wear pink predominantly in terms of the inherent features of their constituents e.g. pink is a delicate color. We then demonstrate how this proposed heuristic can provide a unified account for a broad set of findings spanning areas of research that might at first appear unrelated e.g. system justification nominal realism is-ought errors in moral reasoning. By revealing the deep commonalities among the diverse phenomena that fall under its scope our account is able to generate new insights into these phenomena as well as new empirical predictions. A second main goal of this article aside from introducing the inherence heuristic is to articulate the proposal that the heuristic serves as a foundation for the development of psychological essentialism. More specifically we propose that essentialism - which is the common belief that natural and social categories are underlain by hidden causally powerful essences - emerges over the first few years of life as an elaboration of the earlier and more open-ended intuitions supplied by the inherence heuristic. In the final part of the report we distinguish our proposal from competing accounts e.g. Strevenss K-laws and clarify the relationship between the inherence heuristic and related cognitive tendencies e.g. the correspondence bias. In sum this article illuminates a basic cognitive process that emerges early in life and is likely to have profound effects on many aspects of human psychology." The inherence heuristic: an intuitive means of making sense of the world and a potential precursor to psychological essentialism.
