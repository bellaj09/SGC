"Increased oscillatory activities in the beta frequency band 13-30 Hz in the subthalamic nucleus STN and in particular prolonged episodes of increased synchrony in this frequency band have been associated with motor symptoms such as bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinsons disease PD. Numerous studies have investigated sensorimotor cortical beta oscillations either as a control signal for Brain Computer Interfaces BCI or as target signal for neurofeedback training NFB. However it still remains unknown whether patients with PD can gain control of the pathological oscillations recorded from a subcortical site - the STN - with neurofeedback training. We tried to address this question in the current study. Specifically we designed a simple basketball game in which the position of a basketball changes based on the occurrence of events of temporally increased beta power quantified in real-time. Participants practised in the game to control the position of the basketball which requires modulation of the beta oscillations recorded from STN local field potentials LFPs. Our results suggest that it is possible to use neurofeedback training for PD patients to downregulate pathological beta oscillations in STN LFPs and that this can lead to a reduction of beta oscillations in the cortical-STN motor network."
