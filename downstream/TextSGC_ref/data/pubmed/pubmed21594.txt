This case series evaluated the use of virtual reality hypnosis VRH for the treatment of pain associated with multiple fractures from traumatic injuries. VRH treatment was administered on 2 consecutive days and pain and anxiety were assessed each day before and after VRH treatment as well as on Day 3 which was 24 hours after the second treatment session. Pain reduction from baseline to Day 3 was from 70% to 30% despite opioid analgesic use remaining stable. The subjective pain reduction reported by patients was encouraging and the results of this case series suggest the importance of further study of VRH with larger samples using randomized controlled trials.
