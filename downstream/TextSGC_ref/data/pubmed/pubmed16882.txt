"The subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation Parkinsons disease patient model seems to represent a unique opportunity for studying the functional role of the basal ganglia and notably the subthalamic nucleus in human emotional processing. Indeed in addition to constituting a therapeutic advance for severely disabled Parkinsons disease patients deep brain stimulation is a technique which selectively modulates the activity of focal structures targeted by surgery. There is growing evidence of a link between emotional impairments and deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. In this context according to the definition of emotional processing exposed in the companion paper available in this issue the aim of the present review will consist in providing a synopsis of the studies that investigated the emotional disturbances observed in subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation Parkinsons disease patients. This review leads to the conclusion that several emotional components would be disrupted after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinsons disease: subjective feeling neurophysiological activation and motor expression. Finally after a description of the limitations of this study model we discuss the functional role of the subthalamic nucleus and the striato-thalamo-cortical circuits in which it is involved in emotional processing. It seems reasonable to conclude that the striato-thalamo-cortical circuits are indeed involved in emotional processing and that the subthalamic nucleus plays a central in role the human emotional architecture."
