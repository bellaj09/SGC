We have previously demonstrated a brain-machine interface neuroprosthetic system that provided continuous control of functional electrical stimulation FES and restoration of grasp in a primate model of spinal cord injury SCI. Predicting intended EMG directly from cortical recordings provides a flexible high-dimensional control signal for FES. However no peripheral signal such as force or EMG is available for training EMG decoders in paralyzed individuals. Adaptive neuron-to-EMG decoder training for FES neuroprostheses.
