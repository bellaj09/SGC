Previous studies have characterized the brain regions involved in encoding monetary reward and punishment outcomes. The question of how this information is integrated across brain regions has received less attention. Here we investigated changes in effective connectivity related to the processing of positive and negative monetary outcomes using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. Specifically subjects engaged in a card guessing game which could yield win loss or neutral outcomes. A general linear model was used to define a network of regions involved in win and loss outcome processing including anterior insula anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum. Dynamic causal modelling DCM was implemented to study between-region couplings and outcome-related modulations thereof within this network. In addition we explored the relation between effective connectivity patterns and choice behavior in the gambling task. Parametric empirical Bayesian modelling was conducted for group-level inferences of both DCM and the choice behavior. Behaviorally both win and loss outcomes increased the probability of choice switches in subsequent gambles. In terms of connectivity win outcomes were associated with increased extrinsic connectivity across the network while loss outcomes featured a balance between increased and decreased extrinsic connectivity. Moreover self-inhibitory connections tended to decrease for both win and loss outcomes. Interestingly a substantial discrepancy was observed for occipital cortex connectivity which was characterized by intrinsic disinhibition in loss but not in win trials. The observed differences in effective connectivity during the processing of positive and negative outcomes despite similarities in average regional activity and choice behavior highlight the value of exploring network dynamics in the context of incentive manipulations.
