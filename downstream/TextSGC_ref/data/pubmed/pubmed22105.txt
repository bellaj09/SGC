With the rapid development of deep learning technology and other powerful tools 3D object detection has made great progress and become one of the fastest growing field in computer vision. Many automated applications such as robotic navigation autonomous driving and virtual or augmented reality system require estimation of accurate 3D object location and detection. Under this requirement many methods have been proposed to improve the performance of 3D object localization and detection. Despite recent efforts 3D object detection is still a very challenging task due to occlusion viewpoint variations scale changes and limited information in 3D scenes. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of recent state-of-the-art approaches in 3D object detection technology. We start with some basic concepts then describe some of the available datasets that are designed to facilitate the performance evaluation of 3D object detection algorithms. Next we will review the state-of-the-art technologies in this area highlighting their contributions importance and limitations as a guide for future research. Finally we provide a quantitative comparison of the results of the state-of-the-art methods on the popular public datasets.
