Effective frequency recognition algorithms are critical in steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. In this study we present a hierarchical feature fusion framework which can be used to design high-performance frequency recognition methods. The proposed framework includes two primary techniques for fusing features: spatial dimension fusion SD and frequency dimension fusion FD. Both SD and FD fusions are obtained using a weighted strategy with a nonlinear function. To assess our novel methods we used the correlated component analysis CORRCA method to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results were obtained from a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects and indicate that the extended CORRCA method used within the framework significantly outperforms the original CORCCA method. Accordingly the proposed framework holds promise to enhance the performance of frequency recognition methods in SSVEP-based BCIs.
