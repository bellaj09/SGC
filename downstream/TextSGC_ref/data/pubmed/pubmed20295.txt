According to literature virtual reality was found to reduce pain and kinesiophobia in patients with chronic pain. The purpose of the study was to investigate short-term effect of the virtual reality on pain function and kinesiophobia in patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain METHODS: This randomised controlled study in which 44 patients were randomly assigned to the traditional physiotherapy control group 22 subjects or virtual walking integrated physiotherapy experimental group 22 subjects. Before and after treatment Visual Analog Scale VAS TAMPA Kinesiophobia Scale TKS Oswestry Disability Index ODI Nottingham Health Profile NHP Timed-up and go Test TUG 6-Minute Walk Test 6MWT and Single-Leg Balance Test were assessed. The interaction effect between group and time was assessed by using repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Is physiotherapy integrated virtual walking effective on pain function and kinesiophobia in patients with non-specific low-back pain? Randomised controlled trial.
