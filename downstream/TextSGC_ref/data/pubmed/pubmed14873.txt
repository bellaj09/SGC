It is currently not well understood whether people experience themselves to be located in one or more specific parts of their body. Virtual reality VR is increasingly used as a tool to study aspects of bodily perception and self-consciousness due to its strong experimental control and ease in manipulating multi-sensory aspects of bodily experience. To investigate where people self-locate in their body within virtual reality we asked participants to point directly at themselves with a virtual pointer in a VR headset. In previous work employing a physical pointer participants mainly located themselves in the upper face and upper torso. In this study using a VR headset participants mainly located themselves in the upper face. In an additional body template task where participants pointed at themselves on a picture of a simple body outline participants pointed most often to the upper torso followed by the upper face. These results raise the question as to whether head-mounted virtual reality might alter where people locate themselves making them more "head-centred". Where am I in virtual reality?
