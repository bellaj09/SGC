This study included 658 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Forty-two 6.4% out of 658 patients presented with ketosis on admission with no obvious fever or diarrhea. They had a median age of 47.0\u2009years IQR 38.0-70.3 while 16 38.1% were men. Patients with ketosis were younger median age: 47.0 vs 58.0\u2009years P\xa0=\xa00.003 and had greater prevalence of fatigue 31.0% vs 10.6% P\u2009<\u20090.001 diabetes 35.7% vs 18.5% P\xa0=\xa00.007 and digestive disorders 31.0% vs 12.0% P\u2009<\u20090.001. However they had longer length of hospital stay 19.0 12.8-33.3 days vs 16.0 10.0-24.0 days P\u2009<\u20090.001 and higher mortality rate 21.4% vs 8.9% P\xa0=\xa00.017. Three 20.0% out of the 15 cases with diabetic ketosis developed acidosis 5 cases 26.7% with diabetic ketosis died and one 25.0% of the deaths presented with acidosis. Two 7.4% and four 14.3% cases of the 27 non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died respectively and one 25.0% of the deaths presented with acidosis. This suggested that COVID-19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis and induced DKA for those patients with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. Meanwhile diabetes increased the length of hospital stay for patients with ketosis but had no effect on their mortality. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
