Evolving debate suggests that C-reactive protein CRP might be associated with the development of venous thromboembolism VTE; however the evidence is conflicting. We aimed to assess the prospective association of CRP with VTE risk. C-reactive protein was measured in serum samples at baseline from 2420 men aged 42-61\xa0years from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease study. Within-person variability in CRP levels was corrected for using repeat measurements of CRP taken 11\xa0years after baseline. Incident VTE events n\xa0=\xa0119 were recorded during a median follow-up of 24.7\xa0years. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio for loge CRP was 0.57 95% confidence interval CIs: 0.51-0.64. In age-adjusted Cox regression analysis the hazard ratio 95% CIs for VTE per 1 standard deviation SD increase in loge baseline CRP was 1.17 0.98-1.40. Further adjustment for several established and emerging risk factors did not alter the association. In a meta-analysis of nine population-based studies including the current study comprising 81625 participants and 2225 VTE cases the fully-adjusted risk estimate for VTE was 1.14 1.08-1.19 per SD increase in loge baseline CRP. In a pooled dose-response analysis a linear association between CRP and VTE risk was suggested P for nonlinearity\xa0=\xa00.272. The pooled risk estimate for VTE per 5\xa0mg/l increment in CRP levels was 1.23 1.09-1.38. C-reactive protein was only modestly associated with VTE risk in the primary analysis. Pooled evidence however suggests that elevated CRP is associated with greater VTE risk consistent with a linear dose-response relationship. Serum C-reactive protein increases the risk of venous thromboembolism: a prospective study and meta-analysis of published prospective evidence.
