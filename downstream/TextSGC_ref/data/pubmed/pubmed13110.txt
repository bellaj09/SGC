Water octanol partition coefficient serves as a measure for the lipophilicity of a molecule and is important in the field of drug discovery. A novel method for computational prediction of logarithm of partition coefficient logP has been developed using molecular fingerprints and a deep neural network. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset of 12000 molecules and tested on 2000 molecules. In this article we present our results for the blind prediction of logP for the SAMPL6 challenge. While the best submission achieved a RMSE of 0.41 logP units our submission had a RMSE of 0.61 logP units. Overall we ranked in the top quarter out of the 92 submissions that were made. Our results show that the deep learning model can be used as a fast accurate and robust method for high throughput prediction of logP of small molecules. A deep learning approach for the blind logP prediction in SAMPL6 challenge.
