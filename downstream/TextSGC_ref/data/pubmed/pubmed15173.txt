The objective is to test automated in vivo estimation of active and passive skeletal muscle states using ultrasonic imaging. Current technology electromyography dynamometry shear wave imaging provides no general non-invasive method for online estimation of skeletal muscle states. Ultrasound US allows non-invasive imaging of muscle yet current computational approaches have never achieved simultaneous extraction or generalization of independently varying active and passive states. We use deep learning to investigate the generalizable content of two-dimensional 2D US muscle images. US data synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles with measures of joint moment/angle were recorded from 32 healthy participants seven female; ages: 27.5 19-65. We extracted a region of interest of medial gastrocnemius and soleus using our prior developed accurate segmentation algorithm. From the segmented images a deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict three absolute drift-free components of the neurobiomechanical state activity joint angle joint moment during experimentally designed simultaneous independent variation of passive joint angle and active electromyography inputs. For all 32 held-out participants 16-fold cross-validation the ankle joint angle electromyography and joint moment were estimated to accuracy 55  8% 57  11% and 46  9% respectively. With 2D US imaging deep neural networks can encode in generalizable form the activity-length-tension state relationship of these muscles. Observation-only low-power 2D US imaging can provide a new category of technology for non-invasive estimation of neural output length and tension in skeletal muscle. This proof of principle has value for personalized muscle assessment in pain injury neurological conditions neuropathies myopathies and ageing.
