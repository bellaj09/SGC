Visual P300-based brain-computer interface spellers offer a useful communication channel for locked-in patients who are completely dependent in their daily lives. One of the research goals for these systems is to achieve greater communication rates by means of modifying some features of their interfaces e.g. reducing the matrix size. However such modifications may not work well with disabled end-users such as patients of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS due to a supposed reduction of their cognitive resources. The purpose of the present study was to provide a proof of concept that ALS patients could efficiently use a P300-based speller with a 4  3 symbol matrix based on the T9 interface developed for mobile phones. Initial test of a T9-like P300-based speller by an ALS patient.
