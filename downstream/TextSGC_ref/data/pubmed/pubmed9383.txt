Identification of enhancer-promoter interactions EPIs is of great significance to human development. However experimental methods to identify EPIs cost too much in terms of time manpower and money. Therefore more and more research efforts are focused on developing computational methods to solve this problem. Unfortunately most existing computational methods require a variety of genomic data which are not always available especially for a new cell line. Therefore it limits the large-scale practical application of methods. As an alternative computational methods using sequences only have great genome-scale application prospects. Identifying enhancer-promoter interactions with neural network based on pre-trained DNA vectors and attention mechanism.
