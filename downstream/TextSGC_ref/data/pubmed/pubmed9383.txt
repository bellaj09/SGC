"DNA-binding proteins play pivotal roles in alternative splicing RNA editing methylating and many other biological functions for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes. Predicting the functions of these proteins from primary amino acids sequences is becoming one of the major challenges in functional annotations of genomes. Traditional prediction methods often devote themselves to extracting physiochemical features from sequences but ignoring motif information and location information between motifs. Meanwhile the small scale of data volumes and large noises in training data result in lower accuracy and reliability of predictions. In this paper we propose a deep learning based method to identify DNA-binding proteins from primary sequences alone. It utilizes two stages of convolutional neutral network to detect the function domains of protein sequences and the long short-term memory neural network to identify their long term dependencies an binary cross entropy to evaluate the quality of the neural networks. When the proposed method is tested with a realistic DNA binding protein dataset it achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.2% at the Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.961. Compared with the LibSVM on the arabidopsis and yeast datasets via independent tests the accuracy raises by 9% and 4% respectively. Comparative experiments using different feature extraction methods show that our model performs similar accuracy with the best of others but its values of sensitivity specificity and AUC increase by 27.83% 1.31% and 16.21% respectively. Those results suggest that our method is a promising tool for identifying DNA-binding proteins." On the prediction of DNA-binding proteins only from primary sequences: A deep learning approach.
