Individuals with cervical spinal cord injury SCI that causes tetraplegia are challenged with dramatic sensorimotor deficits. However certain rehabilitation techniques may significantly enhance their autonomy by restoring reach-to-grasp movements. Among others evidence of motor imagery MI benefits for neurological rehabilitation of upper limb movements is growing. This literature review addresses MI effectiveness during reach-to-grasp rehabilitation after tetraplegia. Among articles from MEDLINE published between 1966 and 2015 we selected ten studies including 34 participants with C4 to C7 tetraplegia and 22 healthy controls published during the last 15 years. We found that MI of possible non-paralyzed movements improved reach-to-grasp performance by: i increasing both tenodesis grasp capabilities and muscle strength; ii decreasing movement time MT and trajectory variability; and iii reducing the abnormally increased brain activity. MI can also strengthen motor commands by potentiating recruitment and synchronization of motoneurons which leads to improved recovery. These improvements reflect brain adaptations induced by MI. Furthermore MI can be used to control brain-computer interfaces BCI that successfully restore grasp capabilities. These results highlight the growing interest for MI and its potential to recover functional grasping in individuals with tetraplegia and motivate the need for further studies to substantiate it. Motor imagery reinforces brain compensation of reach-to-grasp movement after cervical spinal cord injury.
