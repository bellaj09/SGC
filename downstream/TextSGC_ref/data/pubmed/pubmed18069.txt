"The aim of this study was to compare the impact of case-based learning CBL and lecture-based learning LBL on fourth-year dental students clinical decision making by using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcome SOLO taxonomy. Participants in the study were fourth-year dental students n=55 in academic year 2012-13 taught in a large-group LBL context and fourth-year dental students n=54 in academic year 2013-14 taught with the CBL methodology; both took place in the oral diseases course at Yeditepe University Faculty of Dentistry Istanbul Turkey. All eligible students participated for a 100 percent response rate. A real case was presented to the students in both groups to assess their clinical decision making on the topic of oral diseases. Their performance was evaluated with the SOLO taxonomy. Student t-test was used for statistical evaluation and significance was set at the p<0.05 level. A statistically significant difference was found between the mean scores of the relational and extended abstract categories of the CBL and LBL groups p<0.05. Students who were taught with CBL had higher scores at the top two levels of the SOLO taxonomy than students taught with LBL. These findings suggest that an integrated case-based curriculum may be effective in promoting students deep learning and it holds promise for better integration of clinical cases likely to be encountered during independent practice."
