Neuronal cell bodies mostly reside in the cerebral cortex. The study of this thin and highly convoluted surface is essential for understanding how the brain works. The analysis of surface data is however challenging due to the high variability of the cortical geometry. This paper presents a novel approach for learning and exploiting surface data directly across multiple surface domains. Current approaches rely on geometrical simplifications such as spherical inflations a popular but costly process. For instance the widely used FreeSurfer takes about 3\xa0hours to parcellate brain surfaces on a standard machine. Direct learning of surface data via graph convolutions would provide a new family of fast algorithms for processing brain surfaces. However the current limitation of existing state-of-the-art approaches is their inability to compare surface data across different surface domains. Surface bases are indeed incompatible between brain geometries. This paper leverages recent advances in spectral graph matching to transfer surface data across aligned spectral domains. This novel approach enables direct learning of surface data across compatible surface bases. It exploits spectral filters over intrinsic representations of surface neighborhoods. We illustrate the benefits of this approach with an application to brain parcellation. We validate the algorithm over 101 manually labeled brain surfaces. The results show a significant improvement in labeling accuracy over recent Euclidean approaches while gaining a drastic speed improvement over conventional methods.
