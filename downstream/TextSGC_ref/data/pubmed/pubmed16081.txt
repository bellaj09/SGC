Two questionnaires were developed to investigate the workplace learning of physicians. The Approaches to Work Questionnaire for Physicians and the Workplace Climate Questionnaire for Physicians were adapted from general measures developed by Kirby Knapper Evans Carty and Gadula. These questionnaires were administered to a random sample of Ontario physicians. Consistent with the results of Kirby et al. three dimensions of approaches to work were observed: Deep. Surface-Rational and Surface-Disorganized. Three dimensions of workplace climate were also found Supportive-Receptive Choice-Independence and Workload. Results indicate that physicians adopt primarily a Deep approach to work but that there is a smaller tendency toward Surface-Disorganized learning one that is strongly correlated with perceptions of heavy workload. The Deep approach was associated with work environments perceived to be Supportive-Receptive and offer Choice-Independence. The use of these questionnaires in research and practice is discussed.
