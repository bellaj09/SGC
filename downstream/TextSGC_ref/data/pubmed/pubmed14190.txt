Histologic subtypes of malignant pleural mesothelioma are a major prognostic indicator and decision denominator for all therapeutic strategies. In an ambiguous case a rare transitional mesothelioma TM pattern may be diagnosed by pathologists either as epithelioid mesothelioma EM biphasic mesothelioma BM or sarcomatoid mesothelioma SM. This study aimed to better characterize the TM subtype from a histological immunohistochemical and molecular standpoint. Deep learning of pathologic slides was applied to this cohort.
