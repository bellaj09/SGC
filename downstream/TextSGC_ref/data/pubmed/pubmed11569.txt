Pneumothorax can precipitate a life-threatening emergency due to lung collapse and respiratory or circulatory distress. Pneumothorax is typically detected on chest X-ray; however treatment is reliant on timely review of radiographs. Since current imaging volumes may result in long worklists of radiographs awaiting review an automated method of prioritizing X-rays with pneumothorax may reduce time to treatment. Our objective was to create a large human-annotated dataset of chest X-rays containing pneumothorax and to train deep convolutional networks to screen for potentially emergent moderate or large pneumothorax at the time of image acquisition. Automated detection of moderate and large pneumothorax on frontal chest X-rays using deep convolutional neural networks: A retrospective study.
