A fluorescent emitter simultaneously transmits its identity location and cellular context through its emission pattern. We developed smNet a deep neural network for multiplexed single-molecule analysis to retrieve such information with high accuracy. We demonstrate that smNet can extract three-dimensional molecule location orientation and wavefront distortion with precision approaching the theoretical limit and therefore will allow multiplexed measurements through the emission pattern of a single molecule.
