Brain-computer interface BCI technology aims to provide individuals with paralysis a means to restore function. Electrocorticography ECoG uses disc electrodes placed on either the surface of the dura or the cortex to record field potential activity. ECoG has been proposed as a viable neural recording modality for BCI systems potentially providing stable long-term recordings of cortical activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Previously we have demonstrated that a subject with spinal cord injury SCI could control an ECoG-based BCI system with up to three degrees of freedom Wang et al 2013 PLoS One. Here we expand upon these findings by including brain-control results from two additional subjects with upper-limb paralysis due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and brachial plexus injury and investigate the potential of motor and somatosensory cortical areas to enable BCI control. Remapping cortical modulation for electrocorticographic brain-computer interfaces: a somatotopy-based approach in individuals with upper-limb paralysis.
