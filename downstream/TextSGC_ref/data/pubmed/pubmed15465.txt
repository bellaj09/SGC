"Although functional brain imaging has been used for the early and objective assessment of cognitive dysfunction there is a lack of generalized image-based biomarker which can evaluate individuals cognitive dysfunction in various disorders. To this end we developed a deep learning-based cognitive signature of FDG brain PET adaptable for Parkinsons disease PD as well as Alzheimers disease AD."
