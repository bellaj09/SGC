Here we present an electroencephalographic EEG collection of 71-channel datasets recorded from 14 subjects 7 males 7 females aged 20-40 years while performing a visual working memory task with a T set of 150 Independent Component Analysis ICA decompositions by Extended Infomax using RELICA each on a bootstrap resampling of the data. These data are linked to the paper "Applying dimension reduction to EEG data by Principal Component Analysis reduces the quality of its subsequent Independent Component decomposition" 1. Independent components ICs are clustered within subject and thereby associated with a quality index QIc measure of their stability to data resampling. Sets of single ICA decompositions obtained after applying Principal Component Analysis PCA to the data to perform dimension reduction retaining 85% 95% 99% of data variance are also included as are the positions of the best fitting equivalent dipoles for ICs whose scalp projections are compatible with a compact brain source. These bootstrap ICs may be used as benchmarks for different data preprocessing pipelines and/or ICA algorithms allowing investigation of the effects that noise or insufficient data have on the quality of ICA decompositions. A visual working memory dataset collection with bootstrap Independent Component Analysis for comparison of electroencephalographic preprocessing pipelines.
