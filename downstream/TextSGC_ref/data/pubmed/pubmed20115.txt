Virtual reality VR is a potentially promising tool for enhancing real-world locomotion in individuals with mobility impairment through its ability to provide personalized performance feedback and simulate real-world challenges. However it is unknown whether novel locomotor skills learned in VR show sustained transfer to the real world. Here as an initial step towards developing a VR-based clinical intervention we study how young adults learn and transfer a treadmill-based virtual obstacle negotiation skill to the real world. Locomotor skill acquisition in virtual reality shows sustained transfer to the real world.
