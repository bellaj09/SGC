Considering the fact that points of interest on 3D shapes can be discriminated from a geometric perspective it is reasonable to map the geometric signature of a point $p$p to a probability value encoding to what degree $p$p is a point of interest especially for a specific class of 3D shapes. Based on the observation we propose a three-phase algorithm for learning and predicting points of interest on 3D shapes by using multiple feature descriptors. Our algorithm requires two separate deep neural networks stacked auto-encoders to accomplish the task. During the first phase we predict the membership of the given 3D shape according to a set of geometric descriptors using a deep neural network. After that we train the other deep neural network to predict a probability distribution defined on the surface representing the possibility of a point being a point of interest. Finally we use a manifold clustering technique to extract a set of points of interest as the output. Experimental results show superior detection performance of the proposed method over the previous state-of-the-art approaches.
