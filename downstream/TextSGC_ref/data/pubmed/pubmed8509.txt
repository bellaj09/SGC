Optical coherence tomography OCT is used to produce high resolution depth images of the retina and is now the standard of care for in-vivo ophthalmological assessment. In particular OCT is used to study the changes in layer thickness across various pathologies. The automated image analysis of these OCT images has primarily been performed with graph based methods. Despite the preeminence of graph based methods deep learning based approaches have begun to appear within the literature. Unfortunately they cannot currently guarantee the strict biological tissue order found in human retinas. We propose a cascaded fully convolutional network FCN framework to segment eight retina layers and preserve the topological relationships between the layers. The first FCN serves as a segmentation network which takes retina images as input and outputs the segmentation probability maps of the layers. We next perform a topology check on the segmentation and those patches that do not satisfy the topology criterion are passed to a second FCN for topology correction. The FCNs have been trained on Heidelberg Spectralis images and validated on both Heidelberg Spectralis and Zeiss Cirrus images.
