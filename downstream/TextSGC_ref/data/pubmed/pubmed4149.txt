Sensory information processing and higher cognitive functions rely on the interactions between thalamus and cortex. Many types of neurological and psychiatric disorders are accompanied or driven by alterations in the brain connectivity. In this study putative changes in functional and effective corticocortical CC thalamocortical TC and corticothalamic CT connectivity during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep SWS in a model of thalamocortical dysrhythmia TRIP8b-/- mice and in control wild-type or WT mice are described. Coherence and nonlinear Granger causality GC were calculated for twenty 10\u2009s length epochs of SWS and active wakefulness AW of each animal. Coherence was reduced between 4 and ca 20\u2009Hz in the cortex and between cortex and thalamus during SWS compared with AW in WT but not in TRIP8b-/- mice. Moreover TRIP8b-/- mice showed lower CT coherence during AW compared with WT mice; these differences were no longer present during SWS. Unconditional GC analysis also showed sleep-related reductions in TC and CT couplings in WT mice while TRIP8b-/- mice showed diminished wake and enhanced sleep CC coupling and rather strong CT-directed coupling during wake and sleep although smaller during sleep. Conditional GC coupling analysis confirmed the diminished CC and enhanced CT coupling in TRIP8b-/- mice. Our findings indicate that altered properties of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels characterizing TRIP8b-/- mice have clear effects on CC TC and CT networks. A more complete understanding of the function of the altered communication within these networks awaits detailed phenotyping of TRIP8b-/- mice aimed at specifics of sensory and attentional processes.
