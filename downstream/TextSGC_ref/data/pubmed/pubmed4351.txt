The purported role of the cerebellum has shifted from one that is exclusively sensorimotor related to one that encompasses a wide range of cognitive and associative functions 1-5. Within sensorimotor areas of the cerebellum functional organization is characterized by ipsilateral representations of the body 6. Yet in the remaining cerebellar cognitive and associative networks functional organization remains less well understood. Regions of cerebral cortex 7-9 and subcortex 10 important for visual perception and cognition are organized topographically: neural organization mirrors the retina. Recently it was shown that known retinotopic areas in cerebral cortex are functionally connected to nodes in the cerebellum 2\xa011\xa012. In fact this revealed signals with visuospatial selectivity in the cerebellum 13. Here we analyzed the highly powered Human Connectome Project HCP retinotopy dataset 14 to create a comprehensive and detailed overview of visuospatial organization in the cerebellum. This revealed 5 ipsilateral topographic maps in 3 cerebellar clusters oculomotor vermis OMV-lobule VIIb-lobule VIIIb of which we quantified visual field coverage and topography. These quantifications dovetail with the known roles of these areas in eye movements OMV 5 15 attention OMV-VIIb 5 13 working memory VIIb 13 and\xa0the integration of visuomotor information with respect to effector movements VIIIb 5. To aid future research on visual perception in the cerebellum we provide an online atlas of the visuospatial maps in Montreal Neurological Institute MNI space. Our findings demonstrate that the cerebellum is abundant with visuospatial information and moreover that it is organized according to known retinotopic properties.
