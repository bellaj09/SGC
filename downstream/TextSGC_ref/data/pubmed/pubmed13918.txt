Accurate detection of end-systolic ES and end-diastolic ED frames in an echocardiographic cine series can be difficult but necessary pre-processing step for the development of automatic systems to measure cardiac parameters. The detection task is challenging due to variations in cardiac anatomy and heart rate often associated with pathological conditions. We formulate this problem as a regression problem and propose several deep learning-based architectures that minimize a novel global extrema structured loss function to localize the ED and ES frames. The proposed architectures integrate convolution neural networks CNNs-based image feature extraction model and recurrent neural networks RNNs to model temporal dependencies between each frame in a sequence. We explore two CNN architectures: DenseNet and ResNet and four RNN architectures: long short-term memory bi-directional LSTM gated recurrent unit GRU and Bi-GRU and compare the performance of these models. The optimal deep learning model consists of a DenseNet and GRU trained with the proposed loss function. On average we achieved 0.20 and 1.43 frame mismatch for the ED and ES frames respectively which are within reported inter-observer variability for the manual detection of these frames.
