The extracellular matrix ECM plays an important role in supporting tissues and organs. It even has a functional role in morphogenesis and differentiation by acting as a source of active molecules matrikines. Many diseases are linked to dysfunction of ECM components and fragments or changes in their structures. As such it is a prime target for drugs. Because of technological limitations for observations at mesoscopic scales the precise structural organisation of the ECM is not well-known with sparse or fuzzy experimental observables. Based on the Unity3D game and physics engines along with rigid body dynamics we propose a virtual sandbox to model large biological molecules as dynamic chains of rigid bodies interacting together to gain insight into ECM components behaviour in the mesoscopic range. We have preliminary results showing how parameters such as fibre flexibility or the nature and number of interactions between molecules can induce different structures in the basement membrane. Using the Unity3D game engine and virtual reality headset coupled with haptic controllers we immerse the user inside the corresponding simulation. Untrained users are able to navigate a complex virtual sandbox crowded with large biomolecules models in a matter of seconds. Mesoscopic Rigid Body Modelling of the Extracellular Matrix Self-Assembly.
