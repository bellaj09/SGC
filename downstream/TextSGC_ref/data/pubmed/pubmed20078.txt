The effects of stroke differ considerably in degree and symptoms for different patients. It has been shown that specific individualized and varied therapy favors recovery. The Rehabilitation Gaming System RGS is a Virtual Reality VR based rehabilitation system designed following these principles. We have developed two algorithms to control the level of task difficulty that a user of the RGS is exposed to as well as providing controlled variation in the therapy. In this paper we compare the two algorithms by running numerical simulations and a study with healthy subjects. We show that both algorithms allow for individualization of the challenge level of the task. Further the results reveal that the algorithm that iteratively learns a user model for each subject also allows a high variation of the task.
