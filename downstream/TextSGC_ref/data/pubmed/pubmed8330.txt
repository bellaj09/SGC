By localizing microbubbles MBs in the vasculature ultrasound localization microscopy ULM has recently been proposed which greatly improves the spatial resolution of ultrasound US imaging and will be helpful for clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless several challenges remain in fast ULM imaging. The main problems are that current localization methods used to implement fast ULM imaging e.g. a previously reported localization method based on sparse recovery CS-ULM suffer from long data-processing time and exhaustive parameter tuning optimization. To address these problems in this paper we propose a ULM method based on deep learning which is achieved by using a modified sub-pixel convolutional neural network CNN termed as mSPCN-ULM. Simulations and in vivo experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of mSPCN-ULM. Simulation results show that even if under high-density condition 6.4 MBs/mm2 a high localization precision  28 lm in the lateral direction and 24 lm in the axial direction and a high localization reliability Jaccard index of 0.66 can be obtained by mSPCN-ULM compared to CS-ULM. The in vivo experimental results indicate that with plane wave scan at a transmit center frequency of 15.625 MHz microvessels with diameters of 17 lm can be detected and adjacent microvessels with a distance of 42 lm can be separated. Furthermore when using GPU acceleration the data-processing time of mSPCN-ULM can be shortened to 6 sec/frame in the simulations and 23 sec/frame in the in vivo experiments which is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than CS-ULM. Finally once the network is trainedmSPCN-ULM does not need parameter tuning to implement ULM. As a result mSPCN-ULM opens the door to implement ULM with fast data-processing speed high imaging accuracy short data-acquisition time and high flexibility robustness to parameters characteristics.
