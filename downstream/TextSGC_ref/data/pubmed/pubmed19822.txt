"Poststroke hemiplegic patients often show altered weight distribution with balance disorders increasing their risk of fall. Conventional balance training though powerful suffers from scarcity of trained therapists frequent visits to clinics to get therapy one-on-one therapy sessions and monotony of repetitive exercise tasks. Thus technology-assisted balance rehabilitation can be an alternative solution. Here we chose virtual reality as a technology-based platform to develop motivating balance tasks. This platform was augmented with off-the-shelf available sensors such as Nintendo Wii balance board and Kinect to estimate ones center of mass CoM. The virtual reality-based CoM-assisted balance tasks Virtual CoMBaT was designed to be adaptive to ones individualized weight-shifting capability quantified through CoM displacement. Participants were asked to interact with Virtual CoMBaT that offered tasks of varying challenge levels while adhering to ankle strategy for weight shifting. To facilitate the patients to use ankle strategy during weight-shifting we designed a heel lift detection module. A usability study was carried out with 12 hemiplegic patients. Results indicate the potential of our system to contribute to improving ones overall performance in balance-related tasks belonging to different difficulty levels."
