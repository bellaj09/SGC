The introduction of laparoscopic approaches to surgery has been responsible for increased morbidity and has necessitated the development of a system of apprenticeship training in and out of the operating room for surgeons making their debut in the laparoscopic arena. This study based on published data in the surgical literature aims to evaluate the tools currently available for both teaching and evaluating competence in laparascopic surgery. Video simulators currently being used for teaching laparoscopic skills do not permit an objective evaluation of skill acquisition. Virtual reality simulators have the advantage of permitting an apprenticeship in laparoscopic surgical technique and a simultaneous assessment of the acquisition of surgical dexterity. This new technology should enable a better preparation of young surgeons for the operating room of the future. Apprenticeship in laparoscopic surgery: Tools and methods for the surgeon in training.
