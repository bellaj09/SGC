The effective delivery of information literacy training can be a challenging process and health library and information professionals are constantly innovating in this area. This article presents a case study of the BHSc Hons Occupational therapy degree programme at York St John University to demonstrate ways in which deep integration of information skills into the curriculum can be achieved. The article advises that in the delivery of health and social care related information skills we should look more broadly at where relevant learning can happen. In particular contexts of the health care environment are suggested as a consideration rather than the narrow scope of the academic classroom-based environment. Examples are provided of specific teaching and learning activities used on the programme alongside CPD activity and curriculum design.
