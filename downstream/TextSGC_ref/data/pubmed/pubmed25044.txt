"We used virtual reality technology to improve the quality of life and amenity of in-patients in a childrens hospital. Children in the hospital could enjoy a zoo amusement park and aquarium in virtual. They played soccer skiing and horse riding in virtual. They could communicate with persons who were out of the hospital and attend the school which they had gone to before entering hospital. They played music with children who had been admitted to other childrens hospitals. By using this virtual technology the quality of life of children who suffered from psychological and physiological stress in the hospital greatly improved. It is not only useful for their QOL but also for the healing of illness. However these methods are very rare. Our systemic in our childrens hospital is the first to be reported in Japan both software and hardware of virtual reality technology to increase the QOL of sick children need further development."
