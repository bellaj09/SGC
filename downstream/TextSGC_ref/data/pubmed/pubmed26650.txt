Selecting suitable feature types is crucial to obtain good overall brain-computer interface performance. Popular feature types include logarithmic band power logBP autoregressive AR parameters time-domain parameters and wavelet-based methods. In this study we focused on different variants of AR models and compare performance with logBP features. In particular we analyzed univariate vector and bilinear AR models. We used four-class motor imagery data from nine healthy users over two sessions. We used the first session to optimize parameters such as model order and frequency bands. We then evaluated optimized feature extraction methods on the unseen second session. We found that band power yields significantly higher classification accuracies than AR methods. However we did not update the bias of the classifiers for the second session in our analysis procedure. When updating the bias at the beginning of a new session we found no significant differences between all methods anymore. Furthermore our results indicate that subject-specific optimization is not better than globally optimized parameters. The comparison within the AR methods showed that the vector model is significantly better than both univariate and bilinear variants. Finally adding the prediction error variance to the feature space significantly improved classification results.
