Brain-computer interfaces have been a novel approach to translate human intentions into movement commands in robotic systems. This paper describes an electroencephalogram-based brain-controlled lower-limb exoskeleton for gait training as a proof of concept towards rehabilitation with human-in-the-loop. Instead of using conventional single electroencephalography correlates e.g. evoked P300 or spontaneous motor imagery we propose a novel framework integrated two asynchronous signal modalities i.e. sensorimotor rhythms SMRs and movement-related cortical potentials MRCPs. We executed experiments in a biologically inspired and customized lower-limb exoskeleton where subjects N = 6 actively controlled the robot using their brain signals. Each subject performed three consecutive sessions composed of offline training online visual feedback testing and online robot-control recordings. Post hoc evaluations were conducted including mental workload assessment feature analysis and statistics test. An average robot-control accuracy of 80.16%  5.44% was obtained with the SMR-based method while estimation using the MRCP-based method yielded an average performance of 68.62%  8.55%. The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed framework with all subjects successfully controlled the exoskeleton. The current paradigm could be further extended to paraplegic patients in clinical trials. A brain-controlled lower-limb exoskeleton for human gait training.
