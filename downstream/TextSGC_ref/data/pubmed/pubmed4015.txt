Sparse graphical models are frequently used to explore both static and dynamic functional brain networks from neuroimaging data. However the practical performance of the models has not been studied in detail for brain networks. In this work we have two objectives. First we compare several sparse graphical model estimation procedures and several selection criteria under various experimental settings such as different dimensions sample sizes types of data and sparsity levels of the true model structures. We discuss in detail the superiority and deficiency of each combination. Second in the same simulation study we show the impact of autocorrelation and whitening on the estimation of functional brain networks. We apply the methods to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data set. Our results show that the best sparse graphical model in terms of detection of true connections and having few false-positive connections is the smoothly clipped absolute deviation SCAD estimating method in combination with the Bayesian information criterion BIC and cross-validation CV selection method. In addition the presence of autocorrelation in the data adversely affects the estimation of networks but can be helped by using the CV selection method. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies where inferior graphical model techniques have been used to estimate brain networks.
