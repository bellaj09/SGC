Recovering the high-resolution three-dimensional 3D surface of an object from a single frame image has been the ultimate goal long pursued in fringe projection profilometry FPP. The color fringe projection method is one of the technologies with the most potential towards such a goal due to its three-channel multiplexing properties. However the associated color imbalance crosstalk problems and compromised coding strategy remain major obstacles to overcome. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning for FPP we propose a single-shot absolute 3D shape measurement with deep-learning-based color FPP. Through "learning" on extensive data sets the properly trained neural network can "predict" the high-resolution motion-artifact-free crosstalk-free absolute phase directly from one single color fringe image. Compared with the traditional approach our method allows for more accurate phase retrieval and more robust phase unwrapping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide high-accuracy single-frame absolute 3D shape measurement for complicated objects.
