The detection rate for identifying the underlying mutation in neurocutaneous syndromes is affected by the sensitivity of the mutation test and the heterogeneity of the disease based on the diagnostic criteria. Neurofibromatosis type NF1 has been defined for 29years by the National Institutes for Health NIH criteria which include 6 Caf au Lait macules CAL as a defining criterion. The discovery of SPRED1 as a cause of Legius syndrome which is manifested by CAL freckling and learning difficulties has introduced substantial heterogeneity to the NIH criteria. Comprehensive RNA Analysis of the NF1 Gene in Classically Affected NF1 Affected Individuals Meeting NIH Criteria has High Sensitivity and Mutation Negative Testing is Reassuring in Isolated Cases With Pigmentary Features Only.
