Studying freezing of gait FOG in the lab has proven problematic. This has primarily been due to the difficulty in designing experimental setups that maintain high levels of ecological validity whilst also permitting sufficient levels of experimental control. To help overcome these challenges we have developed a virtual reality VR environment with virtual doorways a situation known to illicit FOG in real life. To examine the validity of this VR environment an experiment was conducted and the results were compared to a previous "real-world" experiment. A group of healthy controls N\u2009=\u200910 and a group of idiopathic Parkinson disease PD patients without any FOG episodes N\u2009=\u20096 and with a history of freezing PD-f N\u2009=\u20094 walked under three different virtual conditions no door narrow doorway 100% of shoulder width and standard doorway 125% of shoulder width. The results were similar to those obtained in the real-world setting. Virtual doorways reduced step length and velocity while increasing general gait variability. The PD-f group always walked slower with a smaller step length and showed the largest increases in gait variability. The narrow doorway induced FOG in 66% of the trials while the standard doorway caused FOG in 29% of the trials. Our results closely mirrored those obtained with real doors. In short this methodology provides a safe personalized yet adequately controlled means to examine FOG in Parkinson\s patients along with possible interventions.
