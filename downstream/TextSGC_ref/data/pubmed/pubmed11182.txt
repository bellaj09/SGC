"The previous literature on working memory WM has indicated that verbal materials are dominantly retained in phonological representations whereas other linguistic information e.g. orthography semantics only contributes to verbal WM minimally if not negligibly. Although accumulating evidence has suggested that multiple linguistic components jointly support verbal WM the visual/orthographic contribution has rarely been addressed in alphabetic languages possibly due to the difficulty of dissociating the effects of word forms from the effects of their pronunciations in relatively shallow orthography. In the present study we examined whether the orthographic representations of Chinese characters support the retention of verbal materials in this language of deep orthography. In Experiments 1a and 2 we independently manipulated the phonological and orthographic similarity of horizontal and vertical characters respectively and found that participants accuracy of probed serial recall was reduced by both similar pronunciations and shared phonetic radicals in the to-be-remembered stimuli. Moreover Experiment 1b showed that only the effect of phonological but not that of orthographic similarity was affected by concurrent articulatory suppression. Taken together the present results indicate the indispensable contribution of orthographic representations to verbal WM of Chinese characters and suggest that the linguistic characteristics of a specific language not only determine long-term linguistic-processing mechanisms but also delineate the organization of verbal WM for that language." Phonological similarity and orthographic similarity affect probed serial recall of Chinese characters.
