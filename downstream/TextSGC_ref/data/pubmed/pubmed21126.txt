This pilot study compared a Nintendo Wii intervention to single-joint resistance training for the upper limb in children ages 7 to 12 with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy CP. Children were randomized to Wii training n= 3 or resistance training n= 3 and trained at home for 6 weeks. Pre post and 4-week follow-up measures were collected. Outcome measures were the Melbourne Assessment MA2 and ABILHAND-Kids and grip strength. Compliance motivation and feasibility of each intervention was explored using daily logbook responses and questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used. Three children improved in the MA2 two of which were in the Wii training group. Improvements in the ABILHAND-Kids were minimal for all participants. Grip strength improvements were observed in 3 participants two of which were in the resistance training group. The Wii training group reported higher compliance and more consistently positive responses to motivation and feasibility questions. Therefore Wii training may be an effective home-based rehabilitation strategy and is worth exploring in a larger trial. Implications of Wii training in the context of motivation theory are discussed. Home-based Nintendo Wii training to improve upper-limb function in children ages 7 to 12 with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
