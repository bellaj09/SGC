Understanding the circuit mechanisms behind motion detection is a long-standing question in visual neuroscience. In Drosophila melanogaster recently discovered synapse-level connectomes in the optic lobe particularly in ON-pathway T4 receptive-field circuits in concert with physiological studies suggest a motion model that is increasingly intricate when compared with the ubiquitous Hassenstein-Reichardt model. By contrast our knowledge of OFF-pathway T5 has been incomplete. Here we present a conclusive and comprehensive connectome that for the first time integrates detailed connectivity information for inputs to both the T4 and T5 pathways in a single EM dataset covering the entire optic lobe. With novel reconstruction methods using automated synapse prediction suited to such a large connectome we successfully corroborate previous findings in the T4 pathway and comprehensively identify inputs and receptive fields for T5. Although the two pathways are probably evolutionarily linked and exhibit many similarities we uncover interesting differences and interactions that may underlie their distinct functional properties.
