Fragile X Syndrome FXS is the most common single gene cause of inherited mental impairment and cognitive deficits can range from simple learning disabilities to mental retardation. Human FXS is caused by a loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein FMRP. The fragile X knockout FX KO mouse also shows a loss of FMRP as well as many of the physical and behavioural characteristics of human FXS. This work aims to characterize the anatomical changes between the FX KO and a corresponding wild type mouse. Significant volume decreases were found in two regions within the deep cerebellar nuclei namely the nucleus interpositus and the fastigial nucleus which may be caused by a loss of neurons as indicated by histological analysis. Well-known links between these nuclei and previously established behavioural and physical characteristics of FXS are discussed. The loss of FMRP has a significant effect on these two nuclei and future studies of FXS should evaluate the biochemical physiological and behavioral consequences of alterations in these key nuclei.
