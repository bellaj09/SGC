In this study we propose an analysis system combined with feature selection to further improve the classification accuracy of single-trial electroencephalogram EEG data. Acquiring event-related brain potential data from the sensorimotor cortices the system comprises artifact and background noise removal feature extraction feature selection and feature classification. First the artifacts and background noise are removed automatically by means of independent component analysis and surface Laplacian filter respectively. Several potential features such as band power autoregressive model and coherence and phase-locking value are then extracted for subsequent classification. Next artificial bee colony ABC algorithm is used to select features from the aforementioned feature combination. Finally selected subfeatures are classified by support vector machine. Comparing with and without artifact removal and feature selection using a genetic algorithm on single-trial EEG data for 6 subjects the results indicate that the proposed system is promising and suitable for brain-computer interface applications.
