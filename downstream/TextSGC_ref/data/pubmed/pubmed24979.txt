Compelling scene movements in a virtual reality VR system can cause symptoms of motion sickness i.e. cybersickness. A within-subject experiment has been conducted to investigate the effects of scene oscillations along different axes on the level of cybersickness. Sixteen male participants were exposed to four 20-min VR simulation sessions. The four sessions used the same virtual environment but with scene oscillations along different axes i.e. pitch yaw roll or no oscillation speed: 30 degrees/s range: +/- 60 degrees. Verbal ratings of the level of nausea were taken at 5-min intervals during the sessions and sickness symptoms were also measured before and after the sessions using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire SSQ. In the presence of scene oscillation both nausea ratings and SSQ scores increased at significantly higher rates than with no oscillation. While individual participants exhibited different susceptibilities to nausea associated with VR simulation containing scene oscillations along different rotational axes the overall effects of axis among our group of 16 randomly selected participants were not significant. The main effects of and interactions among scene oscillation duration and participants are discussed in the paper. Cybersickness in the presence of scene rotational movements along different axes.
