Mapping biological circuit connectivity has revolutionized our understanding of structure-function relationships. Although connectomic analyses have primarily focused on neural systems electrical connectivity within muscle mitochondrial networks was recently demonstrated to provide a rapid mechanism for cellular energy distribution. However tools to evaluate organelle connectivity with high spatial fidelity within single cells are currently lacking. Here we developed a framework to quantitatively assess mitochondrial network connectivity and interactions with cellular sites of energy storage utilization and calcium cycling in cardiac oxidative and glycolytic muscle. We demonstrate that mitochondrial network configuration individual mitochondrial size and shape and the junctions connecting mitochondria within each network are consistent with the differing contraction demands of each muscle type. Moreover mitochondria-lipid droplet interaction analyses suggest that individual mitochondria within networks may play specialized roles regarding energy distribution and calcium cycling within the cell and reveal the power of connectomic analyses of organelle interactions within single cells.
