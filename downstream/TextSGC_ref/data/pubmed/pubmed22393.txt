"Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES is a minimally invasive procedure which utilizes the bodys natural orifices to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. The NOTES procedure is designed to minimize external scarring and patient trauma however flexible endoscopy based pure NOTES procedures require critical scope handling skills. The delicate nature of the NOTES procedure requires extensive training. Thus to improve access to training while reducing risk to patients we have designed and developed the VTEST a virtual reality NOTES simulator. As part of the simulator a novel decoupled 2-DOF haptic device was developed to provide realistic force feedback to the user in training. A series of experiments were performed to determine the behavioral characteristics of the device. The device was found capable of rendering up to 5.62N and 0.190\xa0Nm of continuous force and torque in the translational and rotational DOF respectively. The device possesses 18.1 and 5.7\xa0Hz of force bandwidth in the translational and rotational DOF respectively. A feedforward friction compensator was also successfully implemented to minimize the negative impact of friction during the interaction with the device. In this work we have presented the detailed development and evaluation of the haptic device for the VTEST."
