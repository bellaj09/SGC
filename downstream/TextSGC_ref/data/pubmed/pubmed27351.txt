Flexible electronics can serve as powerful tools for biomedical diagnosis and therapies of neurological disorders particularly for application cases with brain-machine interfaces BMIs. Existing conformal soft bioelectrodes are applicable for basic electrocorticogram ECoG collecting/monitoring. Nevertheless as an emerging and promising approach further multidisciplinary efforts are still demanded for in-depth exploitations with these conformal soft electronics toward their practical neurophysiological applications in both scientific research and real-world clinical operation. Here clinically-friendly silk-supported/delivered soft bioelectronics are developed and multiple functions and features valuable for customizable intracranial applications e.g. biocompatible and spontaneously conformal coupling with cortical surface spatiotemporal ECoG detecting/monitoring electro-neurophysiological neural stimulating/decoding controllable loading/delivery of therapeutic molecules and parallel optical readouts of operating states are integrated.
