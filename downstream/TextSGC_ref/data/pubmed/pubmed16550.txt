In this review the neural underpinnings of the experience of presence are outlined. Firstly it is shown that presence is associated with activation of a distributed network which includes the dorsal and ventral visual stream the parietal cortex the premotor cortex mesial temporal areas the brainstem and the thalamus. Secondly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC is identified as a key node of the network as it modulates the activity of the network and the associated experience of presence. Thirdly children lack the strong modulatory influence of the DLPFC on the network due to their unmatured frontal cortex. Fourthly it is shown that presence-related measures are influenced by manipulating the activation in the DLPFC using transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS while participants are exposed to the virtual roller coaster ride. Finally the findings are discussed in the context of current models explaining the experience of presence the rubber hand illusion and out-of-body experiences. Virtual reality and the role of the prefrontal cortex in adults and children.
