Brain machine interfaces BMIs have the potential to restore movement to people with paralysis. However a clinically-viable BMI must enable consistently accurate control over time spans ranging from years to decades which has not yet been demonstrated. Most BMIs that use single-unit spikes as inputs will experience degraded performance over time without frequent decoder re-training. Two other signals local field potentials LFPs and multi-unit spikes MSPs may offer greater reliability over long periods and better performance stability than single-unit spikes. Here we demonstrate that LFPs can be used in a biomimetic BMI to control a computer cursor. Long term stable brain machine interface performance using local field potentials and multiunit spikes.
