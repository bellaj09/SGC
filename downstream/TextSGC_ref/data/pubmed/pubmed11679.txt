Malignant mesothelioma MM is a rare but aggressive cancer. The definitive diagnosis of MM is critical for effective treatment and has important medicolegal significance. However the definitive diagnosis of MM is challenging due to its composite epithelial/mesenchymal pattern. The aim of the current study was to develop a deep learning method to automatically diagnose MM. A retrospective analysis of 324 participants with or without MM was performed. Significant features were selected using a genetic algorithm GA or a ReliefF algorithm performed in MATLAB software. Subsequently the current study constructed and trained several models based on a backpropagation BP algorithm extreme learning machine algorithm and stacked sparse autoencoder SSAE to diagnose MM. A confusion matrix F-measure and a receiver operating characteristic ROC curve were used to evaluate the performance of each model. A total of 34 potential variables were analyzed while the GA and ReliefF algorithms selected 19 and 5 effective features respectively. The selected features were used as the inputs of the three models. SSAE and GA+SSAE demonstrated the highest performance in terms of classification accuracy specificity F-measure and the area under the ROC curve. Overall the GA+SSAE model was the preferred model since it required a shorter CPU time and fewer variables. Therefore the SSAE with GA feature selection was selected as the most accurate model for the diagnosis of MM. The deep learning methods developed based on the GA+SSAE model may assist physicians with the diagnosis of MM. Diagnosis of mesothelioma with deep learning.
