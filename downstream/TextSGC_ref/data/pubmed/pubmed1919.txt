For decades it has been largely unknown to what extent multiple functional networks spatially overlap/interact with each other and jointly realize the total cortical function. Here by developing novel sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals and by using the recently publicly released large-scale Human Connectome Project high-quality fMRI data we show that a number of reproducible and robust functional networks including both task-evoked and resting state networks are simultaneously distributed in distant neuroanatomic areas and substantially spatially overlapping with each other thus forming an initial collection of holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions HAFNIs. More interestingly the HAFNIs revealed two distinct patterns of highly overlapped regions and highly specialized regions and exhibited that these two patterns of areas are reciprocally localized revealing a novel organizational principle of cortical function. Holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions reveal reciprocal organizational architecture of cortical function.
