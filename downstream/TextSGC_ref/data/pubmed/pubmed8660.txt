Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia which can result in a series of complications especially in diabetic patients such as confusion irritability seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram ECG-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence AI to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ECG signal recorded with non-invasive wearable devices in healthy individuals monitored 24\u2009hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal e.g. T-wave ST-interval is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance the feasibility of a real-time non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming system using short excerpts of ECG signal.
