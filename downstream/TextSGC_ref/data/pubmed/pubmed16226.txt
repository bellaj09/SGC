Approaches to study and course perceptions were investigated and compared in both junior and senior students on a vocational course dentistry and on a non-vocational course life sciences using standard questionnaires. Junior dental students reported significantly greater tendencies towards both Deep and Surface Approaches than junior life science students. They also had significantly higher scores for Achieving Approach but in senior students this trend was reversed. Final year dental students experienced greater workloads and less freedom in learning than life science students and they also reported less organized study methods. These course perceptions demonstrate similar trends to those reported by Ramsden 1991. The implications for the courses concerned and for curriculum development are considered. Dental and life science students: a comparison of approaches to study and course perceptions.
