"Graphics technology has extended medical imaging tools to the hands of surgeons and doctors beyond the radiology suite. However a common issue in most medical imaging software is the added complexity for non-radiologists. This paper presents the development of a unique software toolset that is highly customizable and targeted at the general physicians as well as the medical specialists. The core functionality includes features such as viewing medical images in two-and three-dimensional representations clipping tissue windowing and coloring. Additional features can be loaded in the form of plug-ins such as tumor segmentation tissue deformation and surgical planning. This allows the software to be lightweight and easy to use while still giving the user the flexibility of adding the necessary features thus catering to a wide range of user population." Development of a customizable software application for medical imaging analysis and visualization.
