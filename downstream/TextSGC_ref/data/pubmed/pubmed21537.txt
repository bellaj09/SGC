While virtual reality VR has potential in enhancing cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment prerequisite labor-intensive image segmentation remains an obstacle for seamlessly simulating 4-dimensional 4-D 3-D\u2009+\u2009time imaging data in an immersive physiological VR environment. We applied deformable image registration DIR in conjunction with 3-D reconstruction and VR implementation to recapitulate developmental cardiac contractile function from light-sheet fluorescence microscopy LSFM. This method addressed inconsistencies that would arise from independent segmentations of time-dependent data thereby enabling the creation of a VR environment that fluently simulates cardiac morphological changes. By analyzing myocardial deformation at high spatiotemporal resolution we interfaced quantitative computations with 4-D VR. We demonstrated that our LSFM-captured images followed by DIR yielded average dice similarity coefficients of 0.92\u2009\u20090.05 n\u2009=\u2009510 and 0.93\u2009\u20090.06 n\u2009=\u2009240 when compared to ground truth images obtained from Otsu thresholding and manual segmentation respectively. The resulting VR environment simulates a wide-angle zoomed-in view of motion in live embryonic zebrafish hearts in which the cardiac chambers are undergoing structural deformation throughout the cardiac cycle. Thus this technique allows for an interactive micro-scale VR visualization of developmental cardiac morphology to enable high resolution simulation for both basic and clinical science.
