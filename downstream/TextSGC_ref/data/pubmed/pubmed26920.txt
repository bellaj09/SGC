Brain Machine Interfaces BMIs mostly utilise spike rate as an input feature for decoding a desired motor output as it conveys a useful measure to the underlying neuronal activity. The spike rate is typically estimated by a using non-overlap binning method that yields a coarse estimate. There exist several methods that can produce a smooth estimate which could potentially improve the decoding performance. However these methods are relatively computationally heavy for real-time BMIs. To address this issue we propose a new method for estimating spike rate that is able to yield a smooth estimate and also amenable to real-time BMIs. The proposed method referred to as Bayesian adaptive kernel smoother BAKS employs kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution which is adaptively updated through a Bayesian framework. With appropriate selection of prior distribution and kernel function an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We apply BAKS and evaluate its impact on offline BMI decoding performance using Kalman filter. The results reveal that BAKS can improve the decoding performance compared to the binning method. This suggests the feasibility and the potential use of BAKS for real-time BMIs. Spike Rate Estimation Using Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother BAKS and Its Application to Brain Machine Interfaces.
