N6-methyladensine m6A is a common and abundant RNA methylation modification found in various species. As a type of post-transcriptional methylation m6A plays an important role in diverse RNA activities such as alternative splicing an interplay with microRNAs and translation efficiency. Although existing tools can predict m6A at single-base resolution it is still challenging to extract the biological information surrounding m6A sites.
