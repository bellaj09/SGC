This work deals with negation detection in the context of clinical texts. Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events detection of absence of some events help ascertain current medical conditions. For artificial intelligence negation detection is a valuable point as it can revert the meaning of a part of a text and accordingly influence other tasks such as medical dosage adjustment the detection of adverse drug reactions or hospital acquired diseases. We focus on negated medical events such as disorders findings and allergies. From Natural Language Processing NLP background we refer to them as negated medical entities. A novelty of this work is that we approached this task as Named Entity Recognition NER with the restriction that just negated medical entities must be recognized in an attempt to help distinguish them from non-negated ones. Our study is driven with Electronic Health Records EHRs written in Spanish. A challenge to cope with is the lexical variability alternative medical forms abbreviations etc.. To this end we employed an approach based on deep learning. Specifically the system combines character embeddings to cope with out-of-vocabulary OOV words Long Short-Term Memory LSTM networks to model contextual representations and it makes use of Conditional Random Fields CRF to classify each medical entity as either negated or not given the contextual dense representation. Moreover we explored both embeddings created from words and embeddings created from lemmas. The best results were obtained with the lemmatized embeddings. Apparently this approach reinforced the capability of the LSTMs to cope with the high lexical variability. The f-measure for exact-match was 65.1 and 82.4 for the partial-match.
