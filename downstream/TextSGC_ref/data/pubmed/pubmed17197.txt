Almost all living species regularly explore environments that they experience as pleasant aversive arousing or frightening. We postulate that such exploratory behavior and emotional experience both are regulated based on the interdependent perception of one\s body and stimuli that collectively define a spatial context such as a cliff. Here we examined this by testing if the interaction of the sensory input on one\s gait and the sensory input on the spatial context is modulating both the emotional experience of the environment and its exploration through head motion. To this end we asked healthy humans to explore a life-sized Virtual Reality simulation of a forest glade by physically walking around in this environment on two narrow rectangular platforms connected by a plank. The platforms and the plank were presented such that they were either placed on ground or on the top of two high bridge piers. Hence the forest glade was presented either as a "ground" or as a "height" context. Within these two spatial contexts the virtual plank was projected either on the rigid physical floor or onto a bouncy physical plank. Accordingly the gait of our participants while they crossed the virtual plank was either "smooth" or "bouncy." We found that in the height context bouncy gait compared to smooth gait increased the orientation of the head below the horizon and intensified the experience of the environment as negative. Whereas within the ground context bouncy gait increased the orientation of the head towards and above the horizon and made that the environment was experienced as positive. Our findings suggest that the brain of healthy humans is using the interaction of the sensory input on their gait and the sensory input on the spatial context to regulate both the emotional experience of the environment and its exploration through head motion. Sensorimotor body-environment interaction serves to regulate emotional experience and exploratory behavior.
