Proprioceptive sense plays a significant role in the generation and correction of skilled movements and consequently in most activities of daily living. We developed a new proprioception assessment protocol that enables the quantification of elbow position sense without using the opposite arm involving active movement of the evaluated limb or relying on working memory. The aims of this descriptive study were to validate this assessment protocol by quantifying the elbow position sense of healthy adults before using it in individuals who sustained a stroke and to investigate its test-retest reliability. Quantification of upper limb position sense using an exoskeleton and a virtual reality display.
