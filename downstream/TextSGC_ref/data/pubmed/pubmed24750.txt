In this paper we describe a new multi-mode telestimulation system for brain-microstimulation for the navigation of a robo-pigeon a new type of bio-robot based on Brain-Computer Interface BCI techniques. The multi-mode telestimulation system overcomes neuron adaptation that was a key shortcoming of the previous single-mode stimulation by the use of non-steady TTL biphasic pulses accomplished by randomly alternating pulse modes. To improve efficiency a new behavior model "virtual fear" is proposed and applied to the robo-pigeon. Unlike the previous "virtual reward" model the "virtual fear" behavior model does not require special training. The performance and effectiveness of the system to alleviate the adaptation of neurons was verified by a robo-pigeon navigation test simultaneously confirming the practicality of the "virtual fear" behavioral model. A robo-pigeon based on an innovative multi-mode telestimulation system.
