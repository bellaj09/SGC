Stereotactic electroencephalogaphy sEEG utilizes localized penetrating depth electrodes to measure electrophysiological brain activity. It is most commonly used in the identification of epileptogenic zones in cases of refractory epilepsy. The implanted electrodes generally provide a sparse sampling of a unique set of brain regions including deeper brain structures such as hippocampus amygdala and insula that cannot be captured by superficial measurement modalities such as electrocorticography ECoG. Despite the overlapping clinical application and recent progress in decoding of ECoG for Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs sEEG has thus far received comparatively little attention for BCI decoding. Additionally the success of the related deep-brain stimulation DBS implants bodes well for the potential for chronic sEEG applications. This article provides an overview of sEEG technology BCI-related research and prospective future directions of sEEG for long-term BCI applications.
