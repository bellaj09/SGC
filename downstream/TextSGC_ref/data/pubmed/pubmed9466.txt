"We show that both single-component and two-component Bose-Einstein condensates BECs ground states can be simulated by a deep convolutional neural network. We trained the neural network via inputting the parameters in the dimensionless Gross-Pitaevskii equation GPE and outputting the ground-state wave function. After the training the neural network generates ground-state wave functions with high precision. We benchmark the neural network for either inputting different coupling strength in the GPE or inputting an arbitrary potential under the infinite double walls trapping potential and it is found that the ground state wave function generated by the neural network gives the relative chemical potential error magnitude below 10-3. Furthermore the neural network trained with random potentials shows prediction ability on other types of potentials. Therefore the BEC ground states which are continuous wave functions can be represented by deep convolutional neural networks."
