"Investigations of the human brains connectomic architecture have produced two alternative models: one describes the brains spatial structure in terms of static localized networks and the other describes the brains temporal structure in terms of dynamic whole-brain states. Here we used tools from connectivity dynamics to develop a synthesis that bridges these models. Using resting fMRI data we investigated the assumptions undergirding current models of the human connectome. Consistent with state-based models our results suggest that static localized networks are superordinate approximations of underlying dynamic states. Furthermore each of these localized dynamic connectivity states is associated with global changes in the whole-brain functional connectome. By nesting localized dynamic connectivity states within their whole-brain contexts we demonstrate the relative temporal independence of brain networks. Our assay for functional autonomy of coordinated neural systems is broadly applicable and our findings provide evidence of structure in temporal state dynamics that complements the well-described static spatial organization of the brain."
