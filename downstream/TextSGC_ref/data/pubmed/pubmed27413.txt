In the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain computer interfaces BCIs spatial filtering which combines the multi-channel electroencephalography EEG signals so as to reduce the non-SSVEP-related component and thus enhance the signal-to-noise ratio SNR plays an important role in target recognition. Recently various spatial filtering algorithms have been developed employing different prior knowledge and characteristics of SSVEPs however how these algorithms interconnect and differ is not yet fully explored leading to difficulties in further understanding utilizing and improving them.
