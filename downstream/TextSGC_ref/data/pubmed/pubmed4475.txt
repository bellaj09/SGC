"Dynamical changes have recently been tracked in functional connectivity FC calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. Diverse dynamical FC states dFC are believed to represent different internal states of the brain in terms of brain-regional interactions. In this paper we propose a novel protocol the signed community clustering with the optimized modularity by two-step procedures to track dynamical whole brain functional connectivity dWFC states. This protocol is assumption free without a priori threshold for the number of clusters. By applying our method on sliding window based dWFCs with automated anatomical labeling 2 AAL2 three main dWFC states were extracted from R-fMRI datasets in Human Connectome Project that are independent on window size. Through extracting the FC features of these states we found the functional links in state 1 WFC-C1 mainly involved visual somatomotor attention and cerebellar posterior lobe modules. State 2 WFC-C2 was similar to WFC-C1 but more FCs linking limbic default mode and frontoparietal modules and less linking the cerebellum sensory and attention modules. State 3 had more FCs linking default mode limbic and cerebellum compared to WFC-C1 and WFC-C2. With tests of robustness and stability our work provides a solid hypothesis-free tool to detect dWFC states for the possibility of tracking rapid dynamical change in FCs among large data sets."
