"Synchronization in activated regions of cortical networks affect the brains frequency response which has been associated with a wide range of states and abilities including memory. A non-invasive method for manipulating cortical synchronization is binaural beats. Binaural beats take advantage of the brains response to two pure tones delivered independently to each ear when those tones have a small frequency mismatch. The mismatch between the tones is interpreted as a beat frequency which may act to synchronize cortical oscillations. Neural synchrony is particularly important for working memory processes the system controlling online organization and retention of information for successful goal-directed behavior. Therefore manipulation of synchrony via binaural beats provides a unique window into working memory and associated connectivity of cortical networks."
