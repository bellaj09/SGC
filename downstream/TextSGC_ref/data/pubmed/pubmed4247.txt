Understanding the connectivity architecture of entire vertebrate brains is a fundamental but difficult task. Here we present an integrated neuro-histological pipeline as well as a grid-based tracer injection strategy for systematic mesoscale connectivity mapping in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Individual brains are sectioned into ~1700 20 m sections using the tape transfer technique permitting high quality 3D reconstruction of a series of histochemical stains Nissl myelin interleaved with tracer labeled sections. Systematic in-vivo MRI of the individual animals facilitates injection placement into reference-atlas defined anatomical compartments. Further by combining the resulting 3D volumes containing informative cytoarchitectonic markers with in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI and using an integrated computational pipeline we are able to accurately map individual brains into a common reference atlas despite the significant individual variation. This approach will facilitate the systematic assembly of a mesoscale connectivity matrix together with unprecedented 3D reconstructions of brain-wide projection patterns in a primate brain.
