Nyquist ghost artifacts in echo planar imaging EPI are originated from phase mismatch between the even and odd echoes. However conventional correction methods using reference scans often produce erroneous results especially in high-field MRI due to the nonlinear and time-varying local magnetic field changes. Recently it was shown that the problem of ghost correction can be reformulated as k-space interpolation problem that can be solved using structured low-rank Hankel matrix approaches. Another recent work showed that data driven Hankel matrix decomposition can be reformulated to exhibit similar structures as deep convolutional neural network. By synergistically combining these findings we propose a k-space deep learning approach that immediately corrects the phase mismatch without a reference scan in both accelerated and non-accelerated EPI acquisitions. k-Space deep learning for reference-free EPI ghost correction.
