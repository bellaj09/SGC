Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma LUAD and squamous cell carcinoma LUSC are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study we trained a deep convolutional neural network inception v3 on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists with an average area under the curve AUC of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them-STK11 EGFR FAT1 SETBP1 KRAS and TP53-can be predicted from pathology images with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH .
