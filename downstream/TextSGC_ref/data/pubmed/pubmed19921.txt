"We developed a near infrared NIR virtual intraoperative surgical photoacoustic microscopy NIR-VISPAM system that combines a conventional surgical microscope and an NIR light photoacoustic microscopy PAM system. NIR-VISPAM can simultaneously visualize PA B-scan images at a maximum display rate of 45\xa0Hz and display enlarged microscopic images on a surgeons view plane through the ocular lenses of the surgical microscope as augmented reality. The use of the invisible NIR light eliminated the disturbance to the surgeons vision caused by the visible PAM excitation laser in a previous report. Further the maximum permissible laser pulse energy at this wavelength is approximately 5 times more than that at the visible spectral range. The use of a needle-type ultrasound transducer without any water bath for acoustic coupling can enhance convenience in an intraoperative environment. We successfully guided needle and injected carbon particles in biological tissues ex vivo and in melanoma-bearing mice in vivo."
