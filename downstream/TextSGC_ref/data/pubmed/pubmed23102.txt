Acquired brain injury ABI is the main cause of death and disability among young adults. In most cases survivors can experience balance instability resulting in functional impairments that are associated with diminished health-related quality of life. Traditional rehabilitation therapy may be tedious. This can reduce motivation and adherence to the treatment and thus provide a limited benefit to patients with balance disorders. We present eBaViR easy Balance Virtual Rehabilitation a system based on the Nintendo Wii Balance Board WBB which has been designed by clinical therapists to improve standing balance in patients with ABI through motivational and adaptative exercises. We hypothesize that eBaViR is feasible safe and potentially effective in enhancing standing balance.
