Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric disorders. With regard to pharmacological treatment antidepressants the calcium modulator pregabalin and benzodiazepines are recommended according to current treatment guidelines. With regard to acute states of anxiety so far practically only benzodiazepines provide an immediate anxiolytic effect. However the risk of tolerance and dependency limits the use of this class of medication. Therefore there is still a need for alternative pharmacologic strategies. Increasing evidence points towards anxiety-reducing properties of atypical antipsychotics particularly quetiapine. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the putative acute anxiolytic effects of this compound choosing the induction of acute anxiety in patients with specific phobia as a model for the evaluation of ad-hoc anxiolytic properties in a proof-of-concept approach. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study 58 patients with arachnophobia were treated with a single dose of quetiapine XR or placebo prior to a virtual reality spider challenge procedure. Treatment effects were monitored using rating scales for acute anxiety as well as measurements of heart rate and skin conductance. Overall quetiapine showed significant anxiolytic effects compared to placebo. However effects were not seen on the primary outcome measure VAS Anxiety but were limited to somatic anxiety symptoms. Additionally a significant reduction of skin conductance was observed. Further exploratory analyses hint towards a mediating role of the COMT val158met genotype on treatment response. The present results thus suggest a possible suitability of quetiapine in the acute treatment of anxiety particularly with regard to somatic symptoms.
