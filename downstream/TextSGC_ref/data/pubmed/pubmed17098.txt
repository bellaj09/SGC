Retrieval monitoring enhances episodic memory accuracy. For instance false recognition is reduced when participants base their decisions on more distinctive recollections a retrieval monitoring process called the distinctiveness heuristic. The experiments reported here tested the hypothesis that autobiographical elaboration during study i.e. generating autobiographical memories in response to cue words would lead to more distinctive recollections than other item-specific encoding tasks enhancing retrieval monitoring accuracy at test. Consistent with this hypothesis false recognition was less likely when participants had to search their memory for previous autobiographical elaborations compared to previous semantic judgments. These false recognition effects were dissociated from true recognition effects across four experiments implicating a recollection-based monitoring process that was independent from familiarity-based processes. Separately obtained subjective measures provided converging evidence for this conclusion. The cognitive operations engaged during autobiographical elaboration can lead to distinctive recollections making them less prone to memory distortion than other types of deep or semantic encoding. Autobiographical elaboration reduces memory distortion: cognitive operations and the distinctiveness heuristic.
