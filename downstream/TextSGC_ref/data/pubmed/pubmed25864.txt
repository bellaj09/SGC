Evaluation and treatment of children with eosinophilic esophagitis EoE requires serial endoscopic visual and histologic assessment by sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD. Unsedated transnasal endoscopy TNE was reported to be successful in a pilot study of children. We evaluated video goggle and virtual reality-based unsedated TNE in children with EoE collecting data on rates of completion adverse events and adequacy of visual and histologic findings.
