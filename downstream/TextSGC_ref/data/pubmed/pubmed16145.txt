Integral imaging is a promising three-dimensional 3D imaging technique that captures and reconstructs light field information. Microlens arrays are usually used for the reconstruction process to display 3D scenes to the viewer. However the inherent chromatic aberration of the microlens array reduces the viewing quality and thus broadband achromatic imaging remains a challenge for integral imaging. Here we realize a silicon nitride metalens array in the visible region that can be used to reconstruct 3D optical scenes in the achromatic integral imaging for white light. The metalens array contains 60\u2009\u200960 polarization-insensitive metalenses with nearly diffraction-limited focusing. The nanoposts in each high-efficiency measured as 47% on average metalens are delicately designed with zero effective material dispersion and an effective achromatic refractive index distribution from 430 to 780\u2009nm. In addition such an achromatic metalens array is composed of only a single silicon nitride layer with an ultrathin thickness of 400\u2009nm making the array suitable for on-chip hybrid-CMOS integration and the parallel manipulation of optoelectronic information. We expect these findings to provide possibilities for full-color and aberration-free integral imaging and we envision that the proposed approach may be potentially applicable in the fields of high-power microlithography high-precision wavefront sensors virtual/augmented reality and 3D imaging.
