The aim of the study is to assess the enjoyment and intensity of physical exercise while practicing physical activity PA in immersive virtual reality IVR using innovative training devices omni-directional Omni treadmill and Icaros Pro flight simulator. The study also contains the results of subjective research on the usefulness of such a form of PA in the opinion of users. In total 61 adults 10 women and 51 men took part in the study. To assess the enjoyment level EL Interest/Enjoyment subscale of Intrinsic Motivation Inventory IMI was used. Exercise intensity was assessed during 10-min sessions of active video games AVGs in IVR based on heart rate HR. The average enjoyment level during physical exercise in IVR on the tested training devices was high Omni 5.74 points Icaros 5.60 points on a 1-7 Likert scale and differed significantly in favor of PA on Omni. In the opinion of the majority of participants AVGs in IVR on the tested devices constitute a sufficiently useful form of PA to meet the needs of leisure time activities and they can even replace some forms of physical effort performed in a classic way. The intensity of PA during games on training devices was at the level recommended for health benefits for 80.55% Omni and 50.77% Icaros Pro of its duration. Based on the conducted research it can be assumed that AVGs in IVR using a multi-directional treadmill and a flight simulator can be an effective tool for increasing participation in health-oriented PA. Enjoyment and Intensity of Physical Activity in Immersive Virtual Reality Performed on Innovative Training Devices in Compliance with Recommendations for Health.
