Deep learning has made great strides in tackling chemical problems but still lacks full-fledged representations for three-dimensional 3D molecular structures for its inner working. For example the molecular graph commonly used in chemistry and recently adapted to the graph convolutional network GCN is inherently a 2D representation of 3D molecules. Herein we propose an advanced version of the GCN called 3DGCN which receives 3D molecular information from a molecular graph augmented by information on bond direction. While outperforming state-of-the-art deep-learning models in the prediction of chemical and biological properties 3DGCN has the ability to both generalize and distinguish molecular rotations in 3D beyond 2D which has great impact on drug discovery and development not to mention the design of chemical reactions.
