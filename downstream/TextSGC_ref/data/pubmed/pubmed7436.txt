Magnetic resonance MR images with both high resolutions and high signal-to-noise ratios SNRs are desired in many clinical and research applications. However acquiring such images takes a long time which is both costly and susceptible to motion artifacts. Acquiring MR images with good in-plane resolution and poor through-plane resolution is a common strategy that saves imaging time preserves SNR and provides one viewpoint with good resolution in two directions. Unfortunately this strategy also creates orthogonal viewpoints that have poor resolution in one direction and for 2D MR acquisition protocols also creates aliasing artifacts. A deep learning approach called SMORE that carries out both anti-aliasing and super-resolution on these types of acquisitions using no external atlas or exemplars has been previously reported but not extensively validated. This paper reviews the SMORE algorithm and then demonstrates its performance in four applications with the goal to demonstrate its potential for use in both research and clinical scenarios. It is first shown to improve the visualization of brain white matter lesions in FLAIR images acquired from multiple sclerosis patients. Then it is shown to improve the visualization of scarring in cardiac left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Third its performance on multi-view images of the tongue is demonstrated and finally it is shown to improve performance in parcellation of the brain ventricular system. Both visual and selected quantitative metrics of resolution enhancement are demonstrated. Applications of a deep learning method for anti-aliasing and super-resolution in MRI.
