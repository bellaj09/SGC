A visual stimulator plays a vital part in brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP. The properties of visual stimulation such as frequency color and waveform will influence SSVEP-based BCI performance to some extent. Recently the computer monitor serves as a visual stimulator that is widespread in SSVEP-based BCIs because of its great flexibility in generating visual stimuli. However stimulation properties based on a computer monitor have received very little attention. For a better comprehension of SSVEPs this study explored the stimulation effects of waveforms and frequencies when evoking SSVEPs through a computer monitor. Effects of stimulation frequency and stimulation waveform on steady-state visual evoked potentials using a computer monitor.
