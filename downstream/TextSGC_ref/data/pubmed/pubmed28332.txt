Transcranial Doppler TCD was recently introduced as a new brain-computer interface BCI modality for detecting task-induced hemispheric lateralization. To date single-trial discrimination between a lateralized mental activity and a rest state has been demonstrated with long 45 s activation time periods. However the possibility of detecting successive activations in a user-independent framework i.e. without training data from the user remains an open question. Towards a hemodynamic BCI using transcranial Doppler without user-specific training data.
