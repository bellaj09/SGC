"There is an association among postural instability gait dysfunction and cognitive impairment in subjects with Parkinsons disease PD. Difficulty in dividing attention response inhibition and visuospatial attention deficiencies may contribute to the impairment of motor performance during daily activities. There are strong evidences that physical therapy can prevent physical and cognitive decline in individuals with PD. Recently the European Physiotherapy Guideline EPG was developed based on randomized clinical trials about the effectiveness of the physical therapy to improve the functional deficiencies of individuals with PD. The EPG did not include the use of promising new intervention as virtual reality in PD due the lack of studies about its safety feasibility and effectiveness. Therefore this study protocol had as objective to evaluate the feasibility safety and effectiveness of a physical therapy program-based on the European Physiotherapy Guideline EPG compared to Kinect-based training on postural control gait cognition and quality of life QoL of Individuals with PD."
