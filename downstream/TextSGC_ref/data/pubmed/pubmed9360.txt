Although we now routinely sequence human genomes we can confidently identify only a fraction of the sequence variants that have a functional impact. Here we developed a deep mutational scanning framework that produces exhaustive maps for human missense variants by combining random codon mutagenesis and multiplexed functional variation assays with computational imputation and refinement. We applied this framework to four proteins corresponding to six human genes: UBE2I encoding SUMO E2 conjugase SUMO1 small ubiquitin-like modifier TPK1 thiamin pyrophosphokinase and CALM1/2/3 three genes encoding the protein calmodulin. The resulting maps recapitulate known protein features and confidently identify pathogenic variation. Assays potentially amenable to deep mutational scanning are already available for 57% of human disease genes suggesting that DMS could ultimately map functional variation for all human disease genes. A framework for exhaustively mapping functional missense variants.
