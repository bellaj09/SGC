Automatic or semi-automatic analysis of the equine electrocardiogram eECG is currently not possible because human or small animal ECG analysis software is unreliable due to a different ECG morphology in horses resulting from a different cardiac innervation. Both filtering beat detection to classification for eECGs are currently poorly or not described in the literature. There are also no public databases available for eECGs as is the case for human ECGs. In this paper we propose the use of wavelet transforms for both filtering and QRS detection in eECGs. In addition we propose a novel robust deep neural network using a parallel convolutional neural network architecture for ECG beat classification. The network was trained and tested using both the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and an own made eECG dataset with 26.440 beats on 4 classes: normal premature ventricular contraction premature atrial contraction and noise. The network was optimized using a genetic algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7% and 92.6% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and eECG database respectively. Afterwards transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the eECG database was applied after which the average accuracy recall positive predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1%.
