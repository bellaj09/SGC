Residue-residue close contact R2R-C data procured from three-dimensional protein-protein interaction PPI experiments is currently used for predicting residue-residue interaction R2R-I in PPI. However due to complex physiochemical environments R2R-I incidences facilitated by multiple factors are usually entangled in the source environment and masked in the acquired data. Here we present a novel method P2K Pattern to Knowledge to disentangle R2R-I patterns and render much succinct discriminative information expressed in different specific R2R-I statistical/functional spaces. Since such knowledge is not visible in the data acquired we refer to it as deep knowledge. Leveraging the deep knowledge discovered to construct machine learning models for sequence-based R2R-I prediction without trial-and-error combination of the features over external knowledge of sequences our R2R-I predictor was validated for its effectiveness under stringent leave-one-complex-out-alone cross-validation in a benchmark dataset and was surprisingly demonstrated to perform better than an existing sequence-based R2R-I predictor by 28% p: 1.9E-08.
