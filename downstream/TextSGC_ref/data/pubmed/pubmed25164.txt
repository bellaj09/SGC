A computer-assisted three-dimensional virtual osteotomy system for orthognathic surgery CAVOS is presented. The virtual reality workbench is used for surgical planning. The surgeon immerses in a virtual reality environment with stereo eyewear holds a virtual "scalpel" 3D Mouse and operates on a "real" patient 3D visualization to obtain pre-surgical prediction 3D bony segment movements. Virtual surgery on a computer-generated 3D head model is simulated and can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point in a personal computer system. Computer-assisted three-dimensional surgical planning and simulation: 3D virtual osteotomy.
