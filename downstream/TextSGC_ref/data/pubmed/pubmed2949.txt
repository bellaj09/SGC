Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family. Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses however viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology PRT System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet UV light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious while maintaining blood product quality. Here we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. Inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in plasma and platelet products using a riboflavin and ultraviolet light-based photochemical treatment.
