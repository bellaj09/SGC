"We compared the performance of different Deep learning-convolutional neural network DL-CNN models for bladder cancer treatment response assessment based on transfer learning by freezing different DL-CNN layers and varying the DL-CNN structure. Pre- and posttreatment computed tomography scans of 123 patients cancers 129; pre- and posttreatment cancer pairs 158 undergoing chemotherapy were collected. After chemotherapy 33% of patients had T0 stage cancer complete response. Regions of interest in pre- and posttreatment scans were extracted from the segmented lesions and combined into hybrid pre -post image pairs h-ROIs. Training pairs 94; h-ROIs 6209 validation 10 pairs and test sets 54 pairs were obtained. The DL-CNN consisted of 2 convolution C1-C2 2 locally connected L3-L4 and 1 fully connected layers. The DL-CNN was trained with h-ROIs to classify cancers as fully responding stage T0 or not fully responding to chemotherapy. Two radiologists provided lesion likelihood of being stage T0 posttreatment. The test area under the ROC curve AUC was 0.73 for T0 prediction by the base DL-CNN structure with randomly initialized weights. The base DL-CNN structure with pretrained weights and transfer learning no frozen layers achieved test AUC of 0.79. The test AUCs for 3 modified DL-CNN structures different C1-C2 max pooling filter sizes strides and padding with transfer learning were 0.72 0.86 and 0.69. For the base DL-CNN with C1 frozen C1-C2 frozen and C1-C2-L3 frozen the test AUCs were 0.81 0.78 and 0.71 respectively. The radiologists AUCs were 0.76 and 0.77. DL-CNN performed better with pretrained than randomly initialized weights." Deep Learning Approach for Assessment of Bladder Cancer Treatment Response.
