Ultrasound molecular imaging UMI is enabled by targeted microbubbles MBs which are highly reflective ultrasound contrast agents that bind to specific biomarkers. Distinguishing between adherent MBs and background signals can be challenging in vivo. The preferred preclinical technique is differential targeted enhancement DTE wherein a strong acoustic pulse is used to destroy MBs to verify their locations. However DTE intrinsically cannot be used for real-time imaging and may cause undesirable bioeffects. In this work we propose a simple 4-layer convolutional neural network to nondestructively detect adherent MB signatures. We investigated several types of input data to the network: "anatomy-mode" fundamental frequency" contrast-mode" pulse-inversion harmonic frequency or both i.e." dual-mode" using IQ channel signals the channel sum or the channel sum magnitude. Training and evaluation were performed on in vivo mouse tumor data and microvessel phantoms. The dual-mode channel signals yielded optimal performance achieving a soft Dice coefficient of 0.45 and AUC of 0.91 in two test images. In a volumetric acquisition the network best detected a breast cancer tumor resulting in a generalized contrast-to-noise ratio GCNR of 0.93 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic KSS of 0.86 outperforming both regular contrast mode imaging GCNR=0.76 KSS=0.53 and DTE imaging GCNR=0.81 KSS=0.62. Further development of the methodology is necessary to distinguish free from adherent MBs. These results demonstrate that neural networks can be trained to detect targeted MBs with DTE-like quality using nondestructive dual-mode data and can be used to facilitate the safe and real-time translation of UMI to clinical applications.
