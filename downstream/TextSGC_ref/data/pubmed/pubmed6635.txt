"Neurochemical changes evoked by electrical stimulation of the nervous system have been linked to both therapeutic and undesired effects of neuromodulation therapies used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder depression epilepsy Parkinsons disease stroke hypertension tinnitus and many other indications. In fact interest in better understanding the role of neurochemical signaling in neuromodulation therapies has been a focus of recent government- and industry-sponsored programs whose ultimate goal is to usher in an era of personalized medicine by creating neuromodulation therapies that respond to real-time changes in patient status. A key element to achieving these precision therapeutic interventions is the development of mathematical modeling approaches capable of describing the nonlinear transfer function between neuromodulation parameters and evoked neurochemical changes. Here we propose two computational modeling frameworks based on artificial neural networks ANNs and Volterra kernels that can characterize the input/output transfer functions of stimulation-evoked neurochemical release. We evaluate the ability of these modeling frameworks to characterize subject-specific neurochemical kinetics by accurately describing stimulation-evoked dopamine release across rodent R2 = 0.83 Volterra kernel R2 = 0.86 ANN swine R2 = 0.90 Volterra kernel R2 = 0.93 ANN and non-human primate R2 = 0.98 Volterra kernel R2 = 0.96 ANN models of brain stimulation. Ultimately these models will not only improve understanding of neurochemical signaling in healthy and diseased brains but also facilitate the development of neuromodulation strategies capable of controlling neurochemical release via closed-loop strategies."
