Diffusion imaging tractography has allowed the in vivo description of brain white matter. One of its applications is preoperative planning for brain tumor resection. Due to a limited spatial and angular resolution it is difficult for fiber tracking to delineate fiber crossing areas and small-scale structures in particular brainstem tracts and cranial nerves. New methods are being developed but these involve extensive multistep tractography pipelines including the patient-specific design of multiple regions of interest ROIs. The authors propose a new practical full tractography method that could be implemented in routine presurgical planning for skull base surgery. Full tractography for detecting the position of cranial nerves in preoperative planning for skull base surgery: technical note.
