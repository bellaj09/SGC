"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the internal segment of the globus pallidus GPi in patients with Parkinsons disease and dystonia improves motor symptoms and quality of life. Traditionally pallidal borders have been demarcated by electrophysiological microelectrode recordings MERs during DBS surgery. However detection of pallidal borders can be challenging due to the variability of the firing characteristics of neurons encountered along the trajectory. MER can also be time-consuming and therefore costly. Here we show the feasibility of real-time machine learning classification of striato-pallidal borders to assist neurosurgeons during DBS surgery."
