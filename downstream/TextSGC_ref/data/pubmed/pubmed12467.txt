To enable the application of deep learning in biology we present Selene https://selene.flatironinstitute.org/ a PyTorch-based deep learning library for fast and easy development training and application of deep learning model architectures for any biological sequence data. We demonstrate on DNA sequences how Selene allows researchers to easily train a published architecture on new data develop and evaluate a new architecture and use a trained model to answer biological questions of interest.
