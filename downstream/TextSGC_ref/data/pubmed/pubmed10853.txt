Automatic seizure detection is significant for the diagnosis of epilepsy and reducing the massive workload of reviewing continuous EEGs. In this work a novel approach combining Stockwell transform S-transform with deep Convolutional Neural Networks CNN is proposed to detect seizure onsets in long-term intracranial EEG recordings. Primarily raw EEG data is filtered with wavelet decomposition. Then S-transform is used to obtain a proper time-frequency representation of each EEG segment. After that a 15-layer deep CNN using dropout and batch normalization serves as a robust feature extractor and classifier. Finally smoothing and collar technique are applied to the outputs of CNN to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false detection rate FDR. The segment-based and event-based evaluation assessments and receiver operating characteristic ROC curves are employed for the performance evaluation on a public EEG database containing 21 patients. A segment-based sensitivity of 97.01% and a specificity of 98.12% are yielded. For the event-based assessment this method achieves a sensitivity of 95.45% with an FDR of 0.36/h.
