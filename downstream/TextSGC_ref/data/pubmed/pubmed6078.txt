Conventional methods of matrix completion are linear methods that are not effective in handling data of nonlinear structures. Recently a few researchers attempted to incorporate nonlinear techniques into matrix completion but there still exists considerable limitations. In this paper a novel method called deep matrix factorization DMF is proposed for nonlinear matrix completion. Different from conventional matrix completion methods that are based on linear latent variable models DMF is on the basis of a nonlinear latent variable model. DMF is formulated as a deep-structure neural network in which the inputs are the low-dimensional unknown latent variables and the outputs are the partially observed variables. In DMF the inputs and the parameters of the multilayer neural network are simultaneously optimized to minimize the reconstruction errors for the observed entries. Then the missing entries can be readily recovered by propagating the latent variables to the output layer. DMF is compared with state-of-the-art methods of linear and nonlinear matrix completion in the tasks of toy matrix completion image inpainting and collaborative filtering. The experimental results verify that DMF is able to provide higher matrix completion accuracy than existing methods do and DMF is applicable to large matrices.
