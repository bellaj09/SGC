The interactions between ncRNAs and proteins are critical for regulating various cellular processes in organisms such as gene expression regulations. However due to limitations including financial and material consumptions in recent experimental methods for predicting ncRNA and protein interactions it is essential to propose an innovative and practical approach with convincing performance of prediction accuracy. In this study based on the protein sequences from a biological perspective we put forward an effective deep learning method named BGFE to predict ncRNA and protein interactions. Protein sequences are represented by bi-gram probability feature extraction method from Position Specific Scoring Matrix PSSM and for ncRNA sequences k-mers sparse matrices are employed to represent them. Furthermore to extract hidden high-level feature information a stacked auto-encoder network is employed with the stacked ensemble integration strategy. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by using three datasets and a five-fold cross-validation after classifying the features through the random forest classifier. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the prediction accuracy of our approach. In general the proposed method is helpful for ncRNA and protein interacting predictions and it provides some serviceable guidance in future biological research.
