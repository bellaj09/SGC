For evaluation of upper limb impairment and activity capacity Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity FMA-UE and Action Research Arm Test ARAT are recommended to be included in stroke trials. To improve the understanding of mechanisms of motor recovery and differentiate between restitution and compensation kinematic analysis is also recommended for assessment of upper limb function after stroke. End-point kinematics using virtual reality explaining upper limb impairment and activity capacity in stroke.
