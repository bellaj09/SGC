"Despite the effectiveness of levodopa for treatment of Parkinsons disease PD prolonged usage leads to development of motor complications most notably levodopa-induced dyskinesia LID. Persons with PD and their physicians must regularly modify treatment regimens and timing for optimal relief of symptoms. While standardized clinical rating scales exist for assessing the severity of PD symptoms they must be administered by a trained medical professional and are inherently subjective. Computer vision is an attractive non-contact potential solution for automated assessment of PD made possible by recent advances in computational power and deep learning algorithms. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of vision-based assessment of parkinsonism and LID using pose estimation." Vision-based assessment of parkinsonism and levodopa-induced dyskinesia with pose estimation.
