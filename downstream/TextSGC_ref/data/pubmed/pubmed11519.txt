"An accurate prediction of cage-cultured water quality is a hot topic in smart mariculture. Since the mariculturing environment is always open to its surroundings the changes in water quality parameters are normally nonlinear dynamic changeable and complex. However traditional forecasting methods have lots of problems such as low accuracy poor generalization and high time complexity. In order to solve these shortcomings a novel water quality prediction method based on the deep LSTM long short-term memory learning network is proposed to predict pH and water temperature. Firstly linear interpolation smoothing and moving average filtering techniques are used to repair correct and de-noise water quality data respectively. Secondly Pearsons correlation coefficient is used to obtain the correlation priors between pH water temperature and other water quality parameters. Finally a water quality prediction model based on LSTM is constructed using the preprocessed data and its correlation information. Experimental results show that in the short-term prediction the prediction accuracy of pH and water temperature can reach 98.56% and 98.97% and the time cost of the predictions is 0.273 s and 0.257 s respectively. In the long-term prediction the prediction accuracy of pH and water temperature can reach 95.76% and 96.88% respectively."
