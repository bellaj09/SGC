Tree rings as archives of the past and biosensors of the present offer unique opportunities to study influences of the fluctuating environment over decades to centuries. As such tree-ring-based wood traits are capital input for global vegetation models. To contribute to earth system sciences however sufficient spatial coverage is required of detailed individual-based measurements necessitating large amounts of data. X-ray computed tomography CT scanning is one of the few techniques that can deliver such data sets. Advanced X-ray CT scanning can boost tree ring research for earth system sciences.
