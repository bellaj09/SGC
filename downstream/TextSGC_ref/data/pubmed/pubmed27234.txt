Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit event-related potentials ERPs. For the example of a visual P300 speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to solve the decoding task by a transfer learning b unsupervised adaptation c language model and d dynamic stopping. Integrating dynamic stopping transfer learning and language models in an adaptive zero-training ERP speller.
