"In SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI it is very important to get an evoked EEG with a high signal to noise ratio SNR. The SNR of SSVEP is fundamentally related to the characteristics of stimulus such as its intensity and frequency and it is also related to both the reference electrode and the active electrode. In the past with SSVEP-based BCI often the potential at Cz the average potential at all electrodes or the average mastoid potential were statically selected as the reference. In conjunction a certain electrode in the occipital area was statically selected as the active electrode for all stimuli. This work proposed a dynamic selection method for the reference electrode in which all electrodes can be looked upon as active electrodes while an electrode which can result in the maximum sum relative-power of a specific frequency SSVEP can be confirmed dynamically and considered as the optimum reference electrode for that specific frequency stimulus. Comparing this dynamic selection method with previous methods in which Cz the average potential at all electrodes or the average mastoid potential were selected as the reference electrode it is demonstrated that the SNR of SSVEP is improved significantly as is the accuracy of SSVEP detection."
