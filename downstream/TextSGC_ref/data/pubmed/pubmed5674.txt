Bipolar disorder BD is a serious mental illness. Several studies have shown that brain structure and function changes and the development of BD are associated with age and sex differences. Therefore we hypothesized that the functional and structural neural circuitry of BD patients would differ according to age. The amygdala and prefrontal cortex PFC are play a key role in the emotional and cognitive processing of patients with BD. In this study we used magnetic resonance imaging MRI to examine the structural and functional connectivity within amygdala-PFC neural circuitry in women with BD at different ages. Age-specific effects of structural and functional connectivity in prefrontal-amygdala circuitry in women with bipolar disorder.
