The objective of this study was to identify frequent situations and specific cues that produce the craving to binge in Spanish and Italian samples of patients with eating disorders ED. There were two main aims: to assess transcultural differences in the contexts and cues that elicit food craving; and to develop valid reliable VR environments for effective cue-exposure therapy CET for patients from both countries. Twenty-six Spanish and 75 Italian ED patients completed an ad hoc questionnaire to assess contexts and cues that trigger the craving to binge. No differences between groups were found. All patients reported experiencing higher levels of craving in the afternoon/early evening and in the late evening/night between meals when alone and more frequently at the end of the week. Being in the dining room the kitchen the bedroom the bakery and the supermarket were the specific situations that produced the highest levels of craving to binge. We used the questionnaire results to develop a virtual reality application for CET.
