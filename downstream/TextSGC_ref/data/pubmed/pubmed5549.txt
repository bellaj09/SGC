For a mechanistic understanding of neuronal circuits in the brain a detailed description of information flow is necessary. Thereby it is crucial to link neuron function to the underlying circuit structure. Multiphoton calcium imaging is the standard technique to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously. Similarly recent advances in high-throughput electron microscopy techniques allow for the reconstruction of synaptic resolution wiring diagrams. These two methods can be combined to study both function and structure in the same specimen. Due to its small size and optical transparency the larval zebrafish brain is one of the very few vertebrate systems where both activity and connectivity of all neurons from entire anatomically defined brain regions can be analyzed. Here we describe different methods and the tools required for combining multiphoton microscopy with dense circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy stacks of entire brain regions in the larval zebrafish.
