"Encoding and recognition of unfamiliar faces in young adults were examined using positron emission tomography to determine whether different encoding strategies would lead to encoding/retrieval differences in brain activity. Three types of encoding were compared: a deep task judging pleasantness/unpleasantness a shallow task judging right/left orientation and an intentional learning task in which subjects were instructed to learn the faces for a subsequent memory test but were not provided with a specific strategy. Memory for all faces was tested with an old/new recognition test. A modest behavioral effect was obtained with deeply-encoded faces being recognized more accurately than shallowly-encoded or intentionally-learned faces. Regardless of encoding strategy encoding activated a primarily ventral system including bilateral temporal and fusiform regions and left prefrontal cortices whereas recognition activated a primarily dorsal set of regions including right prefrontal and parietal areas. Within encoding the type of strategy produced different brain activity patterns with deep encoding being characterized by left amygdala and left anterior cingulate activation. There was no effect of encoding strategy on brain activity during the recognition conditions. Posterior fusiform gyrus activation was related to better recognition accuracy in those conditions encouraging perceptual strategies whereas activity in left frontal and temporal areas correlated with better performance during the deep condition. Results highlight three important aspects of face memory: 1 the effect of encoding strategy was seen only at encoding and not at recognition; 2 left inferior prefrontal cortex was engaged during encoding of faces regardless of strategy; and 3 differential activity in fusiform gyrus was found suggesting that activity in this area is not only a result of automatic face processing but is modulated by controlled processes."
