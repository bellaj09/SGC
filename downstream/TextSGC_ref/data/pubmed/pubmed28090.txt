Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is the most common motor neuron disease leading to progressive paralysis dysarthria dysphagia and respiratory disabilities. Therapy is mostly focused on palliative interventions. During the course of the disease verbal as well as nonverbal communicative abilities become more and more impaired. In this light communication has been argued to be "the essence of human life" and crucial for patients\ quality of life. High-tech augmentative and alternative communication HT-AAC technologies such as eyetracking based computer devices and brain-computer-interfaces provide the possibility to maintain caregiver-independent communication and environmental control even in the advanced disease state of ALS. Thus they enable patients to preserve social participation and to independently communicate end-of-life-decisions. In accordance with these functions of HT-AAC their use is reported to strengthen self-determination increase patients\ quality of life and reduce caregiver burden. Therefore HT-AAC should be considered as standard of palliative care for people with ALS. On the other hand the supply with individually tailored HT-AAC technologies is limited by external and patient-inherent variables. This review aims to provide an overview of the possibilities and limitations of HT-AAC technologies and discuss their role in the palliative care for patients with ALS.
