Real-time functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging rtfMRI is used mainly for neurofeedback or for brain-computer interfaces BCI. But multi-site rtfMRI could in fact help in the application of new interactive paradigms such as the monitoring of mutual information flow or the controlling of objects in shared virtual environments. For that reason a previously developed framework that provided an integrated control and data analysis of rtfMRI experiments was extended to enable multi-site rtfMRI. Important new components included a data exchange platform for analyzing the data of both MR scanners independently and/or jointly. Information related to brain activation can be displayed separately or in a shared view. However a signal calibration procedure had to be developed and integrated in order to permit the connecting of sites that had different hardware and to account for different inter-individual brain activation levels. The framework was successfully validated in a proof-of-principle study with twelve volunteers. Thus the overall concept the calibration of grossly differing signals and BCI functionality on each site proved to work as required. To model interactions between brains in real-time more complex rules utilizing mutual activation patterns could easily be implemented to allow for new kinds of social fMRI experiments.
