Spiking Neural Networks SNNs have recently emerged as a prominent neural computing paradigm. However the typical shallow SNN architectures have limited capacity for expressing complex representations while training deep SNNs using input spikes has not been successful so far. Diverse methods have been proposed to get around this issue such as converting off-the-shelf trained deep Artificial Neural Networks ANNs to SNNs. However the ANN-SNN conversion scheme fails to capture the temporal dynamics of a spiking system. On the other hand it is still a difficult problem to directly train deep SNNs using input spike events due to the discontinuous non-differentiable nature of the spike generation function. To overcome this problem we propose an approximate derivative method that accounts for the leaky behavior of LIF neurons. This method enables training deep convolutional SNNs directly with input spike events using spike-based backpropagation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed spike-based learning on deep networks VGG and Residual architectures by achieving the best classification accuracies in MNIST SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets compared to other SNNs trained with a spike-based learning. Moreover we analyze sparse event-based computations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN training method for inference operation in the spiking domain.
