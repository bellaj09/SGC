"This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of a 50000-pose-sample-per-second 6-degree-of-freedom optical head tracking instrument with motion-to-pose latency of 28s and dynamic precision of 1-2 arcminutes. The instrument uses high-intensity infrared emitters and two duo-lateral photodiode-based optical sensors to triangulate pose. This instrument serves two purposes: it is the first step towards the requisite head tracking component in sub- 100s motion-to-photon latency optical see-through augmented reality OST AR head-mounted display HMD systems; and it enables new avenues of research into human visual perception - including measuring the thresholds for perceptible real-virtual displacement during head rotation and other human research requiring high-sample-rate motion tracking. The instruments tracking volume is limited to about 120120250 but allows for the full range of natural head rotation and is sufficient for research involving seated users. We discuss how the instruments tracking volume is scalable in multiple ways and some of the trade-offs involved therein. Finally we introduce a novel laser-pointer-based measurement technique for assessing the instruments tracking latency and repeatability. We show that the instruments motion-to-pose latency is 28s and that it is repeatable within 1-2 arcminutes at mean rotational velocities yaw in excess of 500/sec."
