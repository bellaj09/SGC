To estimate the reliability and cognitive states of operator performance in a human-machine collaborative environment we propose a novel human mental workload MW recognizer based on deep learning principles and utilizing the features of the electroencephalogram EEG. To determine personalized properties in high dimensional EEG indicators we introduce a feature mapping layer in stacked denoising autoencoder SDAE that is capable of preserving the local information in EEG dynamics. The ensemble classifier is then built via the subject-specific integrated deep learning committee and adapts to the cognitive properties of a specific human operator and alleviates inter-subject feature variations. We validate our algorithms and the ensemble SDAE classifier with local information preservation denoted by EL-SDAE on an EEG database collected during the execution of complex human-machine tasks. The classification performance indicates that the EL-SDAE outperforms several classical MW estimators when its optimal network architecture has been identified.
