Autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD are associated with complex changes as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. To date neuroimaging-based models are not able to characterize individuals with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Further although evidence shows that ADHD traits occur in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and autism spectrum disorder traits in individuals with ADHD the neurofunctional basis of the overlap is undefined. The Functional Brain Organization of an Individual Allows Prediction of Measures of Social Abilities Transdiagnostically in Autism and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
