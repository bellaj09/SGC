"Medical simulators with vision and haptic feedback techniques offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the traditional medical trainings. They have been used to train doctors in many specialties of medicine allowing tasks to be practised in a safe and repetitive manner. This paper describes a virtual-reality VR system which will help to influence surgeons learning curves in the technically challenging field of laparoscopic surgery of the rectum." Graphic and haptic simulation system for virtual laparoscopic rectum surgery.
