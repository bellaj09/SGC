Cryo-electron microscopy cryo-EM has become a widely used tool for determining the structures of proteins and macromolecular complexes. To acquire the input for single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction researchers must select hundreds of thousands of particles from micrographs. As the signal-to-noise ratio SNR of micrographs is extremely low the performance of automated particle-selection methods is still unable to meet research requirements. To free researchers from this laborious work and to acquire a large number of high-quality particles we propose an automated particle-selection method PIXER based on the idea of segmentation using a deep neural network.
