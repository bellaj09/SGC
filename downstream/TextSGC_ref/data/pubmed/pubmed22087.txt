This review article summarizes neuropsychological descriptions of abnormal body representations in brain-damaged patients and recent neuroscientific investigations of their sensorimotor underpinnings in healthy participants. The first part of the article describes unilateral disorders of the bodily self such as asomatognosia feelings of amputation supernumerary phantom limbs and somatoparaphrenia as well as descriptions of non-lateralized disorders of the bodily self including Alice in Wonderland syndrome and autoscopic hallucinations. Because the sensorimotor mechanisms of these disorders are unclear we focus on clinical descriptions and insist on the importance of reporting clinical cases to better understand the full range of bodily disorders encountered in neurological diseases. The second part of the article presents the advantages of merging neuroscientific approaches of the bodily self with immersive virtual reality robotics and neuroprosthetics to foster the understanding of the multisensory motor and neural mechanisms of bodily representations. The bodily self: Insights from clinical and experimental research.
