Progress in electron microscopy-based high-resolution connectomics is limited by data analysis throughput. Here we present SegEM a toolset for efficient semi-automated analysis of large-scale fully stained 3D-EM datasets for the reconstruction of neuronal circuits. By combining skeleton reconstructions of neurons with automated volume segmentations SegEM allows the reconstruction of neuronal circuits at a work hour consumption rate of about 100-fold less than manual analysis and about 10-fold less than existing segmentation tools. SegEM provides a robust classifier selection procedure for finding the best automated image classifier for different types of nerve tissue. We applied these methods to a volume of 44  60  141 m3 SBEM data from mouse retina and a volume of 93  60  93 m3 from mouse cortex and performed exemplary synaptic circuit reconstruction. SegEM resolves the tradeoff between synapse detection and semi-automated reconstruction performance in high-resolution connectomics and makes efficient circuit reconstruction in fully-stained EM datasets a ready-to-use technique for neuroscience.
