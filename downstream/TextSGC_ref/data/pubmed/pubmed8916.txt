As Twitter has become an active data source for health surveillance research it is important that efficient and effective methods are developed to identify tweets related to personal health experience. Conventional classification algorithms rely on features engineered by human domain experts and engineering such features is a challenging task and requires much human intelligence. The resultant features may not be optimal for the classification problem and can make it challenging for conventional classifiers to correctly predict personal experience tweets PETs due to the various ways to express and/or describe personal experience in tweets. In this study we developed a method that combines word embedding and long short-term memory LSTM model without the need to engineer any specific features. Through word embedding tweet texts were represented as dense vectors which in turn were fed to the LSTM neural network as sequences. Identifying tweets of personal health experience through word embedding and LSTM neural network.
