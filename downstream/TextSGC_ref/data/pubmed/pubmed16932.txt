"Visuomotor entrainment or the synchronization of motor responses to visual stimuli is a naturally emergent phenomenon in human standing. Our purpose was to investigate the prevalence and resolution of visuomotor entrainment in walking and the frequency-dependent response of walking balance to perturbations. We used a virtual reality environment to manipulate optical flow in ten healthy young adults during treadmill walking. A motion capture system recorded trunk sacrum and heel marker trajectories during a series of 3-min conditions in which we perturbed a virtual hallway mediolaterally with systematic changes in the driving frequencies of perceived motion. We quantified visuomotor entrainment using spectral analyses and balance deficits using trunk sway gait variability and detrended fluctuation analyses DFA. ML kinematics were highly sensitive to visual perturbations and instinctively synchronized i.e. entrained to a broad range of driving frequencies of perceived ML motion. However the influence of visual perturbations on metrics of walking balance was frequency-dependent and governed by their proximity to stride frequency. Specifically we found that a driving frequency nearest to subjects average stride frequency uniquely compromised trunk sway gait variability and step-to-step correlations. We conclude that visuomotor entrainment is a robust and naturally emerging phenomenon during human walking involving coordinated and frequency-dependent adjustments in trunk sway and foot placement to maintain balance at the whole-body level. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how the visuomotor control of walking balance is disrupted by visual perturbations and important reference values for the emergence of balance deficits due to age injury or disease."
