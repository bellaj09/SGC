"Protein-protein interactions are closely relevant to protein function and drug discovery. Hence accurately identifying protein-protein interactions will help us to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and significantly facilitate the drug discovery. However the majority of existing computational methods for protein-protein interactions prediction are focused on the feature extraction and combination of features and there have been limited gains from the state-of-the-art models. In this work a new residue representation method named Res2vec is designed for protein sequence representation. Residue representations obtained by Res2vec describe more precisely residue-residue interactions from raw sequence and supply more effective inputs for the downstream deep learning model. Combining effective feature embedding with powerful deep learning techniques our method provides a general computational pipeline to infer protein-protein interactions even when protein structure knowledge is entirely unknown. The proposed method DeepFE-PPI is evaluated on the S. Cerevisiae and human datasets. The experimental results show that DeepFE-PPI achieves 94.78% accuracy 92.99% recall 96.45% precision 89.62% Matthews correlation coefficient MCC and 98.71% accuracy 98.54% recall 98.77% precision 97.43% MCC respectively. In addition we also evaluate the performance of DeepFE-PPI on five independent species datasets and all the results are superior to the existing methods. The comparisons show that DeepFE-PPI is capable of predicting protein-protein interactions by a novel residue representation method and a deep learning classification framework in an acceptable level of accuracy.
