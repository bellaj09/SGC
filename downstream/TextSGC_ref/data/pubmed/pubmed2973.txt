Generalized anxiety disorder GAD and social anxiety disorder SAD are currently considered distinct diagnostic categories. Accumulating data suggest the study of anxiety disorders may benefit from the use of dimensional conceptualizations. One such dimension of shared dysfunction is emotion regulation ER. The current study evaluated dimensional ER and categorical diagnosis neurocorrelates of resting-state functional connectivity rsFC in participants with GAD and SAD and healthy controls HC. Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI rsFC was estimated between all regions of the default mode network DMN salience network SN and bilateral amygdala N\u2009=\u200937: HC-19; GAD-10; SAD-8. Thereafter rsFC was predicted by both ER using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale DERS and diagnosis DSM-5 within a single unified analysis of covariance ANCOVA. For the ER dimension there was a significant association between impaired ER abilities and anticorrelated rsFC of amygdala and DMN L.amygdala-ACC: p\u2009=\u20090.011 beta\u2009=\u2009-0.345 as well as amygdala and SN L.amygdala-posterior cingulate cortex PCC: p\u2009=\u20090.032 beta\u2009=\u2009-0.409. Diagnostic status was significantly associated with rsFC differences between the SAD and HC groups both within the DMN PCC-MPFC: p\u2009=\u20090.009 and between the DMN and SN R.LP-ACC: p\u2009=\u20090.010. Although preliminary our results exemplify the potential contribution of the dimensional approach to the study of GAD and SAD and support a combined categorical and dimensional model of rsFC of anxiety disorders.
