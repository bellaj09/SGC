There have been a lot of methods to address the recognition of complete face images. However in real applications the images to be recognized are usually incomplete and it is more difficult to realize such a recognition. In this paper a novel convolution neural network frame named a low-rank-recovery network LRRNet is proposed to conquer the difficulty effectively inspired by matrix completion and deep learning techniques. The proposed LRRNet first recovers the incomplete face images via an approach of matrix completion with the truncated nuclear norm regularization solution and then extracts some low-rank parts of the recovered images as the filters. With these filters some important features are obtained by means of the binaryzation and histogram algorithms. Finally these features are classified with the classical support vector machines SVMs. The proposed LRRNet method has high face recognition rate for the heavily corrupted images especially for the images in the large databases. The proposed LRRNet performs well and efficiently for the images with heavily corrupted especially in the case of large databases. Extensive experiments on several benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed LRRNet performs better than some other excellent robust face recognition methods.
