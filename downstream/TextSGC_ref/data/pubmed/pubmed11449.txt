"Recently researchers have built new deep learning DL models using a single image modality to diagnose age-related macular degeneration AMD. Retinal fundus and optical coherence tomography OCT images in clinical settings are the most important modalities investigating AMD. Whether concomitant use of fundus and OCT data in DL technique is beneficial has not been so clearly identified. This experimental analysis used OCT and fundus image data of postmortems from the Project Macula. The DL based on OCT fundus and combination of OCT and fundus were invented to diagnose AMD. These models consisted of pre-trained VGG-19 and transfer learning using random forest. Following the data augmentation and training process the DL using OCT alone showed diagnostic efficiency with area under the curve AUC of 0.906 95% confidence interval 0.891-0.921 and 82.6% 81.0-84.3% accuracy rate. The DL using fundus alone exhibited AUC of 0.914 0.900-0.928 and 83.5% 81.8-85.0% accuracy rate. Combined usage of the fundus with OCT increased the diagnostic power with AUC of 0.969 0.956-0.979 and 90.5% 89.2-91.8% accuracy rate. The Delong test showed that the DL using both OCT and fundus data outperformed the DL using OCT alone P value <\u20090.001 and fundus image alone P value <\u20090.001. This multimodal random forest model showed even better performance than a restricted Boltzmann machine P value\u2009=\u20090.002 and deep belief network algorithms P value\u2009=\u20090.042. According to Duncans multiple range test the multimodal methods significantly improved the performance obtained by the single-modal methods. In this preliminary study a multimodal DL algorithm based on the combination of OCT and fundus image raised the diagnostic accuracy compared to this data alone. Future diagnostic DL needs to adopt the multimodal process to combine various types of imaging for a more precise AMD diagnosis.

The possibility of the combination of OCT and fundus images for improving the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning for age-related macular degeneration: a preliminary experiment.
