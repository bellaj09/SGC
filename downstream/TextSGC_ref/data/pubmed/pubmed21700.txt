"Computers used as supporting tools for diagnostics operation planning and therapy are of increasing relevance in surgery. Rapid progress in imaging techniques such as computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRT and ultrasound already allows to represent anatomical and physiological conditions with maximal authenticity. In order to simulate complex surgeries we must develop ergonomic and intuitively useable software tools thus enabling a precise and fast virtual execution of the planned surgical intervention preoperatively. Intraoperative support will consist of passive navigation tools available already today supporting the intraoperative orientation and in the future robots performing specific steps autonomously. Methods of augmented reality for the interaction of virtual objects and the real surgical scene are also suitable for the visualization of planning data and other medically relevant information in the operation <I>situs</I>. In maxillofacial and craniofacial surgery the techniques mentioned have been applied in all fields from dental implantology up to the correction of craniofacial malformations and the resection of skull base tumors. Many applications are still being developed or are still in the form of a prototype. However it is already clear that developments in this area will have a considerable effect on a surgeons routine work." Computer-based approaches for maxillofacial interventions.
