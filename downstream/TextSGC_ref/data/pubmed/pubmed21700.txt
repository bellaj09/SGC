"Walking for physical activity can bring important health benefits to older adults. In this population walking has been related to various urban design features and street characteristics. To gain new insights into the microscale environmental details that might influence seniors walking details which might be more amenable to change than neighbourhood level factors we employed a reliable streetscape audit tool in combination with Google Street View to evaluate the walkability of where older adults choose to walk. Analysis of the routes selected by a purposive sample of independently mobile adults aged 65 years and over living in Edinburgh UK revealed a preference to walk in more walkable environments alongside a willingness to walk in less supportive settings. At times factors commonly considered important for walking including wayfinding and legibility user conflict kerb paving quality and lighting appeared to have little impact on older adults decisions about where to walk. The implications for policy practice and the emerging technique of virtual auditing are considered."
