For robots to successfully integrate into everyday life it is important that they can be effectively controlled by laypeople. However the task of manually controlling mobile robots can be challenging due to demanding cognitive and sensorimotor requirements. This research explores the effect that the built environment has on the manual control of domestic service robots. In this study a virtual reality simulation of a domestic robot control scenario was developed. The performance of fifty novice users was evaluated and their subjective experiences recorded through questionnaires. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis it was found that untrained operators frequently perform poorly at navigation-based robot control tasks. The study found that passing through doorways accounted for the largest number of collisions and was consistently identified as a very difficult operation to perform. These findings suggest that homes and other human-orientated settings present significant challenges to robot control.
