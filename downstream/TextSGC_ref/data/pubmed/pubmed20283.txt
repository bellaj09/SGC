There is increasing evidence that educating trainee surgeons by simulation is preferable to traditional operating-room training methods with actual patients. Apart from reducing costs and risks to patients training by simulation can provide some unique benefits such as greater control over the training procedure and more easily defined metrics for assessing proficiency. Virtual reality VR simulators are now playing an increasing role in surgical training. However currently available VR simulators lack the fidelity to teach trainees past the novice-to-intermediate skills level. Recent technological developments in other industries using simulation such as the games and entertainment and aviation industries suggest that the next generation of VR simulators should be suitable for training maintenance and certification of advanced surgical skills. To be effective as an advanced surgical training and assessment tool VR simulation needs to provide adequate and relevant levels of physical realism case complexity and performance assessment. Proper validation of VR simulators and an increased appreciation of their value by the medical profession are crucial for them to be accepted into surgical training curricula. Progress in virtual reality simulators for surgical training and certification.
