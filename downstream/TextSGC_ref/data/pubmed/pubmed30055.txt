"Recent preclinical advances highlight the therapeutic potential of treatments aimed at boosting regeneration and plasticity of spinal circuitry damaged by spinal cord injury SCI. With several promising candidates being considered for translation into clinical trials the SCI community has called for a non-human primate model as a crucial validation step to test efficacy and validity of these therapies prior to human testing. The present paper reviews the previous and ongoing efforts of the California Spinal Cord Consortium CSCC a multidisciplinary team of experts from 5 University of California medical and research centers to develop this crucial translational SCI model. We focus on the growing volumes of high resolution data collected by the CSCC and our efforts to develop a biomedical informatics framework aimed at leveraging multidimensional data to monitor plasticity and repair targeting recovery of hand and arm function. Although the main focus of many researchers is the restoration of voluntary motor control we also describe our ongoing efforts to add assessments of sensory function including pain vital signs during surgery and recovery of bladder and bowel function. By pooling our multidimensional data resources and building a unified database infrastructure for this clinically relevant translational model of SCI we are now in a unique position to test promising therapeutic strategies efficacy on the entire syndrome of SCI. We review analyses highlighting the intersection between motor sensory autonomic and pathological contributions to the overall restoration of function.
