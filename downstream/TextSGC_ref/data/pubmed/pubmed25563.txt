This paper demonstrates the feasibility of decoding neuronal population signals using a sparse linear regression model with an elastic net penalty. In offline analysis of real electrocorticographic ECoG neural data the elastic net achieved a timepoint decoding accuracy of 95% for classifying hand grasps vs. rest and 82% for moving a cursor in 1-D space towards a target. These results were superior to those obtained using 2-penalized and unpenalized linear regression and marginally better than 1-penalized regression. Elastic net and the 1-penalty also produced sparse feature sets but the elastic net did not eliminate correlated features which could result in a more stable decoder for brain-computer interfaces. Sparse linear regression with elastic net regularization for brain-computer interfaces.
