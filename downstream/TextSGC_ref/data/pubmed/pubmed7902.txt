The success of Deep Learning models notably convolutional neural networks CNNs makes them the favorable solution for object recognition systems in both visible and infrared domains. However the lack of training data in the case of maritime ships research leads to poor performance due to the problem of overfitting. In addition the back-propagation algorithm used to train CNN is very slow and requires tuning many hyperparameters. To overcome these weaknesses we introduce a new approach fully based on Extreme Learning Machine ELM to learn useful CNN features and perform a fast and accurate classification which is suitable for infrared-based recognition systems. The proposed approach combines an ELM based learning algorithm to train CNN for discriminative features extraction and an ELM based ensemble for classification. The experimental results on VAIS dataset which is the largest dataset of maritime ships confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in term of generalization performance and training speed. For instance the proposed model is up to 950 times faster than the traditional back-propagation based training of convolutional neural networks primarily for low-level features extraction.
