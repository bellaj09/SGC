"Commercially available devices for Brain-Computer Interface BCI-controlled robotic stroke rehabilitation are prohibitively expensive for many researchers who are interested in the topic and physicians who would utilize such a device. Additionally they are cumbersome and require a technician to operate increasing the inaccessibility of such devices for home-based robotic stroke rehabilitation therapy. Presented here is the design implementation and test of an inexpensive portable and adaptable BCI-controlled hand therapy device. The system utilizes a soft flexible pneumatic glove which can be used to deflect the subjects wrist and fingers. Operation is provided by a custom-designed pneumatic circuit. Air flow is controlled by an embedded system which receives serial port instruction from a PC running real-time BCI software. System tests demonstrate that glove control can be successfully driven by a real-time BCI. A system such as the one described here may be used to explore closed loop neurofeedback rehabilitation in stroke relatively inexpensively and potentially in home environments."
