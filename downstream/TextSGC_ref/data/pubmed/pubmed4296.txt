"The contribution of hypoperfusion to abnormal functional connectivity in Alzheimers disease AD and mild cognitive impairment MCI remains unclear. In this study we investigated the potential association between brain perfusion and functional connectivity FC and its effects on the cognitive impairment among AD MCI and normal controls NC. One-time acquisition of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI was used to study brain perfusion and FC. Compared to the NC the perfusion in the left temporal lobe showed significantly lower in AD and bilateral hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe showed in MCI. Using these hypoperfusion areas as seed regions we found that FC between the left inferior temporal gyrus and medial frontal-cingulate regions in AD patients was significantly lower than that in NCs. The FC between the right medial superior frontal gyrus and left parietal lobe in MCI patients was significantly higher than that in NCs. Additionally the FC between the right medial superior frontal gyrus and the left superior parietal gyrus were found to be correlated significantly and negatively with mini-mental state examination MMSE scores in MCI patients. In conclusion hypoperfusion may affect cognitive states via abnormal FC as an additional factor contributing to cognitive impairment."
