Body awareness is the result of sensory integration in the posterior parietal cortex; however other brain structures are part of this process. Our goal is to determine how the cingulate cortex is involved in the representation of our body. We retrospectively selected patients with drug-resistant epilepsy explored by stereo-electroencephalography that had the cingulate cortex sampled outside the epileptogenic zone. The clinical effects of high-frequency electrical stimulation were reviewed and only those sites that elicited changes related to body perception were included. Connectivity of the cingulate cortex and other cortical structures was assessed using the h2 coefficient following a nonlinear regression analysis of the broadband EEG signal. Poststimulation changes in connectivity were compared between two sets of stimulations eliciting or not eliciting symptoms related to body awareness interest and control groups. We included 17 stimulations from 12 patients that reported different types of body perception changes such as sensation of being pushed toward right/left/up one limb becoming heavier/lighter illusory sensation of movement sensation of pressure sensation of floating or detachment of one hemi-body. High-frequency stimulation in the cingulate cortex 1 anterior 15 middle 1 posterior part elicits body perception changes associated with a decreased connectivity of the dominant posterior insula and increased coupling between other structures located particularly in the nondominant hemisphere. Illusory own body perceptions mapped in the cingulate cortex-An intracranial stimulation study.
