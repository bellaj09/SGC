"One challenge of using an interesting object such as a scale model as a symbol for something else is childrens deep interest in the object itself. Attending to the model the symbol as a toy children do not use information about where in the model a tiny dog is hiding to mentally represent where a larger dog is hiding in the full-sized room the referent. Young children use pictures in this way because they are relatively uninteresting as objects. Today interactive images on touchscreens function as virtual objects on which to act and which respond to the users actions. In this chapter we examine how interactive symbolic media e.g. touchscreens video chat augmented reality might affect childrens symbolic development and the way that psychologists think about representational objects. Young childrens learning about and from interactive media may depend upon adults scaffolding childrens use of these new cultural tools."
