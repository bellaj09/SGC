Named entity recognition NER is a key step in clinical natural language processing NLP. Traditionally rule-based systems leverage prior knowledge to define rules to identify named entities. Recently deep learning-based NER systems have become more and more popular. Contextualized word embedding as a new type of representation of the word has been proposed to dynamically capture word sense using context information and has proven successful in many deep learning-based systems in either general domain or medical domain. However there are very few studies that investigate the effects of combining multiple contextualized embeddings and prior knowledge on the clinical NER task.
