"There has been increasing interest in modelling survival data using deep learning methods in medical research. Current approaches have focused on designing special cost functions to handle censored survival data. We propose a very different method with two simple steps. In the first step we transform each subjects survival time into a series of jackknife pseudo conditional survival probabilities and then use these pseudo probabilities as a quantitative response variable in the deep neural network model. By using the pseudo values we reduce a complex survival analysis to a standard regression problem which greatly simplifies the neural network construction. Our two-step approach is simple yet very flexible in making risk predictions for survival data which is very appealing from the practice point of view.
