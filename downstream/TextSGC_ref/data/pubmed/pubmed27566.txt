Understanding the mechanisms of neural stimulation is necessary to improve the management of sensory disorders. Neurons can be artificially stimulated using electrical current or with newer stimulation modalities including optogenetics. Electrical stimulation forms the basis for all neuroprosthetic devices that are used clinically. Off-target stimulation and poor implant performance remain concerns for patients with electrically based neuroprosthetic devices. Optogenetic techniques may improve cranial nerve stimulation strategies used by various neuroprostheses and result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews the fundamentals of neural stimulation and provides an overview of recent major advancements in light-based neuromodulation."
