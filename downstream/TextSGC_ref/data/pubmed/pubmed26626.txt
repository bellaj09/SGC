"Flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors have been attracting wide attention for applications in health monitoring and human-machine interfaces because of their simple device structure and easy-readout signals. For practical applications flexible pressure sensors with both high sensitivity and wide linearity range are highly desirable. Herein a simple and low-cost method for the fabrication of a flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor with a hierarchical structure over large areas is presented. The piezoresistive pressure sensor consists of arrays of microscale papillae with nanoscale roughness produced by replicating the lotus leafs surface and spray-coating of graphene ink. Finite element analysis FEA shows that the hierarchical structure governs the deformation behavior and pressure distribution at the contact interface leading to a quick and steady increase in contact area with loads. As a result the piezoresistive pressure sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity of 1.2 kPa-1 and a wide linearity range from 0 to 25 kPa. The flexible pressure sensor is applied for sensitive monitoring of small vibrations including wrist pulse and acoustic waves. Moreover a piezoresistive pressure sensor array is fabricated for mapping the spatial distribution of pressure. These results highlight the potential applications of the flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor for health monitoring and electronic skin."
