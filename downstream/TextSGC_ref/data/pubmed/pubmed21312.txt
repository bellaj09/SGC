How the brain functions during behavioural tasks conducted in virtual reality VR remains largely unresolved. This issue is extremely important both in terms of establishing the benefits of VR through basic science as well as for future optimization of tasks conducted in VR environments. Here the authors describe their current work to develop a testing platform for conducting VR experiments that can be probed by functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to measure brain activity. Examples involving human spatial navigation and data glove operation illustrate the technical feasibility of the approach and introduce thought-provoking observations of brain activation patterns. Future research directions for combined use of VR and fMRI are also discussed. A platform for combining virtual reality experiments with functional magnetic resonance imaging.
