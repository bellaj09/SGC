"Muscle force-length dynamics are governed by intrinsic contractile properties motor stimulation and mechanical load. Although intrinsic properties are well-characterised physiologists lack in vitro instrumentation accounting for combined effects of limb inertia musculoskeletal architecture and contractile dynamics. We introduce in vitro virtual-reality in vitro-VR which enables in vitro muscle tissue to drive a musculoskeletal jumping simulation. In hardware muscle force from a frog plantaris was transmitted to a software model where joint torques inertia and ground reaction forces were computed to advance the simulation at 1 kHz. To close the loop simulated muscle strain was returned to update in vitro length. We manipulated 1 stimulation timing and 2 the virtual muscles anatomical origin. This influenced interactions among muscular inertial gravitational and contact forces dictating limb kinematics and jump performance. We propose that in vitro-VR can be used to illustrate how neuromuscular control and musculoskeletal anatomy influence muscle dynamics and biomechanical performance."
