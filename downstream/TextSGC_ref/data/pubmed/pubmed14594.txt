With recent substantial improvements in modern computing interest in quantitative imaging with CT has seen a dramatic increase. As a result the need to both create and analyze large high-quality datasets of clinical studies has increased as well. At present no efficient widely available method exists to accomplish this. The purpose of this technical note is to describe an open-source high-throughput computational pipeline framework for the reconstruction and analysis of diagnostic CT imaging data to conduct large-scale quantitative imaging studies and to accelerate and improve quantitative imaging research. Technical Note: Design and implementation of a high-throughput pipeline for reconstruction and quantitative analysis of CT image data.
