In this paper we propose a novel image dehazing method. Typical deep learning models for dehazing are trained on paired synthetic indoor dataset. Therefore these models may be effective for indoor image dehazing but less so for outdoor images. We propose a heterogeneous Generative Adversarial Networks GAN based method composed of a cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks CycleGAN for producing haze-clear images and a conditional Generative Adversarial Networks cGAN for preserving textural details. We introduce a novel loss function in the training of the fused network to minimize GAN generated artifacts to recover fine details and to preserve color components. These networks are fused via a convolutional neural network CNN to generate dehazed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world hazy images.
