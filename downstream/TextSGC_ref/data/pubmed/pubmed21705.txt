Synthetic sounds tone-beeps vowels or syllables are typically used in the assessment of attention to auditory stimuli because they evoke a set of well-known event-related potentials whose characteristics can be statistically contrasted. Such approach rules out the use of stimuli with non-predictable response such as human speech. In this study we present a procedure based on the robust binary phase-shift keying BPSK receiver that permits the real-time detection of selective attention to human speeches in dichotic listening tasks. The goal was achieved by tagging the speeches with two barely-audible tags whose joined EEG response constitutes a reliable BPSK constellation which can be detected by means of a BPSK receiver. The results confirmed the expected generation of the BPSK constellation by the human auditory system. Also the bit-error rate and the information transmission rate achieved in the detection of attention fairly followed the expected curves and equations of the standard BPSK receiver. Actually it was possible to detect attention as well as the estimation a priori of its accuracy based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the BPSK signals. This procedure which permits the detection of the attention to human speeches can be of interest for new potential applications such as brain-computer interfaces clinical assessment of the attention in real time or for entertainment.
