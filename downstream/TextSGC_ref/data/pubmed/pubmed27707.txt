"Dystonia is often currently treated with botulinum toxin injections to spastic muscles or deep brain stimulation to the basal ganglia. In addition to these pharmacological or neurosurgical measures a new noninvasive treatment concept functional modulation using a brain-computer interface was tested for feasibility. We recorded electroencephalograms EEGs over the bilateral sensorimotor cortex from a patient suffering from chronic writers cramp. The patient was asked to suppress an exaggerated beta frequency component in the EEG during hand extension."
