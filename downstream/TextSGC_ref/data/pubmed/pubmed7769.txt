We propose the Learned Primal-Dual algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. The algorithm accounts for a possibly non-linear forward operator in a deep neural network by unrolling a proximal primal-dual optimization method but where the proximal operators have been replaced with convolutional neural networks. The algorithm is trained end-to-end working directly from raw measured data and it does not depend on any initial reconstruction such as filtered back-projection FBP. We compare performance of the proposed method on low dose computed tomography reconstruction against FBP total variation TV and deep learning based post-processing of FBP. For the Shepp-Logan phantom we obtain >6 dB peak signal to noise ratio improvement against all compared methods. For human phantoms the corresponding improvement is 6.6 dB over TV and 2.2 dB over learned post-processing along with a substantial improvement in the structural similarity index. Finally our algorithm involves only ten forward-back-projection computations making the method feasible for time critical clinical applications. Learned Primal-Dual Reconstruction.
