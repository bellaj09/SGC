Positron emission tomography and computed tomography PET-CT dual-modality imaging provides critical diagnostic information in modern cancer diagnosis and therapy. Automated accurate tumor delineation is essentially important in computer-assisted tumor reading and interpretation based on PET-CT. In this paper we propose a novel approach for the segmentation of lung tumors that combines the powerful fully convolutional networks FCN based semantic segmentation framework 3D-UNet and the graph cut based co-segmentation model. First two separate deep UNets are trained on PET and CT separately to learn high level discriminative features to generate tumor/non-tumor masks and probability maps for PET and CT images. Then the two probability maps on PET and CT are further simultaneously employed in a graph cut based co-segmentation model to produce the final tumor segmentation results. Comparative experiments on 32 PET-CT scans of lung cancer patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 3D FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR CO-SEGMENTATION OF TUMORS ON PET-CT IMAGES.
