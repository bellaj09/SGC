Esophageal intubations are performed for urgent airway control in injured patients. Current methods of training include working on cadavers and mannequins which lack the realism of a living human being. Work in this field has been limited due to the complex nature of simulating in real-time the interactive forces and deformations which occur during an actual patient intubation. This study addressed the issue of intubation training in an attempt to bridge the gap between actual and virtual patient scenarios. The two haptic devices along with the real-time performance of the simulator give it both visual and physical realism. The three dimensional viewing and interaction available through virtual reality make it possible for physicians pre-hospital personnel and students to practice many esophageal intubations without ever touching a patient. The ability for a medical professional to practice a procedure multiple times prior to performing it on a patient will both enhance the skill of the individual while reducing the risk to the patient. A virtual environment for esophageal intubation training.
