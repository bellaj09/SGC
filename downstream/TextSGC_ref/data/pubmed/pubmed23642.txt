In an effort to reduce morbidity of cardiac interventions minimizing invasiveness inevitably leads to limited visual access to the surgical targets. To address these limitations we provide the surgeons with a robust visualization environment that integrates interventional ultrasound imaging augmented with pre-operative anatomical models and virtual surgical instruments within a virtual reality environment. Here we present an in vitro study on a cardiac phantom that mimics an ablation therapy procedure which allows us to assess the feasibility of our surgical system in comparison to traditional intra-operative ultrasound imaging. Following surgical target identification via an electro-anatomical model the "ablation procedure" is performed blindly. A 2.8 mm RMS targeting error is achieved using our novel surgical system. This level of accuracy is adequate from both a clinical and engineering perspective under the inherent procedure requirements and limitations of the system.
