Visualization is one of the main features of Building Information Modeling BIM. It has many advantages throughout the lifecycle of a construction project and it has become a timely research topic in recent years. However no attempt has been made to give a holistic understanding of the existing BIM-based visualization research status. Thus this study aims to conduct a scientometric analysis of the existing BIM-based visualization literature and to gain a snapshot of the research status during the period 2010-2019. A total of 255 articles were abstracted from the Scopus database. Then the VOSviewer program was employed to visualize the research status from the perspectives of scholars countries/regions journals articles and co-occurring keywords. Results revealed that Wang X. published the greatest number of articles while Cheng J.C.P. received the greatest average normalized citations. Furthermore Automation in Construction was identified as the most influential journal and the article "Building information modeling BIM: trends benefits risks and challenges for the AEC industry" was the most cited paper. Through the keywords co-occurrence analysis "virtual reality" and "visual programming language" were identified as the emerging themes in this field. The research findings can provide both researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the status quo and trends of the BIM-based visualization research.
