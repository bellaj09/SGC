A high-speed steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI system using dry EEG electrodes was demonstrated in this study. The dry electrode was fabricated in our laboratory. It was designed as claw-like structure with a diameter of 14\u2009mm featuring 8 small fingers of 6\u2009mm length and 2\u2009mm diameter. The structure and elasticity can help the fingers pass through the hair and contact the scalp when the electrode is placed on head. The electrode was capable of recording spontaneous EEG and evoked brain activities such as SSVEP with high signal-to-noise ratio. This study implemented a twelve-class SSVEP-based BCI system with eight electrodes embedded in a headband. Subjects also completed a comfort level questionnaire with the dry electrodes. Using a preprocessing algorithm of filter bank analysis FBA and a classification algorithm based on task-related component analysis TRCA the average classification accuracy of eleven participants was 93.2% using 1-second-long SSVEPs leading to an average information transfer rate ITR of 92.35 bits/min. All subjects did not report obvious discomfort with the dry electrodes. This result represented the highest communication speed in the dry-electrode based BCI systems. The proposed system could provide a comfortable user experience and a stable control method for developing practical BCIs. A High-Speed SSVEP-Based BCI Using Dry EEG Electrodes.
