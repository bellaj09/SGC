"Soil moisture is one of the main factors in agricultural production and hydrological cycles and its precise prediction is important for the rational use and management of water resources. However soil moisture involves complex structural characteristics and meteorological factors and it is difficult to establish an ideal mathematical model for soil moisture prediction. Existing prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy generalization and multi-feature processing capability and prediction performance must improve. Based on this taking the Beijing area as the research object the deep learning regression network DNNR with big data fitting capability was proposed to construct a soil moisture prediction model. By integrating the dataset analyzing the time series of the predictive variables and clarifying the relationship between features and predictive variables through the Taylor diagram selected meteorological parameters can provide effective weights for moisture prediction. Test results prove that the deep learning model is feasible and effective for soil moisture prediction. Its good data fitting and generalization capability can enrich the input characteristics while ensuring high accuracy in predicting the trends and values of soil moisture data and provides an effective theoretical basis for water-saving irrigation and drought control."
