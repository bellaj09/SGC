"Sensorimotor-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have achieved successful control of real and virtual devices in up to three dimensions; however the traditional sensor-based paradigm limits the intuitive use of these systems. Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command revealing a cognitive disconnection between the users intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device."
