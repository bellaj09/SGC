Femoral fractures in children can be treated effectively and with a low complication rate by using external fixation. However as with most treatment modalities there is a learning curve to be considered. The aim of this paper is to report "tricks" and different considerations that we have learned to be of value based on experience gained during a prospective and consecutive study of 98 femoral fractures in children aged 3-15 years. Our experience is based on the use of a unilateral fixator with the option to apply axial dynamisation. Traction prior to operation is not needed if the child is operated on within 24h. During surgery a traction table will prevent significant malrotation and facilitate reduction prior to insertion of the pins. Four 4 or 5mm pins are sufficient for adequate stability in children. Transverse skin incisions are preferable for pin insertion as the scars become smaller and the soft tissue irritation during activity is less when compared with longitudinal incisions. Unrestricted weight-bearing can be allowed. A nihilistic approach to pin site care with daily showers is as effective as more aggressive treatment with local antiseptics. Pin infections can occur but are mild and can be treated locally or with a short period of antibiotics taken orally. Pin-loosening and deep infections are very uncommon. By using external fixation malunion overgrowth or delayed union can almost be avoided completely. Re-fractures are rare and occur only after significant trauma. Treatment time is relatively short. No physiotherapy or further protection of the leg is necessary during or after healing. Technique and considerations when using external fixation as a standard treatment of femoral fractures in children.
