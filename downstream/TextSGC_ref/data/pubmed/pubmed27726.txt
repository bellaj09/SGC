EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI can be regarded as a new channel for motor control except that it does not involve muscles. Normal neuromuscular motor control has two fundamental components: 1 to control the body and 2 to predict the consequences of the control command which is called motor prediction. In this study after training with a specially designed BCI paradigm based on motor imagery two subjects learnt to predict the time course of some features of the EEG signals. It is shown that with this newly-obtained motor prediction skill subjects can use motor imagery of feet to directly control a mobile robot to avoid obstacles and reach a small target in a time-critical scenario.
