"We have been developing and combining state-of-art devices that allow humans to visualize and feel synthetic objects superimposed on the real world. This effort stems from the need of platform for extending experiments on motor control and learning to realistic human motor tasks and environments not currently represented in the practice of research. This papers goal is to outline our motivations progress and objectives. Because the system is a general tool we also hope to motivate researchers in related fields to join in. The platform under development an augmented reality system combined with a haptic-interface robot will be a new tool for contributing to the scientific knowledge base in the area of human movement control and rehabilitation robotics. Because this is a prototype the system will also guide new methods by probing the levels of quality necessary for future design cycles and related technology. Inevitably it should also lead the way to commercialization of such systems." Robotics and virtual reality: the development of a life-sized 3-D system for the rehabilitation of motor function.
