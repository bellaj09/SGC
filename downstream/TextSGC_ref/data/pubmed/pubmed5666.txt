"Purpose: Primary insomnia PI is the second most common mental disorder. However the topologic alterations in structural brain connectome in patients with PI remain largely unknown. Methods: A total of 44 PI patients and 46 age- gender- and education level matched healthy control HC participants were recruited in this study. Diffusion tensor imaging DTI and resting state MRI were used to construct structural connectome for each participant and the network parameters were employed by non-parametric permutations to evaluate the significant differences between the two groups. Relationships between abnormal network metrics and clinical characteristics including the disease duration the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQI the Insomnia Severity Index ISI the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale SAS and the Self-Rating Depression Scale SDS were investigated with Spearmans correlation analysis in PI patients. Results: PI patients demonstrated small-world architecture with lower global P = 0.005 and local P = 0.035 efficiencies compared with the HC group. The unique hub nodal properties in PI patients were mainly in the right limbic cortico-basal-ganglia circuit. Five disrupted subnetworks in PI patients were observed in the limbic cortico-basal-ganglia circuit and left default-mode networks DMN P < 0.05 NBS corrected. Moreover most unique hub nodal properties in the right limbic cortico-basal-ganglia circuit were significantly correlated with disease duration and clinical characteristics SAS SDS ISI scores in PI processing. Conclusion: These findings suggested the abnormal anatomical network architecture may be closely linked to clinical characteristics in PI. The study provided novel insights into the neural substrates underlying symptoms and neurophysiologic mechanisms of PI."
