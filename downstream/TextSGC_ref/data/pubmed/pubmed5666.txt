Hidden beneath the Sylvian fissure and sometimes considered as the fifth lobe of the brain the insula plays a multi-modal role from its strategic location. Previous structural studies have reported cortico-cortical connections with the frontal temporal parietal and occipital lobes but only a few have looked at its connections with subcortical structures. The insular cortex plays a role in a wide range of functions including processing of visceral and somatosensory inputs olfaction audition language motivation craving addiction and emotions such as pain empathy and disgust. These functions implicate numerous subcortical structures as suggested by various functional studies. Based on these premises we explored the structural connectivity of insular ROIs with the thalamus amygdala hippocampus putamen globus pallidus caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens. More precisely we were interested in unraveling the specific areas of the insula connected to these subcortical structures. By using state-of-the-art HARDI tractography algorithm we explored here the subcortical connectivity of the insula. Subcortical structural connectivity of insular subregions.
