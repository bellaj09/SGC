The connectivity architecture of the human brain varies across individuals. Mapping functional anatomy at the individual level is challenging but critical for basic neuroscience research and clinical intervention. Using resting-state functional connectivity we parcellated functional systems in an "embedding space" based on functional characteristics common across the population while simultaneously accounting for individual variability in the cortical distribution of functional units. The functional connectivity patterns observed in resting-state data were mapped in the embedding space and the maps were aligned across individuals. A clustering algorithm was performed on the aligned embedding maps and the resulting clusters were transformed back to the unique anatomical space of each individual. This novel approach identified functional systems that were reproducible within subjects but were distributed across different anatomical locations in different subjects. Using this approach for intersubject alignment improved the predictability of individual differences in language laterality when compared with anatomical alignment alone. Our results further revealed that the strength of association between function and macroanatomy varied across the cortex which was strong in unimodal sensorimotor networks but weak in association networks.
