Considering organic molecules as the functional building blocks of future nanoscale technology the question of how to arrange and assemble such building blocks in a bottom-up approach is still open. The scanning probe microscope SPM could be a tool of choice; however SPM-based manipulation was until recently limited to two dimensions 2D. Binding the SPM tip to a molecule at a well-defined position opens an opportunity of controlled manipulation in 3D space. Unfortunately 3D manipulation is largely incompatible with the typical 2D-paradigm of viewing and generating SPM data on a computer. For intuitive and efficient manipulation we therefore couple a low-temperature non-contact atomic force/scanning tunneling microscope LT NC-AFM/STM to a motion capture system and fully immersive virtual reality goggles. This setup permits "hand controlled manipulation" HCM in which the SPM tip is moved according to the motion of the experimenter\s hand while the tip trajectories as well as the response of the SPM junction are visualized in 3D. HCM paves the way to the development of complex manipulation protocols potentially leading to a better fundamental understanding of nanoscale interactions acting between molecules on surfaces. Here we describe the setup and the steps needed to achieve successful hand-controlled molecular manipulation within the virtual reality environment.
