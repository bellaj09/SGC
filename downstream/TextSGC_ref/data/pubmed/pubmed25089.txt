Advanced data analysis and visualization methodologies have played an important role in making surface electromyography both a valuable diagnostic methodology of neuromuscular disorders and a robust brain-machine interface usable as a simple interface for prosthesis control arm movement analysis stiffness control gait analysis etc. But for diagnostic purposes as well as for interfaces where the activation of single muscles is of interest surface EMG suffers from severe crosstalk between deep and superficial muscle activation making the reliable detection of the source of the signal as well as reliable quantification of deeper muscle activation prohibitively difficult. To address these issues we present a novel approach for processing surface electromyographic data. Our approach enables the reconstruction of 3D muscular activity location making the depth of muscular activity directly visible. This is even possible when deep muscles are overlaid with superficial muscles such as seen in the human forearm. The method which we call imaging EMG iEMG is based on using the crosstalk between a sufficiently large number of surface electromyographic electrodes to reconstruct the 3D generating electrical potential distribution within a given area. Our results are validated by in vivo measurements of iEMG and ultrasound on the human forearm. iEMG: Imaging electromyography.
