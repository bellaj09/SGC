This paper describes the design and realization of a wireless sensor gateway WSG within a wireless sensor network WSN for health monitoring. The WSN allows recording and wireless transmission of biosignals namely the electrocardiogram pulse wave and body weight which are important parameters for cardiovascular monitoring. These can be displayed analysed and saved on the WSG through a user interface based on a touch screen. The proposed WSG has the distinctive feature of using two different radio transceivers exploiting the advantages of each device. Currently most personal computers and handhelds have standardized Bluetooth interfaces IEEE 802.15.1 but not ZigBee interfaces IEEE 802.15.4. Hence the proposed gateway is designed to receive data from wireless sensors through its ZigBee interface and to forward them to a personal computer via its Bluetooth interface. This feature combined with simple touch screen menu navigation will reach increased patient compliance and consequently increased benefit for patient in terms of healthcare and safety. Design and realization of a wireless sensor gateway for health monitoring.
