Previous state-of-the-art systems on Drug Name Recognition DNR and Clinical Concept Extraction CCE have focused on a combination of text "feature engineering" and conventional machine learning algorithms such as conditional random fields and support vector machines. However developing good features is inherently heavily time-consuming. Conversely more modern machine learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks RNNs have proved capable of automatically learning effective features from either random assignments or automated word "embeddings".
