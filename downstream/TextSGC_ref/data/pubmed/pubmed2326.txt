Individual differences in brain functional networks may be related to complex personal identifiers including health age and ability. Dynamic network theory has been used to identify properties of dynamic brain function from fMRI data but the majority of analyses and findings remain at the level of the group. Here we apply hypergraph analysis a method from dynamic network theory to quantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics. Using a summary metric derived from the hypergraph formalism-hypergraph cardinality-we investigate individual variations in two separate complementary data sets. The first data set "multi-task" consists of 77 individuals engaging in four consecutive cognitive tasks. We observe that hypergraph cardinality exhibits variation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals between tasks; moreover the analysis of one of the memory tasks revealed a marginally significant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding motivated a similar analysis of the second data set "age-memory" in which 95 individuals aged 18-75 performed a memory task with a similar structure to the multi-task memory task. With the increased age range in the age-memory data set the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence becomes significant. We discuss these results in the context of the well-known finding linking age with network structure and suggest that hypergraph analysis should serve as a useful tool in furthering our understanding of the dynamic network structure of the brain.
