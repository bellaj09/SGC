The prevalence of obesity and associated health complications are currently at unprecedented levels. Physical activity in this population can improve patient outcomes. Virtual reality VR self-modeling may improve self-efficacy and adherence to physical activity. We conducted a comparative study of 30 participants randomized to 3 versions of a 3D avatar-based VR intervention about exercise: virtual representation of the self exercising condition; virtual representation of other person exercising and control condition. Participants in the virtual representation of the self group significantly increased their levels of physical activity. The improvement in physical activity for participants in the visual representation of other person exercising was marginal. The improvement for the control group was not significant. However the effect sizes for comparing the pre and post intervention physical activity levels were quite large for all three groups. We did not find any group difference in the improvements of physical activity levels and self-efficacy among sedentary overweight or obese individuals. Using anthropomorphic avatars resembling sedentary older individuals as models to enhance self-efficacy and adherence to physical activity: psychophysiological correlates.
