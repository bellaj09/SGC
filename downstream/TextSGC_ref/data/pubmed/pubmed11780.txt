"Biological dosimetry is used to estimate individual absorbed radiation dose by quantifying an appropriate biological marker. The most popular gold-standard marker is the appearance of dicentric chromosomes in metaphase. The metaphase finder is a tool for biological dosimetry that finds metaphase cells on glass slides. The author and a software company have designed a new system and are now preparing to produce the system commercially. The metaphase finder consists of an automated microscope a camera and a computer. To enhance the accuracy of the system an artificial intelligence AI with deep learning was tested. A total of 1709 images of the metaphase finder detected as metaphases were read into a nine-layer artificial neural network to detect true metaphases. A total of 456 images were used for training and the rest of the images were used for validation. The accuracy of AI was 0.89 for metaphases and 0.90 for non-metaphases."
