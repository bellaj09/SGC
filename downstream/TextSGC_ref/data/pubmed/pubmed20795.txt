Decoding algorithm in motor Brain Machine Interfaces translates the neural signals to movement parameters. They usually assume the connection between the neural firings and movements to be stationary which is not true according to the recent studies that observe the time-varying neuron tuning property. This property results from the neural plasticity and motor learning etc. which leads to the degeneration of the decoding performance when the model is fixed. To track the non-stationary neuron tuning during decoding we propose a dual model approach based on Monte Carlo point process filtering method that enables the estimation also on the dynamic tuning parameters. When applied on both simulated neural signal and in vivo BMI data the proposed adaptive method performs better than the one with static tuning parameters which raises a promising way to design a long-term-performing model for Brain Machine Interfaces decoder.
