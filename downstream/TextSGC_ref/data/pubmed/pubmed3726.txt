"Depression is a major mental health condition and is expected be the most debilitating and widespread health disorder by 2030. Tuberculosis TB is also a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and interestingly is a common comorbidity of depression. As such much attention has been paid to the association between these 2 pathologies. Based on clinical reports the association between TB and depression seems to be bidirectional with a substantial overlap in symptoms between the 2 conditions. TB infection or reactivation may precipitate depression likely as a consequence of the hosts inflammatory response and/or dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Nevertheless few studies have considered whether patients with depression are at a higher risk for TB. In this review we discuss the hypotheses on the association between depression and TB highlighting the immuno-inflammatory response and lipid metabolism as potential mechanisms. Improving our understanding of the interplay between these 2 disorders should help guide TB clinical care and prevention both in patients with comorbid depression and in the general population."
