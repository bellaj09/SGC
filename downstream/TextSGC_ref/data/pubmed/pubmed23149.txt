Patient-specific simulated rehearsal PsR is a technological advance within the domain of endovascular virtual reality VR simulation. It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine CT DICOM data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal PTr of a carotid artery stenting procedure CAS on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task FTr preoperative run through. Efficient implementation of patient-specific simulated rehearsal for the carotid artery stenting procedure: part-task rehearsal.
