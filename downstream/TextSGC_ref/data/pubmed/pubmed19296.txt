The phantom limb pain has been described as a condition in which patients experience a feeling of itching spasm or pain in a limb or body part that has been previously amputated. Such pain can be induced by a conflict between the representation of the visual and proprioceptive feedback of the previously healthy limb. The phantom limb pain occurs in at least 42 to 90% of amputees. Regular drug treatment of phantom limb pain is almost never effective. Psychotherapies for the Treatment of Phantom Limb Pain.
