"We compare motor planning mechanisms of ADHD and control subjects based on their effect on later observed kinematic characteristics. We monitor hand movement following planning conditions that differ in preparation time and evaluate the differences across conditions and participants with/without ADHD. Our findings show that when there is sufficient planning time people without ADHD seem to have a motor plan ready and immediately initiate a planned movement after a GO cue with a bell shaped velocity profile. When planning time is not sufficient they start the movement in a delayed time possibly indicating that they needed to complete a movement plan. However people with ADHD did not start movement immediately after the cue even when provided with a long preparation time possibly indicating that even for this planning interval they did not have a motion plan ready. The movement was not only delayed its velocity profile was not bell shaped and had several peaks. We further found differences between control and ADHD participants in the velocity profile variability and jitter of movements. Our results suggest that ADHD motion characteristics are associated with an immature motor plan. Based on the results we propose a paradigm to evaluate deficiencies in motor planning." Evidence for deficient motor planning in ADHD.
