The past two decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to model brain signals recorded by electroencephalography functional near-infrared spectroscopy etc. and to derive real-time estimates of user cognitive state response or intent for a variety of purposes: to restore communication by the severely disabled to effect brain-actuated control and more recently to augment human-computer interaction. Continuing these advances largely achieved through increases in computational power and methods requires software tools to streamline the creation testing evaluation and deployment of new data analysis methods.
