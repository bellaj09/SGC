Brain-computer interface BCI technology has attracted significant attention over recent decades and has made remarkable progress. However BCI still faces a critical hurdle in that performance varies greatly across and even within subjects an obstacle that degrades the reliability of BCI systems. Understanding the causes of these problems is important if we are to create more stable systems. In this short review we report the most recent studies and findings on performance variation especially in motor imagery-based BCI which has found that low-performance groups have a less-developed brain network that is incapable of motor imagery. Further psychological and physiological states influence performance variation within subjects. We propose a possible strategic approach to deal with this variation which may contribute to improving the reliability of BCI. In addition the limitations of current work and opportunities for future studies are discussed. Performance variation in motor imagery brain-computer interface: a brief review.
