In 7 free-recall experiments the benefit of creating drawings of to-be-remembered information relative to writing was examined as a mnemonic strategy. In Experiments 1 and 2 participants were presented with a list of words and were asked to either draw or write out each. Drawn words were better recalled than written. Experiments 3-5 showed that the memory boost provided by drawing could not be explained by elaborative encoding deep level of processing LoP visual imagery or picture superiority respectively. In Experiment 6 we explored potential limitations of the drawing effect by reducing encoding time and increasing list length. Drawing relative to writing still benefited memory despite these constraints. In Experiment 7 the drawing effect was significant even when encoding trial types were compared in pure lists between participants inconsistent with a distinctiveness account. Together these experiments indicate that drawing enhances memory relative to writing across settings instructions and alternate encoding strategies both within- and between-participants and that a deep LoP visual imagery or picture superiority alone or collectively are not sufficient to explain the observed effect. We propose that drawing improves memory by encouraging a seamless integration of semantic visual and motor aspects of a memory trace.
