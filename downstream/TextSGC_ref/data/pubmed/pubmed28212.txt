In the past few years there has been a growing interest in studying brain functioning in natural real-life situations. Mobile EEG allows to study the brain in real unconstrained environments but it faces the intrinsic challenge that it is impossible to disentangle observed changes in brain activity due to increase in cognitive demands by the complex natural environment or due to the physical involvement. In this work we aim to disentangle the influence of cognitive demands and distractions that arise from such outdoor unconstrained recordings. Mobile EEG on the bike: disentangling attentional and physical contributions to auditory attention tasks.
