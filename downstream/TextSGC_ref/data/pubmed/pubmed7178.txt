Cephalopods exhibit unique behaviors such as camouflage and tactile learning. The brain functions correlated to these behaviors have long been analyzed through behavioral observations of animals subject to surgical manipulation or electrical stimulation of brain lobes. However physiological methods have rarely been introduced to investigate the functions of each individual lobe though physiological work on giant axons and slices of the vertical lobe system of the cephalopods have provided deep insights into ion conductance of nerves and long-term synaptic plasticity. The lack of in vivo physiological work is partly due to difficulties in immobilizing the brain which is contained within the soft body and applying calcium indicators to the cephalopod central nervous system.
