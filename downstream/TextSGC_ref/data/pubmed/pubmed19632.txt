Virtual reality opens new opportunities for operator training in complex tasks. It lowers costs and has fewer constraints than traditional training. The ultimate goal of virtual training is to transfer knowledge gained in a virtual environment to an actual real-world setting. This study tested whether a maintenance procedure could be learnt equally well by virtual-environment and conventional training. Forty-two adults were divided into three equally sized groups: virtual training GVT generic virtual training conventional training using a real tank suspension and preparation station and control no training. Participants then performed the procedure individually in the real environment. Both training types conventional and virtual produced similar levels of performance when the procedure was carried out in real conditions. Performance level for the two trained groups was better in terms of success and time taken to complete the task time spent consulting job instructions and number of times the instructor provided guidance. Evaluation of procedural learning transfer from a virtual environment to a real situation: a case study on tank maintenance training.
