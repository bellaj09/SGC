We analyze the market of using a mobile application Positive Technology as a solution. Eleven participants aged between 18 and 24 participated in the exercise. Self-reported stress reduction was measured via an online marketing survey while physiological measurements were monitored via peripheral devices. Secondary goals assessed the apps ease-of-use accessibility and cost. Results indicate that participants enjoyed the availability of the mobile solution and found the app to be fun and easy to learn. Stress levels were reduced in 73% of the participants with higher effects in females and in participants aged 18-24.
