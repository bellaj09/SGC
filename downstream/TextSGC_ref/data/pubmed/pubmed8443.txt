This research is concerned with malignant pulmonary nodule detection PND in low-dose CT scans. Due to its crucial role in the early diagnosis of lung cancer PND has considerable potential in improving the survival rate of patients. We propose a two-stage framework that exploits the ever-growing advances in deep neural network models and that is comprised of a semantic segmentation stage followed by localization and classification. We employ the recently published DeepLab model for semantic segmentation and we show that it significantly improves the accuracy of nodule detection compared to the classical U-Net model and its most recent variants. Using the widely adopted Lung Nodule Analysis dataset LUNA16 we evaluate the performance of the semantic segmentation stage by adopting two network backbones namely MobileNet-V2 and Xception. We present the impact of various model training parameters and the computational time on the detection accuracy featuring a 79.1% mean intersection-over-union mIoU and an 88.34% dice coefficient. This represents a mIoU increase of 60% and a dice coefficient increase of 30% compared to U-Net. The second stage involves feeding the output of the DeepLab-based semantic segmentation to a localization-then-classification stage. The second stage is realized using Faster RCNN and SSD with an Inception-V2 as a backbone. On LUNA16 the two-stage framework attained a sensitivity of 96.4% outperforming other recent models in the literature including deep models. Finally we show that adopting a transfer learning approach particularly the DeepLab model weights of the first stage of the framework to infer binary malignant-benign labels on the Kaggle dataset for pulmonary nodules achieves a classification accuracy of 95.66% which represents approximately 4% improvement over the recent literature.
