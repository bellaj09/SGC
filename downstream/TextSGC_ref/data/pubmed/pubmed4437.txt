Sleep and the functional connectome are research areas with considerable overlap. Neuroimaging studies of sleep based on EEG-PET and EEG-fMRI are revealing the brain networks that support sleep as well as networks that may support the roles and processes attributed to sleep. For example phenomena such as arousal and consciousness are substantially modulated during sleep and one would expect this modulation to be reflected in altered network activity. In addition recent work suggests that sleep also has a number of adaptive functions that support waking activity. Thus the study of sleep may elucidate the circuits and processes that support waking function and complement information obtained from fMRI during waking conditions. In this review we will discuss examples of this for memory arousal and consciousness after providing a brief background on sleep and on studying it with fMRI. Sleep and the functional connectome.
