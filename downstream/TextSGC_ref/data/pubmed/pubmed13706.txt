We recently proposed that human memory systems are "tuned" to remember information that is processed for survival perhaps as a result of fitness advantages accrued in the ancestral past. This proposal was supported by experiments in which participants showed superior memory when words were rated for survival relevance at least relative to when words received other forms of deep processing. The current experiments tested the mettle of survival memory by pitting survival processing against conditions that are universally accepted as producing excellent retention including conditions in which participants rated words for imagery pleasantness and self-reference; participants also generated words studied words with the intention of learning them or rated words for relevance to a contextually rich but non-survival-related scenario. Survival processing yielded the best retention which suggests that it may be one of the best encoding procedures yet discovered in the memory field. Adaptive memory: the comparative value of survival processing.
