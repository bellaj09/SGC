"The most pertinent question concerning teaching and learning in the twenty-first century is not what knowledge and skills students need--that laundry list was identified over a decade ago--but rather how to foster twenty-first century learning. What curricula experiences assessments environments and technology best support twenty-first century learning? New Technology High School NTHS in Napa California is one example of a successful twenty-first century school. In this chapter the author describes the components of this exemplary high school illustrating an environment that will cultivate twenty-first century student learning. New Technology High School began by defining eight learning outcomes aligned with the standards of the Partnership for 21st Century Skills; to graduate students demonstrate mastery of these outcomes through an online portfolio. To help students achieve the outcomes NTHS employs project- and problem-based learning. Whereas in traditional classrooms students work alone on short-term assignments that do not lend themselves to deep understanding the project-based learning approach has students working in teams on long-term in-depth rigorous projects. Students work is supported by the schools workplace-like environment and effectiv use of technology. Meaningful assessment is essential to project-based learning; students receive continuous feedback helping them become self-directed learners. In fact NTHS uses outcome-based grading through which students constantly know how they are performing on the twenty-first century outcomes. Research has shown that NTHS graduates are better prepared for postsecondary education careers and citizenship than their peers from other schools. To facilitate twenty-first century learning all schools need to rethink their approach to teaching and learning. New Technology High School is one way to do so."
