We address the problem of prostate lesion detection localization and segmentation in T2W magnetic resonance MR images. We train a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously segment the prostate its anatomical structure and the malignant lesions. To incorporate the 3D contextual spatial information provided by the MRI series we propose a novel 3D sliding window approach which preserves the 2D domain complexity while exploiting 3D information. Experiments on data from 19 patients provided for the public by the Initiative for Collaborative Computer Vision Benchmarking I2CVB show that our approach outperforms traditional pattern recognition and machine learning approaches by a significant margin. Particularly for the task of cancer detection and localization the system achieves an average AUC of 0.995 an accuracy of 0.894 and a recall of 0.928. The proposed mono-modal deep learning-based system performs comparably to other multi-modal MR-based systems. It could improve the performance of a radiologist in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.
