Renal cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in human beings. The laparoscopic partial nephrectomy LPN is an effective way to treat renal cancer. Localization and delineation of the renal tumor from pre-operative CT Angiography CTA is an important step for LPN surgery planning. Recently with the development of the technique of deep learning deep neural networks can be trained to provide accurate pixel-wise renal tumor segmentation in CTA images. However constructing the training dataset with a large amount of pixel-wise annotations is a time-consuming task for the radiologists. Therefore weakly-supervised approaches attract more interest in research. Weakly-supervised convolutional neural networks of renal tumor segmentation in abdominal CTA images.
