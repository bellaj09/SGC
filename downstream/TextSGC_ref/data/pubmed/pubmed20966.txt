"At this years 161st Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association from May 3 to 8 2008 in Washington DC researchers presented data on new atypical antipsychotic medications iloperidone and asenapine with an efficacy comparable to that of older atypical agents but with more benign side-effect profiles in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In addition among studies of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans returning from tours of duty in Iraq preliminary results for medications in combination with virtual reality exposure therapy show strong promise."
