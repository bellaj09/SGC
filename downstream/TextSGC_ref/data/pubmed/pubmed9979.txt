The application of Robotic technology in thoracic surgery has become widespread in the last decades. Thanks to its advanced features the robotic system allows to perform a broad range of complex operations safely and in a comfortable way with valuable advantages related to low invasiveness. Regarding lung tumours several studies have shown the benefits of robotic surgery including lower blood loss and improved lymph node removal when compared with other minimally invasive techniques. Moreover the robotic instruments allow to reach deep and narrow spaces permitting safe and precise removal of tumours located in remote areas such as retrosternal and posterior mediastinal spaces with outstanding postoperative and oncological results. One controversial finding about the application of robotic system is its high capital and running costs. For this reason a limited number of centres worldwide are able to employ this groundbreaking technology and there are limited possibilities for the trainees to acquire the necessary skills in robotic surgery. Therefore a training programme based on three steps of learning associated with a solid surgical background and a consistent operating activity are required to obtain effective results. Putting this highest technological innovation in the hand of expert surgeons we can assure safe and effective procedures getting the best from robotic thoracic surgery. How to get the best from robotic thoracic surgery.
