The observational fear OF paradigm in rodents in which the subject is exposed to a distressed conspecific elicits contextual fear learning and enhances future passive avoidance learning which may model certain behavioral traits resulting from traumatic experiences in humans. As these behaviors affected by the OF require dorso-medial prefrontal cortex dmPFC we searched for synaptic adaptations in dmPFC resulting from OF in mice by recording synaptic responses in dmPFC layer V pyramidal neurons elicited by repeated 5\u2009Hz electrical stimulation of dmPFC layer I or by optogenetic stimulation of specific interneurons ex vivo 1 day after OF. OF increased depression of inhibitory postsynaptic currents IPSCs along IPSC trains evoked by the 5\u2009Hz electrical stimulation but surprisingly decreased depression of dendritic IPSCs isolated after blocking GABAa receptor on the soma. Subsequent optogenetic analyses revealed increased depression of IPSCs originating from perisomatically projecting parvalbumin interneurons PV-IPSCs but decreased depression of IPSCs from dendritically projecting somatostatin cells SOM-IPSCs. These changes were no longer detectable in the presence of a GABAb receptor antagonist CGP52432. Meanwhile OF decreased the sensitivity of SOM-IPSCs but not PV-IPSCs to a GABAb receptor agonist baclofen. Thus OF causes opposing changes in GABAb receptor mediated suppression of GABA release from PV-positive and SOM-positive interneurons. Such adaptations may alter dmPFC connectivity with brain areas that target its deep vs superficial layers and thereby contribute to the behavioral consequences of the aversive experiences.
