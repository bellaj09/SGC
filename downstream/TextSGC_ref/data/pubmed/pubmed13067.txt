Identifying drug-disease associations is helpful for not only predicting new drug indications and recognizing lead compounds but also preventing diagnosing treating diseases. Traditional experimental methods are time consuming laborious and expensive. Therefore it is urgent to develop computational method for predicting potential drug-disease associations on a large scale. Herein a novel method was proposed to identify drug-disease associations based on the deep learning technique. Molecular structure and clinical symptom information were used to characterize drugs and diseases. Then a novel two-dimensional matrix was constructed and mapped to a gray-scale image for representing drug-disease association. Finally deep convolution neural network was introduced to build model for identifying potential drug-disease associations. The performance of current method was evaluated based on the training set and test set and accuracies of 89.90 and 86.51% were obtained. Prediction ability for recognizing new drug indications lead compounds and true drug-disease associations was also investigated and verified by performing various experiments. Additionally 3620516 potential drug-disease associations were identified and some of them were further validated through docking modeling. It is anticipated that the proposed method may be a powerful large scale virtual screening tool for drug research and development.
