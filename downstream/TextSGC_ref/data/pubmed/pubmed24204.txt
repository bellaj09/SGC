With the expanding role of laparoscopy in urologic practice efficient and safe training has become paramount. Virtual reality simulation may potentially aid training but it requires validation before it can be incorporated into training programs. The objective of this study was to assess whether training on a virtual reality VR laparoscopy simulator LAP Mentor can improve performance of virtual laparoscopic procedures. Virtual reality training improves simulated laparoscopic surgery performance in laparoscopy nave medical students.
