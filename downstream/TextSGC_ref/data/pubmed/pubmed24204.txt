"Behavioral tasks utilized as models for decoding neural activity for use in brain-machine interfaces are constrained primarily to forelimb tasks or locomotion. We present here our methodology for training adult rats in a novel skilled hindlimb reaching task in which the animal is trained to make different types of hindlimb movements. 6 adult Long-Evans rats were trained to make variable duration <1 or >1.5 s hindlimb presses cued by a spatially-independent visual cue. 5 of 6 animals 83.3% were able to learn the task to proficiency. The training paradigm introduced here serves as a platform to investigate the ability of the animal to transfer motor cortical activity in response to a cue originally generated during normal movments to a novel context in the absecense of movement and ultimately after complete mid-thoracic spinal cord transection. We also present preliminary results of offline classification of neural activity during trial performance for two trained animals."
