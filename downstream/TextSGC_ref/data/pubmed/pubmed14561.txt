We show that a deep-learning neural network potential DP based on density functional theory DFT calculations can well describe Cu-Zr materials an example of a binary alloy system that can coexist in as ordered intermetallic and as an amorphous phase. The complex phase diagram for Cu-Zr makes it a challenging system for traditional atomistic force-fields that cannot accurately describe the different properties and phases. Instead we show that a DP approach using a large database with 300k configurations can render results generally on par with DFT. The training set includes configurations of pristine and bulk elementary metals and intermetallic structures in the liquid and solid phases in addition to slab and amorphous configurations. The DP model was validated by comparing bulk properties such as lattice constants elastic constants bulk moduli phonon spectra and surface energies to DFT values for identical structures. Furthermore we contrast the DP results with values obtained using well-established two embedded atom method potentials. Overall our DP potential provides near DFT accuracy for the different Cu-Zr phases but with a fraction of its computational cost thus enabling accurate computations of realistic atomistic models especially for the amorphous phase.
