Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP is a visual cortical response evoked by repetitive stimuli with a light source flickering at frequencies above 4 Hz and could be classified into three ranges: low up to 12 Hz medium 12-30 and high frequency > 30 Hz. SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI are principally focused on the low and medium range of frequencies whereas there are only a few projects in the high-frequency range. However they only evaluate the performance of different methods to extract SSVEP. Asynchronous BCI control using high-frequency SSVEP.
