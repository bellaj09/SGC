This paper describes a method to recover task-related brain sources in the context of multiclass brain--computer interfaces BCIs based on noninvasive EEG. We extend the method joint approximate diagonalization JAD for spatial filtering using a maximum likelihood framework. This generic formulation: 1 bridges the gap between the common spatial patterns CSPs and blind source separation of nonstationary sources; and 2 leads to a neurophysiologically adapted version of JAD accounting for the successive activations/deactivations of brain sources during motor imagery MI trials. Using dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV 2008 in which nine subjects were involved in a four-class two-session MI-based BCI experiment a quantitative evaluation of our extension is provided by comparing its performance against JAD and CSP in the case of cross-validation as well as session-to-session transfer. While JAD as already proposed in other works does not prove to be significantly better than classical one-versus-rest CSP our extension is shown to perform significantly better than CSP for cross-validated and session-to-session performance. The extension of JAD introduced in this paper yields among the best session-to-session transfer results presented so far for this particular dataset; thus it appears to be of great interest for real-life BCIs.
