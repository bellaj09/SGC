Automatic traffic flow classification is useful to reveal road congestions and accidents. Nowadays roads and highways are equipped with a huge amount of surveillance cameras which can be used for real-time vehicle identification and thus providing traffic flow estimation. This research provides a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art object detectors visual features and classification models useful to implement traffic state estimations. More specifically three different object detectors are compared to identify vehicles. Four machine learning techniques are successively employed to explore five visual features for classification aims. These classic machine learning approaches are compared with the deep learning techniques. This research demonstrates that when methods and resources are properly implemented and tested results are very encouraging for both methods but the deep learning method is the most accurately performing one reaching an accuracy of 99.9% for binary traffic state classification and 98.6% for multiclass classification.
