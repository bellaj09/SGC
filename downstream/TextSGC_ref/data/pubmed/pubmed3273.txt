"Graph analysis was used to study the effects of accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation aiTBS on the brains network topology in medication-resistant depressed patients. Anatomical and resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI was recorded at baseline and after sham and verum stimulation. Depression severity was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HDRS. Using various graph measures the different effects of sham and verum aiTBS were calculated. It was also investigated whether changes in graph measures were correlated to clinical responses. Furthermore by correlating baseline graph measures with the changes in HDRS in terms of percentage the potential of graph measures as biomarker was studied. Although no differences were observed between the effects of verum and sham stimulation on whole-brain graph measures and changes in graph measures did not correlate with clinical response the baseline values of clustering coefficient and global efficiency showed to be predictive of the clinical response to verum aiTBS. Nodal effects were found throughout the whole brain. The distribution of these effects could not be linked to the strength of the functional connectivity between the stimulation site and the node. This study showed that the effects of aiTBS on graph measures distribute beyond the actual stimulation site. However additional research into the complex interactions between different areas in the brain is necessary to understand the effects of aiTBS in more detail." Focal application of accelerated iTBS results in global changes in graph measures.
