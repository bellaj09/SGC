The purpose of this pilot study was to test the feasibility and efficacy of an iPad-enhanced aerobic exercise intervention designed to enhance wayfinding efficacy and performance and relevant cognitive functioning among middle-aged adults at risk for cognitive impairment. Twenty-seven low active adults 21 females aged 45 to 62 years 51.22  5.20 participated in a ten-week randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to an iPad-enhanced aerobic exercise group experimental group or an aerobic exercise-only group control group following baseline assessment. Both groups exercised at 50% to 75% of age-predicted heart rate maximum for 30 to 50 min/d 2 d/wk for 10 weeks. During aerobic exercise the experimental group engaged in virtual tours delivered via iPad. Baseline and post-intervention assessments of wayfinding self-efficacy wayfinding task performance cognitive functioning electroencephalogram EEG and psychosocial questionnaires were administered. The results suggest that ten weeks of iPad-enhanced moderately intense aerobic exercise had specific effects on wayfinding self-efficacy; however no statistical differences were found between groups on the behavioral wayfinding task or spatial memory performance at follow-up. Performance scores on an inhibitory attentional-control cognitive assessment revealed significant differences between groups favoring the experimental group p < 0.05. Virtual reality-enhanced aerobic exercise may prove to be an effective method for improving cognitive function and increasing confidence to navigate real-world scenarios among individuals at risk of cognitive impairment.
