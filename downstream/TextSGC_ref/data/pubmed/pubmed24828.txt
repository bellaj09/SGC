Bone marrow transplant is a relatively new procedure to treat recently considered incurable diseases. One important part of the procedure is the process of harvesting the donor bone marrow. We are developing a virtual reality simulator for bone marrow harvest that integrates interactive stereo visualization and force feedback techniques. The main objective is to offer a low cost virtual reality system to boost current adopted training methodologies for bone marrow harvesting. A virtual reality simulator for bone marrow harvest for pediatric transplant.
