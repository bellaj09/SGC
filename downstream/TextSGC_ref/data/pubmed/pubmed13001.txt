Intrinsically disordered or unstructured proteins or regions in proteins have been found to be important in a wide range of biological functions and implicated in many diseases. Due to the high cost and low efficiency of experimental determination of intrinsic disorder and the exponential increase of unannotated protein sequences developing complementary computational prediction methods has been an active area of research for several decades. Here we employed an ensemble of deep Squeeze-and-Excitation residual inception and long short-term memory LSTM networks for predicting protein intrinsic disorder with input from evolutionary information and predicted one-dimensional structural properties. The method called SPOT-Disorder2 offers substantial and consistent improvement not only over our previous technique based on LSTM networks alone but also over other state-of-the-art techniques in three independent tests with different ratios of disordered to ordered amino acid residues and for sequences with either rich or limited evolutionary information. More importantly semi-disordered regions predicted in SPOT-Disorder2 are more accurate in identifying molecular recognition features MoRFs than methods directly designed for MoRFs prediction. SPOT-Disorder2 is available as a web server and as a standalone program at https://sparks-lab.org/server/spot-disorder2/.
