This work presents the multilayered caries model with a visuo-tactile virtual reality simulator and a randomized controlled trial protocol to determine the effectiveness of the simulator in training for minimally invasive caries removal. A three-dimensional multilayered caries model was reconstructed from 10 micro-computed tomography CT images of deeply carious extracted human teeth before and after caries removal. The full grey scale 0-255 yielded a median grey scale value of 0-9 10-18 19-25 26-52 and 53-80 regarding dental pulp infected carious dentin affected carious dentin normal dentin and normal enamel respectively. The simulator was connected to two haptic devices for a handpiece and mouth mirror. The visuo-tactile feedback during the operation varied depending on the grey scale. Sixth-year dental students underwent a pretraining assessment of caries removal on extracted teeth. The students were then randomly assigned to train on either the simulator n=16 or conventional extracted teeth n=16 for 3 days after which the assessment was repeated. The posttraining performance of caries removal improved compared with pretraining in both groups Wilcoxon p<0.05. The equivalence test for proportional differences two 1-sided t-tests with a 0.2 margin confirmed that the participants in both groups had identical posttraining performance scores 95% CI=0.92 1; p=0.00. In conclusion training on the micro-CT multilayered caries model with the visuo-tactile virtual reality simulator and conventional extracted tooth had equivalent effects on improving performance of minimally invasive caries removal.
