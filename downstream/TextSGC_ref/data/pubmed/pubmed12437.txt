Some advanced RF pulses like multidimensional RF pulses are often long and require substantial computation time because of a number of constraints and requirements sometimes hampering clinical use. However the pulses offer opportunities of reduced-FOV imaging regional flip-angle homogenization and localized spectroscopy e.g. of hyperpolarized metabolites. Proposed herein is a novel deep learning approach to ultrafast design of multidimensional RF pulses with intention of real-time pulse updates. Ultrafast milliseconds multidimensional RF pulse design with deep learning.
