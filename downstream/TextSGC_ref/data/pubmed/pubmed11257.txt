Electromyography EMG is a measure of electrical activity generated by the contraction of muscles. Non-invasive surface EMG sEMG-based pattern recognition methods have shown the potential for upper limb prosthesis control. However it is still insufficient for natural control. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown tremendous progress in biosignal processing. Multiple architectures have been proposed yielding high accuracies >95% for offline analysis yet the delay caused due to optimization of the system remains a challenge for its real-time application. From this arises a need for optimized deep learning architecture based on fine-tuned hyper-parameters. Although the chance of achieving convergence is random however it is important to observe that the performance gain made is significant enough to justify extra computation. In this study the convolutional neural network CNN was implemented to decode hand gestures from the sEMG data recorded from 18 subjects to investigate the effect of hyper-parameters on each hand gesture. Results showed that the learning rate set to either 0.0001 or 0.001 with 80-100 epochs significantly outperformed p < 0.05 other considerations. In addition it was observed that regardless of network configuration some motions close hand flex hand extend the hand and fine grip performed better 83.7%  13.5% 71.2%  20.2% 82.6%  13.9% and 74.6%  15% respectively throughout the course of study. So a robust and stable myoelectric control can be designed on the basis of the best performing hand motions. With improved recognition and uniform gain in performance the deep learning-based approach has the potential to be a more robust alternative to traditional machine learning algorithms.
