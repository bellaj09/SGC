"Assessment serves the primary function of determining a students competence in a subject. Several different assessment formats are available for assessing anatomical skills knowledge and understanding and as assessment can drive learning a careful selection of assessments can help to engender the correct deep learning facility required of the safe clinical practitioner. The aim of this review was to survey the published literature to see whether higher education institutions are taking an andragogical approach to assessment. Five databases EMBASE ERIC Medline PubMed and Web of Knowledge were searched using standardized search terms with two limits applied English language and 2000 to the present. Among the 2094 papers found 32 were deemed suitable for this review. Current literature on assessment can be categorized into the following themes: assessment driven learning types of assessments frequency of assessments and use of images in assessments. The consensus is to use a variety of methods written and practical to assess anatomical knowledge and skill in different domains. Institutions aim for different levels of Blooms taxonomy for students at similar stages of their medical degree. Formative assessments are used widely in differing formats with mostly good effects on the final examination grade. In conclusion a wide variety of assessments each aimed at a different level of Blooms taxonomy are used by different institutions. Clin. Anat. 30:290-299 2017."
