"Panoramic video provides immersive and interactive experience by enabling humans to control the field of view FoV through head movement HM. Thus HM plays a key role in modeling human attention on panoramic video. This paper establishes a database collecting subjects HM in panoramic video sequences. From this database we find that the HM data are highly consistent across subjects. Furthermore we find that deep reinforcement learning DRL can be applied to predict HM positions via maximizing the reward of imitating human HM scanpaths through the agents actions. Based on our findings we propose a DRL-based HM prediction DHP approach with offline and online versions called offline-DHP and online-DHP. In offline-DHP multiple DRL workflows are run to determine potential HM positions at each panoramic frame. Then a heat map of the potential HM positions named the HM map is generated as the output of offline-DHP. In online-DHP the next HM position of one subject is estimated given the currently observed HM position which is achieved by developing a DRL algorithm upon the learned offline-DHP model. Finally the experiments validate that our approach is effective in both offline and online prediction of HM positions for panoramic video and that the learned offline-DHP model can improve the performance of online-DHP."
