Soil spectra are often measured in the laboratory and there is an increasing number of large-scale soil spectral libraries establishing across the world. However calibration models developed from soil libraries are difficult to apply to spectral data acquired from the field or space. Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap and make the calibration model transferrable from one sensor to another. The objective of this study is to explore the potential of transfer learning for soil spectroscopy and its performance on soil clay content estimation using hyperspectral data. First a one-dimensional convolutional neural network 1D-CNN is used on Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey LUCAS mineral soils. To evaluate whether the pre-trained 1D-CNN model was transferrable LUCAS organic soils were used to fine-tune and validate the model. The fine-tuned model achieved a good accuracy coefficient of determination R = 0.756 root-mean-square error RMSE= 7.07 and ratio of percent deviation RPD = 2.26 for the estimation of clay content. Spectral index as suggested as a simple transferrable feature was also explored on LUCAS data but did not performed well on the estimation of clay content. Then the pre-trained 1D-CNN model was further fine-tuned by field samples collect in the study area with spectra extracted from HyMap imagery achieved an accuracy of R = 0.601 RMSE = 8.62 and RPD = 1.54. Finally the soil clay map was generated with the fine-tuned 1D-CNN model and hyperspectral data.
