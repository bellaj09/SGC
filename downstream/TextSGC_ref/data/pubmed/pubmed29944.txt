Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface MI-BCI controlling functional electrical stimulation FES is promising for disabled patients to restore their motor functions. However it remains unclear how much the BCI part can contribute to the functional coupling between the brain and muscle. Specifically whether it can enhance the cerebral activation for motor training? Here we investigate the electroencephalographic and cerebral hemodynamic responses for MI-BCI-FES training and MI-FES training respectively. Twelve healthy subjects were recruited in the motor training study when concurrent electroencephalography EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS were recorded. Compared with the MI-FES training conditions the MI-BCI-FES could induce significantly stronger event-related desynchronization ERD and blood oxygen response which demonstrates that BCI indeed plays a functional role in the closed-loop motor training. Therefore this paper verifies the feasibility of using BCI to train motor functions in a closed-loop manner.
