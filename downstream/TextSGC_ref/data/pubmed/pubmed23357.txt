The current research aims to study the link between the type of vision experienced in a collaborative immersive virtual environment active vs. multiple passive the type of error one looks for during a cooperative multi-user exploration of a design project affordance vs. perceptual violations and the type of setting in which multi-user perform field in Experiment 1 vs. laboratory in Experiment 2. The relevance of this link is backed by the lack of conclusive evidence on an active vs. passive vision advantage in cooperative search tasks within software based on immersive virtual reality IVR. Using a yoking paradigm based on the mixed usage of simultaneous active and multiple passive viewings we found that the likelihood of error detection in a complex 3D environment was characterized by an active vs. multi-passive viewing advantage depending on: 1 the degree of knowledge dependence of the type of error the passive/active observers were looking for low for perceptual violations vs. high for affordance violations as the advantage tended to manifest itself irrespectively from the setting for affordance but not for perceptual violations; and 2 the degree of social desirability possibly induced by the setting in which the task was performed as the advantage occurred irrespectively from the type of error in the laboratory Experiment 2 but not in the field Experiment 1 setting. Results are relevant to future development of cooperative software based on IVR used for supporting the design review. A multi-user design review experience in which designers engineers and end-users all cooperate actively within the IVR wearing their own head mounted display seems more suitable for the detection of relevant errors than standard systems characterized by a mixed usage of active and passive viewing.
