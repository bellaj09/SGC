This paper presents a technique for optimizing the performance of web based multimodal interactive simulations. For such applications where visual quality and the performance of simulations directly influence user experience overloading of hardware resources may result in unsatisfactory reduction in the quality of the simulation and user satisfaction. However optimization of simulation performance on individual hardware platforms is not practical. Hence we present a mixed integer programming model to optimize the performance of graphical rendering and simulation performance while satisfying application specific constraints. Our approach includes three distinct phases: identification optimization and update. In the identification phase the computing and rendering capabilities of the client device are evaluated using an exploratory proxy code. This data is utilized in conjunction with user specified design requirements in the optimization phase to ensure best possible computational resource allocation. The optimum solution is used for rendering e.g. texture size canvas resolution and simulation parameters e.g. simulation domain in the update phase. Test results are presented on multiple hardware platforms with diverse computing and graphics capabilities to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
