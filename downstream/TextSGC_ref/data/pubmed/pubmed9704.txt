Arterial spin labeling ASL perfusion MRI is a noninvasive technique for measuring cerebral blood flow CBF in a quantitative manner. A technical challenge in ASL MRI is data processing because of the inherently low signal-to-noise-ratio SNR. Deep learning DL is an emerging machine learning technique that can learn a nonlinear transform from acquired data without using any explicit hypothesis. Such a high flexibility may be particularly beneficial for ASL denoising. In this paper we proposed and validated a DL-based ASL MRI denoising algorithm DL-ASL.
