"The retrosplenial cortex RSC is involved in a broad range of cognitive functions integrating rich sensory motor and spatial signals from multiple brain areas including the hippocampal system. RSC neurons show hippocampus-dependent activity reminiscent of place cell sequences. Using cellular calcium imaging in a virtual reality VR-based locomotion task we investigate how the integration of visual and locomotor inputs may give rise to such activity in RSC. A substantial population shows neural sequences that track position in the VR environment. This activity is driven by the conjunction of visual stimuli sequences and active movement which is suggestive of path integration. The activity is anchored to a reference point and predominantly follows the VR upon manipulations of optic flow against locomotion. Thus locomotion-gated optic flow combined with the presence of contextual cues at the start of each trial is sufficient to drive the sequential activity. A subpopulation shows landmark-related visual responses that are modulated by animals position in the VR. Thus rather than fragmenting the spatial representation\xa0into equivalent locomotion-based ensemble versus optic-flow-based ensemble in RSC optic flow appears to override locomotion signals coherently in the population when the gain between\xa0the two signals is altered."
