Brain-computer interfaces represent one of the most astonishing technologies in our era. However the grand challenge of chronic instability and limited throughput of the electrode-tissue interface has significantly hindered the further development and ultimate deployment of such exciting technologies. A multidisciplinary research workforce has been called upon to respond to this engineering need. In this paper I briefly review this multidisciplinary pursuit of chronically reliable neural interfaces from a materials perspective by analyzing the problem abstracting the engineering principles and summarizing the corresponding engineering strategies. I further draw my future perspectives by extending the proposed engineering principles. The Pursuit of Chronically Reliable Neural Interfaces: A Materials Perspective.
