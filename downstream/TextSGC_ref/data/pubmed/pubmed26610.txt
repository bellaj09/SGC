"The traditional brain-computer interface BCI system measures the electroencephalography EEG signals by the wet sensors with the conductive gel and skin preparation processes. To overcome the limitations of traditional BCI system with conventional wet sensors a wireless and wearable multi-channel EEG-based BCI system is proposed in this study including the wireless EEG data acquisition device dry spring-loaded sensors a size-adjustable soft cap. The dry spring-loaded sensors are made of metal conductors which can measure the EEG signals without skin preparation and conductive gel. In addition the proposed system provides a size-adjustable soft cap that can be used to fit users head properly. Indeed the results are shown that the proposed system can properly and effectively measure the EEG signals with the developed cap and sensors even under movement. In words the developed wireless and wearable BCI system is able to be used in cognitive neuroscience applications."
