Conducting polymers especially poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene PEDOT based materials are important for developing highly sensitive and microscale neural probes. In the present work we show that the conductivity and stability of PEDOT can be significantly increased by switching the widely used counter anion polystyrenesulfonate PSS to the smaller tetrafluoroborate TFB anion during the electrodeposition of the polymer. Time-dependent impedance measurements of polymer modified implantable microwires were conducted in physiological buffer solutions under accelerated aging conditions and the relative stability of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:TFB modified microwires was compared over time. This study was also extended to carbon nanotube CNT incorporated PEDOT:PSS which according to some reports is claimed to enhance the stability and electrical performance of the polymer. However no noticeable difference was observed between PEDOT:PSS and CNT:PEDOT:PSS in our measurements. At the biologically relevant frequency of 1kHz PEDOT:TFB modified microwires exhibit approximately one order of magnitude higher conductivity and demonstrate enhanced stability over both PEDOT:PSS and CNT:PEDOT:PSS modified microwires. In addition PEDOT:TFB is not neurotoxic and we show the proof-of-concept for both in vitro and in vivo neuronal recordings using PEDOT:TFB modified microelectrode arrays and chronic electrodes respectively. Our findings suggest that PEDOT:TFB is a promising conductive polymer coating for the recording of neural activities.
