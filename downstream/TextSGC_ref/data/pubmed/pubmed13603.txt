Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However systematically and precisely predicting enhancers remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction they still suffer from many issues. We developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells and demonstrated that PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to iteratively learn from 22 training cell types/tissues. Our results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average PEDLA achieved 95.0% accuracy and a 96.8% geometric mean GM of sensitivity and specificity across 22 training cell types/tissues as well as 95.7% accuracy and a 96.8% GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.
