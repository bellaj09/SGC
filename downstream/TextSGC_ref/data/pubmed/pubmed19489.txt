Gait control challenges commonly coincide with vestibular dysfunction and there is a long history in using balance and gait activities to enhance functional mobility in this population. While much has been learned using traditional rehabilitation exercises there is a new line of research emerging that is using visual stimuli in a very specific way to enhance gait control. For example avatars can be created in an individualized manner to incorporate specific gait characteristics. The avatar could then be used as a visual stimulus to which the patient can synchronize their own gait cycle. This line of research builds upon the rich history of sensorimotor control research in which augmented sensory information visual haptic or auditory is used to probe and even enhance human motor control. This review paper focuses on gait control challenges in patients with vestibular dysfunction provides a brief historical perspective on how various visual displays have been used to probe sensorimotor and gait control and offers some recommendations for future research. Using visual stimuli to enhance gait control.
