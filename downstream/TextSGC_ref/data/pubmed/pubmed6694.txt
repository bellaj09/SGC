The Human Connectome Project HCP has a 7T component that aims to study the human brain\s organization and function with high spatial and temporal resolution fMRI and diffusion-weighted acquisitions. For whole brain applications at 7T a major weakness however remains the heterogeneity of the radiofrequency transmission field B1+  which prevents from achieving an optimal signal and contrast homogeneously throughout the brain. In this work we use parallel transmission pTX Universal Pulses UP to improve the flip angle homogeneity and demonstrate their application to highly accelerated multi-band EPI MB5 and GRAPPA2 as prescribed in the 7T HCP protocol sequence but also to acquire at 7T B1+ -artefact-free T1 - and T2 -weighted anatomical scans used in the pre-processing pipeline of the HCP protocol. As compared to typical implementations of pTX the proposed solution is fully operator-independent and allows "plug and play" exploitation of the benefits offered by multi-channel transmission. Validation in five healthy adults shows that the proposed technique achieves a flip angle homogeneity comparable to that of a clinical 3\u202fT system. Compared to standard single-channel transmission the use of UPs at 7T yielded up to a two-fold increase of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio in the temporal lobes as well as improved detection of functional connectivity in the brain regions most strongly affected by B1+ inhomogeneity.
