A 73-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset of dyspnea. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed acute pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis. He was started on the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban factor Xa inhibitor and this resolved the thrombus. Serological analysis revealed that his risk of thrombosis was primary antiphospholipid syndrome APS. He has remained free of recurrent venous thromboembolism VTE for two years while under rivaroxaban. We present a case with VTE due to APS for whom direct oral anticoagulant was effective. <Learning objective: Direct oral anticoagulants DOAC have become agents of first choice in the treatment of acute to chronic period pulmonary thromboembolism for most patients. However the effects of DOAC on acute pulmonary thromboembolism APTE in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome APS remain obscure. The standard treatment for thrombotic APS is initial anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin. DOAC may be useful for some APTE patients with APS.>. Successful treatment with rivaroxaban for an acute pulmonary thromboembolism in a patient with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
