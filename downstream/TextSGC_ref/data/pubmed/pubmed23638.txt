Skill effort and time are required to identify and visualize anatomic structures in three-dimensions from radiological data. Fundamentally automating these processes requires a technique that uses symbolic information not in the dynamic range of the voxel data. We were developing such a technique based on mutual information for automatic multi-modality image fusion MIAMI Fuse University of Michigan. This system previously demonstrated facility at fusing one voxel dataset with integrated symbolic structure information to a CT dataset different scale and resolution from the same person. The next step of development of our technique was aimed at accommodating the variability of anatomy from patient to patient by using warping to fuse our standard dataset to arbitrary patient CT datasets. Visualization of conserved structures by fusing highly variable datasets.
