Feature extraction is a very crucial step in P300-based brain-computer interface BCI and independent component analysis ICA is a suitable P300 feature extraction method. But at present the convergence performance of the general ICA iteration methods are not very satisfactory. In this paper a method based on quantum particle swarm optimizer QPSO algorithm and ICA technique is put forward for P300 extraction. In this method quantum computing is used to impel ICA iteration to globally converge faster. It achieved the purpose of extracting P300 rapidly and efficiently. The method was tested on two public datasets of BCI Competition II and III and a simple linear classifier was employed to classify the extracted P300 features. The recognition accuracy reached 94.4% with 15 times averaged. The results showed that the proposed method could extract P300 rapidly and the extraction effect did not reduce. It provides an experimental basis for further study of real-time BCI system. EEG feature extraction based on quantum particle swarm optimizer and independent component analysis.
