The cerebellum is considered a brain structure in which memories for learned motor responses e.g. conditioned eyeblink responses are stored. Within the cerebellum however the relative importance of the cortex and the deep nuclei in motor learning/memory is not entirely clear. In this study we show that the cerebellar cortex exerts both basal and stimulus-activated inhibition to the deep nuclei. Sequential application of a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor GABAAR agonist and a noncompetitive GABAAR antagonist allows selective blockade of stimulus-activated inhibition. By using the same sequential agonist and antagonist methods in behaving animals we demonstrate that the conditioned response CR expression and timing are completely dissociable and involve different inhibitory inputs; although the basal inhibition modulates CR expression the conditioned stimulus-activated inhibition is required for the proper timing of the CR. In addition complete blockade of cerebellar deep nuclear GABAARs prevents CR acquisition. Together these results suggest that different aspects of the memories for eyeblink CRs are encoded in the cerebellar cortex and the cerebellar deep nuclei.
