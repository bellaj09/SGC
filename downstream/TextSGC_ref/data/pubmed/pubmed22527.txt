The aim of this study was to create a valid reliable method for an assessment of arthroscopic skills that is independent of time and place and is designed for both real and simulated settings. The validity of the scale was tested using a virtual reality shoulder arthroscopy simulator. Assessing Performance in Shoulder Arthroscopy: The Imperial Global Arthroscopy Rating Scale IGARS.
