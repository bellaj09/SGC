Brain-computer interface BCI allows collaboration between humans and machines. It translates the electrical activity of the brain to understandable commands to operate a machine or a device. In this study we propose a method to improve the accuracy of a 3-class BCI using electroencephalographic EEG signals. This BCI discriminates rest against imaginary grasps and elbow movements of the same limb. This classification task is challenging because imaginary movements within the same limb have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. The proposed method extracts time-domain features and classifies them using a support vector machine SVM with a radial basis kernel function RBF. An average accuracy of 74.2% was obtained when using the proposed method on a dataset collected prior to this study from 12 healthy individuals. This accuracy was higher than that obtained when other widely used methods such as common spatial patterns CSP filter bank CSP FBCSP and band power methods were used on the same dataset. These results are encouraging and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications including BCI-driven robotic devices such as a portable exoskeleton for the arm to assist individuals with impaired upper extremity functions in performing daily tasks. Classifying three imaginary states of the same upper extremity using time-domain features.
