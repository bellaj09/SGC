Deep learning models have been successfully applied to the analysis of various functional MRI data. Convolutional neural networks CNN a class of deep neural networks have been found to excel at extracting local meaningful features based on their shared-weights architecture and space invariance characteristics. In this study we propose M2D CNN a novel multichannel 2D CNN model to classify 3D fMRI data. The model uses sliced 2D fMRI data as input and integrates multichannel information learned from 2D CNN networks. We experimentally compared the proposed M2D CNN against several widely used models including SVM 1D CNN 2D CNN 3D CNN and 3D separable CNN with respect to their performance in classifying task-based fMRI data. We tested M2D CNN against six models as benchmarks to classify a large number of time-series whole-brain imaging data based on a motor task in the Human Connectome Project HCP. The results of our experiments demonstrate the following: i convolution operations in the CNN models are advantageous for high-dimensional whole-brain imaging data classification as all CNN models outperform SVM; ii 3D CNN models achieve higher accuracy than 2D CNN and 1D CNN model but 3D CNN models are computationally costly as any extra dimension is added in the input; iii the M2D CNN model proposed in this study achieves the highest accuracy and alleviates data overfitting given its smaller number of parameters as compared with 3D CNN.
