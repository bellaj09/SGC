Artificial neural networks ANN deep learning and neuromorphic systems are exciting new processing architectures being used to implement a wide variety of intelligent and adaptive systems. To date these architectures have been primarily realized using traditional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor CMOS processes or otherwise conventional semiconductor fabrication processes. Thus the high cost associated with the design and fabrication of these circuits has limited the broader scientific community from applying new ideas and arguably has slowed research progress in this exciting new area. Solution-processed electronics offer an attractive option for providing low-cost rapid prototyping of neuromorphic devices. This article proposes a novel wholly solution-based process used to produce low-cost transparent synaptic transistors capable of emulating biological synaptic functioning and thus used to construct ANN. We have demonstrated the fabrication process by constructing an ANN that encodes and decodes a 100  100 pixel image. Here the synaptic weights were configured to achieve the desired image processing functions.
