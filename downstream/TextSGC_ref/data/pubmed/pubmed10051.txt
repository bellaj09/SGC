Convolutional neural networks CNNs a popular type of deep neural network have been actively applied to image recognition object detection object localization semantic segmentation and object instance segmentation. Accordingly the applicability of deep learning to the analysis of medical images has increased. This paper presents a novel application of state-of-the-art CNN models such as DenseNet to the automatic detection of the tympanic membrane TM and middle ear ME infection. We collected 2484 oto-endoscopic images OEIs and classified them into one of three categories: normal chronic otitis media COM with TM perforation and otitis media with effusion OME. Our results indicate that CNN models have significant potential for the automatic recognition of TM and ME infections demonstrating a competitive accuracy of 95% in classifying TM and middle ear effusion MEE from OEIs. In addition to accuracy measurement our approach achieves nearly perfect measures of 0.99 in terms of the average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUROC. All these results indicate robust performance when recognizing TM and ME effusions in OEIs. Visualization through a class activation mapping CAM heatmap demonstrates that our proposed model performs prediction based on the correct region of OEIs. All these outcomes ensure the reliability of our method; hence the study can aid otolaryngologists and primary care physicians in real-world scenarios.
