Ultra-Deep Sequencing UDS enabled identification of specific changes in human genome occurring in malignant tumors with current approaches calling for the detection of specific mutations associated with certain cancers. However such associations are frequently idiosyncratic and cannot be generalized for diagnostics. Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA has been shown to be functionally associated with several cancer types. Here we study the association of intra-host mtDNA diversity with Hepatocellular Carcinoma HCC. Entropy of mitochondrial DNA circulating in blood is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.
