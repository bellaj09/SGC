"Few question the need for continuous professional development throughout a physicians career but rapid changes in health care are creating demand for physicians to acquire new knowledge skills and attitudes to implement quality improvement in clinical practice. The Internet and World Wide Web are technologies that have the potential to facilitate deep change in physician practice and lifelong learning. This paper describes how the American Board of Internal Medicine ABIM has utilized the Web and the Internet to engage physicians in the competencies of practice-based learning and improvement and systems-based practice. Specifically we describe how the ABIM developed and implemented Web-based practice improvement modules PIMs to help physicians measure and improve their clinical practice."
