Brain-machine interfaces BMIs can improve the quality of life of patients with sensory and motor disabilities by both decoding motor intentions expressed by neural activity and by encoding artificially sensed information into patterns of neural activity elicited by causal interventions on the neural tissue. Yet current BMIs can exchange relatively small amounts of information with the brain. This problem has proved difficult to overcome by simply increasing the number of recording or stimulating electrodes because trial-to-trial variability of neural activity partly arises from intrinsic factors collectively known as the network state that include ongoing spontaneous activity and neuromodulation and so is shared among neurons. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the state dependence of neural responses and in particular of how neural responses depend on endogenous slow fluctuations of network excitability. We then elaborate on how this knowledge may be used to increase the amount of information that BMIs exchange with brain. Knowledge of network state can be used to fine-tune the stimulation pattern that should reliably elicit a target neural response used to encode information in the brain and to discount part of the trial-by-trial variability of neural responses so that they can be decoded more accurately.
