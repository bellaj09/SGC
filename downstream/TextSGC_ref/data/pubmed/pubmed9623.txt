Here a streamlined scalable laboratory approach is discussed that enables medium-to-large dataset analysis. The presented approach combines data management artificial intelligence containerization cluster orchestration and quality control in a unified analytic pipeline. The unique combination of these individual building blocks creates a new and powerful analysis approach that can readily be applied to medium-to-large datasets by researchers to accelerate the pace of research. The proposed framework is applied to a project that counts the number of plasmonic nanoparticles bound to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in dark-field microscopy images. By using the techniques presented in this article the images are automatically processed overnight without user interaction streamlining the path from experiment to conclusions.
