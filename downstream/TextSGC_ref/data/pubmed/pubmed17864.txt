Increased spatial QRS-T angle has been shown to predict appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrilIator ICD therapy in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction LVSD. We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 31-40% to assess the relationship between the spatial QRS-T angle and other advanced ECG A-ECG as well as echocardiographic metadata with all-cause mortality or ICD implantation for secondary prevention. ECG-derived spatial QRS-T angle is associated with ICD implantation mortality and heart failure admissions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction.
