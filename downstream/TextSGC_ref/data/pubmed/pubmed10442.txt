A deep learning approach based on big data is proposed to locate broadband acoustic sources using a single hydrophone in ocean waveguides with uncertain bottom parameters. Several 50-layer residual neural networks trained on a huge number of sound field replicas generated by an acoustic propagation model are used to handle the bottom uncertainty in source localization. A two-step training strategy is presented to improve the training of the deep models. First the range is discretized in a coarse 5\u2009km grid. Subsequently the source range within the selected interval and source depth are discretized on a finer 0.1\u2009km and 2\u2009m grid. The deep learning methods were demonstrated for simulated magnitude-only multi-frequency data in uncertain environments. Experimental data from the China Yellow Sea also validated the approach.
