The systematic development of subject-specific computer models for the analysis of personalized treatments is currently a reality. In fact many advances have recently been developed for creating virtual finite element-based models. These models accurately recreate subject-specific geometries and material properties from recent techniques based on quantitative image analysis. However to determine the subject-specific forces we need a full gait analysis typically in combination with an inverse dynamics simulation study. In this work we aim to determine the subject-specific forces from the computer tomography images used to evaluate bone density. In fact we propose a methodology that combines these images with bone remodelling simulations and artificial neural networks. To test the capability of this novel technique we quantify the personalized forces for five subject-specific tibias using our technique and a gait analysis. We compare both results finding that similar vertical loads are estimated by both methods and that the dominant part of the load can be reliably computed. Therefore we can conclude that the numerical-based technique proposed in this work has great potential for estimating the main forces that define the mechanical behaviour of subject-specific bone.
