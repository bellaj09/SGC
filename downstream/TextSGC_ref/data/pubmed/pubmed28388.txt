Recent neuroscientific and technical developments of brain machine interfaces have put increasing demands on neuroinformatic databases and data handling software especially when managing data in real time from large numbers of neurons. Extrapolating these developments we here set out to construct a scalable software architecture that would enable near-future massive parallel recording organization and analysis of neurophysiological data on a standard computer. To this end we combined for the first time in the present context bit-encoding of spike data with a specific communication format for real time transfer and storage of neuronal data synchronized by a common time base across all unit sources. We demonstrate that our architecture can simultaneously handle data from more than one million neurons and provide in real time <\u200925 ms feedback based on analysis of previously recorded data. In addition to managing recordings from very large numbers of neurons in real time it also has the capacity to handle the extensive periods of recording time necessary in certain scientific and clinical applications. Furthermore the bit-encoding proposed has the additional advantage of allowing an extremely fast analysis of spatiotemporal spike patterns in a large number of neurons. Thus we conclude that this architecture is well suited to support current and near-future Brain Machine Interface requirements.
