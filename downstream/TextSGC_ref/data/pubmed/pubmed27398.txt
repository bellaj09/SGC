Advancements in the Neuro-rehabilitation across Pakistan is warranted to effectively and efficiently deal with the disease burden of neurological conditions. Being a developing country an in-expensive treatment approach is required to culminate the rise in the disease occurrence in Pakistan. Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs have come up as a new channel for communication and control eliminating the need of physical input opening doors to a wide array of applications in terms of assistive and rehabilitative devices for paralyzed patients and those with neuromuscular disorders. Even with a promising prospect BCIs and electroencephalograms EEG can be very expensive and therefore they are not practically applicable. For this reason the purpose of the current study was to come up with a possibility of an inexpensive BCI for rehabilitation of patients with neuro-muscular disorders in Pakistan by using a low-cost and readily available equipment like Emotiv EPOC+ EEG headset and electrical muscle stimulator. Emotiv EPOC+ fed electrical muscle stimulation system; an inexpensive brain-computer interface for rehabilitation of neuro muscular disorders.
