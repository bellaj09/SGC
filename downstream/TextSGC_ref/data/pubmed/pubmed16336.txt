The lack of experimental data in current literature on material properties of soft tissues in living condition has been a significant obstacle in the development of realistic soft tissue models for virtual reality based surgical simulators used in medical training. A robotic indenter was developed for minimally invasive measurement of soft tissue properties in abdominal region during a laparoscopic surgery. Using the robotic indenter force versus displacement and force versus time responses of pig liver under static and dynamic loading conditions were successfully measured to characterize its material properties in three consecutive steps. First the effective elastic modulus of pig liver was estimated as 10-15 kPa from the force versus displacement data of static indentations based on the small deformation assumption. Then the stress relaxation function relating the variation of stress with respect to time was determined from the force versus time response data via curve fitting. Finally an inverse finite element solution was developed using ANSYS finite element package to estimate the optimum values of viscoelastic and nonlinear hyperelastic material properties of pig liver through iterations. The initial estimates of the material properties for the iterations were extracted from the experimental data for faster convergence of the solutions.
