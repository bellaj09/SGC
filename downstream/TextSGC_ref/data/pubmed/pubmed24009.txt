Studies suggest that observing magnified and minified body parts using mirrors lenses and virtual reality may affect pain perception. However the direction of effect varies between studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of observing a normal-sized magnified and minified reflection of a hand on perceptual embodiment and contact-heat stimuli. Changing the size of a mirror-reflected hand does not affect pain perception: A repeated measures study on healthy human participants.
