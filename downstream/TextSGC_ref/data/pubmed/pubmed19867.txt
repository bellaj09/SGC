Video gaming demands elements of visual attention hand-eye coordination and depth perception which may be contiguous with laparoscopic skill development. General video gaming has demonstrated altered cortical plasticity and improved baseline/acquisition of minimally invasive skills. The present study aimed to evaluate for skill acquisition associated with a commercially available dedicated laparoscopic video game Underground and its unique laparoscopic-like controller for the NintendoWii U console. Playing to your skills: a randomised controlled trial evaluating a dedicated video game for minimally invasive surgery.
