Control of plant diseases is largely dependent on use of agrochemicals. However there are widening gaps between our knowledge on plant diseases gained from genetic/mechanistic studies and rapid translation of the knowledge into target-oriented development of effective agrochemicals. Here we propose that the time is ripe for computer-aided drug discovery/design CADD in molecular plant pathology. CADD has played a pivotal role in development of medically important molecules over the last three decades. Now explosive increase in information on genome sequences and three dimensional structures of biological molecules in combination with advances in computational and informational technologies opens up exciting possibilities for application of CADD in discovery and development of agrochemicals. In this review we outline two categories of the drug discovery strategies: structure- and ligand-based CADD and relevant computational approaches that are being employed in modern drug discovery. In order to help readers to dive into CADD we explain concepts of homology modelling molecular docking virtual screening and de novo ligand design in structure-based CADD and pharmacophore modelling ligand-based virtual screening quantitative structure activity relationship modelling and de novo ligand design for ligand-based CADD. We also provide the important resources available to carry out CADD. Finally we present a case study showing how CADD approach can be implemented in reality for identification of potent chemical compounds against the important plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
