Accurate automatic segmentation of the prostate in magnetic resonance images MRI is a challenging task due to the high variability of prostate anatomic structure. Artifacts such as noise and similar signal intensity of tissues around the prostate boundary inhibit traditional segmentation methods from achieving high accuracy. We investigate both patch-based and holistic image-to-image deep-learning methods for segmentation of the prostate. First we introduce a patch-based convolutional network that aims to refine the prostate contour which provides an initialization. Second we propose a method for end-to-end prostate segmentation by integrating holistically nested edge detection with fully convolutional networks. Holistically nested networks HNN automatically learn a hierarchical representation that can improve prostate boundary detection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on the MRI scans of 250 patients in fivefold cross-validation. The proposed enhanced HNN model achieves a mean  standard deviation. A Dice similarity coefficient DSC of Formula: see text and a mean Jaccard similarity coefficient IoU of Formula: see text are used to calculate without trimming any end slices. The proposed holistic model significantly Formula: see text outperforms a patch-based AlexNet model by 9% in DSC and 13% in IoU. Overall the method achieves state-of-the-art performance as compared with other MRI prostate segmentation methods in the literature.
