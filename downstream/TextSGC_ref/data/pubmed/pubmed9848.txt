The prognosis for pharyngeal cancer is relatively poor. It is usually diagnosed in an advanced stage. Although the recent development of narrow-band imaging NBI and increased awareness among endoscopists have enabled detection of superficial pharyngeal cancer these techniques are still not prevalent worldwide. Nevertheless artificial intelligence AI-based deep learning has led to significant advancements in various medical fields. Here we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI-based detection of pharyngeal cancer from endoscopic images in esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Artificial intelligence-based detection of pharyngeal cancer using convolutional neural networks.
