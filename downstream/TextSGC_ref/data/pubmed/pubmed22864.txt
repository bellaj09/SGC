This paper describes the development of the Virtual Pelvic Floor a new method of teaching the complex anatomy of the pelvic region utilizing virtual reality and advanced networking technology. Virtual reality technology allows improved visualization of three-dimensional structures over conventional media because it supports stereo vision viewer-centered perspective large angles of view and interactivity. Two or more ImmersaDesk systems drafting table format virtual reality displays are networked together providing an environment where teacher and students share a high quality three-dimensional anatomical model and are able to converse see each other and to point in three dimensions to indicate areas of interest. This project was realized by the teamwork of surgeons medical artists and sculptors computer scientists and computer visualization experts. It demonstrates the future of virtual reality for surgical education and applications for the Next Generation Internet. The Virtual Pelvic Floor a tele-immersive educational environment.
