"An important principle of human ethics is that individuals are not responsible for actions performed when unconscious. Recent research found that the generation of an action and the building of a conscious experience of that action agency are distinct processes and crucial mechanisms for self-consciousness. Yet previous agency studies have focussed on actions of a finger or hand. Here we investigate how agents consciously monitor actions of the entire body in space during locomotion. This was motivated by previous work revealing that 1 a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness concerns a single and coherent representation of the entire spatially situated body and 2 clinical instances of human behaviour without consciousness occur in rare neurological conditions such as sleepwalking or epileptic nocturnal wandering. Merging techniques from virtual reality full-body tracking and cognitive science of conscious action monitoring we report experimental data about consciousness during locomotion in healthy participants. We find that agents consciously monitor the location of their entire body and its locomotion only with low precision and report that while precision remains low it can be systematically modulated in several experimental conditions. This shows that conscious action monitoring in locomoting agents can be studied in a fine-grained manner. We argue that the study of the mechanisms of agency for a persons full body may help to refine our scientific criteria of self-hood and discuss sleepwalking and related conditions as alterations in neural systems encoding motor awareness in walking humans."
