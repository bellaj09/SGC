This study examines the effectiveness of state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods in conjunction with different feature types for the task of automatic annotation of fragments of clinical text based on codebooks with a large number of categories. We used a collection of motivational interview transcripts consisting of 11353 utterances which were manually annotated by two human coders as the gold standard and experimented with state-of-art classifiers including Nave Bayes J48 Decision Tree Support Vector Machine SVM Random Forest RF AdaBoost DiscLDA Conditional Random Fields CRF and Convolutional Neural Network CNN in conjunction with lexical contextual label of the previous utterance and semantic distribution of words in the utterance across the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionaries features. We found out that when the number of classes is large the performance of CNN and CRF is inferior to SVM. When only lexical features were used interview transcripts were automatically annotated by SVM with the highest classification accuracy among all classifiers of 70.8% 61% and 53.7% based on the codebooks consisting of 17 20 and 41 codes respectively. Using contextual and semantic features as well as their combination in addition to lexical ones improved the accuracy of SVM for annotation of utterances in motivational interview transcripts with a codebook consisting of 17 classes to 71.5% 74.2% and 75.1% respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of using machine learning methods in conjunction with lexical semantic and contextual features for automatic annotation of clinical interview transcripts with near-human accuracy. A study of the effectiveness of machine learning methods for classification of clinical interview fragments into a large number of categories.
