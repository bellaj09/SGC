In this paper we develop a new weakly supervised learning algorithm to learn to segment cancerous regions in histopathology images. This paper is under a multiple instance learning MIL framework with a new formulation deep weak supervision DWS; we also propose an effective way to introduce constraints to our neural networks to assist the learning process. The contributions of our algorithm are threefold: 1 we build an end-to-end learning system that segments cancerous regions with fully convolutional networks FCNs in which image-to-image weakly-supervised learning is performed; 2 we develop a DWS formulation to exploit multi-scale learning under weak supervision within FCNs; and 3 constraints about positive instances are introduced in our approach to effectively explore additional weakly supervised information that is easy to obtain and enjoy a significant boost to the learning process. The proposed algorithm abbreviated as DWS-MIL is easy to implement and can be trained efficiently. Our system demonstrates the state-of-the-art results on large-scale histopathology image data sets and can be applied to various applications in medical imaging beyond histopathology images such as MRI CT and ultrasound images.
