"It is still poorly understood how unspecific effects peripheral to the supposed action mechanism of neurofeedback NF influence the ability to self-regulate ones own brain signals. Recently skeptical researchers have even attributed the lions part of therapeutic outcomes of NF to placebo and other psychosocial factors. Here we investigated whether and by which mechanisms unspecific factors influence neural self-regulation during NF. To manipulate the impact of unspecific influences on NF performance we used a sham transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS as active placebo intervention suggesting positive effects on NF performance. Our results show that the expectation of receiving brain stimulation which should boost neural self-regulation interferes with the ability to self-regulate the sensorimotor rhythm in the EEG. Hence these results provide evidence that placebo reduces NF performance and thereby challenge current theories on unspecific effects related to NF."
