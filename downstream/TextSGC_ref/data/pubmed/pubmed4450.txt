While many previous studies assumed the functional connectivity FC between brain regions to be stationary recent studies have demonstrated that FC dynamically varies across time. However two challenges have limited the interpretability of dynamic FC information. First a principled framework for selecting the temporal extent of the window used to examine the dynamics is lacking and this has resulted in ad-hoc selections of window lengths and subsequent divergent results. Second it is unclear whether there is any behavioral relevance to the dynamics of the functional connectome in addition to that obtained from conventional static FC SFC. In this work we address these challenges by first proposing a principled framework for selecting the extent of the temporal windows in a dynamic and data-driven fashion based on statistical tests of the stationarity of time series. Further we propose a method involving three levels of clustering-across space time and subjects-which allow for group-level inferences of the dynamics. Next using a large resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral dataset from the Human Connectome Project we demonstrate that metrics derived from dynamic FC can explain more than twice the variance in 75 behaviors across different domains alertness cognition emotion and personality traits as compared with SFC in healthy individuals. Further we found that individuals with brain networks exhibiting greater dynamics performed more favorably in behavioral tasks. This indicates that the ease with which brain regions engage or disengage may provide potential biomarkers for disorders involving altered neural circuitry.
