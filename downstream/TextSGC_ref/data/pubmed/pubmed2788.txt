There is intense interest in fMRI research on whole-brain functional connectivity and however two fundamental issues are still unresolved: the impact of spatiotemporal data resolution spatial parcellation and temporal sampling and the impact of the network construction method on the reliability of functional brain networks. In particular the impact of spatiotemporal data resolution on the resulting connectivity findings has not been sufficiently investigated. In fact a number of studies have already observed that functional networks often give different conclusions across different parcellation scales. If the interpretations from functional networks are inconsistent across spatiotemporal scales then the whole validity of the functional network paradigm is called into question. This paper investigates the consistency of resting state network structure when using different temporal sampling or spatial parcellation or different methods for constructing the networks. To pursue this we develop a novel network comparison framework based on persistent homology from a topological data analysis. We use the new network comparison tools to characterize the spatial and temporal scales under which consistent functional networks can be constructed. The methods are illustrated on Human Connectome Project data showing that the DISCOH2 network construction method outperforms other approaches at most data spatiotemporal resolutions.
