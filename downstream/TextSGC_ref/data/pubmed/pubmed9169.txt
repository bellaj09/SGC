A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells particularly how cellular composition structure and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting integrates high-throughput cell microscopy focusing and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition data processing decision-making and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological pharmaceutical and medical sciences. Intelligent Image-Activated Cell Sorting.
