Background\u2003During aneurysm surgery neurosurgeons may need to look at the cerebral angiograms again to better orient themselves to the aneurysm and also the surrounding vascular anatomy. Simplification of the intraoperative imaging review and reduction of the time interval between the view under the microscope and the angiogram review can theoretically improve orientation. Objective\u2003To describe the use of a smartphone as a remote touchpad to simplify intraoperative visualization of three-dimensional 3D cerebral angiograms and reduce the time interval between the view under the microscope and the angiogram review. Methods\u2003Anonymized 3D angiograms of the patients in Virtual Reality Modelling Language format are securely uploaded to sketchfab.com accessible through smartphone Web browsers. A simple software has been developed and made available to facilitate the workflow. The smartphone is connected wirelessly to an external monitor using a Chromecast device and is used intraoperatively as a remote touchpad to view/rotate/zoom the 3D aneurysms angiograms on the external monitor. Results\u2003Implementation of the method is practical and helpful for the surgeon in certain cases. It also helps the operating staff registrars and students to orient themselves to the surgical anatomy. I present 10 of the uploaded angiograms published online. Conclusion\u2003The concept and method of using the smartphone as a remote touchpad to improve intraoperative visualization of 3D cerebral angiograms is described. The implementation is practical using easily available hardware and software in most neurosurgical centers worldwide. The method and concept have potential for further development.
