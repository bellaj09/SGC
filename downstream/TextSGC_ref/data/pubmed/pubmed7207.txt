"Malignant melanoma is one of the most deadly forms of skin cancer which is one of the worlds fastest-growing cancers. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical. In this study a neural network structure is utilized to construct a broad and accurate basis for the diagnosis of skin cancer thereby reducing screening errors. The technique is able to improve the efficacy for identification of normally indistinguishable lesions such as pigment spots versus clinically unknown lesions and to ultimately improve the diagnostic accuracy. In the field of medical imaging in general using neural networks for image segmentation is relatively rare. The existing traditional machine-learning neural network algorithms still cannot completely solve the problem of information loss nor detect the precise division of the boundary area. We use an improved neural network framework described herein to achieve efficacious feature learning and satisfactory segmentation of melanoma images. The architecture of the network includes multiple convolution layers dropout layers softmax layers multiple filters and activation functions. The number of data sets can be increased via rotation of the training set. A non-linear activation function such as ReLU and ELU is employed to alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance and RMSprop/Adam are incorporated to optimize the loss algorithm. A batch normalization layer is added between the convolution layer and the activation layer to solve the problem of gradient disappearance and explosion. Experiments described herein show that our improved neural network architecture achieves higher accuracy for segmentation of melanoma images as compared with existing processes."
