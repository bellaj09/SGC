This implies a change in the study and learning techniques of students resident doctors and specialists in gynecology radiodiagnosis urology and many other medical specialties considering new computer developments as a good alternative or complement to existing teaching methods. For this reason we consider that computer programs like the one we present in this work can be very useful in the future of education and more specifically in the training of specialists in medicine.
