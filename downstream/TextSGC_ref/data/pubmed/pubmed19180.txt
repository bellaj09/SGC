"At CT 2007 we presented NeuroVR http://www.neurovr.org a free virtual reality platform based on open-source software. The software allows non-expert users to adapt the content of 14 pre-designed virtual environments to the specific needs of the clinical or experimental setting. Following the feedbacks of the 700 users who downloaded the first version we developed a new version - NeuroVR 1.5 - that improves the possibility for the therapist to enhance the patients feeling of familiarity and intimacy with the virtual scene by using external sounds photos or videos. The key characteristics that make NeuroVR suitable for most clinical applications are the high level of control of the interaction with the tool and the enriched experience provided to the patient. Actually NeuroVR is used in the assessment and treatment of Obesity Alcohol Abuse Anxiety Disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorders and Cognitive Rehabilitation."
