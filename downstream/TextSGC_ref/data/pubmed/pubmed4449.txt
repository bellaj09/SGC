The cerebral cortex retains its fundamental organization layering and input-output relations as it scales in volume over many orders of magnitude in mammals. How is its network architecture affected by size scaling? By comparing network organization of the mouse and rhesus macaque cortical connectome derived from complete neuroanatomical tracing studies a recent study in PLOS Biology shows that an exponential distance rule emerges that reveals the falloff in connection probability with distance in the two brains that in turn determines common organizational features. Principles of Network Architecture Emerging from Comparisons of the Cerebral Cortex in Large and Small Brains.
