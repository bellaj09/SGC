Emerging evidence indicates that circular RNA circRNA plays a crucial role in human disease. Using circRNA as biomarker gives rise to a new perspective regarding our diagnosing of diseases and understanding of disease pathogenesis. However detection of circRNA-disease associations by biological experiments alone is often blind limited to small-scale high-cost and time-consuming. Therefore there is an urgent need for reliable computational methods to rapidly infer the potential circRNA-disease associations on a large scale and to provide the most promising candidates for biological experiments. An Efficient Approach based on Multi-sources Information to Predict CircRNA-disease Associations Using Deep Convoltional Neural Network.
