Vehicle detection in aerial images is an important and challenging task. Traditionally many target detection models based on sliding-window fashion were developed and achieved acceptable performance but these models are time-consuming in the detection phase. Recently with the great success of convolutional neural networks CNNs in computer vision many state-of-the-art detectors have been designed based on deep CNNs. However these CNN-based detectors are inefficient when applied in aerial image data due to the fact that the existing CNN-based models struggle with small-size object detection and precise localization. To improve the detection accuracy without decreasing speed we propose a CNN-based detection model combining two independent convolutional neural networks where the first network is applied to generate a set of vehicle-like regions from multi-feature maps of different hierarchies and scales. Because the multi-feature maps combine the advantage of the deep and shallow convolutional layer the first network performs well on locating the small targets in aerial image data. Then the generated candidate regions are fed into the second network for feature extraction and decision making. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery VEDAI dataset and Munich vehicle dataset. The proposed cascaded detection model yields high performance not only in detection accuracy but also in detection speed.
