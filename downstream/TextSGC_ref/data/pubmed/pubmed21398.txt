The number of young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders ASD enrolled in higher education institutions has steadily increased over the last decade. Despite this there has been little research on how to most effectively support this growing population. The current study presents data from a pilot trial of two novel intervention programs developed for college students with ASD. In this small randomized controlled trial college students with ASD n = 8 were assigned to one of two new programs - either an intervention based on a virtual reality-Brain-Computer Interface for ASD BCI-ASD or a psychosocial intervention the College and Living Success CLS program. Preliminary evidence supports the feasibility and acceptability of both programs although behavioral outcomes were inconsistent across participants and interventions. Results indicate that expanded research on psychosocial and computer-assisted intervention approaches for this population is warranted given the preliminary support found in this pilot study.
