Light microscopy plays a key role in biological studies and medical diagnosis. The spatial resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited to approximately half the wavelength of the illumination light as a result of the diffraction limit. Several approaches-including confocal microscopy stimulated emission depletion microscopy stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy photoactivated localization microscopy and structured illumination microscopy-have been established to achieve super-resolution imaging. However none of these methods is suitable for the super-resolution ophthalmoscopy of retinal structures because of laser safety issues and inevitable eye movements. We recently experimentally validated virtually structured detection VSD as an alternative strategy to extend the diffraction limit. Without the complexity of structured illumination VSD provides an easy low-cost and phase artifact-free strategy to achieve super-resolution in scanning laser microscopy. In this article we summarize the basic principles of the VSD method review our demonstrated single-point and line-scan super-resolution systems and discuss both technical challenges and the potential of VSD-based instrumentation for super-resolution ophthalmoscopy of the retina.
