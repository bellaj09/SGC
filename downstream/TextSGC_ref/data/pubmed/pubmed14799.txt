Abnormally high deposition of iron can contribute to neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive impairment. Since previous studies investigating cognition-brain iron accumulation relationships focused on elderly people our aim was to explore the association between iron concentration in subcortical nuclei and two types of memory performances in a healthy young population. Gender difference was found only in the globus pallidus. Our results showed that iron load characterized by R2* value on the MRI in the caudate and putamen was related to visual memory while verbal memory was unrelated to iron concentration. Iron Concentration in Deep Gray Matter Structures is Associated with Worse Visual\xa0Memory Performance in Healthy Young Adults.
