Planetary gearbox is a critical component for many mechanical systems. It is essential to monitor the planetary gearbox health and performance in order to maintain the whole machine works well. The methodology of mechanical fault diagnosis is increasingly intelligent with the extensive application of deep learning. However the cross-domain issue caused by varying working conditions becomes an enormous encumbrance to fault diagnosis based on deep learning. In this paper in order to fully excavate potentialities of deep neural network architectures a novel generative adversarial learning method was introduced for a completely new fault diagnosis based on a deep convolution neural network. In addition the intelligent fault diagnostic scheme for planetary gearbox under varying speed conditions was developed. After that some experiments on measured vibration signals of planetary gearbox were conducted to verify the validity and efficiency of the fault diagnostic scheme. The results showed that the proposed method enhanced the capability of the intelligent diagnosis for planetary gear faults under varying speed conditions.
