The various parameters that define a hand movement such as its trajectory speed etc are encoded in distinct brain activities. Decoding this information from neurophysiological recordings is a less explored area of brain-computer interface BCI research. Applying non-invasive recordings such as electroencephalography EEG for decoding makes the problem more challenging as the encoding is assumed to be deep within the brain and not easily accessible by scalp recordings.
