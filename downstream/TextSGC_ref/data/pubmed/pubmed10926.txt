High-performance thermal interface materials TIMs have attracted persistent attention for the design and development of miniaturized nanoelectronic devices; however a large number of potential new materials exist to form these heterostructures and the explorations of their thermal properties are time consuming and expensive. In this work we train several supervised machine learning ML and artificial neural network ANN models to predict the interfacial thermal resistance R between graphene and hexagonal boron-nitride hBN with only the knowledge of the system temperature coupling strength between two layers and in-plane tensile strains. The training data were obtained by high-throughput computations HTCs of R using classical molecular dynamics MD simulations. Four different ML models i.e. linear regression polynomial regression decision tree and random forest are explored. A pair of one dense layer ANNs and another pair of two dense layer deep neural networks DNNs are also investigated. It is reported that the DNN models provide better R prediction results compared to the ML models. The thermal property predictions using HTC and ML/ANN models are applicable to a wide range of materials and open up new perspectives in the explorations of TIMs. Machine learning and artificial neural network prediction of interfacial thermal resistance between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride.
