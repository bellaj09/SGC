The aim of this study was to investigate the use of inexpensive and easy-to-use hydrogel "marble" electrodes for the recording of electrical potentials of the human visual cortex using visual evoked potentials VEPs as example. Top hat-shaped holders for the marble electrodes were developed with an electrode cap to acquire the signals. In 12 healthy volunteers we compared the VEPs obtained with conventional gold-cup electrodes to those obtained with marble electrodes. Checkerboards of two check sizes-0.8 and 0.25-were presented. Despite the higher impedance of the marble electrodes the line noise could be completely removed by averaging 64 single traces and VEPs could be recorded. Linear mixed-effect models using electrode type stimulus and recording duration revealed a statistically significant effect of the electrode type on only VEP N75 peak latency mean  SEM: 1.0  1.2 ms and amplitude mean  SEM: 0.8  0.9 V The mean amplitudes of the delta theta alpha beta and gamma frequency bands of marble electrodes were statistically significantly different and on average 25% higher than those of gold-cup electrodes. However the mean amplitudes showed a statistically significant strong correlation Pearson\s r = 0.8. We therefore demonstrate the potential of the inexpensive and efficient hydrogel electrode to replace conventional gold-cup electrodes for the recording of VEPs and possibly other recordings from the human cortex.
