Actinic keratosis AK is one of the most common precancerous skin lesions which is easily confused with benign keratosis BK. At present the diagnosis of AK mainly depends on histopathological examination and ignorance can easily occur in the early stage thus missing the opportunity for treatment. In this study we designed a shallow convolutional neural network CNN named actinic keratosis deep learning AK-DL and further developed an intelligent diagnostic system for AK based on the iOS platform. After data preprocessing the AK-DL model was trained and tested with AK and BK images from dataset HAM10000. We further compared it with mainstream deep CNN models such as AlexNet GoogLeNet and ResNet as well as traditional medical image processing algorithms. Our results showed that the performance of AK-DL was better than the mainstream deep CNN models and traditional medical image processing algorithms based on the AK dataset. The recognition accuracy of AK-DL was 0.925 the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC was 0.887 and the training time was only 123.0 s. An iOS app of intelligent diagnostic system was developed based on the AK-DL model for accurate and automatic diagnosis of AK. Our results indicate that it is better to employ a shallow CNN in the recognition of AK.
