Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a common anxiety disorder characterized by 6 months of "excessive anxiety and worry" about a variety of events and situations. Anxiety and worry are often accompanied by additional symptoms like restlessness being easily fatigued difficulty concentrating irritability muscle tension and disturbed sleep. GAD is usually treated with medications and/or psychotherapy. In particular the two most promising treatments seem to be cognitive therapy and applied relaxation. In this study we integrated these approaches through the use of a biofeedback enhanced virtual reality VR system used both for relaxation and controlled exposure. Moreover this experience is strengthened by the use of a mobile phone that allows patients to perform the virtual experience even in an outpatient setting. This paper describe the results of a controlled trial NCT00602212 involving 20 GAD patients randomly assigned to the following groups: 1 the VR and Mobile group VRMB including biofeedback; 2 the VR and Mobile group VRM without biofeedback; 3 the waiting list WL group. The clinical data underlined that a VR can be used also in the treatment of GAD; b in a VR treatment patients take advantage of a mobile device that delivers in an outpatient setting guided experiences similar to the one experienced in VR.
