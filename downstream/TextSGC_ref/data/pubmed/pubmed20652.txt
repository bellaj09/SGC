"At MMVR 2007 we presented NeuroVR http://www.neurovr.org a free virtual reality platform based on open-source software. The software allows non-expert users to adapt the content of 14 pre-designed virtual environments to the specific needs of the clinical or experimental setting. Following the feedbacks of the 700 users who downloaded the first version we developed a new version - NeuroVR 1.5 - that improves the possibility for the therapist to enhance the patients feeling of familiarity and intimacy with the virtual scene by using external sounds photos or videos. Specifically the new version now includes full sound support and the ability of triggering external sounds and videos using the keyboard. The outcomes of different trials made using NeuroVR will be presented and discussed."
