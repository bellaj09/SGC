Studies on a virtual reality simulator have demonstrated that sleep-deprived residents make more errors. Work-hour restrictions were implemented among other reasons to ensure enough sleep time for residents. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of sleep time perceived fatigue and experience on surgical performance. We hypothesized that performance would decrease with less sleep and fatigue and that experienced surgeons would perform better than less experienced surgeons despite sleep deprivation and fatigue.
