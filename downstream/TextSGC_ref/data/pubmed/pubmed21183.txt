"Radiology is the fastest growing discipline of medicine thanks to the implementation of new technologies and very rapid development of imaging diagnostic procedures in the last few decades. On the other hand the development of imaging diagnostic procedures has put aside the traditional gaining of experience by working on real patients and the need for other alternatives of learning interventional radiology procedures has emerged. A new method of virtual approach was added as an excellent alternative to the currently known methods of training on physical models and animals. Virtual reality represents a computer-generated reconstruction of anatomical environment with tactile interactions and it enables operators not only to learn on their own mistakes without compromising the patients safety but also to enhance their knowledge and experience." Virtual simulation as a learning method in interventional radiology.
