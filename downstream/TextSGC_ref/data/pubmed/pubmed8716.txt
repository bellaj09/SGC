Artificial intelligence AI has the ability of revolutionizing our lives and society in a radical way by enabling machine learning in the industry business health transportation and many other fields. The ability to recognize objects faces and speech requires however exceptional computational power and time which is conflicting with the current difficulties in transistor scaling due to physical and architectural limitations. As a result to accelerate the progress of AI it is necessary to develop materials devices and systems that closely mimic the human brain. In this work we review the current status and challenges on the emerging neuromorphic devices for brain-inspired computing. First we provide an overview of the memory device technologies which have been proposed for synapse and neuron circuits in neuromorphic systems. Then we describe the implementation of synaptic learning in the two main types of neural networks namely the deep neural network and the spiking neural network SNN. Bio-inspired learning such as the spike-timing dependent plasticity scheme is shown to enable unsupervised learning processes which are typical of the human brain. Hardware implementations of SNNs for the recognition of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns are also shown to support the cognitive computation in silico. Finally we explore the recent advances in reproducing bio-neural processes via device physics such as insulating-metal transitions nanoionics drift/diffusion and magnetization flipping in spintronic devices. By harnessing the device physics in emerging materials neuromorphic engineering with advanced functionality higher density and better energy efficiency can be developed. Emerging neuromorphic devices.
