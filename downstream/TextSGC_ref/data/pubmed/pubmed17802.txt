This paper presents a 3D localization method to register clustered microcalcifications on mammograms from cranio-caudal CC and medio-lateral oblique MLO views. The method consists of three major components: registration of clustered microcalcifications in CC and MLO views 3D localization of clustered microcalcifications and 3D visualization of clustered microcalcifications. The registration is performed based on three features gradient energy and local entropy codes that are independent of spatial locations of microcalcifications in two different views and are prioritized by discriminability in a binary decision tree. The 3D localization is determined by a sequence of coordinate corrections of calcified pixels using the breast nipple as a controlling point. Finally the 3D visualization implements a virtual reality modeling language viewer VRMLV to view the exact location of the lesion as a guide for needle biopsy. In order to validate our proposed 3D localization system a set of breast lesions which appear both in mammograms and in MR Images is used for experiments where the depth of clustered microcalcifications can be verified by the MR images. 3D localization of clustered microcalcifications using cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique views.
