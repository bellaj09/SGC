"Training in endovascular intervention ultimately aims to produce interventionalists who demonstrate competence in technical skills. Herein the authors investigate the rationale for simulation-based training by providing an overview of the psychological theories underpinning acquisition of technical skills training and assessment history recent advances in simulation technology and a critical appraisal of their role in training and assessment in endovascular intervention. Simulators have potential for training and assessment and promise solution to many shortcomings of traditional apprenticeship training models. Before inclusion into the curriculum further work is needed regarding fidelity validity reliability and design of simulators to ensure accurate transfer of acquired endovascular skills from simulator to patient." Role of virtual reality simulation in teaching and assessing technical skills in endovascular intervention.
