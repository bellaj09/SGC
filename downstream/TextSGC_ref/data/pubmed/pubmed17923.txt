We present EP-DNN a protocol for predicting enhancers based on chromatin features in different cell types. Specifically we use a deep neural network DNN-based architecture to extract enhancer signatures in a representative human embryonic stem cell type H1 and a differentiated lung cell type IMR90. We train EP-DNN using p300 binding sites as enhancers and TSS and random non-DHS sites as non-enhancers. We perform same-cell and cross-cell predictions to quantify the validation rate and compare against two state-of-the-art methods DEEP-ENCODE and RFECS. We find that EP-DNN has superior accuracy with a validation rate of 91.6% relative to 85.3% for DEEP-ENCODE and 85.5% for RFECS for a given number of enhancer predictions and also scales better for a larger number of enhancer predictions. Moreover our H1  IMR90 predictions turn out to be more accurate than IMR90  IMR90 potentially because H1 exhibits a richer signature set and our EP-DNN model is expressive enough to extract these subtleties. Our work shows how to leverage the full expressivity of deep learning models using multiple hidden layers while avoiding overfitting on the training data. We also lay the foundation for exploration of cross-cell enhancer predictions potentially reducing the need for expensive experimentation.
