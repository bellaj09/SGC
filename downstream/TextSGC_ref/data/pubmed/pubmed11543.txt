Initial results are reported on automated detection of intracranial hemorrhage from CT which would be valuable in a computer-aided diagnosis system to help the radiologist detect subtle hemorrhages. Previous work has taken a classic approach involving multiple steps of alignment image processing image corrections handcrafted feature extraction and classification. Our current work instead uses a deep convolutional neural network to simultaneously learn features and classification eliminating the multiple hand-tuned steps. Performance is improved by computing the mean output for rotations of the input image. Postprocessing is additionally applied to the CNN output to significantly improve specificity. The database consists of 134 CT cases 4300 images divided into 60 5 and 69 cases for training validation and test. Each case typically includes multiple hemorrhages. Performance on the test set was 81% sensitivity per lesion 34/42 lesions and 98% specificity per case 45/46 cases. The sensitivity is comparable to previous results on different datasets but with a significantly higher specificity. In addition insights are shared to improve performance as the database is expanded. Detecting Intracranial Hemorrhage with Deep Learning.
