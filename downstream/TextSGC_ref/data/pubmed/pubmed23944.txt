"Early recognition of intraoperative critical events is essential in optimizing the health outcomes of surgical patients. Use of simulation in nurse anesthesia education allows students to practice recognizing changes in the patients condition in a safe learning environment. Second- and third-year student registered nurse anesthetists were randomly assigned to 2 groups to explore differences in recognizing intraoperative myocardial infarction MI using highfidelity mannequin simulation vs virtual simulation. One group participated in a virtual simulation first followed by a high-fidelity mannequin simulation. The other group participated in a high-fidelity mannequin simulation first then virtual simulation. Second-year students recognized an intraoperative MI faster when using high-fidelity mannequin simulation than when using virtual simulation. However there was no significant difference among third-year students in the time it took to recognize a critical event when using high-fidelity mannequin simulation vs virtual simulation. These findings indicate that both simulation modalities are useful in evaluating student registered nurse anesthetists timely recognition of intraoperative critical events such as MI. However for students with less didactic and clinical practicum experience in the program such as second-year students the use of high-fidelity mannequin simulation for recognizing an intraoperative MI may be more beneficial than virtual simulation."
