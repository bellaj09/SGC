"Self-face recognition a hallmark of self-awareness depends on off-line stored information about ones face and on-line multisensory-motor face-related cues. The brain mechanisms of how on-line sensory-motor processes affect off-line neural self-face representations are unknown. This study used 3D virtual reality to create a virtual mirror in which participants saw an avatars face moving synchronously with their own face movements. Electroencephalographic EEG analysis during virtual mirror exposure revealed mu oscillations in sensory-motor cortex signalling on-line congruency between the avatars and participants movements. After such exposure and compatible with a change in their off-line self-face representation participants were more prone to recognize the avatars face as their own and this was also reflected in the activation of face-specific regions in the inferotemporal cortex. Further EEG analysis showed that the on-line sensory-motor effects during virtual mirror exposure caused these off-line visual effects revealing the brain mechanisms that maintain a coherent self-representation despite our continuously changing appearance." Tuning of temporo-occipital activity by frontal oscillations during virtual mirror exposure causes erroneous self-recognition.
