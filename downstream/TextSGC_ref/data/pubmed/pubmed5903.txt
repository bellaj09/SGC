The task-positive network TPN is anticorrelated with activity in the default mode network DMN and possibly reflects competition between the processing of external and internal information while the salience network SN is pivotal in regulating TPN and DMN activity. Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula rAI was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex MPFC for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rDLPFC and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex PCC. In particular the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC rAI-PCC and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN TPN and SN in the psychosis risk state reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition as seen in psychotic disorders. Aberrant coupling within and across the default mode task-positive and salience network in subjects at risk for psychosis.
