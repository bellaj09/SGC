Efficient and robust cell detection serves as a critical prerequisite for many subsequent biomedical image analysis methods and computer-aided diagnosis CAD. It remains a challenging task due to touching cells inhomogeneous background noise and large variations in cell sizes and shapes. In addition the ever-increasing amount of available datasets and the high resolution of whole-slice scanned images pose a further demand for efficient processing algorithms. In this paper we present a novel structured regression model based on a proposed fully residual convolutional neural network for efficient cell detection. For each testing image our model learns to produce a dense proximity map that exhibits higher responses at locations near cell centers. Our method only requires a few training images with weak annotations just one dot indicating the cell centroids. We have extensively evaluated our method using four different datasets covering different microscopy staining methods e.g. H & E or Ki-67 staining or image acquisition techniques e.g. bright-filed image or phase contrast. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state of the art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and running time.
