We investigate joint graph inference for the chemical and electrical connectomes of the Caenorhabditis elegans roundworm. The C. elegans connectomes consist of Formula: see text non-isolated neurons with known functional attributes and there are two types of synaptic connectomes resulting in a pair of graphs. We formulate our joint graph inference from the perspectives of seeded graph matching and joint vertex classification. Our results suggest that connectomic inference should proceed in the joint space of the two connectomes which has significant neuroscientific implications. A joint graph inference case study: the C. elegans chemical and electrical connectomes.
