Virtual reality VR based surgical simulator systems offer very elegant possibilities to both enrich and enhance traditional education in endoscopic surgery. However while a wide range of VR simulator systems have been proposed and realized in the past few years most of these systems are far from able to provide a reasonably realistic surgical environment. We explore the basic approaches to the current limits of realism and ultimately seek to extend these based on our description and analysis of the most important components of a VR-based endoscopic simulator. The feasibility of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on a first modular prototype system implementing the basic algorithms for VR-training in gynaecologic laparoscopy.
