Burn debridement is a challenging technique that requires significant skill to identify regions requiring excision and appropriate excision depth. A machine learning tool is being developed in order to assist surgeons by providing a quantitative assessment of burn-injured tissue. Three noninvasive optical imaging techniques capable of distinguishing between four kinds of tissue-healthy skin viable wound bed deep burn and shallow burn-during serial burn debridement in a porcine model are presented in this paper. The combination of all three techniques considerably improves the accuracy of tissue classification from 0.42 to almost 0.77.
