"Immunohistochemistry IHC is the most widely used assay for identification of molecular biomarkers. However IHC is time consuming and costly depends on tissue-handling protocols and relies on pathologists subjective interpretation. Image analysis by machine learning is gaining ground for various applications in pathology but has not been proposed to replace chemical-based assays for molecular detection."
