Space division multiplexing elastic optical networks SDM-EONs with multi-core fiber MCF are the promising candidate for future optical networks due to their high transmission capacity and high flexibility. However the inherent defects of inter-core crosstalk and spectrum fragmentation may have some negative impact on the performance of SDM-EONs. A deep learning and hierarchical graph-assisted crosstalk-aware fragmentation avoidance DLHGA strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly we introduce a deep learning DL model to predict future requests so as to achieve reasonable scheduling of resource in advance. Then considering the inter-core crosstalk of MCF we abstract the core spectrum and time resource as a three-dimensional 3D model with the hierarchical graphs. Therefore the resource allocation process is simplified to be mitigating the crosstalk and fragmentation from the perspective of inter-core and intra-core respectively. Finally based on DL traffic prediction and different characteristics of hierarchical graph we present an adaptive resource allocation algorithm considering relieving core adjacency and downgrading modulation format to achieve efficient resource scheduling. We evaluate our DLHGA strategy in different topologies and the results show that our strategy can efficiently improve network performance in terms to inter-core crosstalk and bandwidth blocking probability compared to earlier approaches.
