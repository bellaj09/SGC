"We studied the use of virtual reality technology as a stimulus in balance examinations. A pilot study was made using a small group of healthy subjects to investigate the effect of alcohol and virtual reality stimulus on the subjects balance. The tests showed that blood alcohol concentration accounted for almost 50% of the increased lateral body sway velocity. The new stimulus technique based on virtual reality technology seems to be effective and flexible for postural investigations." Postural control as assessed with virtual reality.
