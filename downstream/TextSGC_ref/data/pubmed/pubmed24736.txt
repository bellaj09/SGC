"This paper presents an asynchronously intracortical brain-computer interface BCI which allows the subject to continuously drive a mobile robot. This system has a great implication for disabled patients to move around. By carefully designing a multiclass support vector machine SVM the subjects self-paced instantaneous movement intents are continuously decoded to control the mobile robot. In particular we studied the stability of the neural representation of the movement directions. Experimental results on the nonhuman primate showed that the overt movement directions were stably represented in ensemble of recorded units and our SVM classifier could successfully decode such movements continuously along the desired movement path. However the neural representation of the stop state for the self-paced control was not stably represented and could drift."
