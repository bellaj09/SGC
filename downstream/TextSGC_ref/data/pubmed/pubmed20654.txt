"Brain-computer interface BCI systems allow users to directly control computers and other machines by modulating their brain waves. In the present study we investigated the effect of soft drinks on resting state RS EEG signals and BCI control. Eight healthy human volunteers each participated in three sessions of BCI cursor tasks and resting state EEG. During each session the subjects drank an unlabeled soft drink with either sugar caffeine or neither ingredient. A comparison of resting state spectral power shows a substantial decrease in alpha and beta power after caffeine consumption relative to control. Despite attenuation of the frequency range used for the control signal caffeine average BCI performance was the same as control. Our work provides a useful characterization of caffeine the worlds most popular stimulant on brain signal frequencies and their effect on BCI performance."
