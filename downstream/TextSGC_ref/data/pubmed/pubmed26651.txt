Brain-computer interfaces BCI based on event-related potentials ERP were proven to be a reliable synchronous communication method. For everyday life situations however this synchronous mode is impractical because the system will deliver a selection even if the user is not paying attention to the stimulation. So far research into attention-aware visual ERP-BCIs i.e. asynchronous ERP-BCIs has led to variable success. In this study we investigate new approaches for detection of user engagement. Control or non-control state: that is the question! An asynchronous visual P300-based BCI approach.
