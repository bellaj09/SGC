Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been investigated for more than 20 years. Many BCIs use noninvasive electroencephalography as a measurement technique and the P300 event-related potential as an input signal P300 BCI. Since the first experiment with a P300 BCI system in 1988 by Farwell and Donchin not only data processing has improved but also stimuli presentation has been varied and a plethora of applications was developed and refined. Nowadays these applications are facing the challenge of being transferred from the research laboratory into real-life situations to serve motor-impaired people in their homes as assistive technology. Out of the frying pan into the fire--the P300-based BCI faces real-world challenges.
