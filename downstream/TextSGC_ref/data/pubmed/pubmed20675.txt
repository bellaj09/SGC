"Brain-machine-body interfaces BMBIs aim to create an artificial connection in the nervous system by converting neural activity recorded from one cortical region to electrical stimuli delivered to another cortical region spinal cord or muscles in real-time. In particular conditioning-mode BMBIs utilize such activity-dependent stimulation strategies to induce functional re-organization in the nervous system and promote functional recovery after injury by exploiting mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity. This paper reports on reconfigurable field-programmable gate array FPGA-based implementation of a translation algorithm to extract multichannel stimulus trigger signals from intracortical neural spike activity. The approach features digital spike discrimination based on user-set thresholding and time-amplitude windowing decision making to support different triggering patterns for various stimulation scenarios as well as trigger-pattern-dependent blanking schemes for robust operation in the presence of stimulus artifacts. Readily lending itself to low-power low-area implementation for future integration the algorithm has been synthesized on a Cyclone II FPGA using Alteras Quartus II design software and validated experimentally with prerecorded intracortical neural spike activity from an anesthetized laboratory rat."
