Recent work in human cognitive neuroscience has linked self-consciousness to the processing of multisensory bodily signals bodily self-consciousness BSC in fronto-parietal cortex and more posterior temporo-parietal regions. We highlight the behavioral neurophysiological neuroimaging and computational laws that subtend BSC in humans and non-human primates. We propose that BSC includes body-centered perception hand face and trunk based on the integration of proprioceptive vestibular and visual bodily inputs and involves spatio-temporal mechanisms integrating multisensory bodily stimuli within peripersonal space PPS. We develop four major constraints of BSC proprioception body-related visual information PPS and embodiment and argue that the fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal processing of trunk-centered multisensory signals in PPS is of particular relevance for theoretical models and simulations of BSC and eventually of self-consciousness.
