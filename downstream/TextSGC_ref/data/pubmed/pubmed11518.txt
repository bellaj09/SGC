Dofetilide is an effective antiarrhythmic medication for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation but carries a significant risk of pro-arrhythmia and requires meticulous dosing and monitoring. The cornerstone of this monitoring measurement of the QT/QTc interval is an imperfect surrogate for plasma concentration efficacy and risk of pro-arrhythmic potential. Noninvasive assessment of dofetilide plasma concentration using a deep learning neural network analysis of the surface electrocardiogram: A proof of concept study.
