For sustainable operation and maintenance of urban railway infrastructure intelligent visual inspection of the railway infrastructure attracts increasing attention to avoid unreliable manual observation by humans at night while trains do not operate. Although various automatic approaches were proposed using image processing and computer vision techniques most of them are focused only on railway tracks. In this paper we present a novel railway inspection system using facility detection based on deep convolutional neural network and computer vision-based image comparison approach. The proposed system aims to automatically detect wears and cracks by comparing a pair of corresponding image sets acquired at different times. We installed line scan camera on the roof of the train. Unlike an area-based camera the line scan camera quickly acquires images with a wide field of view. The proposed system consists of three main modules: i image reconstruction for registration of facility positions ii facility detection using an improved single shot detector and iii deformed region detection using image processing and computer vision techniques. In experiments we demonstrate that the proposed system accurately finds facilities and detects their potential defects. For that reason the proposed system can provide various advantages such as cost reduction for maintenance and accident prevention.
