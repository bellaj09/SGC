Whilst substantial advances in rehabilitation programmes for brain injured children have been made there is still a fundamental need to improve understanding of the rehabilitation process and how this can be incorporated into practice. It is argued here that taking a neurological approach to improving cognition mood and social functioning is likely to be of great benefit to the patient. Theoretical reasons are outlined as to why activities such as interactive exercise can improve both the structure and function of the brain and it is recommended that further research is carried out to establish the effectiveness of these types of activities. The rehabilitation of brain injured children: the case for including physical exercise and virtual reality.
