"For people living with paralysis restoration of hand function remains the top priority because it leads to independence and improvement in quality of life. In approaches to restore hand and arm function a goal is to better engage voluntary control and counteract maladaptive brain reorganization that results from non-use. Standard rehabilitation augmented with developments from the study of brain-computer interfaces could provide a combined therapy approach for motor cortex rehabilitation and to alleviate motor impairments. In this paper an adaptive brain-computer interface system intended for application to control a functional electrical stimulation FES device is developed as an experimental test bed for augmenting rehabilitation with a brain-computer interface. The systems performance is improved throughout rehabilitation by passive user feedback and reinforcement learning. By continuously adapting to the users brain activity similar adaptive systems could be used to support clinical brain-computer interface neurorehabilitation over multiple days."
