Severe obesity is a global public health threat of growing proportions. Accurate models to predict severe postoperative complications could be of value in the preoperative assessment of potential candidates for bariatric surgery. So far traditional statistical methods have failed to produce high accuracy. We aimed to find a useful machine learning ML algorithm to predict the risk for severe complication after bariatric surgery. A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Severe Complications after Bariatric Surgery.
