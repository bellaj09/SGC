A tensor-input/tensor-output Recursive Exponentially Weighted N-Way Partial Least Squares REW-NPLS regression algorithm is proposed for high dimension multi-way tensor data treatment and adaptive modeling of complex processes in real-time. The method unites fast and efficient calculation schemes of the Recursive Exponentially Weighted PLS with the robustness of tensor-based approaches. Moreover contrary to other multi-way recursive algorithms no loss of information occurs in the REW-NPLS. In addition the Recursive-Validation method for recursive estimation of the hyper-parameters is proposed instead of conventional cross-validation procedure. The approach was then compared to state-of-the-art methods. The efficiency of the methods was tested in electrocorticography ECoG and magnetoencephalography MEG datasets. The algorithms are implemented in software suitable for real-time operation. Although the Brain-Computer Interface applications are used to demonstrate the methods the proposed approaches could be efficiently used in a wide range of tasks beyond neuroscience uniting complex multi-modal data structures adaptive modeling and real-time computational requirements.
