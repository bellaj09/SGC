The purpose of this study was the development of a method for fast and efficient analysis of dynamic MR images of the female breast. The image data sets were acquired with a saturation-recovery turbo-FLASH sequence which enables the detection of the kinetics of the contrast agent concentration in the whole breast with a high temporal and spatial resolution. In addition a morphologic 3D-FLASH data set was acquired. Dynamic MR mammography. Multidimensional visualization of contrast medium enhancement in virtual reality.
