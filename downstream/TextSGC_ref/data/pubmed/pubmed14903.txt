Biochemistry and molecular techniques are used for the development of the scientific practice of students. To improve both the teaching and learning quality and promote the students\ motivation this article outlines an interactive "Virtual Simulation and Actual Operation Combined" approach by using a tailored virtual practice-learning platform and participated by students and lectures as well as a curriculum secretary. The implementation of the Virtual Simulation Laboratory provides a series of learning resources which the students can access in their own time; and the participation of the curriculum secretary also makes the class more interactive and efficient. This method incorporates an experimental platform and a virtual experiment class to utilize fully both the traditional and virtual teaching methods and thereby promote effective student learning. Exploration of an interactive "Virtual and Actual Combined" teaching mode in medical developmental biology.
