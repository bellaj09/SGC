Diabetic retinopathy DR is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the world. Its earliest sign are red lesions a general term that groups both microaneurysms MAs and hemorrhages HEs. In daily clinical practice these lesions are manually detected by physicians using fundus photographs. However this task is tedious and time consuming and requires an intensive effort due to the small size of the lesions and their lack of contrast. Computer-assisted diagnosis of DR based on red lesion detection is being actively explored due to its improvement effects both in clinicians consistency and accuracy. Moreover it provides comprehensive feedback that is easy to assess by the physicians. Several methods for detecting red lesions have been proposed in the literature most of them based on characterizing lesion candidates using hand crafted features and classifying them into true or false positive detections. Deep learning based approaches by contrast are scarce in this domain due to the high expense of annotating the lesions manually.
