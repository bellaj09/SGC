Current brain-computer interfaces BCIs are usually based on various often supervised signal processing methods. The disadvantage of supervised methods is the requirement to calibrate them with recently acquired subject-specific training data. Here we present a novel algorithm for dimensionality reduction spatial filter that is ideally suited for single-trial detection of event-related potentials ERPs and can be adapted online to a new subject to minimize or avoid calibration time. An Adaptive Spatial Filter for User-Independent Single Trial Detection of Event-Related Potentials.
