Prosthetics is a modern area of interest and a challenge in Orthopedics. Over time there has been a transition from an artisanal method of prosthetics production to modern concepts and materials including a re-education through virtual reality. The conditions for an efficient fitting of a prosthesis include the necessity that the prosthesis respects the form and function of the lost limb both anatomically and biomechanically. Prosthetics are made individually personalized according to sex age physiological characteristics profession and preference. In our country thoracic limb prosthetics has a relatively short-recorded history of approximately a century the most preeminent centers being in Iasi Cluj and Bucharest. Currently thoracic limb prosthetics and particularly hand prosthetics are in a period of development. A technique for amputation and stump reamputation called "circumferential osteoneuromioplasty" CONM is currently being used in the Orthopedics and Trauma Clinic of the Central Military University Emergency Hospital in Bucharest. The method was created with the purpose of obtaining distinct myoelectric signals of better quality following the contraction of each muscle. The CONM method can be used in conjuncture with both the new hand prostheses that are currently available in Romania and with the model that is being developed by a mixed team from the Polytechnic University in Bucharest in collaboration with the Central Military University Emergency Hospital in Bucharest. Bionic hand exoprosthesis--perspectives for the future in Romania.
