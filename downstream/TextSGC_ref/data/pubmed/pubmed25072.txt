"The movement-related cortical potential MRCP is a low-frequency negative shift in the electroencephalography EEG recording that takes place about 2 seconds prior to voluntary movement production. MRCP replicates the cortical processes employed in planning and preparation of movement. In this study we recapitulate the features such as signals acquisition processing and enhancement and different electrode montages used for EEG data recoding from different studies that used MRCPs to predict the upcoming real or imaginary movement. An authentic identification of human movement intention accompanying the knowledge of the limb engaged in the performance and its direction of movement has a potential implication in the control of external devices. This information could be helpful in development of a proficient patient-driven rehabilitation tool based on brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Such a BCI paradigm with shorter response time appears more natural to the amputees and can also induce plasticity in brain. Along with different training schedules this can lead to restoration of motor control in stroke patients."
