"Although we have made major advances in understanding motion perception based on the processing of lateral 2D motion signals on computer displays the majority of motion in the real 3D world occurs outside of the plane of fixation and motion directly toward or away from observers has particular behavioral relevance. Previous work has reported a systematic lateral bias in the perception of 3D motion such that an object on a collision course with an observers head is frequently judged to miss it with obvious negative consequences. To better understand this bias we systematically investigated the accuracy of 3D motion perception while manipulating sensory noise by varying the contrast of a moving target and its position in depth relative to fixation. Inconsistent with previous work we found little bias under low sensory noise conditions. With increased sensory noise however we revealed a novel perceptual phenomenon: observers demonstrated a surprising tendency to confuse the direction of motion-in-depth such that approaching objects were reported to be receding and vice versa. Subsequent analysis revealed that the lateral and motion-in-depth components of observers reports are similarly affected but that the effects on the motion-in-depth component i.e. the motion-in-depth confusions are much more apparent than those on the lateral component. In addition to revealing this novel visual phenomenon these results shed new light on errors that can occur in motion perception and provide a basis for continued development of motion perception models. Finally our findings suggest methods to evaluate the effectiveness of 3D visualization environments such as 3D movies and virtual reality devices." Sensory uncertainty leads to systematic misperception of the direction of motion in depth.
