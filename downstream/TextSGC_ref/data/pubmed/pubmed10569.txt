Cardiovascular disease CVD is a leading cause of death globally. Electrocardiogram ECG which records the electrical activity of the heart has been used for the diagnosis of CVD. The automated and robust detection of CVD from ECG signals plays a significant role for early and accurate clinical diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to provide automated detection of coronary artery disease CAD from ECG signals using capsule networks CapsNet. 1D-CADCapsNet: One dimensional deep capsule networks for coronary artery disease detection using ECG signals.
