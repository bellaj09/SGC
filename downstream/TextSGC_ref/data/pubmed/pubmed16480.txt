How does bilingual exposure impact children\s neural circuitry for learning to read? Theories of bilingualism suggests that exposure to two languages may yield a functional and neuroanatomical adaptation to support the learning of two languages Klein et al. 2014. To test the hypothesis that this neural adaptation may vary as a function of structural and orthographic characteristics of bilinguals\ two languages we compared Spanish-English and French-English bilingual children and English monolingual children using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging fNIRS ages 6-10 N =26. Spanish offers consistent sound-to-print correspondences "phonologically transparent" or "shallow"; such correspondences are more opaque in French and even more opaque in English which has both transparent and "phonologically opaque" or "deep" correspondences. Consistent with our hypothesis both French- and Spanish-English bilinguals showed hyperactivation in left posterior temporal regions associated with direct sound-to-print phonological analyses and hypoactivation in left frontal regions associated with assembled phonology analyses. Spanish but not French bilinguals showed a similar effect when reading Irregular words. The findings inform theories of bilingual and cross-linguistic literacy acquisition by suggesting that structural characteristics of bilinguals\ two languages and their orthographies have a significant impact on children\s neuro-cognitive architecture for learning to read.
