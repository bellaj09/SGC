We developed a multi-phase simulation system for patients with jaw deformity and dysfunction as a collaborate study between our departments. The intended application of the physical simulation robot was to evaluate its function based on well it quantitatively measured the movement of the individual patient. This physical simulation robot consists of a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator and a plaster model of patient-specific bone geometry. Each plaster model was mounted on the serial-articulated robotic manipulator. To establish the accuracy of the robot movement the programmed movement of the robotic arm was validated using an optical tracking device. The results of the physical simulation robot corresponded with the data from the 4D analysis system. We could construct interactive relations between the 4D analysis system that was presented by virtual reality and the simulation robot which was constructed from physical simulation.
