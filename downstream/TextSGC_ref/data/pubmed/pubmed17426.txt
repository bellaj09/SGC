"An efficient method for head-related transfer function HRTF measurement is presented. By applying the acoustical principle of reciprocity one can swap the speaker and the microphone positions in the traditional direct HRTF measurement setup that is insert a microspeaker into the subjects ear and position several microphones around the subject enabling simultaneous HRTF acquisition at all microphone positions. The setup used for reciprocal HRTF measurement is described and the obtained HRTFs are compared with the analytical solution for a sound-hard sphere and with KEMAR manikin HRTF obtained by the direct method. The reciprocally measured sphere HRTF agrees well with the analytical solution. The reciprocally measured and the directly measured KEMAR HRTFs are not exactly identical but agree well in spectrum shape and feature positions. To evaluate if the observed differences are significant an auditory localization model based on work by J. C. Middlebrooks J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 92 2607-2624 1992 was used to predict where a virtual sound source synthesized with the reciprocally measured HRTF would be localized if the directly measured HRTF were used for the localization. It was found that the predicted localization direction generally lies close to the measurement direction indicating that the HRTFs obtained via the two methods are in good agreement."
