Recent advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI research have uncovered the existence of the central autonomic network CAN which comprises brain regions whose activity correlates with autonomic nervous system dynamics. By exploiting the spectral paradigm of heartbeat dynamics cortical and sub-cortical areas functionally linked to vagal activity have been identified. However due to methodological limitations functional neural correlates of cardiac sympathetic dynamics remain uncharacterized. To this extent we exploit the high spatiotemporal resolution of fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to study the CAN activity by correlating a recently proposed instantaneous characterization of sympathetic activity the sympathetic activity index - SAI from heartbeat dynamics. SAI estimates are embedded into the probabilistic modeling of inhomogeneous point-processes and are derived from a combination of disentangling coefficients linked to the orthonormal Laguerre functions. By analyzing resting state recordings from 34 young healthy people we obtain positive correlations between instantaneous SAI estimates and a number of brain regions including frontal pole insular cortex frontal and temporal gyri lateral occipital cortex paracingulate and cingulate gyri precuneus and temporal fusiform cortices as well as thalamus caudate nucleus putamen brain-stem hippocampus amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Our findings significantly extend current knowledge on the CAN opening new avenues in the characterization of healthy and pathological states in humans.
