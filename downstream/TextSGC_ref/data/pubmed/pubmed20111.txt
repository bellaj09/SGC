"Junior investigators often have limited access to networks of scientific experts and resources that facilitate competitive grant submissions. Since environments in which scientists are trained are critically important for long-term success we built and tested a virtual environment for early-stage investigators ESIs working on grant proposals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the virtual communitys influence on grant submission patterns among participants from underrepresented groups. As part of a grant writing coaching model junior investigators were recruited into a professional development program designed to develop competitive grantsmanship skills. Designed by the Research Resources and Outreach Core RROC of the National Research Mentoring Network NRMN the Health Equity Learning Collaboratory EQ-Collaboratory provided a virtual community for social support accountability constructive feedback and access to peer networks to help investigators overcome barriers to grant submission. This study assessed differences in outcomes for participants who completed the training within the EQ-Collaboratory compared to those who did not. The analyzed data revealed a statistically significant difference in the average time to submission for participants enrolled in the EQ-Collaboratory. EQ-Collaboratory ESIs submitted proposals 148.6 days earlier p < 0.0001. The results suggest that a supportive virtual environment can help investigators more quickly overcome barriers to grant submission."
