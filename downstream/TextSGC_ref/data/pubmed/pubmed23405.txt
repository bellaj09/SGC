Many previous studies on brain-machine interfaces BMIs have focused on electroencephalography EEG signals elicited during motor-command execution to generate device commands. However exploiting pre-execution brain activity related to movement intention could improve the practical applicability of BMIs. Therefore in this study we investigated whether EEG signals occurring before movement execution could be used to classify movement intention. Six subjects performed reaching tasks that required them to move a cursor to one of four targets distributed horizontally and vertically from the center. Using independent components of EEG acquired during a premovement phase two-class classifications were performed for left vs. right trials and top vs. bottom trials using a support vector machine. Instructions were presented visually test and aurally condition. In the test condition accuracy for a single window was about 75% and it increased to 85% in classification using two windows. In the control condition accuracy for a single window was about 73% and it increased to 80% in classification using two windows. Classification results showed that a combination of two windows from different time intervals during the premovement phase improved classification performance in the both conditions compared to a single window classification. By categorizing the independent components according to spatial pattern we found that information depending on the modality can improve classification performance. We confirmed that EEG signals occurring during movement preparation can be used to control a BMI. Classification of Movement Intention Using Independent Components of Premovement EEG.
