Machine learning a subset of artificial intelligence is a set of models and methods that can automatically detect patterns in vast amounts of data extract information and use it to perform various kinds of decision-making under uncertain conditions. This can assist surgeons in clinical decision-making by identifying patient cohorts that will benefit from surgery prior to treatment. The aim of this review is to evaluate the applications of machine learning in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The applications of machine learning in plastic and reconstructive surgery: protocol of a systematic review.
