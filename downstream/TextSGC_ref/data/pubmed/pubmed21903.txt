The visualization of the progression of brain tissue loss in neurodegenerative diseases like corticobasal syndrome CBS can provide not only information about the localization and distribution of the volume loss but also helps to understand the course and the causes of this neurodegenerative disorder. The visualization of such medical imaging data is often based on 2D sections because they show both internal and external structures in one image. Spatial information however is lost. 3D visualization of imaging data is capable to solve this problem but it faces the difficulty that more internally located structures may be occluded by structures near the surface. Here we present an application with two designs for the 3D visualization of the human brain to address these challenges. In the first design brain anatomy is displayed semi-transparently; it is supplemented by an anatomical section and cortical areas for spatial orientation and the volumetric data of volume loss. The second design is guided by the principle of importance-driven volume rendering: A direct line-of-sight to the relevant structures in the deeper parts of the brain is provided by cutting out a frustum-like piece of brain tissue. The application was developed to run in both standard desktop environments and in immersive virtual reality environments with stereoscopic viewing for improving the depth perception. We conclude that the presented application facilitates the perception of the extent of brain degeneration with respect to its localization and affected regions.
