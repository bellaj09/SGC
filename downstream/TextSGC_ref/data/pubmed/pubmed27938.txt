Extracellular neuronal microelectrode recordings can include action potentials from multiple neurons. To separate spikes from different neurons they can be sorted according to their shape a procedure referred to as spike-sorting. Several algorithms have been reported to solve this task. However when clustering outcomes are unsatisfactory most of them are difficult to adjust to achieve the desired results. We present an online spike-sorting framework that uses feature normalization and weighting to maximize the distinctiveness between different spike shapes. Furthermore multiple criteria are applied to either facilitate or prevent cluster fusion thereby enabling experimenters to fine-tune the sorting process. We compare our method to established unsupervised offline Wave_Clus WC and online OSort OS algorithms by examining their performance in sorting various test datasets using two different scoring systems AMI and the Adamos metric. Furthermore we evaluate sorting capabilities on intra-operative recordings using established quality metrics. Compared to WC and OS our algorithm achieved comparable or higher scores on average and produced more convincing sorting results for intra-operative datasets. Thus the presented framework is suitable for both online and offline analysis and could substantially improve the quality of microelectrode-based data evaluation for research and clinical application.
