Using remotely sensed imagery to identify biophysical components across landscapes is an important avenue of investigation for ecologists studying ecosystem dynamics. With high-resolution remotely sensed imagery algorithmic utilization of image context is crucial for accurate identification of biophysical components at large scales. In recent years convolutional neural networks CNNs have become ubiquitous in image processing and are rapidly becoming more common in ecology. Because the quantity of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery continues to rise CNNs are increasingly essential tools for large-scale ecosystem analysis. We discuss here the conceptual advantages of CNNs demonstrate how they can be used by ecologists through distinct examples of their application and provide a walkthrough of how to use them for ecological applications.
