In the qualitative evaluation the flexibility of access access independent of time/place freedom to decide the best learning route and the similarity with reality were highlighted. It constitutes a promising educational tool an interactive experience similar to reality dynamic and constructive learning. The application of the technology has brought positive results for learning about pain evaluation contributing to fill the gap in the teaching of the thematic.
