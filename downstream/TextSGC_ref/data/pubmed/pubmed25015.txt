"\xa0Light modulation plays an important role in understanding the pathology of brain disorders and improving brain function. Optogenetic techniques can activate or silence targeted neurons with high temporal and spatial accuracy and provide precise control and have recently become a method for quick manipulation of genetically identified types of neurons. Photobiomodulation PBM is light therapy that utilizes non-ionizing light sources including lasers light emitting diodes or broadband light. It provides a safe means of modulating brain activity without any irreversible damage and has established optimal treatment parameters in clinical practice. This manuscript reviews 1 how optogenetic approaches have been used to dissect neural circuits in animal models of Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease and depression and 2 how low level transcranial lasers and LED stimulation in humans improves brain activity patterns in these diseases. State-of-the-art brain machine interfaces that can record neural activity and stimulate neurons with light have good prospects in the future."
