"Operators of a pair of robotic hands report ownership for those hands when they hold image of a grasp motion and watch the robot perform it. We present a novel body ownership illusion that is induced by merely watching and controlling robots motions through a brain machine interface. In past studies body ownership illusions were induced by correlation of such sensory inputs as vision touch and proprioception. However in the presented illusion none of the mentioned sensations are integrated except vision. Our results show that during BMI-operation of robotic hands the interaction between motor commands and visual feedback of the intended motions is adequate to incorporate the non-body limbs into ones own body. Our discussion focuses on the role of proprioceptive information in the mechanism of agency-driven illusions. We believe that our findings will contribute to improvement of tele-presence systems in which operators incorporate BMI-operated robots into their body representations." Humanlike robot hands controlled by brain activity arouse illusion of ownership in operators.
