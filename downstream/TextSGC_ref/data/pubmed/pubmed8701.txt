The importance of microRNAs miRNAs is widely recognized in the community nowadays because these short segments of RNA can play several roles in almost all biological processes. The computational prediction of novel miRNAs involves training a classifier for identifying sequences having the highest chance of being precursors of miRNAs pre-miRNAs. The big issue with this task is that well-known pre-miRNAs are usually few in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of candidate sequences in a genome which results in high class imbalance. This imbalance has a strong influence on most standard classifiers and if not properly addressed in the model and the experiments not only performance reported can be completely unrealistic but also the classifier will not be able to work properly for pre-miRNA prediction. Besides another important issue is that for most of the machine learning ML approaches already used supervised methods it is necessary to have both positive and negative examples. The selection of positive examples is straightforward well-known pre-miRNAs. However it is difficult to build a representative set of negative examples because they should be sequences with hairpin structure that do not contain a pre-miRNA.
