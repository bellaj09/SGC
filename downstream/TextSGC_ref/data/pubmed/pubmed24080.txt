"The process of learning a humans movement and motor control mechanisms by watching and mimicking human motions was based on visuo-motor control in three dimensional space. However previous studies regarding the visuo-motor control in three dimensional space have focused on analyzing the tracking tasks along one-dimensional lines or two-dimensional planes using single or multi-joint movements. Therefore in this study we developed a new system to quantitatively evaluate visuo-motor control in three-dimensional space based on virtual reality VR environment. Our proposed system is designed to analyze circular tracking movements on frontal and sagittal planes in VR space with millimeter level accuracy. In particular we compared the circular tracking movements under monocular and binocular vision conditions. The results showed that the accuracy of circular tracking movements drops approximately 4.5 times in monocular vision than that in binocular vision on both frontal and sagittal planes. We also found that significant difference can be observed between frontal and sagittal planes for only the accuracy of X-axis in both monocular and binocular visions."
