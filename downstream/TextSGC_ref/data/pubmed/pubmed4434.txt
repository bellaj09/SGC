"Chronic pain remains poorly understood; yet it is associated with the reorganization of the nervous system. Here we demonstrate that a unitary global measure of functional connectivity defined as the extent of degree rank order disruption kD identifies the chronic pain state. In contrast local degree disruption differentiates between chronic pain conditions. We used resting-state functional MRI data to analyze the brain connectome at varying scales and densities. In three chronic pain conditions we observe disrupted kD in proportion to individuals pain intensity and associated with community membership disruption. Additionally we observe regional degree changes some of which were unique to each type of chronic pain. Subjects with recent onset of back pain exhibited emergence of kD only when the pain became chronic. Similarly in neuropathic rats kD emerged weeks after injury in proportion to pain-like behavior. Thus we found comprehensive cross-species evidence for chronic pain being a state of global randomization of functional connectivity." Global disruption of degree rank order: a hallmark of chronic pain.
