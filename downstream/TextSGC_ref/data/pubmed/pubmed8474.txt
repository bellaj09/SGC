Electronic health records EHRs provide possibilities to improve patient care and facilitate clinical research. However there are many challenges faced by the applications of EHRs such as temporality high dimensionality sparseness noise random error and systematic bias. In particular temporal information is difficult to effectively use by traditional machine learning methods while the sequential information of EHRs is very useful.
