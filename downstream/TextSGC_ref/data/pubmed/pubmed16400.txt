Convolutional neural networks CNNs offer human experts-like performance and in the same time they are faster and more consistent in their prediction. However most of the proposed CNNs require an expensive state-of-the-art hardware which substantially limits their use in practical scenarios and commercial systems especially for clinical biomedical and other applications that require on-the-fly analysis. In this paper we investigate the possibility of making CNNs lighter by parametrizing the architecture and decreasing the number of trainable weights of a popular CNN: U-Net. Reducing the U-Net size for practical scenarios: Virus recognition in electron microscopy images.
