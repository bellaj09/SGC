In this study we developed a graph based semi-supervised learning SSL scheme using deep convolutional neural network CNN for breast cancer diagnosis. CNN usually needs a large amount of labeled data for training and fine tuning the parameters and our proposed scheme only requires a small portion of labeled data in training set. Four modules were included in the diagnosis system: data weighing feature selection dividing co-training data labeling and CNN. 3158 region of interests ROIs with each containing a mass extracted from 1874 pairs of mammogram images were used for this study. Among them 100 ROIs were treated as labeled data while the rest were treated as unlabeled. The area under the curve AUC observed in our study was 0.8818 and the accuracy of CNN is 0.8243 using the mixed labeled and unlabeled data.
