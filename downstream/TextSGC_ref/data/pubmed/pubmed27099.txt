Detecting signs of consciousness in patients with severe brain injury constitutes a real challenge for clinicians. The current gold standard in clinical diagnosis is the behavioral scale relying on motor abilities which are often impaired or nonexistent in these patients. In this context brain-computer interfaces BCIs could offer a potential complementary tool to detect signs of consciousness whilst bypassing the usual motor pathway. In addition to complementing behavioral assessments and potentially reducing error rate BCIs could also serve as a communication tool for paralyzed but conscious patients e.g. suffering from Locked-In Syndrome. In this paper we report on recent work conducted by the Coma Science Group on BCI technology aiming to optimize diagnosis and communication in patients with disorders of consciousness and Locked-In syndrome. Brain-computer interfaces Locked-In syndrome and disorders of consciousness.
