Feedback has been shown to affect performance when using a Brain-Computer Interface BCI based on sensorimotor rhythms. In contrast little is known about the influence of feedback on P300-based BCIs. There is still an open question whether feedback affects the regulation of P300 and consequently the operation of P300-based BCIs. In this paper for the first time the influence of feedback on the P300-based BCI speller task is systematically assessed. For this purpose 24 healthy participants performed the classic P300-based BCI speller task while only half of them received feedback. Importantly the number of flashes per letter was reduced on a regular basis in order to increase the frequency of providing feedback. Experimental results showed that feedback could significantly improve the P300-based BCI speller performance if it was provided in short time intervals e.g. in sequences as short as 4 to 6 flashes per row/column. Moreover our offline analysis showed that providing feedback remarkably enhanced the relevant ERP patterns and attenuated the irrelevant ERP patterns such that the discrimination between target and non-target EEG trials increased.
