Low-frequency electroencephalographic EEG activity provides relevant information for decoding movement commands in healthy subjects and paralyzed patients. Brainmachine interfaces BMI exploiting these signals have been developed to provide closed-loop feedback and induce neuroplasticity. Several offline and online studies have already demonstrated that discriminable information related to movement can be decoded from low-frequency EEG activity. However there is still not a well-established procedure to guarantee that this activity is optimally filtered from the background noise. This work compares different configurations of non-causal i.e. offline and causal i.e. online filters to classify movement-related cortical potentials MRCP with six healthy subjects during reaching movements. Our results reveal important differences in MRCP decoding accuracy dependent on the selected frequency band for both offline and online approaches. In summary this paper underlines the importance of optimally choosing filter parameters since their variable response has an impact on the classification of low EEG frequencies for BMI. Evaluation of filtering techniques to extract movement intention information from low-frequency EEG activity.
