Virtual reality simulation has been identified as an emerging educational tool with significant potential to enhance teaching of residents and students in emergency clinical encounters and procedures. Endotracheal intubation represents a critical procedure for emergency care providers. Current methods of training include working with cadavers and mannequins which have limitations in their representation of reality ethical concerns and overall availability with access cost and location of models. This paper will present a human airway simulation model designed for tracheal intubation and discuss the aspects that lend itself to use as an educational tool. This realistic and dynamic model is used to teach routine intubations while future models will include more difficult airway management scenarios. This work provides a solid foundation for future versions of the intubation simulator which will incorporate two haptic devices to allow for simultaneous control of the laryngoscope blade and endotracheal tube. Endotracheal intubation: application of virtual reality to emergency medical services education.
