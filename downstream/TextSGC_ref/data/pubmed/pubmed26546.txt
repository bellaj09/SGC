This study establishes the effectiveness of event related synchronisation ERS features for a system paced brain computer interface BCI. In particular the relationship between the duration of motor imagery MI and the quality of the features extracted from the ERS is investigated. To this end two groups of users performed brief 2s or sustained 4s MI and offline single trial BCIs were validated on each group based on features extracted from the EEG before during and after MI. The BCIs were designed to recognise two intentional control tasks and a no-control state. Cross-validated results indicate that brief MI leads to more informative ERS features than sustained MI. Investigating brief motor imagery for an ERD/ERS based BCI.
