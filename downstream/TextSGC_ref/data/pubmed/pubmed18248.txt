We propose a Maxwellian near-to-eye display implemented using a multiplexed holographic optical element. Maxwellian configuration removes the focal cue of the displayed virtual image completely presenting an always-focused image to the observer regardless of the focal length of the eye. The transparent property of the holographic optical element enables the optical see-through feature making the proposed near-to-eye display suitable for augmented reality applications. The multiplexing of multiple concave mirrors into a single holographic optical element enlarges the effective eyebox relaxing the limitation of the conventional Maxwellian displays. Optical experiment confirms that the proposed display can present always-focused images on top of the real environment with 9.2H5.2V field of view and 9\u2009\u2009mm\u2009H3\u2009\u2009mm\u2009V eyebox.
