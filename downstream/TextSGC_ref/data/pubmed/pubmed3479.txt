The use of resting state fMRI rs-fMRI in translational research is a powerful tool to assess brain connectivity and investigate neuropathology in mouse models. However despite encouraging initial results the characterization of consistent and robust resting state networks in mice remains a methodological challenge. One key reason is that the quality of the measured MR signal is degraded by the presence of structural noise from non-neural sources. Notably in the current pipeline of the Human Connectome Project a novel approach has been introduced to clean rs-fMRI data which involves automatic artifact component classification and data cleaning FIX. FIX does not require any external recordings of physiology or the segmentation of CSF and white matter. In this study we evaluated the performance of FIX for analyzing mouse rs-fMRI data. Our results showed that FIX can be easily applied to mouse datasets and detects true signals with 100% accuracy and true noise components with very high accuracy >98% thus reducing both within- and between-subject variability of rs-fMRI connectivity measurements. Using this improved pre-processing pipeline maps of 23 resting state circuits in mice were identified including two networks that displayed default mode network-like topography. Hierarchical clustering grouped these neural networks into meaningful larger functional circuits. These mouse resting state networks which are publicly available might serve as a reference for future work using mouse models of neurological disorders.
