Although virtual reality exposure has been reported as a method to induce paranoid thought little is known about mechanisms to control specific virtual stressors. This paper reports on a study that examines the effect of controlling the stream of potential paranoia evoking events in a virtual restaurant world. A 2-by-2 experiment with a non-clinical group n = 24 was conducted with as two within-subject factors: 1 the cycle time short/long for when the computer considers activation of a paranoia evoking event and 2 the probability that a paranoia-evoking event low/high would be triggered at the completion of a cycle. The results showed a significant main effect for the probability factor and two-way interaction effect with the cycle time factor on the number of paranoid comments participants made and their self-reported anxiety. Controlling a stream of paranoia evoking events in a virtual reality environment.
