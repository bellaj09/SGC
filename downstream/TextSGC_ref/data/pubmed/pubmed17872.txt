Digital transformation is becoming increasingly common in modern life and sports medicine like many other medical disciplines it is strongly influenced and impacted by this rapidly changing field. This review aims to give a brief overview of the potential that digital technologies can have for health care providers and patients in the clinical practice of sports medicine. We will focus on mobile applications wearables smart devices intelligent machines telemedicine artificial intelligence big data system interoperability virtual reality augmented reality exergaming or social networks. While some technologies are already used in current medical practice others still have undiscovered potential. Due to the diversity and ever changing nature of this field we will briefly review multiple areas in an attempt to give readers some general exposure to the landscape instead of a thorough deep review of one topic. Further research will be necessary to show how digitalization applications could best be used for patient treatments. Potentials of Digitalization in Sports Medicine: A Narrative Review.
