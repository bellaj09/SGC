Prior reports have shown optical coherence tomography OCT can differentiate normal colonic mucosa from neoplasia potentially offering an alternative technique to endoscopic biopsy - the current gold-standard colorectal cancer screening and surveillance modality. To help clinical translation limited by processing the large volume of generated data we designed a deep learning-based pattern recognition PR OCT system that automates image processing and provides accurate diagnosis potentially in real-time. Method: OCT is an emerging imaging technique to obtain 3-dimensional 3D "optical biopsies" of biological samples with high resolution. We designed a convolutional neural network to capture the structure patterns in human colon OCT images. The network is trained and tested using around 26000 OCT images acquired from 20 tumor areas 16 benign areas and 6 other abnormal areas. Results: The trained network successfully detected patterns that identify normal and neoplastic colorectal tissue. Experimental diagnoses predicted by the PR-OCT system were compared to the known histologic findings and quantitatively evaluated. A sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.7% can be reached. Further the area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curves AUC of 0.998 is achieved. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that PR-OCT can be used to give an accurate real-time computer-aided diagnosis of colonic neoplastic mucosa. Future development of this system as an "optical biopsy" tool to assist doctors in real-time for early mucosal neoplasms screening and treatment evaluation following initial oncologic therapy is planned.
