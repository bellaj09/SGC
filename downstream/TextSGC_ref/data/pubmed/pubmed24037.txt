Research has consistently shown cervical kinematic impairments in subjects with persistent neck pain NP. It could be reasoned that those with vestibular pathology VP may also have altered kinematics since vestibular stimulation via head movement can cause dizziness and visual disturbances. However this has not been examined to date. This pilot study investigated changes in cervical kinematics between asymptomatic control NP and VP subjects using a Virtual Reality VR system. It was hypothesised that there would be altered kinematics in VP subjects which might be associated with dizziness and visual symptoms.
