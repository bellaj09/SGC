"Student engagement is known to have several positive effects on learning outcomes and can impact a students university experience. High levels of engagement in content-heavy subjects can be difficult to attain. Due to a major institutional restructure the anatomy prosection laboratory time per subject was dramatically reduced. In response the authors set out to redesign their anatomy units with a focus on engaging the learning activities that would increase time-on-task both within and outside of the classroom. One of these curriculum changes was the implementation of a suite of anatomy learning activities centered on sets of three-dimensional printed upper limb skeleton models. A two-part mixed-method sequential exploratory design was used to evaluate these activities. Part one was a questionnaire that evaluated the students engagement with and perceptions of the models. Part two involved focus groups interviews which were an extension of the survey questions in part one. The results of the study indicated that the majority of students found the models to be an engaging resource that helped improve their study habits. As a result students strongly felt that the use of the models inspired greater academic confidence and overall better performance in their assessments. Overall the models were an effective way of increasing the engagement and deep learning and reinforced previous findings from the medical education research. Future research should investigate the effects of these models on students grades within osteopathy and other allied health courses."
