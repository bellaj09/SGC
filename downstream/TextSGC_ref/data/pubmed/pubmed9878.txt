Efficient computational recognition and segmentation of target organ from medical images are foundational in diagnosis and treatment especially about pancreas cancer. In practice the diversity in appearance of pancreas and organs in abdomen makes detailed texture information of objects important in segmentation algorithm. According to our observations however the structures of previous networks such as the Richer Feature Convolutional Network RCF are too coarse to segment the object pancreas accurately especially the edge. Hierarchical combinatorial deep learning architecture for pancreas segmentation of medical computed tomography cancer images.
