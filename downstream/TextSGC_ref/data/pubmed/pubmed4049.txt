"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI is accompanied by the accelerated cognitive decline and rapid brain degeneration with aging. However the age-related alterations of the topological organization of the brain connectome in aMCI patients remained largely unknown. In this study we constructed the brain structural connectome in 51 aMCI patients and 51 healthy controls by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and deterministic tractography. The different age-related alteration patterns of the global and regional network metrics between aMCI patients and healthy controls were assessed by a linear regression model. Compared with healthy controls significantly decreased global and local network efficiency in aMCI patients were found. When correlating network efficiency with age we observed a significant decline in network efficiency with aging in the aMCI patients while not in the healthy controls. The age-related decreases of nodal efficiency in aMCI patients were mainly distributed in the key regions of the default-mode network such as precuneus anterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. In addition age-related decreases in the connection strength of the edges between peripheral nodes were observed in aMCI patients. Moreover the decreased regional efficiency of the parahippocampal gyrus was correlated with impaired memory performances in patients. The present study suggests an age-related disruption of the topological organization of the brain structural connectome in aMCI patients which may provide evidence for different neural mechanisms underlying aging in aMCI and may serve as a potential imaging marker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease."
