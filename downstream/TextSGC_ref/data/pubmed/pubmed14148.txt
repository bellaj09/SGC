Blockade of the human ether--go-go-related gene hERG channel by small compounds causes a prolonged QT interval that can lead to severe cardiotoxicity and is a major cause of the many failures in drug development. Thus evaluating the hERG-blocking activity of small compounds is important for successful drug development. To this end various computational prediction tools have been developed but their prediction performances in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value NPV need to be improved to reduce false negative predictions. DeepHIT: a deep learning framework for prediction of hERG-induced cardiotoxicity.
