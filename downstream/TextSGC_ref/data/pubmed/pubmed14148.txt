"Research on innovation often highlights analogies from sources outside the current problem domain as a major source of novel concepts; however the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. We analyzed the temporal interplay between far analogy use and creative concept generation in a professional design teams brainstorming conversations investigating the hypothesis that far analogies lead directly to very novel concepts via large steps in conceptual spaces jumps. Surprisingly we found that concepts were more similar to their preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to baseline situations i.e. without far analogy use. Yet far analogies increased the teams concept generation rate compared to baseline conditions. Overall these results challenge the view that far analogies primarily lead to novel concepts via jumps in conceptual spaces and suggest alternative pathways from far analogies to novel concepts e.g. iterative deep exploration within a functional space."
