"To go from one place to another we routinely generate internal representations of surrounding spaces which can include egocentric body-centred and allocentric world-centred coordinates combined into route and survey representations.Recent studies have shown how both egocentric and allocentric representations exist in parallel and are joined to support behaviour according to the task.Our study investigated the transfer from survey map-like to route representations in healthy and brain-damaged subjects. The aim was two-fold: first to understand how this ability could change with age in a sample of healthy participants aged from 40 to 71 years old; second to investigate how it is affected after a brain lesion in a 8 patients sample with reference to specific neuropsychological frames."
