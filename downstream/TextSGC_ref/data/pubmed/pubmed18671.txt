This paper presents a virtual reality system the BlindAid developed for orientation and mobility training of people who are newly blind. The BlindAid allows users to interact with different virtual structures and objects via auditory and haptic feedback. This case study aims to examine if and how the BlindAid in conjunction with a traditional rehabilitation programme can help people who are newly blind develop new orientation and mobility methods. Follow-up research based on this study with a large experiment and control group could contribute to the area of orientation and mobility rehabilitation training for the newly blind. The case study research focused on A. a woman who is newly blind for 17 virtual sessions spanning ten weeks during the 12 weeks of her traditional orientation and mobility rehabilitation programme. The research was implemented by using virtual environment VE exploration and orientation tasks in VE and physical spaces. The research methodology used both qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews questionnaire videotape recording and user computer logs. The results of this study helped elucidate several issues concerning the contribution of the BlindAid system to the exploration strategies and learning processes experienced by the participant in her encounters with familiar and unfamiliar physical surroundings.
