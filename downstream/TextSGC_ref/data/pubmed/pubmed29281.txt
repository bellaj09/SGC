A brain-machine interface BMI should be able to help people with disabilities by replacing their lost motor functions. To replace lost functions robot arms have been developed that are controlled by invasive neural signals. Although invasive neural signals have a high spatial resolution non-invasive neural signals are valuable because they provide an interface without surgery. Thus various researchers have developed robot arms driven by non-invasive neural signals. However robot arm control based on the imagined trajectory of a human hand can be more intuitive for patients. In this study therefore an integrated robot arm-gripper system IRAGS that is driven by three-dimensional 3D hand trajectories predicted from non-invasive neural signals was developed and verified.
