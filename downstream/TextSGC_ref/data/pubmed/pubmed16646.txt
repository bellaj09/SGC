Operators in Nuclear Power Plants can receive high doses during refuelling operations. A training programme for simulating refuelling operations will be useful in reducing the doses received by workers as well as minimising operation time. With this goal in mind a virtual reality application is developed within the framework of the CIPRES project. The application requires doses both instantaneous and accumulated to be displayed at all times during operator training. Therefore it is necessary to set up a database containing dose rates at every point in the refuelling plant. This database is based on radiological protection surveillance data measured in the plant during refuelling operations. Some interpolation routines have been used to estimate doses through the refuelling plant. Different assumptions have been adopted in order to perform the interpolation and obtain consistent data. In this paper the procedures developed to set up the dose database for the virtual reality application are presented and analysed. Developing a virtual reality application for training nuclear power plant operators: setting up a database containing dose rates in the refuelling plant.
