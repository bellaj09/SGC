We present in this paper the application of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs which is a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence AI approach in machine learning for automated time-independent prediction of burn depth. Color images of four types of burn depth injured in first few days including normal skin and background acquired by a TiVi camera were trained and tested with four pretrained deep CNNs: VGG-16 GoogleNet ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. In the end the best 10-fold cross-validation results obtained from ResNet-101 with an average minimum and maximum accuracy are 81.66 72.06 and 88.06% respectively; and the average accuracy sensitivity and specificity for the four different types of burn depth are 90.54 74.35 and 94.25% respectively. The accuracy was compared with the clinical diagnosis obtained after the wound had healed. Hence application of AI is very promising for prediction of burn depth and therefore can be a useful tool to help in guiding clinical decision and initial treatment of burn wounds.
