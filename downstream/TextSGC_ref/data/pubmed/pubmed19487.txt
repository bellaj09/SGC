This study examines the psychometric properties of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short WAI-S adaptation to Virtual Reality VR and Augmented Reality AR therapies WAI-VAR. The relationship between the therapeutic alliance TA with VR and AR and clinically significant change CSC is also explored. Seventy-five patients took part in this study 74.7% women M age = 34.41. Fear of flying and adjustment disorder patients received VR therapy and cockroach phobia patients received AR therapy. Psychometric properties CSC one-way ANOVA Spearman\s Correlations and Multiple Regression were calculated. The WAI-VAR showed a unidimensional structure high internal consistency and adequate convergent validity. "Not changed" patients scored lower on the WAI-VAR than "improved" and "recovered" patients. Correlation between the WAI-VAR and CSC was moderate. The best fitting model for predicting CSC was a linear combination of the TA with therapist WAI-S and the TA with VR and AR WAI-VAR due to the latter variable slightly increased the percentage of variability accounted for in CSC. The WAI-VAR is the first validated instrument to measure the TA with VR and AR in research and clinical practice. This study reveals the importance of the quality of the TA with technologies in achieving positive outcomes in the therapy.
