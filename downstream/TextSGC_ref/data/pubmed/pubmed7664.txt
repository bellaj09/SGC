In this paper we present a technique based on deep reinforcement learning that allows for numerical analytic continuation of integrals that are often encountered in one-loop diagrams in quantum field theory. To extract certain quantities of two-point functions such as spectral densities mass poles or multiparticle thresholds it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation of the correlator in question. At one-loop level in Euclidean space this results in the necessity to deform the integration contour of the loop integral in the complex plane of the square of the loop momentum to avoid nonanalyticities in the integration plane. Using a toy model for which an exact solution is known we train a reinforcement learning agent to perform the required contour deformations. Our study shows great promise for an agent to be deployed in iterative numerical approaches used to compute nonperturbative two-point functions such as the quark propagator Dyson-Schwinger equation or more generally Fredholm equations of the second kind in the complex domain.
