"A major clinical goal of brain-computer interfaces BCIs is to allow severely paralyzed patients to communicate their needs and thoughts during their everyday lives. Among others P300-based BCIs which resort to EEG measurements have been successfully operated by people with severe neuromuscular disabilities. Besides reducing the number of stimuli repetitions needed to detect the P300 a current challenge in P300-based BCI research is the simplification of systems setup and maintenance by lowering the number N of recording channels. By using offline data collected in 30 subjects 21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and 9 controls through a clinical BCI with N = 5 channels in the present paper we show that a preprocessing approach based on a Bayesian single-trial ERP estimation technique allows reducing N to 1 without affecting the systems accuracy. The potentially great benefit for the practical usability of BCI devices including patient acceptance that would be given by the reduction of the number N of channels encourages further development of the present study for example in an online setting." Preprocessing by a Bayesian single-trial event-related potential estimation technique allows feasibility of an assistive single-channel P300-based brain-computer interface.
