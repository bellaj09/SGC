"Virtual Reality VR based simulators have been used as a training tool in many settings although very few studies examine transfer of training from simulators to a real world task particularly for manipulation tasks. Simulators could play a key role as an enabling technology for manipulation tasks related to teleoperation and medical procedure training. We investigated the relationship between motor tasks and participants spatial abilities. This relationship was further examined with respect to learning in a simulator and to transfer of training from the simulator to the real world on a pick-and-place task. Spatial abilities were characterized using a battery of recognition and manipulation figural tests. Subjects with lower spatial abilities demonstrated significant positive transfer from a simulator based training task to a similar real world robotic operation task. Subjects with higher spatial skills did not respond as positively from training in a simulated environment." The interaction of spatial ability and motor learning in the transfer of training from a simulator to a real task.
