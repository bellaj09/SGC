Diagnostic bronchoscopy and tissue sampling techniques using forceps endobronchial biopsy EBB and transbronchial biopsies TBB or needle aspiration transbronchial needle aspiration-TBNA all performed with a flexible bronchoscope are the basic elements of any interventional procedure. The flexible fibrobronchoscopy allows the visualization of the airways and is used both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The working channel of both fibrobronchoscopes with optical fibers and videobronchoscopes even if of relatively small diameter allows the insertion of various diagnostic and therapeutic accessories. Fiber optic systems have been widely replaced by video cameras using a miniaturized charge-coupled device camera positioned at the end of the scope that provides electronic transmission of images to a monitor. The indications for both diagnostic and therapeutic fibrobronchoscopy derive from a correct evaluation of symptoms and objective signs of the patient and from the correct interpretation of imaging methods. Although bronchoscopy techniques keep evolving at a rapid pace basic procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage transbronchial lung biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration still play a key role in pulmonary disease diagnostics and therefore these methods must still be part of the training of interventional pulmonologists. Trainees will acquire a thorough knowledge of thoracic anatomy and become skilled in the interpretation of thoracic imaging after which they will be given a theoretical and practical training course on virtual reality simulators on animal or cadaver models the effectiveness of which has been fully demonstrated by scientific studies. Specific DOPS tests have been developed for a qualitative evaluation of procedures on simulators on animal models and on the patient. Competence in flexible bronchoscopy and basic biopsy technique.
