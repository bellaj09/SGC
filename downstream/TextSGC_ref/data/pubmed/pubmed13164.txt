The measurement of Carotid Intima Media Thickness IMT on Common Carotid Artery CCA is a principle marker of risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper presents a novel method of using deep Convolutional Neural Network CNN for identification and measurement of IMT on the far wall of the artery. The Region of Interest ROI is extracted using CNN architecture with 8 layers. 110 subjects are taken for the study. Each subject is recorded with one Right Common Carotid Artery RCCA and Left Common Carotid Artery LCCA frame resulting in 220 recordings. Patch based segmentation with 2640 patches are given to the training network for ROI localization. Intima Media Complex IMC is the area where IMT is measured. This region is extracted after defining the ROI. Keeping in mind the end objective of measurement of IMT values binary threshold with snake algorithm is applied to extract the lumen-intima and media-adventitia boundary. IMT values are measured for 20 cases and mean difference is found to be 0.08\xa0mm. Convolutional Neural Network for Segmentation and Measurement of Intima Media Thickness.
