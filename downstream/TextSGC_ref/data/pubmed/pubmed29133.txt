A brain-computer interface BCI is a computer-based system that acquires analyzes and translates brain signals into output commands in real time. Perdikis and colleagues demonstrate superior performance in a Cybathlon BCI race using a system based on "three pillars": machine learning user training and application. These results highlight the fact that BCI use is a learned skill and not simply a matter of "mind reading." Brain-computer interface use is a skill that user and system acquire together.
