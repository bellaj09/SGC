Extracting relationships between chemicals and diseases from unstructured literature have attracted plenty of attention since the relationships are very useful for a large number of biomedical applications such as drug repositioning and pharmacovigilance. A number of machine learning methods have been proposed for chemical-induced disease CID extraction due to some publicly available annotated corpora. Most of them suffer from time-consuming feature engineering except deep learning methods. In this paper we propose a novel document-level deep learning method called recurrent piecewise convolutional neural networks RPCNN for CID extraction.
