Adverse drug events ADEs occur in approximately 2-5% of hospitalized patients often resulting in poor outcomes or even death. Extraction of ADEs from clinical narratives can accelerate and automate pharmacovigilance. Using state-of-the-art deep-learning neural networks to jointly model concept and relation extraction we achieved the highest integrated task score in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Event MADE 1.0 challenge. Adverse Drug Events Detection in Clinical Notes by Jointly Modeling Entities and Relations Using Neural Networks.
