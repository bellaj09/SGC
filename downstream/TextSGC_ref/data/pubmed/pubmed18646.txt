In a previous publication the authors reported on their findings that VRCBT n = 28 and CBT n = 30 groups were significantly more effective than a wait-list control WLC; n = 30 group in anxiety reduction on four of five anxiety measures as well as on participants self-rating of anxiety during a behavioral task. No significant differences were found between VRCBT and CBT. However twice as many clients dropped out of CBT 15 than from VRCBT 6. Results demonstrated that VRCBT is an effective and brief treatment regimen equal to CBT. This brief report examined durability of these changes. They found that both VRCBT 25 and CBT 24 groups maintained their improvement from post treatment to follow-up on all five measures. In addition they found that the CBT group continued to improve from post treatment to follow-up on Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale LSAS fear. Thus treatment gains were maintained at a 1-year follow-up." Virtual reality cognitive-behavior therapy for public speaking anxiety: one-year follow-up.
