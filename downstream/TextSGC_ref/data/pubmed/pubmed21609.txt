"Learning manual skills is a fundamental part of health care education and motor sensory and cognitive learning processes are essential aspects of professional development. Simulator training has been shown to enhance factors that facilitate motor and cognitive learning. The present study aimed to investigate the students experiences and thoughts about their learning through simulation skills training. The study was designed for an educational setting at a clinical skills centre. Ten third-year undergraduate nursing students performed urethral catheterisation using the virtual reality simulator UrecathVision which has haptic properties. The students practised in pairs. Each session was videotaped and the video was used to stimulate recall in subsequent interviews. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis from interviews resulted in three themes: what the students learn how the students learn and the simulators contribution to the students learning. Students learned manual skills how to perform the procedure and professional behaviour. They learned by preparing watching practising and reflecting. The simulator contributed by providing opportunities for students to prepare for the skills training to see anatomical structures to feel resistance and to become aware of their own performance ability. The findings show that the students related the task to previous experiences used sensory information tested themselves and practised techniques in a hands-on fashion and reflected in and on action. The simulator was seen as a facilitator to learning the manual skills. The study design with students working in pairs combined with video recording was found to enhance opportunities for reflection."
