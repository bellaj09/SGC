Adverse effects induced by drug-drug interactions may result in early termination of drug development or even withdrawal of drugs from the market and many drug-drug interactions are caused by the inhibition of cytochrome P450 CYP450 enzymes. Therefore the accurate prediction of the inhibition capability of a given compound against a specific CYP450 isoform is highly desirable. In this study three ensemble learning methods including random forest gradient boosting decision tree and eXtreme gradient boosting XGBoost and two deep learning methods including deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks were used to develop classification models to discriminate inhibitors and noninhibitors for five major CYP450 isoforms 1A2 2C9 2C19 2D6 and 3A4. The results demonstrate that the ensemble learning models generally give better predictions than the deep learning models for the external test sets. Among all of the models the XGBoost models achieve the best classification capability average prediction accuracy of 90.4% for the test sets which even outperform the previously reported model developed by the multitask deep autoencoder neural network 88.5%. The Shapley additive explanation method was then used to interpret the models and analyze the misclassified molecules. The important molecular descriptors given by our models are consistent with the structural preferences for inhibitors of different CYP450 isoforms which may provide valuable clues to detect potential drug-drug interactions in the early stage of drug discovery.
