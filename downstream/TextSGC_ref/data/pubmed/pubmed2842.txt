The identification of connexel-wise associations which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies BWAS to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders such as schizophrenia autism and depression the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate FWER of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate FDR it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly our method bypasses the need of non-parametric permutation to correct for multiple comparison thus it can efficiently tackle large datasets with high resolution fMRI images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset whereas existing methods fail.
