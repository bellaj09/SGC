Because of the high availability requirements from weapon equipment an in-depth study has been conducted on the real-time fault-tolerance of the widely applied Compact PCI CPCI bus measurement and control system. A redundancy design method that uses heartbeat detection to connect the primary and alternate devices has been developed. To address the low successful execution rate and relatively large waste of time slices in the primary version of the task software an improved algorithm for real-time fault-tolerant scheduling is proposed based on the Basic Checking available time Elimination idle time BCE algorithm applying a single-neuron self-adaptive proportion sum differential PSD controller. The experimental validation results indicate that this system has excellent redundancy and fault-tolerance and the newly developed method can effectively improve the system availability. Redundant and fault-tolerant algorithms for real-time measurement and control systems for weapon equipment.
