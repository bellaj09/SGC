"The use of interprofessional simulation training to enhance nursing students performance of technical and non-technical clinical skills is becoming increasingly common. Simulation training can involve the use of role play virtual reality or patient simulator manikins to replicate clinical scenarios and assess the nursing students ability to for example undertake clinical observations or work as part of a team. Simulation training enables nursing students to practise clinical skills in a safe environment. Effective simulation training requires extensive preparation and debriefing is necessary following a simulated training session to review any positive or negative aspects of the learning experience. This article discusses a high-fidelity simulated training session that was used to assess a group of third-year nursing students and foundation level 1 medical students. This involved the use of a patient simulator manikin in a scenario that required the collaborative management of a deteriorating patient." Exploring the use of high-fidelity simulation training to enhance clinical skills.
