This work presents a proof-of-concept study in artificial-intelligence-assisted AI-assisted chemistry where a machine-learning-based molecule generator is coupled with density functional theory DFT calculations synthesis and measurement. Although deep-learning-based molecule generators have shown promise it is unclear to what extent they can be useful in real-world materials development. To assess the reliability of AI-assisted chemistry we prepared a platform using a molecule generator and a DFT simulator and attempted to generate novel photofunctional molecules whose lowest excited states lie at desired energetic levels. A 10 day run on the 12-core server discovered 86 potential photofunctional molecules around target lowest excitation levels designated as 200 300 400 500 and 600 nm. Among the molecules discovered six were synthesized and five were confirmed to reproduce DFT predictions in ultraviolet visible absorption measurements. This result shows the potential of AI-assisted chemistry to discover ready-to-synthesize novel molecules with modest computational resources.
