Recent work on the role of overlapping cerebral networks in action selection and habit formation has important implications for alcohol addiction research. As reviewed below 1 these networks which all involve a group of deep-brain structures called the basal ganglia are associated with distinct behavioral control processes such as reward-guided Pavlovian conditional responses goal-directed instrumental actions and stimulus-driven habits; 2 different stages of action learning are associated with different networks which have the ability to change i.e. plasticity; and 3 exposure to alcohol and other addictive drugs can have profound effects on these networks by influencing the mechanisms underlying neural plasticity. From actions to habits: neuroadaptations leading to dependence.
