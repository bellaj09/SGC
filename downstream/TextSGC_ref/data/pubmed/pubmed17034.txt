The equine m. gluteus medius GM is the largest muscle of the horse its main movement function is the extension of the hip joint. The objective of the present study was to measure equine GM activity in three adjacent locations on GM during walk and trot on a treadmill in order to document potential differences. Fourteen Haflinger mares were measured using surface electromyography and kinematic markers to identify the motion cycles on three occasions over 16\xa0weeks. The electrodes were placed on left and right gluteus medius muscle over the middle of its widest part and 5\xa0cm lateral and medial of it. For data processing electrical activity was normalised to its maximum value and timing was normalised to the motion cycle. A Gaussian distribution approach was used to determine up to 10 modes of focussed activity and results were analysed separately for stance and swing phase of the ipsilateral hindlimb. Long term consistency and location specificity of equine gluteus medius muscle activity during locomotion on the treadmill.
