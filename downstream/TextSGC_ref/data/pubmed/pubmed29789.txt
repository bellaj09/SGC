Although brain-computer interfaces BCIs can be used in several different ways to restore communication communicative BCI has not approached the rate or efficiency of natural human speech. Electrocorticography ECoG has precise spatiotemporal resolution that enables recording of brain activity distributed over a wide area of cortex such as during speech production. In this study we sought to decode elements of speech production using ECoG. Direct classification of all American English phonemes using signals from functional speech motor cortex.
