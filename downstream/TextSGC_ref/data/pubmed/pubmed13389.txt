With the popularity of using deep learning-based models in various categorization problems and their proven robustness compared to conventional methods a growing number of researchers have exploited such methods in environment sound classification tasks in recent years. However the performances of existing models use auditory features like log-mel spectrogram LM and mel frequency cepstral coefficient MFCC or raw waveform to train deep neural networks for environment sound classification ESC are unsatisfactory. In this paper we first propose two combined features to give a more comprehensive representation of environment sounds Then a fourfour-layer convolutional neural network CNN is presented to improve the performance of ESC with the proposed aggregated features. Finally the CNN trained with different features are fused using the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to compose TSCNN-DS model. The experiment results indicate that our combined features with the four-layer CNN are appropriate for environment sound taxonomic problems and dramatically outperform other conventional methods. The proposed TSCNN-DS model achieves a classification accuracy of 97.2% which is the highest taxonomic accuracy on UrbanSound8K datasets compared to existing models.
