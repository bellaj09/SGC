"Virtual reality-based simulators are very helpful for trainees to acquire the skills of manipulating catheters and guidewires during the vascular interventional surgeries. In the development of such a simulator however it is a great challenge to realistically model and simulate deformable catheters and guidewires in an interactive manner. We propose a novel method to simulate the motion of catheters or guidewires and their interactions with patients vascular system. Our method is based on the principle of minimal total potential energy. We formulate the total potential energy in the vascular interventional circumstance by summing up the elastic energy deriving from the bending of the catheters or guidewires the potential energy due to the deformation of vessel walls and the work by the external forces. We propose a novel FEM-based approach to simulate the deformation of catheters and guidewires. The motion of catheters or the guidewires and their responses to every input from the interventionalist can be calculated globally. Experiments have been conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method and the results demonstrate that our method can realistically simulate the complex behaviors of catheters and guidewires in an interactive manner."
