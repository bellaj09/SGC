The scale and importance of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action challenges us to ask fundamental questions about widespread transformation of college biology instruction. I propose that we have clarified the "vision" but lack research-based models and evidence needed to guide the "change." To support this claim I focus on several key topics including evidence about effective use of active-teaching pedagogy by typical faculty and whether certain programs improve students\ understanding of the Vision and Change core concepts. Program evaluation is especially problematic. While current education research and theory should inform evaluation several prominent biology faculty-development programs continue to rely on self-reporting by faculty and students. Science technology engineering and mathematics STEM faculty-development overviews can guide program design. Such studies highlight viewing faculty members as collaborators embedding rewards faculty value and characteristics of effective faculty-development learning communities. A recent National Research Council report on discipline-based STEM education research emphasizes the need for long-term faculty development and deep conceptual change in teaching and learning as the basis for genuine transformation of college instruction. Despite the progress evident in Vision and Change forward momentum will likely be limited because we lack evidence-based reliable models for actually realizing the desired "change." Post-vision and change: do we know how to change?
