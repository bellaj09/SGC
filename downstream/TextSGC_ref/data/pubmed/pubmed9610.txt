Advances in deep learning DL have been transformative in computer vision and natural language processing as well as in healthcare. The authors present a novel application of DL to plastic surgery. Here the authors describe and demonstrate the mobile deployment of a deep neural network that predicts rhinoplasty status assess model accuracy compared to surgeons and describe future directions for such applications in plastic surgery.
