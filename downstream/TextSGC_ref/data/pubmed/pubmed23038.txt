"Purpose The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a virtual reality exercise program VREP on physical fitness body composition and fatigue in hemodialysis HD patients with end-stage renal failure. Subjects and Methods A nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used. Forty-six HD patients were divided into exercise n=23 and control groups n=23; while waiting for their dialyses the exercise group followed a VREP and the control group received only their usual care. The VREP was accomplished using Nintendos Wii Fit Plus for 40 minutes 3 times a week for 8 weeks during the period of May 27 to July 19 2013. Physical fitness muscle strength balance flexibility body composition skeletal muscle mass body fat rate arm and leg muscle mass and fatigue were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Results After the VREP physical fitness and body composition significantly increased and the level of fatigue significantly decreased in the exercise group. Conclusion These results suggest that a VREP improves physical fitness body composition and fatigue in HD patients. Based on the findings VREPs should be used as a health promotion programs for HD patients."
