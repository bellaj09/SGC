"In many developed countries a coordinated effort is underway to build national and regional Health Information Infrastructures HII for the linking of disparate sites of care so that an access to a comprehensive Health Record will be feasible when critical medical decisions are made 1. However widespread adoption of such national projects is hindered by a series of barriers- regulatory technical financial and cultural. Above all a robust national HII requires a firm foundation of trust: patients must be assured that their confidential health information will not be misused and that there are adequate legal remedies in the event of inappropriate behavior on the part of either authorized or unauthorized parties2.The Israeli evolving National HII is an innovative state of the art implementation of a wide-range clinical inter-organizational data exchange based on a unique concept of virtually temporary sharing of information. A logically connection of multiple caregivers and medical organizations creates a patient-centric virtual repository without centralization. All information remains in its original format location system and ownership. On demand relevant information is instantly integrated and delivered to the point of care. This system successfully covering more than half of Israels population is currently evolving from a voluntary private-public partnership dbMOTION and CLALIT HMO to a formal national reality. The governmental leadership now taking over the process is essential to achieve a full potential of the health information technology. All partners of the Israeli health system are coordinated in concert with each other driven with a shared vision - realizing that a secured private confidential health information exchange is assured."
