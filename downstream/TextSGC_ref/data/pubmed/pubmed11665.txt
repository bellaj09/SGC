The analysis of lung sounds collected through auscultation is a fundamental component of pulmonary disease diagnostics for primary care and general patient monitoring for telemedicine. Despite advances in computation and algorithms the goal of automated lung sound identification and classification has remained elusive. Over the past 40 years published work in this field has demonstrated only limited success in identifying lung sounds with most published studies using only a small numbers of patients typically N<;20 and usually limited to a single type of lung sound. Larger research studies have also been impeded by the challenge of labeling large volumes of data which is extremely labor-intensive. In this paper we present the development of a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm for automatically classify lung sounds from a relatively large number of patients N=284. Focusing on the two most common lung sounds wheeze and crackle we present results from 11627 sound files recorded from 11 different auscultation locations on these 284 patients with pulmonary disease. 890 of these sound files were labeled to evaluate the model which is significantly larger than previously published studies. Data was collected with a custom mobile phone application and a low-cost US$30 electronic stethoscope. On this data set our algorithm achieves ROC curves with AUCs of 0.86 for wheeze and 0.74 for crackle. Most importantly this study demonstrates how semi-supervised deep learning can be used with larger data sets without requiring extensive labeling of data.
