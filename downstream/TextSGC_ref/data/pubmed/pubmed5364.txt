"The Human Connectome Project HCP faces the challenging task of bringing multiple magnetic resonance imaging MRI modalities together in a common automated preprocessing framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural functional and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks including spatial artifact/distortion removal surface generation cross-modal registration and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCPs acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines." The minimal preprocessing pipelines for the Human Connectome Project.
