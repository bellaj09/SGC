Recent studies involving connectome analysis including graph theory have yielded potential biomarkers for mental disorders. In this study we aimed to investigate the differences of resting-state network between patients with social anxiety disorder SAD and healthy controls HCs as well as to distinguish between individual subjects using topological properties. In total 42 SAD patients and the same number of HCs underwent resting functional MRI and the topological organization of the whole-brain functional network was calculated using graph theory. Compared with the controls the patients showed a decrease in 49 positive connections. In the topological analysis the patients showed an increase in the area under the curve AUC of the global shortest path length of the network Lp and a decrease in the AUC of the global clustering coefficient of the network Cp. Furthermore the AUCs of Lp and Cp were used to effectively discriminate the individual SAD patients from the HCs with high accuracy. This study revealed that the neural networks of the SAD patients showed changes in topological characteristics and these changes were prominent not only in both groups but also at the individual level. This study provides a new perspective for the identification of patients with SAD. Altered Topological Properties of Brain Networks in Social Anxiety Disorder: A Resting-state Functional MRI Study.
