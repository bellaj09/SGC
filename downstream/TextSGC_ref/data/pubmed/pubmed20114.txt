Functional Electrical Stimulation FES cycling can benefit health and may lead to neuroplastic changes following incomplete spinal cord injury SCI. Our theory is that greater neurological recovery occurs when electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves is combined with voluntary effort. In this pilot study we investigated the effects of a one-month training programme using a novel device the iCycle in which voluntary effort is encouraged by virtual reality biofeedback during FES cycling. The effects of FES cycling combined with virtual reality racing biofeedback on voluntary function after incomplete SCI: a pilot study.
