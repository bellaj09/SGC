Zanthoxyli Pericarpium ZP are the dried ripe peel of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc ZC or Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim ZB. It has wide range of uses both medicine and food and favorable market value. The diverse specifications of components of ZP is exceptional and the common aims of adulteration for economic profit is conducted. In this work a novel method for the identification different species of ZP is proposed using convolutional neural networks CNNs. The data used for the experiment is 5 classes obtained from camera and mobile phones. Firstly the data considering 2 categories are trained to detect the labels by YOLO. Then the multiple deep learning including VGG ResNet Inception v4 and DenseNet are introduced to identify the different species of ZP HZB DZB OZB ZA and JZC. In order to assess the performance of CNNs compared with two traditional identification models including Support Vector Machines SVM and Back Propagation BP. The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN model have a better performance to identify different species of ZP and the highest identification accuracy is 99.35%. The present study is proved to be a useful strategy for the discrimination of different traditional Chinese medicines TCMs. Identification of different species of Zanthoxyli Pericarpium based on convolution neural network.
