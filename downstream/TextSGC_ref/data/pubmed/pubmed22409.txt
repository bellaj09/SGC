In the last few years the interest in applying virtual reality systems for neurorehabilitation is increasing. Their compatibility with neuroimaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS allows for the investigation of brain reorganization with multimodal stimulation and real-time control of the changes occurring in brain activity. The present study was aimed at testing a novel semi-immersive visuo-motor task VMT which has the features of being adopted in the field of neurorehabilitation of the upper limb motor function. A novel semi-immersive virtual reality visuo-motor task activates ventrolateral prefrontal cortex: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.
