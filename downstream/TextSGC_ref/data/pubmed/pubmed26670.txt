"Online Independent Component Analysis ICA algorithms have recently seen increasing development and application across a range of fields including communications biosignal processing and brain-computer interfaces. However prior work in this domain has primarily focused on algorithmic proofs of convergence with application limited to small `toy examples or to relatively low channel density EEG datasets. Furthermore there is limited availability of computationally efficient online ICA implementations suitable for real-time application. This study describes an optimized online recursive ICA algorithm ORICA with online recursive least squares RLS whitening for blind source separation of high-density EEG data. It is implemented as an online-capable plugin within the open-source BCILAB EEGLAB framework. We further derive and evaluate a block-update modification to the ORICA learning rule. We demonstrate the algorithms suitability for accurate and efficient source identification in high density 64-channel realistically-simulated EEG data as well as real 61-channel EEG data recorded by a dry and wearable EEG system in a cognitive experiment."
