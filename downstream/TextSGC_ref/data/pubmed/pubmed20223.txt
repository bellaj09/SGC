The paper proposes a novel method for an accurate and unobtrusive reconstruction of the upper-limb kinematics of stroke patients during robot-aided rehabilitation tasks with end-effector machines. The method is based on a robust analytic procedure for inverse kinematics that simply uses in addition to hand pose data provided by the robot upper arm acceleration measurements for computing a constraint on elbow position; it is exploited for task space augmentation. The proposed method can enable in-depth comprehension of planning strategy of stroke patients in the joint space and consequently allow developing therapies tailored for their residual motor capabilities. The experimental validation has a twofold purpose: 1 a comparative analysis with an optoelectronic motion capturing system is used to assess the method capability to reconstruct joint motion; 2 the application of the method to healthy and stroke subjects during circle-drawing tasks with InMotion2 robot is used to evaluate its efficacy in discriminating stroke from healthy behavior. The experimental results have shown that arm angles are reconstructed with a RMSE of 8.3  10-3 rad. Moreover the comparison between healthy and stroke subjects has revealed different features in the joint space in terms of mean values and standard deviations which also allow assessing inter- and intra-subject variability. The findings of this study contribute to the investigation of motor performance in the joint space and Cartesian space of stroke patients undergoing robot-aided therapy thus allowing: 1 evaluating the outcomes of the therapeutic approach 2 re-planning the robotic treatment based on patient needs and 3 understanding pathology-related motor strategies.
