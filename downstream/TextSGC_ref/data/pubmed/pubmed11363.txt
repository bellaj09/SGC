For people with Type 1 diabetes T1D forecasting of blood glucose BG can be used to effectively avoid hyperglycemia hypoglycemia and associated complications. The latest continuous glucose monitoring CGM technology allows people to observe glucose in real-time. However an accurate glucose forecast remains a challenge. In this work we introduce GluNet a framework that leverages on a personalized deep neural network to predict the probabilistic distribution of short-term 30-60 minutes future CGM measurements for subjects with T1D based on their historical data including glucose measurements meal information insulin doses and other factors. It adopts the latest deep learning techniques consisting of four components: data pre-processing label transform/recover multi-layers of dilated convolution neural network CNN and post-processing. The method is evaluated in-silico for both adult and adolescent subjects. The results show significant improvements over existing methods in the literature through a comprehensive comparison in terms of root mean square error RMSE Formula: see text mg/dL with short time lag Formula: see text minutes for prediction horizons PH = 30 mins minutes and RMSE Formula: see text mg/dL with time lag Formula: see text mins for PH = 60 mins for virtual adult subjects. In addition GluNet is also tested on two clinical data sets. Results show that it achieves an RMSE Formula: see text\xa0mg/dL with time lag Formula: see text mins for PH = 30 mins and an RMSE Formula: see text mg/dL with time lag Formula: see text\xa0mins for PH = 60 mins. These are the best reported results for glucose forecasting when compared with other methods including the neural network for predicting glucose NNPG the support vector regression SVR the latent variable with exogenous input LVX and the auto regression with exogenous input ARX algorithm.
