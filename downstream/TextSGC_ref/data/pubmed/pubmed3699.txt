The idea that musical training improves speech perception in challenging listening environments is appealing and of clinical importance yet the mechanisms of any such musician advantage are not well specified. Here using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI we found that musicians outperformed nonmusicians in identifying syllables at varying signal-to-noise ratios SNRs which was associated with stronger activation of the left inferior frontal and right auditory regions in musicians compared with nonmusicians. Moreover musicians showed greater specificity of phoneme representations in bilateral auditory and speech motor regions e.g. premotor cortex at higher SNRs and in the left speech motor regions at lower SNRs as determined by multivoxel pattern analysis. Musical training also enhanced the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric functional connectivity between auditory and speech motor regions. Our findings suggest that improved speech in noise perception in musicians relies on stronger recruitment of finer phonological representations in and stronger functional connectivity between auditory and frontal speech motor cortices in both hemispheres regions involved in bottom-up spectrotemporal analyses and top-down articulatory prediction and sensorimotor integration respectively. Musical training sharpens and bonds ears and tongue to hear speech better.
