Autism spectrum disorder ASD is associated with disrupted brain networks. Neuroimaging techniques provide noninvasive methods of investigating abnormal connectivity patterns in ASD. In the present study we compare functional connectivity networks in people with ASD with those in typical controls using neuroimaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE project. Specifically we focus on the characteristics of intrinsic functional connectivity based on data collected by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI. Our aim was to identify disrupted brain connectivity patterns across all networks instead of in individual edges by using advanced statistical methods. Unlike many brain connectome studies in which networks are prespecified before the edge connectivity in each network is compared between clinical groups we detected the latent differentially expressed networks automatically. Our network-level analysis identified abnormal connectome networks that i included a high proportion of edges that were differentially expressed between people with ASD and typical controls; and ii showed highly-organized graph topology. These findings provide new insight into the study of the underlying neuropsychiatric mechanism of ASD. Latent and Abnormal Functional Connectivity Circuits in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
