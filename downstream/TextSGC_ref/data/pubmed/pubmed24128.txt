Neuroimaging techniques to measure the function and biochemistry of the human brain such as positron emission tomography PET proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1H MRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI are powerful tools for assessing neurobiological mechanisms underlying the response to treatments in substance use disorders. Here we review the neuroimaging literature on pharmacological and behavioral treatment in substance use disorder. We focus on neural effects of medications that reduce craving e.g. naltrexone bupropion hydrochloride baclofen methadone varenicline and that improve cognitive control e.g. modafinil N-acetylcysteine of behavioral treatments for substance use disorders e.g. cognitive bias modification training virtual reality motivational interventions and neuromodulatory interventions such as neurofeedback and transcranial magnetic stimulation. A consistent finding for the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions identifies the improvement of executive control networks and the dampening of limbic activation highlighting their values as targets for therapeutic interventions in substance use disorders.
