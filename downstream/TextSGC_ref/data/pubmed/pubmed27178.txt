The performance of steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs has been drastically improved in the past few years. In conventional SSVEP-based BCIs the speed of a selection is fixed towards high performance based on preliminary offline analysis. However due to inter-trial variability the optimal selection time to achieve sufficient accuracy is different for each trial. To optimize the performance of SSVEP-based BCIs this study proposed a dynamic stopping method that can adaptively determine a selection time in each trial by applying a threshold to the probability of detecting a target. A 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Compared to the conventional method with a fixed selection time towards the highest accuracy the proposed method could significantly reduce the averaged selection time 0.840.39 s vs. 1.440.63 s p<;0.05 with comparable accuracy 99.441.57 % vs. 99.551.22 %. As a result the simulated online information transfer rate ITR with the dynamic stopping method achieved a significant improvement compared to the conventional method 125.3021.55 bits/min vs. 92.7523.77 bits/min. These results suggest that the proposed dynamic stopping method is effective for improving the performance of SSVEP-based BCI systems.
