"Alzheimers disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that initially presents with memory loss in the presence of underlying neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque pathology. This period offers an early window for detecting subtle cognitive impairment prior to progressive decline and dementia. We recently developed the Visuospatial Memory Eye-Tracking Test VisMET a passive task capable of predicting cognitive impairment in AD in under five minutes. Here we describe the development of a mobile version of VisMET to enable efficient and widespread administration of the task." Deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning for measuring cognitive impairment using eye-tracking in a distributed tablet-based environment.
