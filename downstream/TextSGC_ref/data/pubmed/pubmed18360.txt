FES certification is required to sit for the ABS Qualifying Exam. Previous work demonstrated a 40% FES pass rate for residents with standard clinical endoscopy training. After implementing a proficiency-based simulation curriculum our FES pass rate increased to 87%. The purpose of this study was to monitor the success of our curriculum in its second year. We also hypothesized that residents who took the FES exam within 30\xa0days of their clinical endoscopy rotation would have superior pass rates to residents who waited longer.
