The ability to predict tandem mass MS/MS spectra from peptide sequences can significantly enhance our understanding of the peptide fragmentation process and could improve peptide identification in proteomics. However current approaches for predicting high-energy collisional dissociation HCD spectra are limited to predict the intensities of expected ion types that is the a/b/c/x/y/z ions and their neutral loss derivatives referred to as backbone ions. In practice backbone ions only account for <70% of total ion intensities in HCD spectra indicating many intense ions are ignored by current predictors. In this paper we present a deep learning approach that can predict the complete spectra both backbone and nonbackbone ions directly from peptide sequences. We made no assumptions or expectations on which kind of ions to predict but instead predicting the intensities for all possible m/z. Training this model needs no annotations of fragment ion nor any prior knowledge of the fragmentation rules. Our analyses show that the predicted 2+ and 3+ HCD spectra are highly similar to the experimental spectra with average full-spectrum cosine similarities of 0.820 0.088 and 0.786 0.085 respectively very close to the similarities between the experimental replicated spectra. In contrast the best-performed backbone only models can only achieve an average similarity below 0.75 and 0.70 for 2+ and 3+ spectra respectively. Furthermore we developed a multitask learning MTL approach for predicting spectra of insufficient training samples which allows our model to make accurate predictions for electron transfer dissociation ETD spectra and HCD spectra of less abundant charges 1+ and 4+.
