Functional brain mapping via cortical microstimulation is a widely used clinical and experimental tool. However data are traditionally collected point by point making the technique very time consuming. Moreover even in skilled hands consistent penetration depths are difficult to achieve. Finally the effects of microstimulation are assessed behaviorally with no attempt to capture the activity of the local cortical circuits being stimulated. Microelectrode array stimulation combined with intrinsic optical imaging: A novel tool for functional brain mapping.
