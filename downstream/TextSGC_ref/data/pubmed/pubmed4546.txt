Communication between brain regions is still insufficiently understood. Applying concepts from network science has shown to be successful in gaining insight in the functioning of the brain. Recent work has implicated that especially shortest paths in the structural brain network seem to play a major role in the communication within the brain. So far for the functional brain network only the average length of the shortest paths has been analyzed. In this article we propose to construct the union of shortest path trees USPT as a new topology for the functional brain network. The minimum spanning tree which has been successful in a lot of recent studies to comprise important features of the functional brain network is always included in the USPT. After interpreting the link weights of the functional brain network as communication probabilities the USPT of this network can be uniquely defined. Using data from magnetoencephalography we applied the USPT as a method to find differences in the network topology of multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls. The new concept of the USPT of the functional brain network also allows interesting interpretations and may represent the highways of the brain.
