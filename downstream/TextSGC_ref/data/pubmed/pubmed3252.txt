The experience of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia is associated with changes in brain network function. In particular studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging rtfMRI can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity. Neurofeedback of core language network nodes modulates connectivity with the default-mode network: A double-blind fMRI neurofeedback study on auditory verbal hallucinations.
