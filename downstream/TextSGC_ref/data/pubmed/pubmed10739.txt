Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment RRD is a serious condition that can lead to blindness; however it is highly treatable with timely and appropriate treatment. Thus early diagnosis and treatment of RRD is crucial. In this study we applied deep learning a machine-learning technology to detect RRD using ultra-wide-field fundus images and investigated its performance. In total 411 images 329 for training and 82 for grading from 407 RRD patients and 420 images 336 for training and 84 for grading from 238 non-RRD patients were used in this study. The deep learning model demonstrated a high sensitivity of 97.6% 95% confidence interval CI 94.2-100% and a high specificity of 96.5% 95% CI 90.2-100% and the area under the curve was 0.988 95% CI 0.981-0.995. This model can improve medical care in remote areas where eye clinics are not available by using ultra-wide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy for the accurate diagnosis of RRD. Early diagnosis of RRD can prevent blindness. Accuracy of deep learning a machine-learning technology using ultra-wide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy for detecting rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
