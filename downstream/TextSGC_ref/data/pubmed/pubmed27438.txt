Neural oscillations originate predominantly from interacting cortical neurons and consequently reflect aspects of cortical information processing. However their functional role is not yet fully understood and their interpretation is debatable. Amplitude modulations AMs in alpha 8-12 Hz beta 13-30 Hz and high gamma 70-150 Hz band in invasive electrocorticogram ECoG and non-invasive electroencephalogram EEG signals change with behavior. Alpha and beta band AMs are typically suppressed desynchronized during motor behavior while high gamma AMs highly correlate with the behavior. These two phenomena are successfully used for functional brain mapping and brain-computer interface BCI applications. Recent research found movement-phase related AMs MPA also in high beta/low gamma 24-40 Hz EEG rhythms. These MPAs were found by separating the suppressed AMs into sustained and dynamic components. Sustained AM components are those with frequencies that are lower than the motor behavior. Dynamic components those with frequencies higher than the behavior. In this paper we study ECoG beta/low gamma band 12-30 Hz/30-42 Hz AM during repetitive finger movements addressing the question whether or not MPAs can be found in ECoG beta band. Indeed MPA in the 12-18 Hz and 18-24 Hz band were found. This additional information may lead to further improvements in ECoG-based prediction and reconstruction of motor behavior by combining high gamma AM and beta band MPA.
