Motor abnormalities are frequently observed in schizophrenia and structural alterations of the motor system have been reported. The association of aberrant motor network function however has not been tested. We hypothesized that abnormal functional connectivity would be related to the degree of motor abnormalities in schizophrenia. In 90 subjects 46 patients we obtained resting stated functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI for 8 minutes 40 seconds at 3T. Participants further completed a motor battery on the scanning day. Regions of interest ROI were cortical motor areas basal ganglia thalamus and motor cerebellum. We computed ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity. Principal component analyses of motor behavioral data produced 4 factors primary motor catatonia and dyskinesia coordination and spontaneous motor activity. Motor factors were correlated with connectivity values. Schizophrenia was characterized by hyperconnectivity in 3 main areas: motor cortices to thalamus motor cortices to cerebellum and prefrontal cortex to the subthalamic nucleus. In patients thalamocortical hyperconnectivity was linked to catatonia and dyskinesia whereas aberrant connectivity between rostral anterior cingulate and caudate was linked to the primary motor factor. Likewise connectivity between motor cortex and cerebellum correlated with spontaneous motor activity. Therefore altered functional connectivity suggests a specific intrinsic and tonic neural abnormality in the motor system in schizophrenia. Furthermore altered neural activity at rest was linked to motor abnormalities on the behavioral level. Thus aberrant resting state connectivity may indicate a system out of balance which produces characteristic behavioral alterations. Aberrant Hyperconnectivity in the Motor System at Rest Is Linked to Motor Abnormalities in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders.
