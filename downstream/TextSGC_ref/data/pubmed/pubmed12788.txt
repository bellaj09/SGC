Venous thromboembolism VTE prophylaxis also known as thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism and associated complications including death in high-risk patients. VTE prophylaxis is recommended for acutely ill hospitalized medical patients at risk of thrombosis. Anticoagulants the pharmacologic agents of choice to prevent VTE are considered high-alert medications. By definition therefore anticoagulants bear a hightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. As part of ongoing collaboration with a provincial death investigation service ISMP Canada received a report of a fatal incident that involved continuation of VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin for a patient discharge to a long-term care LTC facility from an acute care setting. The findings and recommendations from this case are charged to highlight the need to build routine reassessment of VTE prophylaxis into the process for discharging patients from the acute care setting and upon transfer to another facility or to primary care. Death Associated with Inadequate Reassessment of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis at and after Hospital Discharge.
