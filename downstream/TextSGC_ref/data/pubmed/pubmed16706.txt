Convolutional Neural Networks can be effectively used only when data are endowed with an intrinsic concept of neighbourhood in the input space as is the case of pixels in images. We introduce here Ph-CNN a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of metagenomics data based on the Convolutional Neural Networks with the patristic distance defined on the phylogenetic tree being used as the proximity measure. The patristic distance between variables is used together with a sparsified version of MultiDimensional Scaling to embed the phylogenetic tree in a Euclidean space. Phylogenetic convolutional neural networks in metagenomics.
