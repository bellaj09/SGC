Early diagnosis of skin cancer lesions by dermoscopy the gold standard in dermatological imaging calls for a diagnostic upscale. The aim of the study was to improve the accuracy of dermoscopic skin cancer diagnosis through use of novel deep learning DL algorithms. An additional sonification-derived diagnostic layer was added to the visual classification to increase sensitivity. Dermoscopy diagnosis of cancerous lesions utilizing dual deep learning algorithms via visual and audio sonification outputs: Laboratory and prospective observational studies.
