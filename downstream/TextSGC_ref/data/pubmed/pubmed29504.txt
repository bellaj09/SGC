People who suffer from paralysis have difficulties participating in society. Particularly burdensome is the locked-in syndrome LIS. LIS patients are not able to move and speak but are cognitively healthy. They rely on assistive technology to interact with the world and may benefit from neurotechnological advances. Optimal research and design of such aids requires a well-defined target population. However the LIS population is poorly characterized and the number of patients in this condition is unknown.
