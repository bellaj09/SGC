Augmented reality AR enables the superimposition of virtual reality reconstructions onto clinical images of a real patient in real time. This allows visualization of internal structures through overlying tissues thereby providing a virtual transparency vision of surgical anatomy. AR has been applied to neurosurgery which utilizes a relatively fixed space frames and bony references; the application of AR facilitates the relationship between virtual and real data. Augmented breast imaging ABI is described. Breast MRI studies for breast implant patients with seroma were performed using a Siemens 3T system with a body coil and a four-channel bilateral phased-array breast coil as the transmitter and receiver respectively. Gadolinium was injected as a contrast agent 0.1 mmol/kg at 2 mL/s using a programmable power injector. Dicom formatted images data from 10 MRI cases of breast implant seroma and 10 MRI cases with T1-2 N0 M0 breast cancer were imported and transformed into augmented reality images. ABI demonstrated stereoscopic depth perception focal point convergence 3D cursor use and joystick fly-through. ABI can improve clinical outcomes providing an enhanced view of the structures to work on. It should be further studied to determine its utility in clinical practice.
