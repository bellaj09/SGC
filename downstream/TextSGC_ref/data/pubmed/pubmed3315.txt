Speed with which brain performs information processing influences overall cognition and is dependent on the white matter fibers. To understand genetic influences on processing speed and white matter FA we assessed processing speed and diffusion imaging fractional anisotropy FA in related individuals from two populations. Discovery analyses were performed in 146 individuals from large Old Order Amish OOA families and findings were replicated in 485 twins and siblings of the Human Connectome Project HCP. The heritability of processing speed was h2=43% and 49% both p<0.005 while the heritability of whole brain FA was h2=87% and 88% both p<0.001 in the OOA and HCP respectively. Whole brain FA was significantly correlated with processing speed in the two cohorts. Quantitative genetic analysis demonstrated a significant degree to which common genes influenced joint variation in FA and brain processing speed. These estimates suggested common sets of genes influencing variation in both phenotypes consistent with the idea that common genetic variations contributing to white matter may also support their associated cognitive behavior.
