This work deals with Natural Language Processing applied to the clinical domain. Specifically the work deals with a Medical Entity Recognition MER on Electronic Health Records EHRs. Developing a MER system entailed heavy data preprocessing and feature engineering until Deep Neural Networks DNNs emerged. However the quality of the word representations in terms of embedded layers is still an important issue for the inference of the DNNs. Measuring the effect of different types of unsupervised word representations on Medical Named Entity Recognition.
