In the present study we developed a methamphetamine METH-related virtual social environment to elicit subjective craving and physiological reactivity. Sixty-one male patients who were abstinent from METH use and 45 age-matched healthy males i.e. normal controls were recruited. The physiological electrocardiogram ECG signals were recorded before resting-state condition and during viewing of a METH-cue video in the virtual environment cue-induced condition. The cue-induced subjective craving was measured with a visual analogue scale VAS for patients with METH dependence. The results indicated that the cue-induced condition elicited significant differences in heart rate variability HRV between patients with METH dependence and normal controls. The changes of HRV indexes on time domain and non-linear domain from the resting-state condition to the cue-induced condition were positively correlated with the score on VAS of METH craving. Using a supervised machine learning algorithm with the features extracted from HRV changes our results showed that the discriminant model provided a high predictive power for distinguishing patients with METH dependence from normal controls. Our findings support that immersing subjects with METH dependence in a METH-related virtual social environment can successfully induce physiological reactivity and cue-induced physiological signal changes may have a potential implication in clinical practice.
