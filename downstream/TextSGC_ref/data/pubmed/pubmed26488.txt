For the further development of the fields of telemedicine neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces advances in hybrid multimodal signal acquisition and processing technology are invaluable. Currently there are no commonly available hybrid devices combining bioelectrical and biooptical neurophysiological measurements here electroencephalography EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS. Our objective was to design such an instrument in a miniaturized customizable and wireless form.
