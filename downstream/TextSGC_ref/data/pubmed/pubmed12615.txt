Deep learning is an effective method to capture drug-target binding affinity but low accuracy is still an obstacle to be overcome. Thus we propose a novel predictor for drug-target binding affinity based on dipeptide frequency of word frequency encoding and a hybrid graph convolutional network. Word frequency characteristics of natural language are used to improve the frequency characteristics of peptides to express target proteins. For each drug molecules the five different features of drug atoms and the atomic bond relationships are expressed as graphs. The obtained protein features and graph structure are used as the input of convolution neural network and the input of graph convolution neural network respectively. A prediction model is established to predict the drug affinity by calculating the hidden relationship. In the KIBA data set test experiment the consistency coefficient of the model is 0.901 which is 0.01 higher than the existing model and the MSE mean square error of the model is 0.126 which is 5% lower than the existing model. In Davis data set test experiment the consistency coefficient of the model is 0.895 which is 0.006 higher than the existing model and the MSE of the model is 0.220 which is 4% lower than the existing model. These results show that our proposed method can not only predict the affinity better than those existing models but also outperform unitary deep learning approaches.
