Brain-computer interface BCI systems have emerged as an augmentative technology that can provide a promising solution for individuals with motor dysfunctions and for the elderly who are experiencing muscle weakness. Steady-state visually evoked potentials SSVEPs are widely adopted in BCI systems due to their high speed and accuracy when compared to other BCI paradigms. In this paper we apply combined magnitude and phase features for class discrimination in a real-time SSVEP-based BCI platform. In the proposed real-time system users gain control of a motorised bed system with seven motion commands and an idle state. Experimental results amongst eight participants demonstrate that the proposed real-time BCI system can successfully discriminate between different SSVEP signals achieving high information transfer rates ITR of 82.73 bits/min. The attractive features of the proposed system include noninvasive recording simple electrode configuration excellent BCI response and minimal training requirements.
