Deep learning DL has been widely used to solve problems with success in speech recognition visual object recognition and object detection for drug discovery and genomics. Natural language processing has achieved noticeable progress in artificial intelligence. This gives an opportunity to improve on the accuracy and human-computer interaction of clinical informatics. However due to difference of vocabularies and context between a clinical environment and generic English transplanting language models directly from up-to-date methods to real-world health care settings is not always satisfactory. Moreover the legal restriction on using privacy-sensitive patient records hinders the progress in applying machine learning ML to clinical language processing. Adapting State-of-the-Art Deep Language Models to Clinical Information Extraction Systems: Potentials Challenges and Solutions.
