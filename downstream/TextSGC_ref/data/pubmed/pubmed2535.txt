"Quasiperiodic patterns QPPs as reported by Majeed et\xa0al. 2011 are prominent features of the brains intrinsic activity that involve important large-scale networks default mode DMN; task positive TPN and are likely to be major contributors to widely used measures of functional connectivity. We examined the variability of these patterns in 470 individuals from the Human Connectome Project resting state functional MRI dataset. The QPPs from individuals can be coarsely categorized into two types: one where strong anti-correlation between the DMN and TPN is present and another where most areas are strongly correlated. QPP type could be predicted by an individuals global signal with lower global signal corresponding to QPPs with strong anti-correlation. After regression of global signal all QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN. QPP occurrence and type was similar between a subgroup of individuals with extremely low motion and the rest of the sample which shows that motion is not a major contributor to the QPPs. After regression of estimates of slow respiratory and cardiac induced signal fluctuations more QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN an indication that while physiological noise influences the QPP type it is not the primary source of the QPP itself. QPPs were more similar for the same subjects scanned on different days than for different subjects. These results provide the first assessment of the variability in individual QPPs and their relationship to physiological parameters."
