Genome-wide association studies GWASs indicate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CACNA1C and ANK3 genes increase the risk for bipolar disorder BD. The genes influence neuronal firing by modulating calcium and sodium channel functions respectively. Both genes modulate -aminobutyric acid-transmitting interneuron function and can thus affect brain regional activation and interregional connectivity. Independent modulation of engagement and connectivity of the facial network during affect processing by CACNA1C and ANK3 risk genes for bipolar disorder.
