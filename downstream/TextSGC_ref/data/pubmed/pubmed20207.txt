"Most existing locomotion devices that represent the sensation of walking target a user who is actually performing a walking motion. Here we attempted to represent the walking sensation especially a kinesthetic sensation and advancing feeling the sense of moving forward while the user remains seated. To represent the walking sensation using a relatively simple device we focused on the force rendering and its evaluation of the longitudinal friction force applied on the sole during walking. Based on the measurement of the friction force applied on the sole during actual walking we developed a novel friction force display that can present the friction force without the influence of body weight. Using performance evaluation testing we found that the proposed method can stably and rapidly display friction force. Also we developed a virtual reality VR walk-through system that is able to present the friction force through the proposed device according to the avatars walking motion in a virtual world. By evaluating the realism we found that the proposed device can represent a more realistic advancing feeling than vibration feedback."
