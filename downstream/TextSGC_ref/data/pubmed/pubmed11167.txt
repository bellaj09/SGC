Major depressive disorder MDD is a multifactorial disease which often coexists with cognitive deficits. Depression-induced cognitive deficits are known to be associated with aberrant reward processing neurochemical and structural alterations. Recent studies have shown that chronic electrical stimulation of brain reward areas induces a robust antidepressant effect. However the effects of repeated electrical self-stimulation of lateral hypothalamus - medial forebrain bundle LH-MFB on depression-induced cognitive deficits and associated neurochemical and structural alterations in the prefrontal cortex PFC are unknown. Chronic brain stimulation rewarding experience ameliorates depression-induced cognitive deficits and restores aberrant plasticity in the prefrontal cortex.
