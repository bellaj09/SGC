"Owing to improvements in image recognition via deep learning machine-learning algorithms could eventually be applied to automated medical diagnoses that can guide clinical decision-making. However these algorithms remain a black box in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also high-performance deep learning requires large high-quality training datasets. Here we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage ICH and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95% and 196 cases sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95%. The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice."
