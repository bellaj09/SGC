Analysis of brain connectivity has become an important research tool in neuroscience. Connectivity can be estimated between cortical sources reconstructed from the electroencephalogram EEG. Such analysis often relies on trial averaging to obtain reliable results. However some applications such as brain-computer interfaces BCIs require single-trial estimation methods. In this paper we present SCoT-a source connectivity toolbox for Python. This toolbox implements routines for blind source decomposition and connectivity estimation with the MVARICA approach. Additionally a novel extension called CSPVARICA is available for labeled data. SCoT estimates connectivity from various spectral measures relying on vector autoregressive VAR models. Optionally these VAR models can be regularized to facilitate ill posed applications such as single-trial fitting. We demonstrate basic usage of SCoT on motor imagery MI data. Furthermore we show simulation results of utilizing SCoT for feature extraction in a BCI application. These results indicate that CSPVARICA and correct regularization can significantly improve MI classification. While SCoT was mainly designed for application in BCIs it contains useful tools for other areas of neuroscience. SCoT is a software package that 1 brings combined source decomposition and connectivtiy estimation to the open Python platform and 2 offers tools for single-trial connectivity estimation.
