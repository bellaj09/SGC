Neurorehabilitation techniques using virtual reality VR systems have recently become widespread as a rehabilitation method for restoring phantom limb movement and alleviating phantom limb pain PLP. However analgesic effects have varied between studies possibly because of differences in the characteristics of PLP between patients e.g. cramping burning shooting. We aimed to reveal the relationship between VR effects and PLP characteristics using an exploratory factor analysis. Characteristics of Phantom Limb Pain Alleviated with Virtual Reality Rehabilitation.
