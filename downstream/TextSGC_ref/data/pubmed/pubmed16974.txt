This paper presents a machine learning based approach for analyses of photos collected from laboratory experiments conducted to assess the potential impact of water-based drill cuttings on deep-water rhodolith-forming calcareous algae. This pilot study uses imaging technology to quantify and monitor the stress levels of the calcareous algae Mesophyllum engelhartii Foslie Adey caused by various degrees of light exposure flow intensity and amount of sediment. A machine learning based algorithm was applied to assess the temporal variation of the calcareous algae size  mass and color automatically. Measured size and color were correlated to the photosynthetic efficiency maximum quantum yield of charge separation in photosystem II Formula: see text and degree of sediment coverage using multivariate regression. The multivariate regression showed correlations between time and calcareous algae sizes as well as correlations between fluorescence and calcareous algae colors.
