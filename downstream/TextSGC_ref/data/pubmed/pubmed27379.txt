A hybrid brain-computer interface BCI is a device combined with at least one other communication system that takes advantage of both parts to build a link between humans and machines. To increase the number of targets and the information transfer rate ITR electromyogram EMG and steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP were combined to implement a hybrid BCI. A multi-choice selection method based on EMG was developed to enhance the system performance. An online hybrid BCI system based on SSVEP and EMG.
