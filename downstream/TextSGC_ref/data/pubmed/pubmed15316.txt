Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a leading image modality for the assessment of musculoskeletal MSK injuries and disorders. A significant drawback however is the lengthy data acquisition. This issue has motivated the development of methods to improve the speed of MRI. The field of artificial intelligence AI for accelerated MRI although in its infancy has seen tremendous progress over the past 3 years. Promising approaches include deep learning methods for reconstructing undersampled MRI data and generating high-resolution from low-resolution data. Preliminary studies show the promise of the variational network a state-of-the-art technique to generalize to many different anatomical regions and achieve comparable diagnostic accuracy as conventional methods. This article discusses the state-of-the-art methods considerations for clinical applicability followed by future perspectives for the field. Improving the Speed of MRI with Artificial Intelligence.
