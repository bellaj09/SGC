We present a learning-based approach to reconstructing high-resolution three-dimensional 3D shapes with detailed geometry and high-fidelity textures. Albeit extensively studied algorithms for 3D reconstruction from multi-view depth-and-color RGB-D scans are still prone to measurement noise and occlusions; limited scanning or capturing angles also often lead to incomplete reconstructions. Propelled by recent advances in 3D deep learning techniques in this paper we introduce a novel computation and memory efficient cascaded 3D convolutional network architecture which learns to reconstruct implicit surface representations as well as the corresponding color information from noisy and imperfect RGB-D maps. The proposed 3D neural network performs reconstruction in a progressive and coarse-to-fine manner achieving unprecedented output resolution and fidelity. Meanwhile an algorithm for end-to-end training of the proposed cascaded structure is developed. We further introduce Human10 a newly created dataset containing both detailed and textured full body reconstructions as well as corresponding raw RGB-D scans of 10 subjects. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in terms of visual quality and accuracy of reconstructed models.
