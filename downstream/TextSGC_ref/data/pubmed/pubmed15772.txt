Advanced robotic surgery was first introduced into urology in 2000. The first studies showed the feasibility and safety of the daVinci Intuitive Surgical Inc. Sunnyvale CA telemanipulator assistance in radical prostatectomy pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and radical cystectomy and neobladder formation. The miniature endowristed tools offer a potential advantage over standard laparoscopy in the accuracy of preparation and suturing. Other features are a three-dimensional vision system and unimpaired hand-eye coordination. Complex laparoscopic tasks are learned faster by using the robot which may also explain the shorter training required for radical prostatectomy than for manual laparoscopy. This new and expensive technology has spread rapidly over the last 4 years. By 2004 approximately 10% of radical prostatectomies in the USA will be robot-assisted. Data on the functional and oncological outcomes are accruing but not yet conclusive. There will be a further spread of robotic surgery routine telesurgery smaller and more affordable systems the introduction of virtual reality all developments which have the potential to urological surgeons to improve. Robotic surgery in urology: fact or fantasy?
