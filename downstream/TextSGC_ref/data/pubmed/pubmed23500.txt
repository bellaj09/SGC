"MicroRNAs miRNAs regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional level by triggering RNA interference. In such a sense aberrant expressions of miRNAs play critical roles in the pathogenesis of many disorders including Parkinsons disease PD. Controlling the level of specific miRNAs in the brain is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection. A fundamental need for miRNA regulation either replacing or inhibition is a carrier capable of delivering oligonucleotides into brain cells. This study aimed to examine a polymeric magnetic particle Neuromag for delivery of synthetic miRNA inhibitors in the rat central nervous system. We injected the miRNA inhibitor complexed with Neuromag into the lateral ventricles next to the striatum by stereotaxic surgery. Neuromag efficiently delivered oligonucleotides in the striatum and septum areas as shown by microscopy imaging of fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC-labeled oligos in astrocytes and neurons. Transfected oligos showed efficacy concerning miRNA inhibition. Neuromag-structured miR-134 antimiR 0.36 nmol caused a significant 0.35 fold decrease of striatal miR-134 as revealed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction RT-qPCR. In conclusion the polymeric magnetic particle Neuromag efficiently delivered functional miRNA inhibitors in brain regions surrounding lateral ventricles particularly the striatum. This delivery system holds potential as a promising miRNA-based disease-modifying drug and merits further pre-clinical studies using animal models of PD."
