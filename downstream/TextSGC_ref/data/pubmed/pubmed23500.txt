Virtual reality and cadaveric simulations are expensive and not readily accessible1. Innovative and accessible training adjuncts are required to help meet training needs. Cognitive task analysis CTA has been used extensively to train pilots and surgeons in other surgical specialties2-6. However the use of CTA tools within orthopaedics is in its infancy. Arthroscopic procedures are minimally invasive and require a different skill set compared with open surgery. Residents often feel poorly prepared to perform this in the operating room because of the steep learning curve associated with acquiring basic arthroscopic skills. We designed the Imperial Knee Arthroscopy Cognitive Task Analysis IKACTA tool which is to our knowledge the first CTA tool described in the orthopaedic literature demonstrating significant objective benefits in training novices to perform diagnostic knee arthroscopy.
