Disruptions in fear-extinction learning are centrally implicated in a range of stress-related disorders including anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. Given that these disorders frequently begin in childhood/adolescence an understanding of fear-extinction learning in children is essential for 1 detecting the source of developmental susceptibility 2 identifying mechanisms leading to pathology and 3 informing the development and/or more judicious application of treatments for youth. Here we offer and validate a novel virtual reality paradigm to study threat-related learning\xa0and extinction in children that models real-world cues environments and fear-inducing events that children are likely to experience and are linked to the development of fear- and stress-related pathologies. We found that our paradigm is well tolerated in children as young as 6 years that children show intact fear and extinction learning and show evidence of divergence in subjective physiological and behavioral measures of conditioned fear. The paradigm is available for use in 3-D and in 2-D e.g. for the MRI scanner upon request at www.tnp2lab.org .
