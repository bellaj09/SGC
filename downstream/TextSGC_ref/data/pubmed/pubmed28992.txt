With the advent of sophisticated prosthetic limbs the challenge is now to develop and demonstrate optimal closed-loop control of the these limbs using neural measurements from single/multiple unit activity SUA/MUA electrocorticography ECoG local field potentials LFP scalp electroencephalography EEG or even electromyography EMG after targeted muscle reinnervation TMR in subjects with upper limb disarticulation. In this paper we propose design principles for developing a noninvasive EEG-based brain-machine interface BMI for dexterous control of a high degree-of-freedom biologically realistic limb. Design principles for noninvasive brain-machine interfaces.
