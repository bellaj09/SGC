We investigate the use of deep neural networks DNNs for suppressing off-axis scattering in ultrasound channel data. Our implementation operates in the frequency domain via the short-time Fourier transform. The inputs to the DNN consisted of the separated real and imaginary components i.e. in-phase and quadrature components observed across the aperture of the array at a single frequency and for a single depth. Different networks were trained for different frequencies. The output had the same structure as the input and the real and imaginary components were combined as complex data before an inverse short-time Fourier transform was used to reconstruct channel data. Using simulation physical phantom experiment and in vivo scans from a human liver we compared this DNN approach to standard delay-and-sum DAS beamforming and an adaptive imaging technique that uses the coherence factor. For a simulated point target the side lobes when using the DNN approach were about 60 dB below those of standard DAS. For a simulated anechoic cyst the DNN approach improved contrast ratio CR and contrast-to-noise CNR ratio by 8.8 dB and 0.3 dB respectively compared with DAS. For an anechoic cyst in a physical phantom the DNN approach improved CR and CNR by 17.1 dB and 0.7 dB respectively. For two in vivo scans the DNN approach improved CR and CNR by 13.8 dB and 9.7 dB respectively. We also explored methods for examining how the networks in this paper function.
