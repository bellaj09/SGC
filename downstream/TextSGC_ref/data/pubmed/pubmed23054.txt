The main difficulties of transpedicular corpectomies are lack of space for vertebral body replacement in the neighborhood of critical structures the necessity for sacrifice of nerve roots in the thoracic spine. and the extent of hemorrhage due to venous epidural bleeding. We present a modified technique of transpedicular corpectomy by using an endoscopic-assisted microsurgical technique performed through a single posterior approach. A 3-dimensional 3D preoperative reconstruction could be helpful in the planning for this complex anatomic region. A Modified Microsurgical Endoscopic-Assisted Transpedicular Corpectomy of the Thoracic Spine Based on Virtual 3-Dimensional Planning.
