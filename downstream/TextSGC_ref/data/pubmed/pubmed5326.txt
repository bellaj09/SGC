Alterations in circuits involving the amygdala have been repeatedly implicated in schizophrenia neuropathology given their role in stress affective salience processing and psychosis onset. Disturbances in amygdala whole-brain functional connectivity associated with schizophrenia have yet to be fully characterized despite their importance in psychosis. Moreover it remains unknown if there are functional alterations in amygdala circuits across illness phases. To evaluate this possibility we compared whole-brain amygdala connectivity in healthy comparison subjects HCS individuals at high risk HR for schizophrenia individuals in the early course of schizophrenia EC-SCZ and patients with chronic schizophrenia C-SCZ. We computed whole-brain resting-state connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T via anatomically defined individual-specific amygdala seeds. We identified significant alterations in amygdala connectivity with orbitofrontal cortex OFC driven by reductions in EC-SCZ and C-SCZ effect sizes of 1.0 and 0.97 respectively but not in HR for schizophrenia relative to HCS. Reduced amygdala-OFC coupling was associated with schizophrenia symptom severity r = .32 P < .015. Conversely we identified a robust increase in amygdala connectivity with a brainstem region around noradrenergic arousal nuclei particularly for HR individuals relative to HCS effect size = 1.54 but not as prominently for other clinical groups. These results suggest that deficits in amygdala-OFC coupling could emerge during the initial episode of schizophrenia EC-SCZ and may present as an enduring feature of the illness C-SCZ in association with symptom severity but are not present in individuals with elevated risk for developing schizophrenia. Instead in HR individuals there appears to be increased connectivity in a circuit implicated in stress response. Amygdala connectivity differs among chronic early course and individuals at risk for developing schizophrenia.
