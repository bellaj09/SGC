An increasing number of neuroscientific studies gain insights by focusing on differences in functional connectivity-between groups individuals temporal windows or task conditions. We found using simulations that additional insights into such differences can be gained by forgoing variance normalization a procedure used by most functional connectivity measures. Simulations indicated that these functional connectivity measures are sensitive to increases in independent fluctuations unshared signal in time series consistently reducing functional connectivity estimates e.g. correlations even though such changes are unrelated to corresponding fluctuations shared signal between those time series. This is inconsistent with the common notion of functional connectivity as the amount of inter-region interaction. Functional connectivity change as shared signal dynamics.
