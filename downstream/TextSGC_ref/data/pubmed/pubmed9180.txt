This paper presents a method for exploring structural risk of any artificial intelligence-based method in bioinformatics the A-Test method. This method provides a way to not only quantitate the structural risk associated with a classification method but provides a graphical representation to compare the learning capacity of different classification methods. Two different methods Deep Time Growing Neural Network DTGNN and Hidden Markov Model HMM are selected as two classification methods for comparison. Time series of heart sound signals are employed as the case study where the classifiers are trained to learn the disease-related changes. Results showed that the DTGNN offers a superior performance both in terms of the capacity and the structural risk. The A-Test method can be especially employed in comparing the learning methods with small data size.
