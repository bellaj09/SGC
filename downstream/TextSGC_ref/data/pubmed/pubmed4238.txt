The dataset enables exploration of higher-order cognitive faculties self-generated mental experience and personality features in relation to the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. We provide multimodal magnetic resonance imaging MRI data and a broad set of state and trait phenotypic assessments: mind-wandering personality traits and cognitive abilities. Specifically 194 healthy participants between 20 and 75 years of age filled out 31 questionnaires performed 7 tasks and reported 4 probes of in-scanner mind-wandering. The scanning session included four 15.5-min resting-state functional MRI runs using a multiband EPI sequence and a hig h-resolution structural scan using a 3D MP2RAGE sequence. This dataset constitutes one part of the MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body database. A functional connectome phenotyping dataset including cognitive state and personality measures.
