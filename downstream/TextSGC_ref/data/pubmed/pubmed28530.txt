The continuing miniaturization of digital circuits and the development of low power radio systems coupled with continuing studies into the neurophysiology and dynamics of insect flight are enabling a new class of implantable interfaces capable of controlling insects in free flight for extended periods. We provide context for these developments review the state-of-the-art and discuss future directions in this field. Recent developments in the remote radio control of insect flight.
