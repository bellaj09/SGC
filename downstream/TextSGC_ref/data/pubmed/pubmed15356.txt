Diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is a vital prognostic marker in chronic liver diseases. Due to the inaccuracies and risk of complications associated with liver core needle biopsy the current standard for diagnosis other less invasive methods are sought for diagnosis. One such method that has been shown to correlate well with liver fibrosis is shear wave velocity measured by ultrasound US shear wave elastography; however this technique requires specific software hardware and training. A current perspective in the radiology community is that the texture pattern from an US image may be predictive of the stage of liver fibrosis. We propose the use of convolutional neural networks CNNs a framework shown to be well suited for real world image interpretation to test whether the texture pattern in gray scale elastography images B-mode US with fixed subject-agnostic acquisition settings is predictive of the shear wave velocity SWV. In this study gray scale elastography images from over 300 patients including 3500 images with corresponding SWV measurements were preprocessed and used as input to 100 different CNN architectures that were trained to regress shear wave velocity. In this study even the best performing CNN explained only negligible variation in the shear wave velocity measures. These extensive test results suggest that the gray scale elastography image texture provides little predictive information about shear wave velocity and liver fibrosis.
