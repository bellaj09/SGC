"The association of epilepsy with structural brain changes and cognitive abnormalities in midlife has raised concern regarding the possibility of future accelerated brain and cognitive aging and increased risk of later life neurocognitive disorders. To address this issue we examined age-related processes in both structural and functional neuroimaging among individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy TLE N\xa0=\xa0104 who were participants in the Epilepsy Connectome Project ECP. Support vector regression SVR models were trained from 151 healthy controls and used to predict TLE patients brain ages. It was found that TLE patients on average have both older structural +6.6 years and functional +8.3 years brain ages compared to healthy controls. Accelerated functional brain age functional - chronological age was mildly correlated corrected P\xa0=\xa00.07 with complex partial seizure frequency and the number of anti-epileptic drug intake. Functional brain age was a significant correlate of declining cognition fluid abilities and partially mediated chronological age-fluid cognition relationships. Chronological age was the only positive predictor of crystallized cognition. Accelerated aging is evident not only in the structural brains of patients with TLE but also in their functional brains. Understanding the causes of accelerated brain aging in TLE will be clinically important in order to potentially prevent or mitigate their cognitive deficits."
