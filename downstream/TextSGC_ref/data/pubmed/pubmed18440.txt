Robotic-assisted surgery is increasingly being used in thoracic surgery. Currently the Integrated Thoracic Surgery Residency Program lacks a standardized curriculum or requirement for training residents in robotic-assisted thoracic surgery. In most circumstances because of the lack of formal residency training in robotic surgery hospitals are requiring additional training mentorship and formal proctoring of cases before granting credentials to perform robotic-assisted surgery. Therefore there is necessity for residents in Integrated Thoracic Surgery Residency Program to have early exposure and formal training on the robotic platform. We propose a curriculum that can be incorporated into such programs that would satisfy both training needs and hospital credential requirements.
