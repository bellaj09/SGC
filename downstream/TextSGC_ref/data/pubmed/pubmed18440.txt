Virtual reality VR is increasingly often finding applications in physiotherapy and health promotion. Recent years have seen the use of advanced technologies in the promotion of physical activity PA in society. New simulators e.g. treadmills enable the performance of PA e.g. locomotive movements in VR artificially created virtual world. The question of how such movements are similar to natural forms of human locomotion march run inspired the comparative analysis of physiological gait and gait in VR on a multidirectional Omni treadmill. Physiological Gait versus Gait in VR on Multidirectional Treadmill-Comparative Analysis.
