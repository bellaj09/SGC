Electric power line equipment such as insulators cut-out-switches and lightning-arresters play important roles in ensuring a safe and uninterrupted power supply. Unfortunately their continuous exposure to rugged environmental conditions may cause physical or electrical defects in them which may lead to the failure to the electrical system. In this paper we present an automatic real-time electrical equipment detection and defect analysis system. Unlike previous handcrafted feature-based approaches the proposed system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network CNN-based equipment detection framework making it possible to detect 17 different types of powerline insulators in a highly cluttered environment. We also propose a novel rotation normalization and ellipse detection method that play vital roles in the defect analysis process. Finally we present a novel defect analyzer that is capable of detecting gunshot defects occurring in electrical equipment. The proposed system uses two cameras; a low-resolution camera that detects insulators from long-shot images and a high-resolution camera which captures close-shot images of the equipment at high-resolution that helps for effective defect analysis. We demonstrate the performances of the proposed real-time equipment detection with up to 93% recall with 92% precision and defect analysis system with up to 98% accuracy on a large evaluation dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic powerline equipment inspection.
