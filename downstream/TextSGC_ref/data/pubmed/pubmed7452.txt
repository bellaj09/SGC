Scientists are on the lookout for a practical model that can serve as a standard for sorting out identifying and characterizing microplastics which are common occurrences in water sources and wastewaters. The microbeads MBs used in cosmetics and discharged into the sewer systems after use cause substantial microplastics pollution in the receiving waters. Today the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics is banned. The existing use cases are to be discontinued within a few years. Yet there are no restrictions regarding the use of microbeads in a number of industries cleaning products pharmaceuticals and medical practices. In this context the determination and classification of MBs which had so far been discharged to water sources and which continue to be discharged represent crucial problems. In this work we examined a new approach for the classification of MBs based on microscopic images. For classification purposes Convolutional Neural Network CNN -a Deep Learning algorithm- was employed whereas GoogLeNet architecture served as the model. The network is built from scratch and trained then after tested on a total of 42928 images containing MBs in 5 distinct cleansers. The study performed with the CNN which achieved a classification performance of 89% for MBs in wastewater.
