Quantitative susceptibility mapping QSM is a powerful MRI technique that has shown great potential in quantifying tissue susceptibility in numerous neurological disorders. However the intrinsic ill-posed dipole inversion problem greatly affects the accuracy of the susceptibility map. We propose QSMGAN: a 3D deep convolutional neural network approach based on a 3D U-Net architecture with increased receptive field of the input phase compared to the output and further refined the network using the WGAN with gradient penalty training strategy. Our method generates accurate QSM maps from single orientation phase maps efficiently and performs significantly better than traditional non-learning-based dipole inversion algorithms. The generalization capability was verified by applying the algorithm to an unseen pathology--brain tumor patients with radiation-induced cerebral microbleeds.
