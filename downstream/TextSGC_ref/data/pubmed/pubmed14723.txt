Sequencing by translocating DNA fragments through an array of nanopores is a rapidly maturing technology that offers faster and cheaper sequencing than other approaches. However accurately deciphering the DNA sequence from the noisy and complex electrical signal is challenging. Here we report Chiron the first deep learning model to achieve end-to-end basecalling and directly translate the raw signal to DNA sequence without the error-prone segmentation step. Trained with only a small set of 4000 reads we show that our model provides state-of-the-art basecalling accuracy even on previously unseen species. Chiron achieves basecalling speeds of more than 2000 bases per second using desktop computer graphics processing units.
