"Soldier-based simulators have been attracting increased attention recently with the aim of making complex military tactics more effective such that soldiers are able to respond rapidly and logically to battlespace situations and the commanders decisions in the battlefield. Moreover body area networks BANs can be applied to collect the training data in order to provide greater access to soldiers physical actions or postures as they occur in real routine training. Therefore due to the limited physical space of training facilities an efficient soldier-based training strategy is proposed that integrates a virtual reality VR simulation system with a BAN which can capture body movements such as walking running shooting and crouching in a virtual environment. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VR simulation system is able to provide complete and substantial information throughout the training process including detection estimation and monitoring capabilities."
