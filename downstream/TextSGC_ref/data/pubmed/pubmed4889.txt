Information on the brain microstructure can be probed by Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging dMRI. Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging with Diffusivities Assessment NODDIDA is one of the simplest microstructural model proposed. However the estimation of the NODDIDA parameters from clinically plausible dMRI acquisition is ill-posed and different parameter sets can describe the same measurements equally well. A few approaches to resolve this problem focused on developing better optimization strategies for this non-convex optimization. However this fundamentally does not resolve ill-posedness. This article introduces a Bayesian estimation framework which is regularized through knowledge from an extensive dMRI measurement set on a population of healthy adults henceforth population-based prior. Population-based Bayesian regularization for microstructural diffusion MRI with NODDIDA.
