One of the difficulties for the implementation of Brain-Computer Interface BCI systems for motor impaired patients is the time consumed in the system design process since patients do not have the adequate physical nor psychological conditions to complete the process. For this reason most of BCIs are designed in a subject-dependent approach using data of healthy subjects. The developing of subject-independent systems is an option to decrease the required training sessions to design a BCI with patient functionality. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study to evaluate subject-independent system based on hand motor imagery taking gender into account. An approach to improve the performance of subject-independent BCIs-based on motor imagery allocating subjects by gender.
