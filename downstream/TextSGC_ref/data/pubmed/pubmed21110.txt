Mental fatigue induced by long time mental work can cause deterioration in task performance and increase the risk of accidents. Recently electroencephalogram EEG-based monitoring of mental fatigue has received increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces BCI. This study aims to employ EEG signals to measure the mental fatigue level by estimating reaction time RT in a psychomotor vigilance task PVT. In a 36-hour sleep deprivation experiment EEG data from 18 subjects were recorded every four hours in nine blocks each consisting of three tasks: a 6-minute PVT task and two 3-minute resting states eyes closed and eyes open. The mean RT in the PVT task showed a generally increasing trend during the 36-hour awake period reflecting the increase of fatigue over time. For each task multiple EEG features were extracted and selected to better estimate RT using a multiple linear regression MLR method. The correlation between predicted RT and actual RT was evaluated using a leave-one-subject-out LOSO validation strategy. After parameter optimization EEG data from the PVT task obtained a mean correlation coefficient of $0.81 \\pm 0.16$ across all subjects. Resting-state EEG data showed lower correlations eyes-closed: $0.65 \\pm 0.20$ eyes-open: $0.50 \\pm 0.30$ partially due to the involvement of shorter data lengths. These results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the EEG-based fatigue monitoring method which could be potential for applications in operational environments.
