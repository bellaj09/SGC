Electroencephalography based brain-computer interfaces BCIs show promise of providing an alternative communication channel between the brain and an external device. It is well acknowledged that BCI control is a skill and could be improved through practice and training. In this study we explore the change of BCI behavioral performance as well as the electrophysiological properties across three training sessions in a pool of 42 human subjects. Our results show that the group average of BCI accuracy and the information transfer rate improved significantly in the third session compared to the first session; especially the significance reached in a smaller subset of a low BCI performance group average accuracy <70% as well. There was a significant difference of event-related desynchronization ERD lateralization for BCI control between the left- and right-hand imagination task in the last two sessions but this significant difference was not revealed in the first training sessions. No significant change of R 2 value or event-related desynchronization and synchronization ERD/ERS for either channel C3 or channel C4 which were used for online control was found across the training sessions. The change of ERD lateralization was also not significant across the training sessions. The present results indicate that BCI training could induce a change of behavioral performance and electrophysiological properties quickly within just a few hours of training distributed into three sessions. Multiple training sessions might especially be beneficial for the low BCI performers. Exploring Training Effect in 42 Human Subjects Using a Non-invasive Sensorimotor Rhythm Based Online BCI.
