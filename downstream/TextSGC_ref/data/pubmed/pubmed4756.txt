"Alzheimers disease is considered a disconnection syndrome motivating the use of brain network measures to detect changes in whole-brain resting state functional connectivity FC. We investigated changes in FC within and among resting state networks RSN across four different stages in the Alzheimers disease continuum. FC changes were examined in two independent cohorts of individuals 84 and 58 individuals respectively each comprising control subjective cognitive decline mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers dementia groups. For each participant FC was computed as a matrix of Pearson correlations between pairs of time series from 278 gray matter brain regions. We determined significant differences in FC modular organization with two distinct approaches network contingency analysis and multiresolution consensus clustering. Network contingency analysis identified RSN sub-blocks that differed significantly across clinical groups. Multiresolution consensus clustering identified differences in the stability of modules across multiple spatial scales. Significant modules were further tested for statistical association with memory and executive function cognitive domain scores. Across both analytic approaches and in both participant cohorts the findings converged on a pattern of FC that varied systematically with diagnosis within the frontoparietal network FP and between the FP network and default mode network DMN. Disturbances of modular organization were manifest as greater internal coherence of the FP network and stronger coupling between FP and DMN resulting in less segregation of these two networks. Our findings suggest that the pattern of interactions within and between specific RSNs offers new insight into the functional disruption that occurs across the Alzheimers disease spectrum."
