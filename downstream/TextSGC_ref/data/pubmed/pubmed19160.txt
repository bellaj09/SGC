The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency after 1 year of combined use of psychodynamic psychotherapy integrating virtual reality VR for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ED and premature ejaculation PE in 160 heterosexual males who had neither any prior sexual therapy nor had made use either before during or after therapy of any specific pharmaceuticals for the treatment of primary sexual dysfunction. All subjects had given their informed consent. After a clinical diagnosis in an andrologic center 50 presumably psychological ED average age 43.7 years 60 mixed ED 53.9 years and 50 primary PE 39 years who suffered these problems over 6 months were undergoing a cycle of 12 sessions over a 25-week period of psychotherapy integrating an audio CD and helmet with miniature television screens that projected specially designed CD-ROM program on the ontogenetic development of male sexual identity. The clinical follow up was done after 6 and 12 months after the cycle. After one year the overall partial two times out of three and complete positive response rate for psychological ED was 75% for mixed ED was 47% and for PE was 54%. We considered drop-out cases as only before the 7th session of the treatment cycle the drop-outs after session 7 and the patients that did not show up for follow-up are counted as negative results. Two patients reported nausea and one vertigo during the first 15-min virtual reality experience. Considering the particular way that full-immersion virtual reality involves the subject who experiences it we hypothesized that this methodological approach could speed up the therapeutic process. The evidence that positive results persist over time allows us to hypothesize that certain changes in cerebral function can be possible and that these changes are correlated to favorable sexual performance in the male.
