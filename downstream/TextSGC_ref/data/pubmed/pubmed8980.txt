Characterizing the binding behaviors of RNA-binding proteins RBPs is important for understanding their functional roles in gene expression regulation. However current high-throughput experimental methods for identifying RBP targets such as CLIP-seq and RNAcompete usually suffer from the false negative issue. Here we develop a deep boosting based machine learning approach called DeBooster to accurately model the binding sequence preferences and identify the corresponding binding targets of RBPs from CLIP-seq data. Comprehensive validation tests have shown that DeBooster can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in RBP target prediction. In addition we have demonstrated that DeBooster may provide new insights into understanding the regulatory functions of RBPs including the binding effects of the RNA helicase MOV10 on mRNA degradation the potentially different ADAR1 binding behaviors related to its editing activity as well as the antagonizing effect of RBP binding on miRNA repression. Moreover DeBooster may provide an effective index to investigate the effect of pathogenic mutations in RBP binding sites especially those related to splicing events. We expect that DeBooster will be widely applied to analyze large-scale CLIP-seq experimental data and can provide a practically useful tool for novel biological discoveries in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs.
