Constructing integrative visualizations that simultaneously cater to a variety of data types is challenging. Hybrid-reality environments blur the line between virtual environments and tiled display walls. They incorporate high-resolution stereoscopic displays which can be used to juxtapose large heterogeneous datasets while providing a range of naturalistic interaction schemes. They thus empower designers to construct integrative visualizations that more effectively mash up 2D 3D temporal and multivariate datasets. Visualizing large heterogeneous data in hybrid-reality environments.
