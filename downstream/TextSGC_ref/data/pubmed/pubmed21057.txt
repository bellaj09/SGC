The potential of robot-mediated therapy and virtual reality in neurorehabilitation is becoming of increasing importance. However there is limited information using neuroimaging on the neural networks involved in training with these technologies. This study was intended to detect the brain network involved in the visual processing of movement during robotic training. The main aim was to investigate the existence of a common cerebral network able to assimilate biological human upper limb and non-biological abstract object movements hence testing the suitability of the visual non-biological feedback provided by the InMotion2 Robot. Brain network involved in visual processing of movement stimuli used in upper limb robotic training: an fMRI study.
