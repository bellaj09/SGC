Subjects had to judge the size of a tactile stimulus held in the unseen hand while a visible phantom hand representing that unseen hand held a tactile stimulus of same or different size. No asymmetries in interference effects were found that could be related to hand or handedness. The method lends itself to quantification of virtual reality box illusions and can be used to evaluate the role of experience and sources of variability in the strength of the illusion across subjects. Does handedness influence the strength of phantom limb illusions in the virtual reality box?
