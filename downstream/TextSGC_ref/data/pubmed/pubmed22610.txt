Performing closed-loop modifications of a brain-machine interface BMI decoder is a technique that shows great promise for improving performance. We compare two algorithms for implementing adaptations that update decoder parameters on different time-scales discrete batches vs. online and present experimental results of a non-human primate performing a standard center-out BMI task. To ensure that our experimental training models are representative of a broad range of paralyzed patients our decoders were initially trained using neural activity recorded during subject observation of cursor movement. We find that both closed-loop adaptation algorithms can be used to boost BMI performance from 20-30% to 80% yielding movement kinematics similar to natural arm movements. Based on insights derived from the performance of each algorithm we propose that a hybrid of batch and online decoder adaptation may be the best approach.
