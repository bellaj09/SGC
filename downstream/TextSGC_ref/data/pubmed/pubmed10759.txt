Single-trial motor imagery classification is a crucial aspect of brain-computer applications. Therefore it is necessary to extract and discriminate signal features involving motor imagery movements. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction methods are effective when designing these types of motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface applications. In the field of information theory Riemannian geometry is mainly used with covariance matrices. Accordingly investigations showed that if the method is used after the execution of the filterbank approach the covariance matrix preserves the frequency and spatial information of the signal. Deep-learning methods are superior when the data availability is abundant and while there is a large number of features. The purpose of this study is to a show how to use a single deep-learning-based classifier in conjunction with BCI brain-computer interface applications with the CSP common spatial features and the Riemannian geometry feature extraction methods in BCI applications and to b describe one of the wrapper feature-selection algorithms referred to as the particle swarm optimization in combination with a decision tree algorithm. In this work the CSP method was used for a multiclass case by using only one classifier. Additionally a combination of power spectrum density features with covariance matrices mapped onto the tangent space of a Riemannian manifold was used. Furthermore the particle swarm optimization method was implied to ease the training by penalizing bad features and the moving windows method was used for augmentation. After empirical study the convolutional neural network was adopted to classify the pre-processed data. Our proposed method improved the classification accuracy for several subjects that comprised the well-known BCI competition IV 2a dataset.
