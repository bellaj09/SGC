Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity and long-term disability globally. Detection of injured neuron is a prerequisite for defining the degree of focal ischemic brain injury which can be used to guide further therapy. Here we demonstrate the capability of two-photon microscopy TPM to label-freely identify injured neurons on unstained thin section and fresh tissue of rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model revealing definite diagnostic features compared with conventional staining images. Moreover a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network is developed to automatically detect the location of injured neurons on TPM images. We then apply deep learning-assisted TPM to evaluate the ischemic regions based on tissue edema two-photon excited fluorescence signal intensity as well as neuronal injury presenting a novel manner for identifying the infarct core peri-infarct area and remote area. These results propose an automated and label-free method that could provide supplementary information to augment the diagnostic accuracy as well as hold the potential to be used as an intravital diagnostic tool for evaluating the effectiveness of drug interventions and predicting potential therapeutics.
