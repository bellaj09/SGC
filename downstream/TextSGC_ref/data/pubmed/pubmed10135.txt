Designing protein sequences that can fold into a given structure is a well-known inverse protein-folding problem. One important characteristic to attain for a protein design program is the ability to recover wild-type sequences given their native backbone structures. The highest average sequence identity accuracy achieved by current protein-design programs in this problem is around 30% achieved by our previous system SPIN. SPIN is a program that predicts sequences compatible with a provided structure using a neural network with fragment-based local and energy-based nonlocal profiles. Our new model SPIN2 uses a deep neural network and additional structural features to improve on SPIN. SPIN2 achieves over 34% in sequence recovery in 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests a 4% improvement over the previous version. The sequence profiles generated from SPIN2 are expected to be useful for improving existing fold recognition and protein design techniques. SPIN2 is available at http://sparks-lab.org.
