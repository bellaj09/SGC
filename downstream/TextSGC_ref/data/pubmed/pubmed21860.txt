Cognitive training therapies may delay cognitive deterioration in dementia. There is potential to enhance delivery through immersive virtual reality IVR as removing potential distractors for cognitively impaired individuals can enhance their experience resulting in increased engagement. Evidence in this field is emerging and not yet synthesized. We aimed to summarize research investigating the use of IVR in dementia to evaluate the current extent of use acceptability feasibility and potential effectiveness. We also aimed to identify gaps in current research and to create a set of recommendations in utilizing this therapy. Are We There Yet?
