"We are working towards the development of a robotic hand-held surgical device for laparoscopic interventions that enhances the surgeons dexterity. In this paper the kinematics of the end effector is studied. Different choices of kinematics are compared during an evaluation campaign using a virtual reality simulator to find the optimal one: the Yaw-Roll YR kinematics. A proof of concept prototype is made based on the results." "Robotic hand-held surgical device: evaluation of end-effectors kinematics and development of proof-of-concept prototypes."
