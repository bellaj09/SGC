Most present-day visual brain computer interfaces BCIs suffer from the fact that they rely on eye movements are slow-paced or feature a small vocabulary. As a potential remedy we explored a novel BCI paradigm consisting of a central rapid serial visual presentation RSVP of the stimuli. It has a large vocabulary and realizes a BCI system based on covert non-spatial selective visual attention. In an offline study eight participants were presented sequences of rapid bursts of symbols. Two different speeds and two different color conditions were investigated. Robust early visual and P300 components were elicited time-locked to the presentation of the target. Offline classification revealed a mean accuracy of up to 90% for selecting the correct symbol out of 30 possibilities. The results suggest that RSVP-BCI is a promising new paradigm also for patients with oculomotor impairments. A novel brain-computer interface based on the rapid serial visual presentation paradigm.
