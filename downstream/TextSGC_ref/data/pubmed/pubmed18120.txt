The use of gamification in healthcare has been gaining popularity. This prospective randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate whether gamification of the preoperative process-via virtual reality VR gaming that provides a vivid immersive and realistic experience-could reduce preoperative anxiety in children. Seventy children scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into either the control or gamification group. Children in the control group received conventional education regarding the preoperative process whereas those in the gamification group played a 5 min VR game experiencing the preoperative experience. Preoperative anxiety induction compliance checklist ICC and procedural behavior rating scale PBRS were measured. Sixty-nine children were included in the final analysis control group = 35 gamification = 34. Preoperative anxiety 28.3 23.336.7 vs. 46.7 31.751.7; p < 0.001 and intraoperative compliance measured using ICC p = 0.038 were lower in the gamification group than in the control group. However PBRS p = 0.092 and parent/guardian satisfaction p = 0.268 were comparable between the two groups. VR experience of the preoperative process could reduce preoperative anxiety and improve compliance during anesthetic induction in children undergoing elective surgery and general anesthesia.
