"The aim of each occlusal surface reconstruction is to take the functionally developed biomorphologic aspects into consideration while restoring occlusal conditions. In order to fulfil these conditions it is necessary to represent individual mandible movement as accurately as possible. In addition to physiological knowledge it is indispensable for us to be able to simulate spatial mandible movement and determine individual parameters in an utmost precise way. By correcting projecting mistakes the articulator should reproduce static and dynamic occlusal conditions according to reality. This is a difficult task. The advance of technology spreading of computers and the idea of virtual articulator have all helped to fulfil all these conditions by quick digital data processing instead of complicated and slow mechanical gadgets. The aim of our publication is to present the programming possibilities of the articulator of individual value belonging to the system and the advantages of the method." Determination and practical application of articulator related individual functional parameters. New method of measurement: virtual articulator and face-bow.
