Numerous studies have established that estimated brain age constitutes a valuable biomarker that is predictive of cognitive decline and various neurological diseases. In this work we curate a large-scale brain MRI data set of healthy individuals on which we train a uniform deep learning model for brain age estimation. We demonstrate an age estimation accuracy on a hold-out test set mean absolute error = 4.06 years r = 0.970 and an independent life span evaluation data set mean absolute error = 4.21 years r = 0.960. We further demonstrate the utility of the estimated age in a life span aging analysis of cognitive functions. In summary we achieve age estimation performance comparable to previous studies but with a more heterogenous data set confirming the efficacy of this deep learning framework. We also evaluated training with varying age distributions. The analysis of regional contributions to our brain age predictions through multiple analyses and confirmation of the association of divergence between the estimated and chronological brain age with neuropsychological measures may be useful in the development and evaluation of similar imaging biomarkers. Estimating brain age based on a uniform healthy population with deep learning and structural magnetic resonance imaging.
