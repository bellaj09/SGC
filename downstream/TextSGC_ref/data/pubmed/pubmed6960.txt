In the tradition of phenomenology minimal selfdisturbance has been suggested as a manifestation of the core pathogenesis of schizophrenia; however the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here in line with the concept of "cognitive dysmetria" we investigated the cerebro-cerebellar default mode network DMN connectivity and its association with pre-reflective minimal selfdisturbance in individuals at ultra-high risk UHR for psychosis and patients with first-episode schizophrenia FES. Aberrant cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity and minimal self-disturbance in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis and with first-episode schizophrenia.
