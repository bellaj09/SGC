In recent years numerous brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on motor-imagery have been proposed which incorporate features such as adaptive classification error detection and correction fusion with auxiliary signals and shared control capabilities. Due to the added complexity of such algorithms the evaluation strategy and metrics used for analysis must be carefully chosen to accurately represent the performance of the BCI. In this article metrics are reviewed and contrasted using both simulated examples and experimental data. Furthermore a review of the recent literature is presented to determine how BCIs are evaluated in particular focusing on the relationship between how the data are used relative to the BCI subcomponent under investigation. From the analysis performed in this study valuable guidelines are presented regarding the choice of metrics and evaluation strategy dependent upon any chosen BCI paradigm. An analysis of performance evaluation for motor-imagery based BCI.
