"Environmental context has an important impact on health and well being. We aimed to test the effects of a visual distraction induced by classical hospital waiting room RH versus an ideal room with a sea view IH both represented in virtual reality VR on subjective sensation and cortical responses induced by painful laser stimuli LEPs in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic migraine CM. Sixteen CM and 16 controls underwent 62 channels LEPs from the right hand during a fully immersive VR experience where two types of waiting rooms were simulated. The RH simulated a classical hospital waiting room while the IH represented a room with sea viewing. CM patients showed a reduction of laser pain rating and vertex LEPs during the IH vision. The sLORETA analysis confirmed that in CM patients the two VR simulations induced a different modulation of bilateral parietal cortical areas precuneus and superior parietal lobe and superior frontal and cingulate girus in respect to controls. The architectural context may interfere with pain perception depending upon the status of subject. Many variables may change patients outcome and support the use of VR technology to test the best conditions for their management."
