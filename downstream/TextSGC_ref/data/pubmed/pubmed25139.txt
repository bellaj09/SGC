To date the majority of Brain-Machine Interfaces have been used to perform simple tasks with sequences of individual targets in otherwise blank environments. In this study we developed a more practical and clinically relevant task that approximated modern computers and graphical user interfaces GUIs. This task could be problematic given the known sensitivity of areas typically used for BMIs to visual stimuli eye movements decision-making and attentional control. Consequently we sought to assess the effect of a complex GUI-like task on the quality of neural decoding. Parietal neural prosthetic control of a computer cursor in a graphical-user-interface task.
