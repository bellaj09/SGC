Previous work from the authors has shown that hand ergonomics plays an important role in surgical psychomotor performance during virtual reality brain tumor resections. In the current study they propose a hypothetical model that integrates the human and task factors at play during simulated brain tumor resections to better understand the hand ergonomics needed for optimal safety and efficiency. They hypothesize that 1 experts neurosurgeons compared to novices residents and medical students spend a greater proportion of their time in direct contact with critical tumor areas; 2 hand ergonomic conditions most favorable to unfavorable prompt participants to adapt in order to optimize tumor resection; and 3 hand ergonomic adaptation is acquired with increasing expertise. Development of a performance model for virtual reality tumor resections.
