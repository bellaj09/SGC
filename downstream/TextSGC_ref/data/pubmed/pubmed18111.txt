"An immersive virtual reality IVR system was used to investigate allocentric spatial memory in a patient PR who had selective hippocampal damage and also in patients who had undergone unilateral temporal lobectomies 17 right TL and 19 left TL their performance compared against normal control groups. A human analogue of the Olton Olton 1979. Hippocampus space and memory. Behavioural Brain Science 2 315 spatial maze was developed consisting of a virtual room a central virtual circular table and an array of radially arranged up-turned shells. The participant had to search these shells in turn in order to find a blue cube that would then move to another location and so on until all the shells had been target locations. Within-search errors could be made when the participants returned to a previously visited location during a search and between-search errors when they revisited previously successful but now incorrect locations. PR made significantly more between-search errors than his control group but showed no increase in within-search errors. The right TL group showed a similar pattern of impairment but the left TL group showed no impairment. This finding implicates the right hippocampal formation in spatial memory functioning in a scenario in which the visual environment was controlled so as to eliminate extraneous visual cues."
