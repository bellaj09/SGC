Trocar insertion the first step to most micro surgery procedures is a difficult procedure to learn and practice because procedure is carried out almost entirely without any visual feedback of the organs underlying the tissue being punctured. A majority of injuries is attributed to the excessive use of force by the surgeon. This paper looks at developing a haptic based trocar insertion simulator which will assist in training and skill advancement in carrying out this procedure. Different issues regarding development of force model and and trocar-tissue interaction is studied. Parametric modeling and simulation of trocar insertion.
