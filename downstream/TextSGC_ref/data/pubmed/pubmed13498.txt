Quantitative detection of histone modifications has emerged in the recent years as a major means for understanding such biological processes as chromosome packaging transcriptional activation and DNA damage. However high-throughput experimental techniques such as ChIP-seq are usually expensive and time-consuming prohibiting the establishment of a histone modification landscape for hundreds of cell types across dozens of histone markers. These disadvantages have been appealing for computational methods to complement experimental approaches towards large-scale analysis of histone modifications.
