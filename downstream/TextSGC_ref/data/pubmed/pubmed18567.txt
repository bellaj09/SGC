"This paper explores the ramifications of excessive use of media on personality development the development of symbolic and thinking functions and on psychic reality. In doing so the questions of whether there are specific media objects possessing an intrinsic symbolic quality and which attachments in the inner world of a child/adolescent can be mobilized or destroyed are discussed. By selecting specific material computer gamers use their game to activate the field of a personal psychic reality. Hereby they attempt some kind of self-healing. However after leaving the game conflicts and traumata re-enacted but unresolved in the game disappear from their temporary representation without generating any resonance in the gamers psychic experience. Consequently although states of mind and affects are activated in the computer game their processing and integration fail; the game results in a compulsive repetition. The construction and consolidation of retrievable maturation and structural development the representation of the unrepresentable succeed in the context of the triangulating analytic relationship initially through a jointly performed symbolic and narrative re-experience or the recreation of the game. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by means of clinical vignettes." Virtual reality and the psyche. Some psychoanalytic approaches to media addiction.
