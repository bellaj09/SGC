"Background: Cranioplasty CP of autologous bone flap after decompressive craniectomy DC is known to be associated with a high complication rate particularly bone flap resorption BFR. In a retrospective study we used a novel virtual reality VR visualisation technique to identify and evaluate risk factors associated with CP.Method: Twenty-five patients underwent early autologous CP. All complications were recorded. Cranial computed tomography scans were visualised via the VR software to access the fitting accuracy of the bone flap bone flap size gap width at trepanation cutting edge extent of osteoclastic extension.Results: An overall complication rate of 44% was seen and BFR was the most common 36%. Only osteoclastic extension of trepanation p\u2009=\u2009.04 was a significant risk factor for BFR. The factors indication for DC p\u2009=\u2009.09 and size of bone flap p\u2009=\u2009.09 had a tendency towards influencing the rate of BFR while age p\u2009=\u2009.68 time interval between DC and CP p\u2009=\u20091.00 and gap width p\u2009=\u2009.50 were not considered to influence the BFR rate.Conclusions: DC and subsequent CP is a complication-prone procedure. Therefore it is relevant to identify and quantify probable risk factors for the most common complications such as BFR. Here we found that the extent of osteoclastic extension may impair the patients healing process. Our investigation was made considerably easier by using the novel VR visualisation technique which allows parallax free measurements of distances in 3D space."
