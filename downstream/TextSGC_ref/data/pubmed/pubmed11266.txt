Physicians at the beginning of their specialist education have been reported to be especially exposed to stress and difficult working conditions. Considerable worry has also been caused by reports about anaesthetists dying at a younger age than other specialists as well as by reports about higher than average suicide rates among anaesthetists. Maybe as a consequence many young doctors are reluctant to choose anaesthesiology as their future specialty. The aim of this study was to investigate what difficulties trainee anaesthetists experience at work. Being a young and inexperienced trainee anesthetist: a phenomenological study on tough working conditions.
