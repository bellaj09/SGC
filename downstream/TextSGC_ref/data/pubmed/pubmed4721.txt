Chimera states namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior were previously analyzed in complex networks. However they have not been extensively studied in modular networks. Here we consider a neural network inspired by the connectome of the C. elegans soil worm organized into six interconnected communities where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to the Kuramoto order parameter  we also employ other measures of coherence such as the chimera-like  and metastability  indices which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the C. elegans neural network. Similar results suggest that under certain assumptions chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks.
