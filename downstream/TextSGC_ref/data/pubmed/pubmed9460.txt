Bioprosthetic heart valves BHVs are commonly used as heart valve replacements but they are prone to fatigue failure; estimating their remaining life directly from medical images is difficult. Analyzing the valve performance can provide better guidance for personalized valve design. However such analyses are often computationally intensive. In this work we introduce the concept of deep learning DL based finite element analysis DLFEA to learn the deformation biomechanics of bioprosthetic aortic valves directly from simulations. The proposed DL framework can eliminate the time-consuming biomechanics simulations while predicting valve deformations with the same fidelity. We present statistical results that demonstrate the high performance of the DLFEA framework and the applicability of the framework to predict bioprosthetic aortic valve deformations. With further development such a tool can provide fast decision support for designing surgical bioprosthetic aortic valves. Ultimately this framework could be extended to other BHVs and improve patient care. A Deep Learning Framework for Design and Analysis of Surgical Bioprosthetic Heart Valves.
