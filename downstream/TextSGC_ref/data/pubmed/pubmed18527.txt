Minimally invasive techniques for electrophysiological cardiac data mapping and catheter ablation therapy have been driven through advancements in computer-aided technologies including magnetic tracking systems and virtual and augmented-reality environments. The objective of this work is to extend current cardiac mapping techniques to collect and display data in the temporal domain while mapping on patient-specific cardiac models. This paper details novel approaches to collecting spatially tracked cardiac electrograms registering the data with a patient-specific cardiac model and interpreting the data directly on the model surface with the goal of giving a more comprehensive cardiac mapping system in comparison to current systems. To validate the system laboratory studies were conducted to assess the accuracy of navigating to both physical and virtual landmarks. Subsequent to the laboratory studies an in-vivo porcine experiment was conducted to assess the systems overall ability to collect spatial tracked electrophysiological data and map directly onto a cardiac model. The results from these experiments show the new dynamic cardiac mapping system was able to maintain high accuracy of locating physical and virtual landmarks while creating a dynamic cardiac map displayed on a dynamic cardiac surface model.
