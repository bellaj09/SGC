Mastery of the neurosurgical skill set involves many hours of supervised intraoperative training. Convergence of political economic and social forces has limited neurosurgical resident operative exposure. There is need to develop realistic neurosurgical simulations that reproduce the operative experience unrestricted by time and patient safety constraints. Computer-based virtual reality platforms offer just such a possibility. The combination of virtual reality with dynamic three-dimensional stereoscopic visualization and haptic feedback technologies makes realistic procedural simulation possible. Most neurosurgical procedures can be conceptualized and segmented into critical task components which can be simulated independently or in conjunction with other modules to recreate the experience of a complex neurosurgical procedure.
