In online health expert question-answering HQA services it is significant to automatically determine the quality of the answers. There are two prominent challenges in this task. First the answers are usually written in short text which makes it difficult to absorb the text semantic information. Second it usually lacks sufficient labeled data but contains a huge amount of unlabeled data. To tackle these challenges we propose a novel deep co-training framework based on factorization machines FM and deep textual views to intelligently and automatically identify the quality of HQA systems. More specifically we exploit additional domain-specific semantic information from domain-specific word embeddings to expand the semantic space of short text and apply FM to excavate the non-independent interaction relationships among diverse features within individual views for improving the performance of the base classifier via co-training. Our learned deep textual views the convolutional neural networks CNN view which focuses on extracting local features using convolution filters to locally model short text and the dependency-sensitive convolutional neural networks DSCNN view which focuses on capturing long-distance dependency information within the text to globally model short text can then overcome the challenge of feature sparseness in the short text answers from the doctors. The developed co-training framework can effectively mine the highly non-linear semantic information embedded in the unlabeled data and expose the highly non-linear relationships between different views which minimizes the labeling effort. Finally we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the predictive performance of the answer quality in the context of HQA services.
