"Visibility of nigrosome 1 in the substantia nigra SN is used as an MR imaging biomarker for Parkinsons disease. Because of lower susceptibility induced tissue contrast and SNR visualization of the SN pars compacta SNPC using conventional imaging technique in the clinical field strength 3T has been limited. Susceptibility map-weighted imaging SMWI has been proposed to visualize SNPC at 3T. To better visualize nigrosome 1 and SN areas using SMWI accurate estimation of the quantitative susceptibility mapping QSM map is essential. In SMWI processing however QSM processing time using conventional algorithms is the most time-consuming step and may limit clinical use. In this study we introduce an efficient SMWI processing approach using the deep neural network QSMnet. To improve the processing speed of SMWI while maintaining similar image quality to that obtained with the conventional method QSMnet was applied to generate a susceptibility mask for SMWI processing."
