Lung cancer has a poor prognosis when not diagnosed early and unresectable lesions are present. The management of small lung nodules noted on computed tomography scan is controversial due to uncertain tumor characteristics. A conventional computer-aided diagnosis CAD scheme requires several image processing and pattern recognition steps to accomplish a quantitative tumor differentiation result. In such an ad hoc image analysis pipeline every step depends heavily on the performance of the previous step. Accordingly tuning of classification performance in a conventional CAD scheme is very complicated and arduous. Deep learning techniques on the other hand have the intrinsic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature and tuning of performance in a seamless fashion. In this study we attempted to simplify the image analysis pipeline of conventional CAD with deep learning techniques. Specifically we introduced models of a deep belief network and a convolutional neural network in the context of nodule classification in computed tomography images. Two baseline methods with feature computing steps were implemented for comparison. The experimental results suggest that deep learning methods could achieve better discriminative results and hold promise in the CAD application domain.
