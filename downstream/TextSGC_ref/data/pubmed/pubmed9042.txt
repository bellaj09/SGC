The early prediction of deterioration could have an important role in supporting healthcare professionals as an estimated 11% of deaths in hospital follow a failure to promptly recognize and treat deteriorating patients1. To achieve this goal requires predictions of patient risk that are continuously updated and accurate and delivered at an individual level with sufficient context and enough time to act. Here we develop a deep learning approach for the continuous risk prediction of future deterioration in patients building on recent work that models adverse events from electronic health records2-17 and using acute kidney injury-a common and potentially life-threatening condition18-as an exemplar. Our model was developed on a large longitudinal dataset of electronic health records that cover diverse clinical environments comprising 703782\xa0adult patients across 172\xa0inpatient and 1062\xa0outpatient sites. Our model predicts 55.8% of all inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury and 90.2% of all acute kidney injuries that required subsequent administration of dialysis with a lead time of up to 48\xa0h and a ratio of 2\xa0false alerts for every true alert. In addition to predicting future acute kidney injury our model provides confidence assessments and a list of the clinical features that are most salient to each prediction alongside predicted future trajectories for clinically relevant blood tests9. Although the recognition and prompt treatment of acute kidney injury is known to be challenging our approach may offer opportunities for identifying patients at risk within a time window that enables early treatment. A clinically applicable approach to continuous prediction of future acute kidney injury.
