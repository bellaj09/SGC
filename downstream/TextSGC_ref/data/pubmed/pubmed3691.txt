"The earliest white matter changes in Huntingtons disease are seen before disease onset in the premanifest stage around the striatum within the corpus callosum and in posterior white matter tracts. While experimental evidence suggests that these changes may be related to abnormal gene transcription we lack an understanding of the biological processes driving this regional vulnerability."
