This paper presents an algorithm for fast segmentation of white matter bundles from massive dMRI tractography datasets using a multisubject atlas. We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds respectively. This performance enables the use of the algorithm in truly interactive applications for visualization analysis and segmentation of large white matter tractography datasets.
