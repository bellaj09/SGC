Dressing change and physical therapy are extremely painful procedures for burn patients. Adjunctive virtual reality therapy reportedly reduces pain when added to analgesics but a summary analysis of the data has yet to be performed. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to verify the pain-reducing efficacy of virtual reality among burn patients undergoing dressing change or physical therapy. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed EMBASE via OVID and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via OVID for relevant trials based on predetermined eligibility criteria from database establishment to February 2018. Two reviewers screened citations and extracted data independently. The quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook whereas statistical heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square tests and I2 statistics. Review Manager 5.3 was used for statistical analysis. Thirteen randomized controlled trials with 362 patients who underwent 627 burn dressing change or physical therapy sessions were included. The additional use of virtual reality significantly reduced pain intensity time spent thinking about pain and unpleasantness and was more fun compared with that of using analgesics alone. Virtual reality is an effective pain reduction measurement added to analgesics for burn patients undergoing dressing change or physical therapy. However multicenter parallel group design randomized controlled trials are still required.
