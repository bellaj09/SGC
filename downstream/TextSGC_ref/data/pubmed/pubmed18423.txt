"The uses of robotics in surgery were hypothesized as far back as 1967 but it took nearly 30 years and the nations largest agency the Department of Defense in conjunction with innovative startups and established research agencies to complete the first fully functional multipurpose surgical robot. Currently the most prominently available multipurpose robotic surgery system with US Food and Drug Administration approval is Intuitive Surgical Inc.s da Vinci Surgical System which is found in operating rooms across the globe. Although now ubiquitous for minimally invasive surgery early surgical robot prototypes were specialty focused. Originally multipurpose robotic systems were intended for long-distance trauma surgery in battlefield settings. While there were impressive feats of telesurgery the marketable focus has veered from this goal. Initially developed through SRI International and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency surgical robotics reached private industry through two major competitors who later merged."
