"Public speaking anxiety PSA is a common condition which can be treated effectively with exposure therapy. However inherent difficulties in stimuli presentation and control limits dissemination and the therapeutic potential. Virtual Reality VR technology has the potential to resolve these issues and provide a scalable platform for self-help interventions. No previous study has examined whether this can be achieved using the first generation of consumer VR hardware and software. In the current trial n\u2009=\u200925\u2009+\u200925 participants were randomized to either one-session therapist-led VR exposure therapy for PSA followed by a four-week internet-administered VR to in-vivo transition program or a waiting-list. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed significant large within Cohens d\u2009=\u20091.67 decreases in self-reported PSA. The waiting-list was then given access to an internet-administered self-led version of the same VR exposure therapy to be conducted at home followed by the same transition program. Dual-slope mixed effects modeling revealed significant large d\u2009=\u20091.35 decreases in self-reported PSA. Results were maintained or improved at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. We show for the first time that low-cost off-the-shelf consumer VR hardware and software can be used to conduct exposure therapy for PSA both in the traditional previously impractical one-session format and in a novel self-led at-home format."
