Based on neurofeedback NF training as a neurocognitive treatment in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD we designed a randomized controlled functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS NF intervention embedded in an immersive virtual reality classroom in which participants learned to control overhead lighting with their dorsolateral prefrontal brain activation. We tested the efficacy of the intervention on healthy adults displaying high impulsivity as a sub-clinical population sharing common features with ADHD. Twenty participants 10 in an experimental and 10 in a shoulder muscle-based electromyography control group underwent eight training sessions across 2 weeks. Training was bookended by a pre- and post-test including go/no-go n-back and stop-signal tasks SST. Results indicated a significant reduction in commission errors on the no-go task with a simultaneous increase in prefrontal oxygenated hemoglobin concentration for the experimental group but not for the control group. Furthermore the ability of the subjects to gain control over the feedback parameter correlated strongly with the reduction in commission errors for the experimental but not for the control group indicating the potential importance of learning feedback control in moderating behavioral outcomes. In addition participants of the fNIRS group showed a reduction in reaction time variability on the SST. Results indicate a clear effect of our NF intervention in reducing impulsive behavior possibly via a strengthening of frontal lobe functioning. Virtual reality additions to conventional NF may be one way to improve the ecological validity and symptom-relevance of the training situation hence positively affecting transfer of acquired skills to real life.
