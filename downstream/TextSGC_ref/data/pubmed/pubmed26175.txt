"In most Brain-Computer Interface systems especially the P300-Speller there must be a harmonized balance between the accuracy and the spelling time. One major drawback of the classical 36-choice P300-Speller is the slow rate of character elicitation. This paper aims to propose a real-time signal processing method to decrease the spelling time by exploiting the score margins of the ensemble Support Vector Machine classifiers during real-time P300-Speller flashes rather than just getting the classifiers highest scores. Our experiments were conducted on the dataset of the BCI Competition III and resulted in a successful character rate of over 96% with just approximately 15 to 20 seconds for each character spelling session. As compared with the fixed 31.5 seconds of the best original approach of the competition our proposed method significantly reduces the required spelling time by over 30% while maintaining the desired classification accuracy."
