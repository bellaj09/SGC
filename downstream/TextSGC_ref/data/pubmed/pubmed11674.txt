Nucleosomes are DNA-histone complex each wrapping about 150 pairs of double-stranded DNA. Their function is fundamental for one of the primary functions of Chromatin i.e. packing the DNA into the nucleus of the Eukaryote cells. Several biological studies have shown that the nucleosome positioning influences the regulation of cell type-specific gene activities. Moreover computational studies have shown evidence of sequence specificity concerning the DNA fragment wrapped into nucleosomes clearly underlined by the organization of particular DNA substrings. As the main consequence the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by computational methods using a sequence features representation. Deep learning architectures for prediction of nucleosome positioning from sequences data.
