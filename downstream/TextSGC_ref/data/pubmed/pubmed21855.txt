The area of brain-computer interfaces BCIs represents one of the more interesting fields in neurophysiological research since it investigates the development of the machines that perform different transformations of the brain\s "thoughts" to certain pre-defined actions. Experimental studies have reported some successful implementations of BCIs; however much of the field still remains unexplored. According to some recent reports the phase coding of informational content is an important mechanism in the brain\s function and cognition and has the potential to explain various mechanisms of the brain\s data transfer but it has yet to be scrutinized in the context of brain-computer interface. Therefore if the mechanism of phase coding is plausible one should be able to extract the phase-coded content carried by brain signals using appropriate signal-processing methods. In our previous studies we have shown that by using a phase-demodulation-based signal-processing approach it is possible to decode some relevant information on the current motor action in the brain from electroencephalographic EEG data.
