Non-contrast head CT scan is the current standard for initial imaging of patients with head trauma or stroke symptoms. We aimed to develop and validate a set of deep learning algorithms for automated detection of the following key findings from these scans: intracranial haemorrhage and its types ie intraparenchymal intraventricular subdural extradural and subarachnoid; calvarial fractures; midline shift; and mass effect. Deep learning algorithms for detection of critical findings in head CT scans: a retrospective study.
