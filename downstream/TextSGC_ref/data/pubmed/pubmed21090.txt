Virtual reality VR technology can provide a safe environment for observing learning and practicing use of behavioral weight management skills which could be particularly useful in enhancing minimal contact online weight management programs. The Experience Success ES project developed a system for creating and deploying VR scenarios for online weight management skills training. Virtual environments populated with virtual actors allow users to experiment with implementing behavioral skills via a PC-based point and click interface. A culturally sensitive virtual coach guides the experience including planning for real-world skill use.
