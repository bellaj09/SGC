Long term depression LTD is a neuronal learning mechanism after low frequency stimulation LFS. This study compares two types of electrodes concentric vs. matrix and stimulation frequencies 4 and 30 Hz to examine homo- and heterosynaptic effects indirectly depicted from the somatosensory profile of healthy subjects. Both electrodes were compared in a prospective randomized controlled cross-over study using 4 Hz as the conditioning LFS compared to 30 Hz intended sham condition. Quantitative sensory testing QST was used to examine 13 thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds. Sixteen healthy volunteers 10 women age 31.0  12.7 years were examined. Depending on the electrodes and frequencies used a divergent pattern of sensory minus signs occurred. Using LFS the concentric electrode increased thermal thresholds while the matrix electrode rather increased mechanical including deep pain thresholds. Findings after cutaneous neuromodulation using LFS and a matrix electrode are consistent with the concept of heterosynaptic LTD in the human nociceptive system where deep pain sensitivity was reduced after superficial stimulation of intraepidermal nerve fibres. Cutaneous neuromodulation using LFS and a matrix electrode may be a useful tool to influence deep pain sensitivity in a variety of chronic pain syndromes. Evidence of heterosynaptic LTD in the human nociceptive system: superficial skin neuromodulation using a matrix electrode reduces deep pain sensitivity.
