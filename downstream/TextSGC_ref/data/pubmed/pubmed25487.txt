"Here we demonstrate how a marmoset monkey can use a reinforcement learning RL Brain-Machine Interface BMI to effectively control the movements of a robot arm for a reaching task. In this work an actor-critic RL algorithm used neural ensemble activity in the monkeys motor cortext to control the robot movements during a two-target decision task. This novel approach to decoding offers unique advantages for BMI control applications. Compared to supervised learning decoding methods the actor-critic RL algorithm does not require an explicit set of training data to create a static control model but rather it incrementally adapts the model parameters according to its current performance in this case requiring only a very basic feedback signal. We show how this algorithm achieved high performance when mapping the monkeys neural states 94% to robot actions and only needed to experience a few trials before obtaining accurate real-time control of the robot arm. Since RL methods responsively adapt and adjust their parameters they can provide a method to create BMIs that are robust against perturbations caused by changes in either the neural input space or the output actions they generate under different task requirements or goals."
