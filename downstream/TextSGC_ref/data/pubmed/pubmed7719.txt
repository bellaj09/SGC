Electroencephalograph EEG classification is an important technology that can establish a mapping relationship between EEG features and cognitive tasks. Emerging matrix classifiers have been successfully applied to motor imagery MI EEG classification but they belong to shallow classifiers making powerful stacked generalization principle not exploited for automatically learning deep EEG features. To learn\xa0the high-level\xa0representation and\xa0abstraction we proposed a novel deep stacked support matrix machine DSSMM to improve the performance of existing shallow matrix classifiers in EEG classification. Deep stacked support matrix machine based representation learning for motor imagery EEG classification.
