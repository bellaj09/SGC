"Over the last several years the use of machine learning ML in neuroscience has been rapidly increasing. Here we review MLs contributions both realized and potential across several areas of systems neuroscience. We describe four primary roles of ML within neuroscience: 1 creating solutions to engineering problems 2 identifying predictive variables 3 setting benchmarks for simple models of the brain and 4 serving itself as a model for the brain. The breadth and ease of its applicability suggests that machine learning should be in the toolbox of most systems neuroscientists." The roles of supervised machine learning in systems neuroscience.
