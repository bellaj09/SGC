Accurate identification of potential interactions between drugs and protein targets is a critical step to accelerate drug discovery. Despite many relative experimental researches have been done in the past decades detecting drug-target interactions DTIs remains to be extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore many computational approaches have been developed for predicting drug-target associations on a large scale. Predicting drug-target interactions from drug structure and protein sequence using novel convolutional neural networks.
