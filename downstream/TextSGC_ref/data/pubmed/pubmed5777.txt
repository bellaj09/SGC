Hepatic encephalopathy HE as a complication of cirrhosis is a serious brain disease which may lead to death. Accurate diagnosis of HE and its intermediate stage i.e. minimal HE MHE is very important for possibly early diagnosis and treatment. Brain connectivity network as a simple representation of brain interaction has been widely used for the brain disease e.g. HE and MHE analysis. However those studies mainly focus on finding disease-related abnormal connectivity between brain regions although a large number of studies have indicated that some brain diseases are usually related to local structure of brain connectivity network i.e. subnetwork rather than solely on some single brain regions or connectivities. Also mining such disease-related subnetwork is a challenging task because of the complexity of brain network. To address this problem we proposed a novel frequent-subnetwork-based method to mine disease-related subnetworks for MHE classification. Specifically we first mine frequent subnetworks from both groups i.e. MHE patients and non-HE NHE patients respectively. Then we used the graph-kernel based method to select the most discriminative subnetworks for subsequent classification. We evaluate our proposed method on a MHE dataset with 77 cirrhosis patients including 38 MHE patients and 39 NHE patients. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only obtain the improved classification performance in comparison with state-of-the-art network-based methods but also identify disease-related subnetworks which can help us better understand the pathology of the brain diseases.
