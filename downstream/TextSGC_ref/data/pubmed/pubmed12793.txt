The stochastic gradient descent algorithm SGD is the main optimization solution in deep learning. The performance of SGD depends critically on how learning rates are tuned over time. In this paper we propose a novel energy index based optimization method EIOM to automatically adjust the learning rate in the backpropagation. Since a frequently occurring feature is more important than a rarely occurring feature we update the features to different extents according to their frequencies. We first define an energy neuron model and then design an energy index to describe the frequency of a feature. The learning rate is taken as a hyperparameter function according to the energy index. To empirically evaluate the EIOM we investigate different optimizers with three popular machine learning models: logistic regression multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network. The experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed EIOM compared with that of other optimization algorithms. Research on a learning rate with energy index in deep learning.
