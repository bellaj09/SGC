"Reinforcement learning RL-based decoders in brain-machine interfaces BMIs interpret dynamic neural activity without patients real limb movements. In conventional RL the goal state is selected by the user or defined by the physics of the problem and the decoder finds an optimal policy essentially by assigning credit over time which is normally very time-consuming. However BMI tasks require finding a good policy in very few trials which impose a limit on the complexity of the tasks that can be learned before the animal quits. Therefore this paper explores the possibility of letting the agent infer potential goals through actions over space with multiple objects using the instantaneous reward to assign credit spatially. A previous method attention-gated RL employs a multilayer perceptron trained with backpropagation but it is prone to local minima entrapment. We propose a quantized attention-gated kernel RL QAGKRL to avoid the local minima adaptation in spatial credit assignment and sparsify the network topology. The experimental results show that the QAGKRL achieves higher successful rates and more stable performance indicating its powerful decoding ability for more sophisticated BMI tasks as required in clinical applications."
