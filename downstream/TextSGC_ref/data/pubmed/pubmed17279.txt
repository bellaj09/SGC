"Although medical humanities courses taught by teachers from nonmedical backgrounds are not unusual now few studies have compared the outcome of medical humanities courses facilitated by physicians to that by teaching assistants majored in the liberal arts. The objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the satisfaction of medical students with medical humanities problem-based learning PBL classes facilitated by nonmedical teaching assistants TAF majored in the liberal arts and those facilitated by the attending physicians APF and 2 examine the satisfaction of medical students with clinical medicine-related and clinical medicine-unrelated medical humanities PBL classes.A total of 123 medical students randomly assigned to 16 groups participated in this study. There were 16 classes in the course: 8 of them were TAF classes; and the others were APF classes. Each week each group rotated from 1 subject of the 16 subjects of PBL to another subject. All of the 16 groups went through all the 16 subjects in the 2013 spring semester. We examined the medical students satisfaction with each class based on a rating score collected after each class was completed using a scale from 0 the lowest satisfaction to 100 the highest satisfaction. We also conducted multivariate linear regression analysis to examine the association between the independent variables and the students satisfaction.Medical students were more satisfied with the TAF 91.35\u200a\u200a7.75 medical humanities PBL classes than APF 90.40\u200a\u200a8.42 medical humanities PBL classes P\u200a=\u200a0.01. Moreover medical students were more satisfied with the clinical medicine-unrelated topics 92.00\u200a\u200a7.10 than the clinical medicine-related topics 90.36\u200a\u200a7.99 in the medical humanities PBL course P\u200a=\u200a0.01.This medical humanities PBL course including nonmedical subjects and topics and nonmedical teaching assistants from the liberal arts as class facilitators was satisfactory. This pedagogical approach of student-centered nonmedical topics nonmedical facilitators and small groups which is associated with a deep approach to learning medical humanities should be highly encouraged."
