Mr. Smith has been afflicted with the persistency of all his voices for almost 20\u2009years. To our knowledge this patient tried almost all possible treatments with little efficacy. This case highlights the difficulty of finding an adequate treatment for ultra-resistant patients. Mr. Smith first followed CBT before initiating AT. With AT he significantly improved in a way that was not observed with any other intervention and these improvements remained afterward. The severity of his positive symptoms as well as his depressive symptoms diminished and his most distressing persecutory voice disappeared. He was able to regain a life. The effects of AT went well beyond the patient the morale of the entire family improved.
