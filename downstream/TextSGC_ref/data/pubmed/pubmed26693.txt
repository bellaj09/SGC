The basal ganglia BG comprise multiple subcortical nuclei which are responsible for cognition and other functions. Developing a brain-machine interface BMI demands a suitable solution for the real-time implementation of a portable BG. In this study we used a digital hardware implementation of a BG network containing 256 modified Izhikevich neurons and 2048 synapses to reliably reproduce the biological characteristics of BG on a single field programmable gate array FPGA core. We also highlighted the role of Parkinsonian analysis by considering neural dynamics in the design of the hardware-based architecture. Thus we developed a multi-precision architecture based on a precise analysis using the FPGA-based platform with fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed embedding BG network can be applied to intelligent agents and neurorobotics as well as in BMI projects with clinical applications. Although we only characterized the BG network with Izhikevich models the proposed approach can also be extended to more complex neuron models and other types of functional networks.
