The main goal of this paper is a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of a virtual reality VR-based multidimensional approach to the treatment of body image attitudes and related constructs. The female obese patients n = 28 involved in a residential weight control treatment including low-calorie diet 1200 kcal/day and physical training were randomly assigned either to the VR treatment or to psychonutritional groups based on the cognitive-behavior approach. Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomatology attitudes toward food body dissatisfaction level of anxiety motivation for change level of assertiveness and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short-term the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular it was more effective in improving body satisfaction self-efficacy and motivation for change. The improvement was associated with a reduction in problematic eating and social behaviors. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can improve body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs. However given that this research that does not include a follow-up study the obtained results are preliminary. Virtual reality-based multidimensional therapy for the treatment of body image disturbances in obesity: a controlled study.
