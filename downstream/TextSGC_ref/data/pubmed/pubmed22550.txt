Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs for disabled people should allow them to use their remaining functionalities as control possibilities. BCIs connect the brain with external devices to perform the volition or intent of movement regardless if that individual is unable to perform the task due to body impairments. In this work we fuse electromyographic EMG with electroencephalographic EEG activity in a framework called "Hybrid-BCI" hBCI approach to control the movement of a simulated tibio-femoral joint. Two mathematical models of a tibio-femoral joint are used to emulate the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the knee. The interest is to reproduce different velocities of the human gait cycle. The EEG signals are used to classify the user intent which are the velocity changes meanwhile the superficial EMG signals are used to estimate the amplitude of such intent. A multi-level controller is used to solve the trajectory tracking problem involved. The lower level consists of an individual controller for each model it solves the tracking of the desired trajectory even considering different velocities of the human gait cycle. The mid-level uses a combination of a logical operator and a finite state machine for the switching between models. Finally the highest level consists in a support vector machine to classify the desired activity. Hybrid BCI approach to control an artificial tibio-femoral joint.
