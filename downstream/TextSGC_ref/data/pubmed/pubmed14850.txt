"A haptic device is an actuated human-machine interface utilized by an operator to dynamically interact with a remote environment. This interaction could be virtual virtual reality or physical such as using a robotic arm. To date different mechanisms have been considered to actuate the haptic device to reflect force feedback from the remote environment. In a low-force environment or limited working envelope the control of some actuation mechanisms such as hydraulic and pneumatic may be problematic. In the development of a haptic device challenges include limited space high accuracy or resolution limitations in kinematic and dynamic solutions points of singularity dexterity as well as control system development/design. Furthermore the haptic interface designed to operate in a magnetic resonance imaging environment adds additional challenges related to electromagnetic interference static/variable magnetic fields and the use of magnetic resonance-compatible materials. Such a device would allow functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain information on the subjects brain activity while performing a task. When used for surgical trainees functional magnetic resonance imaging could provide an assessment of surgical skills. In this application the trainee located supine within the magnet bore while observing the task environment on a graphical user interface uses a low-force magnetic resonance-compatible haptic device to perform virtual surgical tasks in a limited space. In the quest to develop such a device this review reports the multiple challenges faced and their potential solutions. The review also investigates efforts toward prototyping such devices and classifies the main components of a magnetic resonance-compatible device including actuation and sensory systems and materials used."
