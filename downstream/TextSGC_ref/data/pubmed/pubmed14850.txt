Speckle artifacts degrade image quality in virtually all modalities that utilize coherent energy including optical coherence tomography reflectance confocal microscopy ultrasound and widefield imaging with laser illumination. We present an adversarial deep learning framework for laser speckle reduction called DeepLSR https://durr.jhu.edu/DeepLSR that transforms images from a source domain of coherent illumination to a target domain of speckle-free incoherent illumination. We apply this method to widefield images of objects and tissues illuminated with a multi-wavelength laser using light emitting diode-illuminated images as ground truth. In images of gastrointestinal tissues DeepLSR reduces laser speckle noise by 6.4 dB compared to a 2.9 dB reduction from optimized non-local means processing a 3.0 dB reduction from BM3D and a 3.7 dB reduction from an optical speckle reducer utilizing an oscillating diffuser. Further DeepLSR can be combined with optical speckle reduction to reduce speckle noise by 9.4 dB. This dramatic reduction in speckle noise may enable the use of coherent light sources in applications that require small illumination sources and high-quality imaging including medical endoscopy.
