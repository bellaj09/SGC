Capturing long-range interactions between structural but not sequence neighbors of proteins is a long-standing challenging problem in bioinformatics. Recently long short-term memory LSTM networks have significantly improved the accuracy of speech and image classification problems by remembering useful past information in long sequential events. Here we have implemented deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural networks in the problem of protein intrinsic disorder prediction.
