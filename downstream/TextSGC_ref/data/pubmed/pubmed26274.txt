All neural information systems NIS rely on sensing neural activity to supply commands and control signals for computers machines and a variety of prosthetic devices. Invasive systems achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio SNR by eliminating the volume conduction problems caused by tissue and bone. An implantable brain machine interface BMI using intracortical electrodes provides excellent detection of a broad range of frequency oscillatory activities through the placement of a sensor in direct contact with cortex. This paper introduces a compact-sized implantable wireless 32-channel bidirectional brain machine interface BBMI to be used with freely-moving primates. The system is designed to monitor brain sensorimotor rhythms and present current stimuli with a configurable duration frequency and amplitude in real time to the brain based on the brain activity report. The battery is charged via a novel ultrasonic wireless power delivery module developed for efficient delivery of power into a deeply-implanted system. The system was successfully tested through bench tests and in vivo tests on a behaving primate to record the local field potential LFP oscillation and stimulate the target area at the same time.
