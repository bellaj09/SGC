Prior research in falls risk classification using inertial sensors has relied on the use of engineered features which has resulted in a feature space containing hundreds of features that are likely redundant and possibly irrelevant. In this paper we propose using fully convolutional neural networks FCNNs to classify older adults at low or high risk of falling using inertial sensor data collected from a smartphone. Due to the limited nature of older adult inertial gait datasets we first pre-train the FCNN models using a publicly available dataset for pedestrian activity recognition. Then via transfer learning we train the network for falls risk classification. We show that via transfer learning our falls risk classifier obtains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93.3% which is 10.6% higher than the equivalent model trained without the use of transfer learning. Additionally we show that our method outperforms other standard machine learning classifiers trained on features developed in prior research.
