Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD is the prototypical psychedelic drug but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling ASL blood oxygen level-dependent BOLD measures and magnetoencephalography MEG implemented during resting state conditions revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow CBF decreased visual cortex alpha power and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex V1 functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD\s marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug\s other characteristic effects on consciousness however. Rather decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex RSC correlated strongly with ratings of "ego-dissolution" and "altered meaning" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of "self" or "ego" and its processing of "meaning." Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.
