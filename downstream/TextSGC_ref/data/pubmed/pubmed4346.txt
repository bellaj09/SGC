Numerous studies have characterized impaired cerebral functioning in nicotine-addicted individuals. Whereas nicotine interacts with multiple neurotransmitters in cortical and subcortical circuits it directly targets the cholinergic system sourced primarily from the basal nucleus of Meynert BNM. However no studies have examined how this cholinergic system is influenced by cigarette smoking. Here we addressed this gap of research.
