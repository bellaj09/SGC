The first aim of this study was the development of performance metrics in a virtual reality simulation for interventional procedure in a real case of multivessel coronary disease. A second aim was to assess the construct validity of these metrics by comparing the performance of interventional cardiologists with different levels of experience. Development and construct validation of performance metrics for multivessel coronary interventions on the VIST virtual reality simulator at PCR2005.
