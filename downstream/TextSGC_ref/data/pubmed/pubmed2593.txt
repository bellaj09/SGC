We report on the role of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose F-FDG positron emission tomography PET scan examinations to contribute in the diagnosis of COVID-19 respiratory syndrome even in the case of asymptomatic left ventricular assist device LVAD recipients. Thus warm caution and thoughtful approaches for timely detection should be taken for our delicate LVAD population expecially if patients are currently living in a high density COVID-19 infected area and the pontential intention for LVAD treatment is bridge to transplantation. Contributory Role of Positron Emission Tomography in a Left Ventricular Assist Device Recipient at the time of COVID-19 pandemic.
