Diabetic Macular Edema DME is an advanced stage of Diabetic Retinopathy DR and can lead to permanent vision loss. Currently it affects 26.7 million people globally and on account of such a huge number of DME cases and the limited number of ophthalmologists it is desirable to automate the diagnosis process. Computer-assisted deep learning based diagnosis could help in early detection following which precision medication can help to mitigate the vision loss.
