Teaching of laparoscopic skills is a challenge in surgical training programs. Because of the highly technical nature and the steep learning curve students and residents must learn laparoscopic skills before performing them in the operating room. To improve efficiency of learning and patient safety research in simulation is essential. Two types of simulators currently in use include virtual reality and box trainers. Our study examined which simulator technique was most effective in teaching novice trainees laparoscopic techniques. Effectiveness of laparoscopic computer simulator versus usage of box trainer for endoscopic surgery training of novices.
