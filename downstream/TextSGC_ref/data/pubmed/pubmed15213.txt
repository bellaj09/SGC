"Person re-identification re-ID aims to robustly measure visual affinities between person images. It has wide applications in intelligent surveillance by associating same persons images across multiple cameras. It is generally treated as an image retrieval problem: given a probe person image the affinities between the probe image and gallery images P2G affinities are used to rank the retrieved gallery images. There exist two main challenges for effectively solving this problem. 1 Person images usually show significant variations because of different person poses and viewing angles. The spatial layouts and correspondences between person images are therefore vital information for tackling this problem. State-of-the-art methods either ignore such spatial variation or utilize extra pose information for handling the challenge. 2 Most existing person re-ID methods rank gallery images considering only P2G affinities but ignore the affinities between the gallery images G2G affinity. Such affinities could provide important clues for accurate gallery image ranking but were only utilized in post-processing stages by current methods. In this paper we propose a unified end-to-end deep learning framework to tackle the two challenges. For handling viewpoint and pose variations between compared person images we propose a novel Kronecker Product Matching operation to match and warp feature maps of different persons. Comparing warped feature maps results in more accurate P2G affinities. To fully utilize all available P2G and G2G affinities for accurately ranking gallery person images a novel group-shuffling random walk operation is proposed. Both Kronecker Product Matching and Group-shuffling Random Walk operations are end-to-end trainable and are shown to improve the learned visual features if integrated in the deep learning framework. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Market-1501 CUHK03 and DukeMTMC datasets which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our proposed approach.
