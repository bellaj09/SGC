Automatic and accurate lumbar vertebrae detection is an essential step of image-guided minimally invasive spine surgery IG-MISS. However traditional methods still require human intervention due to the similarity of vertebrae abnormal pathological conditions and uncertain imaging angle. In this paper we present a novel convolutional neural network CNN model to automatically detect lumbar vertebrae for C-arm X-ray images. Training data is augmented by DRR and automatic segmentation of ROI is able to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore a feature fusion deep learning FFDL model is introduced to combine two types of features of lumbar vertebrae X-ray images which uses sobel kernel and Gabor kernel to obtain the contour and texture of lumbar vertebrae respectively. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed model performs more accurate in abnormal cases with pathologies and surgical implants in multi-angle views.
