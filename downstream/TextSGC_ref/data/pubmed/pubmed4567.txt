The extent of brain damage in chronic stroke patients is traditionally defined as the necrotic tissue observed on magnetic resonance image MRI. However patients often exhibit symptoms suggesting that functional impairment may affect areas beyond the cortical necrotic lesion for example when cortical symptoms ensue after subcortical damage. This observation suggests that disconnection or diaschisis can lead to remote cortical dysfunction that can be functionally equivalent to direct cortical lesions. Objective. To directly measure subcortical disconnection after stroke. Mapping remote subcortical ramifications of injury after ischemic strokes.
