Autism spectrum disorder ASD encompasses a set of neurodevelopmental conditions whose striking sex-related disparity with an estimated male-to-female ratio of 4:1 remains unknown. Here we use magnetic resonance imaging MRI and diffusion weighted imaging DWI to identify the brain structure correlates of the sex-by-ASD diagnosis interaction in a carefully selected cohort of 110 ASD patients 55 females and 83 typically-developing TD subjects 40 females. The interaction was found to be predicated primarily upon white matter connectivity density innervating bilaterally the lateral aspect of the temporal lobe the temporo-parieto-occipital junction and the medial parietal lobe. By contrast regional gray matter GM thickness and volume are not found to modulate this interaction significantly. When interpreted in the context of previous studies our findings add considerable weight to three long-standing hypotheses according to which the sex disparity of ASD incidence is A due to WM connectivity rather than to GM differences B modulated to a large extent by temporoparietal connectivity and C accompanied by brain function differences driven by these effects. Our results contribute substantially to the task of unraveling the biological mechanisms giving rise to the sex disparity in ASD incidence whose clinical implications are significant. The connectomes of males and females with autism spectrum disorder have significantly different white matter connectivity densities.
