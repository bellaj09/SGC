Nonlinear system modeling plays an important role in practical engineering and deep learning-based deep belief network DBN is now popular in nonlinear system modeling and identification because of the strong learning ability. However the existing weights optimization for DBN is based on gradient which always leads to a local optimum and a poor training result. In this paper a DBN with partial least square regression PLSR-DBN is proposed for nonlinear system modeling which focuses on the problem of weights optimization for DBN using PLSR. Firstly unsupervised contrastive divergence CD algorithm is used in weights initialization. Secondly initial weights derived from CD algorithm are optimized through layer-by-layer PLSR modeling from top layer to bottom layer. Instead of gradient method PLSR-DBN can determine the optimal weights using several PLSR models so that a better performance of PLSR-DBN is achieved. Then the analysis of convergence is theoretically given to guarantee the effectiveness of the proposed PLSR-DBN model. Finally the proposed PLSR-DBN is tested on two benchmark nonlinear systems and an actual wastewater treatment system as well as a handwritten digit recognition nonlinear mapping and modeling with high-dimension input data. The experiment results show that the proposed PLSR-DBN has better performances of time and accuracy on nonlinear system modeling than that of other methods.
