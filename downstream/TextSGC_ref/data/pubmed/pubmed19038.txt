Aims: Evaluate the impact of a multifaceted knowledge translation KT strategy for the implementation of virtual reality VR intervention by rehabilitation clinicians in a pediatric hospital setting.Methods: Eleven therapists were recruited and completed a questionnaire on perceptions on VR usage. A multifaceted KT strategy was implemented over five months. VR usage was tracked and clinician perceptions were reassessed. Baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test evaluated changes pre- and post-KT.Results: Perceived ease of use behavioral control self-efficacy and barriers to use improved significantly post-KT; however intention to use did not. Usage was higher pre-KT than the last two months of KT. Pre-KT barriers included system setup and use knowledge of games and lack of resources whereas post-KT they were the lack of appropriate patients and patient-specific experience. KT supports and patient engagement were reasons for continued use.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of supporting clinicians when implementing VR in clinical rehabilitation. Clinicians benefit from experiential and individualized learning opportunities peer-led coaching and hands-on training. Whether these strategies translate to increased usage and how usage is influenced by environmental factors i.e. lack of appropriate clients warrants additional research.
