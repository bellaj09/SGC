The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an interactive multimedia CD-ROM with traditional methods of teaching the skill of performing a 12-lead ECG. A randomized pre/posttest experimental design was used. Seventy-seven baccalaureate nursing students in a required senior-level critical-care course at a large midwestern university were recruited for the study. Two teaching methods were compared. The traditional method included a self-study module a brief lecture and demonstration by an instructor and hands-on experience using a plastic manikin and a real 12-lead ECG machine in the learning laboratory. The second method covered the same content using an interactive multimedia CD-ROM embedded with virtual reality and supplemented with a self-study module. There were no significant p < .05 baseline differences in pretest scores between the two groups and no significant differences by group in cognitive gains student satisfaction with their learning method or perception of self-efficacy in performing the skill. Overall results indicated that both groups were satisfied with their instructional method and were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly on a live simulated patient. This evaluation study is a beginning step to assess new and potentially more cost-effective teaching methods and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors including the transfer of skill acquisition via a computer simulation to a real patient. Technology-based vs. traditional instruction. A comparison of two methods for teaching the skill of performing a 12-lead ECG.
