This study is a single blind randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of virtual reality-based postural control training on the gait ability in patients with chronic stroke. Sixteen subjects were randomly assigned to either experimental group VR n= 8 or control group CPT n= 8. Subjects in both groups received conventional physical therapy for 60 min per day five days per week during a period of four weeks. Subjects in the VR group received additional augmented reality-based training for 30 min per day three days per week during a period of four weeks. The subjects were evaluated one week before and after participating in a four week training and follow-up at one month post-training. Data derived from the gait analyses included spatiotemporal gait parameters 10 meters walking test 10 mWT. In the gait parameters subjects in the VR group showed significant improvement except for cadence at post-training and follow-up within the experimental group. However no obvious significant improvement was observed within the control group. In between group comparisons the experimental group VR group showed significantly greater improvement only in stride length compared with the control group P< 0.05 however no significant difference was observed in other gait parameters. In conclusion we demonstrate significant improvement in gait ability in chronic stroke patients who received virtual reality based postural control training. These findings suggest that virtual reality VR postural control training using real-time information may be a useful approach for enhancement of gait ability in patients with chronic stroke. Clinical usefulness of the virtual reality-based postural control training on the gait ability in patients with stroke.
