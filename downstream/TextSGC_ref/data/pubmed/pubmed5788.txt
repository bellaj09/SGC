Protein-protein interactions PPIs play an important role in the life activities of organisms. With the availability of large amounts of protein sequence data PPIs prediction methods have attracted increasing attention. A variety of protein sequence coding methods have emerged but the training of these methods is particularly time consuming. To solve this issue we have proposed a novel matrix sequence coding method. Based on deep neural network DNN and a novel matrix protein sequence descriptor we constructed a protein interaction prediction model for predicting PPIs. When performed on human PPIs data the method achieved an accuracy of 94.34% a recall of 98.28% an area under the curve AUC of 97.79% and a loss of 23.25%. A non-redundant dataset was used to evaluate this prediction model and the prediction accuracy is 88.29%. These results indicate that the matrix of sequence MOS descriptor can enhance the predictive power of PPIs and reduce training time which can be a useful complement for future proteomics research.
