The hypothesis that cortical dynamics operates near criticality also suggests that it exhibits universal critical exponents which marks the Kuramoto equation a fundamental model for synchronization as a prime candidate for an underlying universal model. Here we determined the synchronization behavior of this model by solving it numerically on a large weighted human connectome network containing 836733 nodes in an assumed homeostatic state. Since this graph has a topological dimension d\u2009<\u20094 a real synchronization phase transition is not possible in the thermodynamic limit still we could locate a transition between partially synchronized and desynchronized states. At this crossover point we observe power-law-tailed synchronization durations with t\u2009\u20091.21 away from experimental values for the brain. For comparison on a large two-dimensional lattice having additional random long-range links we obtain a mean-field value: t\u2009\u20091.61. However below the transition of the connectome we found global coupling control-parameter dependent exponents 1\u2009<\u2009t\u2009\u20092 overlapping with the range of human brain experiments. We also studied the effects of random flipping of a small portion of link weights mimicking a network with inhibitory interactions and found similar results. The control-parameter dependent exponent suggests extended dynamical criticality below the transition point.
