"Deep brain stimulation DBS of reward system brain areas such as the medial forebrain bundle MFB by means of intracranial self-stimulation ICSS facilitates learning and memory in rodents. MFB-ICSS has been found capable of modifying different plasticity-related proteins but its underlying molecular mechanisms require further elucidation. MicroRNAs miRNAs and the longevity-associated SIRT1 protein have emerged as important regulatory molecules implicated in neural plasticity. Thus we aimed to analyze the effects of MFB-ICSS on miRNAs expression and SIRT1 protein levels in hippocampal subfields and serum. We used OpenArray to select miRNA candidates differentially expressed in the dentate gyrus DG of ICSS-treated 3 sessions 45 session/day and sham rats. We further analyzed the expression of these miRNAs together with candidates selected after bibliographic screening miR-132-3p miR-134-5p miR-146a-5p miR-181c-5p in DG CA1 and CA3 as well as in serum by qRT-PCR. We also assessed tissue and serum SIRT1 protein levels by Western Blot and ELISA respectively. Expression of miR-132-3p miR-181c-5p miR-495-3p and SIRT1 protein was upregulated in DG of ICSS rats P\u2009<\u20090.05. None of the analyzed molecules was regulated in CA3 while miR-132-3p was also increased in CA1 P\u2009=\u20090.011 and serum P\u2009=\u20090.048. This work shows for the first time that a DBS procedure specifically MFB-ICSS modulates the levels of plasticity-related miRNAs and SIRT1 in specific hippocampal subfields. The mechanistic role of these molecules could be key to the improvement of memory by MFB-ICSS. Moreover regarding the proposed clinical applicability of DBS serum miR-132 is suggested as a potential treatment biomarker."
