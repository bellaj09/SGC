Regions of human medial prefrontal cortex mPFC and posterior cingulate cortex PCC are part of the default network DN and additionally are implicated in diverse cognitive functions ranging from autobiographical memory to subjective valuation. Our ability to interpret the apparent co-localization of task-related effects with DN-regions is constrained by a limited understanding of the individual-level heterogeneity in mPFC/PCC functional organization. Here we used cortical surface-based meta-analysis to identify a parcel in human PCC that was more strongly associated with the DN than with valuation effects. We then used resting-state fMRI data and a data-driven network analysis algorithm spectral partitioning to partition mPFC and PCC into "DN" and "non-DN" subdivisions in individual participants n\u202f=\u202f100 from the Human Connectome Project. The spectral partitioning algorithm identified individual-level cortical subdivisions that varied markedly across individuals especially in mPFC and were reliable across test/retest datasets. Our results point toward new strategies for assessing whether distinct cognitive functions engage common or distinct mPFC subregions at the individual level. Spectral partitioning identifies individual heterogeneity in the functional network topography of ventral and anterior medial prefrontal cortex.
