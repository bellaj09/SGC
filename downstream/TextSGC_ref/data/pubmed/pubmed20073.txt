Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skills Trainer VBLaST is a virtual reality trainer that replicates the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS tasks for training in minimally invasive surgery. For the ligation loop task we have developed a novel hardware interface using a linear motion stroke potentiometer to accurately sense the linear translation of the ligation loop and a mechanism to attach the tool interface to a PHANToM Omni for force feedback. Testing shows that the interface provided a realistic feel and control of the loop similar to the endoloop device used in FLS ligation loop task. Use of a linear motion stroke potentiometer as a high precision sensor for linear translation in a laparoscopic ligating loop simulation.
