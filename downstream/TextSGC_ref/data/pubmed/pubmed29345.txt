"There is great interest in closed-loop neurostimulators that sense and respond to a patients brain state. Such systems may have value for neurological and psychiatric illnesses where symptoms have high intraday variability. Animal models of closed-loop stimulators would aid preclinical testing. We therefore sought to demonstrate that rodents can directly control a closed-loop limbic neurostimulator via a brain-computer interface BCI." Pre-frontal control of closed-loop limbic neurostimulation by rodents using a brain-computer interface.
