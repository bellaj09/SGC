Currently the development of medicines for complex diseases requires the development of combination drug therapies. It is necessary because in many cases one drug cannot target all necessary points of intervention. For example in cancer therapy a physician often meets a patient having a genomic profile including more than five molecular aberrations. Drug combination therapy has been an area of interest for a while for example the classical work of Loewe devoted to the synergism of drugs was published in 1928-and it is still used in calculations for optimal drug combinations. More recently over the past several years there has been an explosion in the available information related to the properties of drugs and the biomedical parameters of patients. For the drugs hundreds of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors for medicines are now available while for patients large data sets related to genetic/proteomic and metabolomics profiles of the patients are now available as well as the more traditional data relating to the histology history of treatments pretreatment state of the organism etc. Moreover during disease progression the genetic profile can change. Thus the ability to optimize drug combinations for each patient is rapidly moving beyond the comprehension and capabilities of an individual physician. This is the reason that biomedical informatics methods have been developed and one of the more promising directions in this field is the application of artificial intelligence AI. In this review we discuss several AI methods that have been successfully implemented in several instances of combination drug therapy from HIV hypertension infectious diseases to cancer. The data clearly show that the combination of rule-based expert systems with machine learning algorithms may be promising direction in this field. Artificial intelligence in drug combination therapy.
