"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is an imaging technique that relies on the principle of shining near-infrared light through tissue to detect changes in hemodynamic activation. An important methodological issue encountered is the creation of optimized probe geometry for fNIRS recordings. Here across three experiments we describe and validate a processing pipeline designed to create an optimized yet scalable probe geometry based on selected regions of interest ROIs from the functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI literature. In experiment 1 we created a probe geometry optimized to record changes in activation from target ROIs important for visual working memory. Positions of the sources and detectors of the probe geometry on an adult head were digitized using a motion sensor and projected onto a generic adult atlas and a segmented head obtained from the subjects MRI scan. In experiment 2 the same probe geometry was scaled down to fit a childs head and later digitized and projected onto the generic adult atlas and a segmented volume obtained from the childs MRI scan. Using visualization tools and by quantifying the amount of intersection between target ROIs and channels we show that out of 21 ROIs 17 and 19 ROIs intersected with fNIRS channels from the adult and child probe geometries respectively. Further both the adult atlas and adult subject-specific MRI approaches yielded similar results and can be used interchangeably. However results suggest that segmented heads obtained from MRI scans be used for registering childrens data. Finally in experiment 3 we further validated our processing pipeline by creating a different probe geometry designed to record from target ROIs involved in language and motor processing."
