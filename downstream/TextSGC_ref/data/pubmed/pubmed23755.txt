Retinal prostheses have been developed to fight blindness in people affected by outer retinal layer dystrophies. To date few hundred patients have received a retinal implant. Inspired by intraocular lenses we have designed a foldable and photovoltaic wide-field epiretinal prosthesis named POLYRETINA capable of stimulating wireless retinal ganglion cells. Here we show that within a visual angle of 46.3 degrees POLYRETINA embeds 2215 stimulating pixels of which 967 are in the central area of 5\u2009mm it is foldable to allow implantation through a small scleral incision and it has a hemispherical shape to match the curvature of the eye. We demonstrate that it is not cytotoxic and respects optical and thermal safety standards; accelerated ageing shows a lifetime of at least 2 years. POLYRETINA represents significant progress towards the improvement of both visual acuity and visual field with the same device a current challenging issue in the field. Design and validation of a foldable and photovoltaic wide-field epiretinal prosthesis.
