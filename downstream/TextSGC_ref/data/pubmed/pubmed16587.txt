"More than 30 years after signing truces there are still around 20000 Portuguese war veterans that fill PTSD Posttraumatic Stress Disorder diagnose criteria. Despite many of them attending therapy the outcome is not cheerful. In this way a research protocol was devised to investigate the opportunity of adopting virtual reality exposure therapy VRET to reduce PTSD symptomathology. This protocol consists on a controlled study VRET vs. traditional psychotherapy vs. waiting list where in the VRET condition patients will be graded by being exposed to a virtual reality jungle scenario. The activating episodes that are comprised of three cues ambush mortar blasting and waiting for injured rescue are repeated 3 times each session. The cues intensity and frequency increase from session to session. Patients are exposed to the VR world through a HMD Head Mounted Display. This paper reports on the ongoing research where 4 VRET patients that filled CAPS DSM-IV PTSD criteria were assessed at pretreatment and at the middle of treatment 5th session. Results from IES and SCL-90R dimensions showed no statistical significant differences between assessments with exception to obsession-compulsion dimension of SCL-90R F1;3=21.235; p<.05 indicating a decrease in obsessive thoughts. However through descriptive analysis it was observed a reduction in all IES and SCL-90R dimensions except for hostility and psychoticism of SCL-90R."
