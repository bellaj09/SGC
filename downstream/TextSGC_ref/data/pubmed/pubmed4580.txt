"Numerous studies have revealed the key role of social pressure on individuals decision-making processes. However the impact of social pressure on unfairness-related decision-making processes remains unclear. In the present study we investigated how social pressure modulated mens and womens responses in an ultimatum game. Twenty women and eighteen men played the ultimatum game as responders in the scanner where fair and unfair offers were tendered by proposers acting alone low pressure or by proposers endorsed by three supporters high pressure. Results showed that men rejected more whereas women accepted more unfair offers in the high versus low pressure context. Neurally pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activation in women positively predicted their acceptance rate difference between contexts. In men stronger right anterior insula activation and increased connectivity between right anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were observed when they receiving unfair offers in the high than low pressure context. Furthermore more bilateral anterior insula and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activations were found when men rejected relative to accepted unfair offers in the high than low pressure context. These findings highlighted gender differences in the modulation of behavioral and neural responses to unfairness by social pressure."
