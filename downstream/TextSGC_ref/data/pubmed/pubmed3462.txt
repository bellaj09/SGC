Functional magnetic resonance imaging data are commonly collected during the resting state. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI is very practical and applicable for a wide range of study populations. Rs-fMRI is usually collected in at least one of three different conditions/tasks eyes closed EC eyes open EO or eyes fixated on an object EO-F. Several studies have shown that there are significant condition-related differences in the acquired data. In this study we compared the functional network connectivity FNC differences assessed via group independent component analysis on a large rs-fMRI dataset collected in both EC and EO-F conditions and also investigated the effect of covariates e.g. age gender and social status score. Our results indicated that task condition significantly affected a wide range of networks; connectivity of visual networks to themselves and other networks was increased during EO-F while EC was associated with increased connectivity of auditory and sensorimotor networks to other networks. In addition the association of FNC with age gender and social status was observed to be significant only in the EO-F condition though limited as well. However statistical analysis did not reveal any significant effect of interaction between eyes status and covariates. These results indicate that resting-state condition is an important variable that may limit the generalizability of clinical findings using rs-fMRI.
