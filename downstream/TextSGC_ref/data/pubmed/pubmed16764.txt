"Gait coordination and balance may be severely compromised in patients with multiple sclerosis MS with considerable consequences on the patients daily living activities psychological status and quality of life. For this reason MS patients may benefit from robotic-rehabilitation and virtual reality training sessions. Aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of robot-assisted gait training RAGT equipped with virtual reality VR system in MS patients with walking disabilities EDSS 4.0 to 5.5 as compared to RAGT without VR. We enrolled 40 patients randomized into two groups undergoing forty RAGTVR sessions over eight weeks. All the patients were assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment by using specific scales. Effect sizes were very small and non-significant between the groups for Berg Balance Scale -0.019 CI95% -2.403 to 2.365 and TUG -0.064 95%CI -0.408 to 0.536 favoring RAGT+VR. Effects were moderate-to-large and significant for positive attitude -0.505 95%CI -3.615 to 2.604 and problem-solving -0.905 95%CI -2.113 to 0.302 sub-items of Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced thus largely favoring RAGT+VR. Our findings show that RAGT combined with VR is an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with walking disability as compared to RAGT without VR. We may hypothesize that VR may strengthen RAGT thanks to the entrainment of different brain areas involved in motor panning and learning."
