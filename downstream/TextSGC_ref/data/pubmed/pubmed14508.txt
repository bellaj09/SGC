"Deep learning methodologies have revolutionized prediction in many fields and show potential to do the same in molecular biology and genetics. However applying these methods in their current forms ignores evolutionary dependencies within biological systems and can result in false positives and spurious conclusions. We developed two approaches that account for evolutionary relatedness in machine learning models: i gene-family-guided splitting and ii ortholog contrasts. The first approach accounts for evolution by constraining model training and testing sets to include different gene families. The second approach uses evolutionarily informed comparisons between orthologous genes to both control for and leverage evolutionary divergence during the training process. The two approaches were explored and validated within the context of mRNA expression level prediction and have the area under the ROC curve auROC values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Model weight inspections showed biologically interpretable patterns resulting in the hypothesis that the 3 UTR is more important for fine-tuning mRNA abundance levels while the 5 UTR is more important for large-scale changes."
