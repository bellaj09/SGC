There is a learning curve in the acquisition of endovascular skills for the treatment of vascular disease. Integration of Virtual reality VR simulator based training into the educational training curriculum offers a potential solution to overcome this learning curve. However evidence-based training curricula that define which tasks how often and in which order they should be performed have yet to be developed. The aim of this study was to determine the nature of skills acquisition on the renal and iliac modules of a commercially-available VR simulator. Identification of skills common to renal and iliac endovascular procedures performed on a virtual reality simulator.
