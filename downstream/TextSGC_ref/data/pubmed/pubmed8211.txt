"Improving imaging quality is a fundamental problem in ultrasound contrast agent imaging UCAI research. Plane wave imaging PWI has been deemed as a potential method for UCAI due to its high frame rate and low mechanical index. High frame rate can improve the temporal resolution of UCAI. Meanwhile low mechanical index is essential to UCAI since microbubbles can be easily broken under high mechanical index conditions. However the clinical practice of ultrasound contrast agent plane wave imaging UCPWI is still limited by poor imaging quality for lack of transmit focus. The purpose of this study was to propose and validate a new post-processing method that combined with deep learning to improve the imaging quality of UCPWI. The proposed method consists of three stages: 1 first a deep learning approach based on U-net was trained to differentiate the microbubble and tissue radio frequency RF signals; 2 then to eliminate the remaining tissue RF signals the bubble approximated wavelet transform BAWT combined with maximum eigenvalue threshold was employed. BAWT can enhance the UCA area brightness and eigenvalue threshold can be set to eliminate the interference areas due to the large difference of maximum eigenvalue between UCA and tissue areas; 3 finally the accurate microbubble imaging were obtained through eigenspace-based minimum variance ESBMV."
