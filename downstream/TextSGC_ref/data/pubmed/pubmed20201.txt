In the last three decades simulation has become a key tool in the training of doctors and the maintenance of patient safety. Simulation offers an immersive realistic way of learning technical skills. Recent changes to the training schemes in many surgical specialities mean that the hours spent working between senior house officer and consultant have been reduced. This combined with other pressures such as reduced operating hours means that surgery has moved away from its traditional apprenticeship model and toward a competency-based one. Simulation can be a standardized and safe method for training and assessing surgeons. Use of simulation for training has become significant alongside the development of laparoscopic techniques and evidence suggests that skills obtained in simulation are applicable in real clinical scenarios. Simulation allows trainees to make mistakes to ask the "what if?" questions and to learn and reflect on such situations without risking patient safety. Virtual reality simulators have been used to allow experts to plan complicated operations and assess perioperative risks. Most recently fully immersive simulations such as those with whole theater teams involved and patient-centered simulations allow development of other key skills aside from purely technical ones. Use of simulation in isolation from traditional teaching methods will furnish the surgeon in training with skills but the best time and place to use such skills comes only with experience. In this article we examine the role of simulation in surgical training and its impact in the context of reduced training time. The role and validity of surgical simulation.
