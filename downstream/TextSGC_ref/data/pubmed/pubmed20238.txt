This paper deals with the developed researches and applications on telerobotic surgery devoted to human patients and with training by virtual reality. The researches have been developed in cooperation between Telerobotics Laboratory Department of Mechanics Politecnico di Milano Italy and Automation and Control Section Jet Propulsion Laboratory Pasadena USA. The researches carried to a telesurgery robotic operation on a dummy on 7th July 1993 by means of satellites communications to a prostatic biopsy on a human patient on 1st September 1995 with optical fibers to results on time delay effects to results on virtual reality applications for training on laparoscopy and surgery. The search implied time delay when the control input originated in Politecnico di Milano Italy. The results were satisfactory but also pointed out the need for specific new control transformations to ease the operator\s or surgeon\s visual/mental workload for hand-eye coordination. In the same research dummy force commands from JPL to Milan were sent and were echoed immediately back to JPL measuring the round-trip time of the command signal. This to some degree simulates a contact force feedback situation. The results were very surprising; despite the fact that the ISDN calls are closed and "private" calls the round-trip time exhibited great variations not only between calls but also within the same call. The results proved that telerobotics and telecontrol may be applied to surgery. Time latency variations are caused by features of communication network of sending and receiving end computer software. The problem and its solution is also an architectural issue and considerable improvements are possible. Virtual reality in the application of the research is a strong support to training on virtual objects and not on living beings.
