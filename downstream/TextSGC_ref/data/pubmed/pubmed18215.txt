Neurosurgeons are faced with the challenge of planning performing and learning complex surgical procedures. With improvements in computational power and advances in visual and haptic display technologies augmented and virtual surgical environments can offer potential benefits for tests in a safe and simulated setting as well as improve management of real-life procedures. This systematic literature review is conducted in order to investigate the roles of such advanced computing technology in neurosurgery subspecialization of intracranial tumor removal. The study would focus on an in-depth discussion on the role of virtual reality and augmented reality in the management of intracranial tumors: the current status foreseeable challenges and future developments. Virtual reality and augmented reality in the management of intracranial tumors: A review.
