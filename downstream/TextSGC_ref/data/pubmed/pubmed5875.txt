While predominant models of visual word form area VWFA function argue for its specific role in decoding written language other accounts propose a more general role of VWFA in complex visual processing. However a comprehensive examination of structural and functional VWFA circuits and their relationship to behavior has been missing. Here using high-resolution multimodal imaging data from a large Human Connectome Project cohort N\u2009=\u2009313 we demonstrate robust patterns of VWFA connectivity with both canonical language and attentional networks. Brain-behavior relationships revealed a striking pattern of double dissociation: structural connectivity of VWFA with lateral temporal language network predicted language but not visuo-spatial attention abilities while VWFA connectivity with dorsal fronto-parietal attention network predicted visuo-spatial attention but not language abilities. Our findings support a multiplex model of VWFA function characterized by distinct circuits for integrating language and attention and point to connectivity-constrained cognition as a key principle of human brain organization. The visual word form area VWFA is part of both language and attention circuitry.
