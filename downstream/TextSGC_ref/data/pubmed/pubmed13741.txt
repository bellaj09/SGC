Lung sounds convey relevant information related to pulmonary disorders and to evaluate patients with pulmonary conditions the physician or the doctor uses the traditional auscultation technique. However this technique suffers from limitations. For example if the physician is not well trained this may lead to a wrong diagnosis. Moreover lung sounds are non-stationary complicating the tasks of analysis recognition and distinction. This is why developing automatic recognition systems can help to deal with these limitations. In this paper we compare three machine learning approaches for lung sounds classification. The first two approaches are based on the extraction of a set of handcrafted features trained by three different classifiers support vector machines k-nearest neighbor and Gaussian mixture models while the third approach is based on the design of convolutional neural networks CNN. In the first approach we extracted the 12 MFCC coefficients from the audio files then calculated six MFCCs statistics. We also experimented normalization using zero mean and unity variance to enhance accuracy. In the second approach the local binary pattern LBP features are extracted from the visual representation of the audio files spectrograms. The features are normalized using whitening. The dataset used in this work consists of seven classes normal coarse crackle fine crackle monophonic wheeze polyphonic wheeze squawk and stridor. We have also experimentally tested dataset augmentation techniques on the spectrograms to enhance the ultimate accuracy of the CNN. The results show that CNN outperformed the handcrafted feature based classifiers. Lung sounds classification using convolutional neural networks.
