P300-based Brain Computer Interfaces offer communication pathways which are independent of muscle activity. Mostly visual stimuli e.g. blinking of different letters are used as a paradigm of interaction. Neural degenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS also cause a decrease in sight but the ability of hearing is usually unaffected. Therefore the use of the auditory modality might be preferable. This work presents a multiclass BCI paradigm using two-dimensional auditory stimuli: cues are varying in pitch high/medium/low and location left/middle/right. The resulting nine different classes are embedded in a predictive text system enabling to spell a letter with a 9-class decision. Moreover an unbalanced subtrial selection is investigated and compared to the well-established sequence-wise paradigm. Twelve healthy subjects participated in an online study to investigate these approaches. Two-dimensional auditory p300 speller with predictive text system.
