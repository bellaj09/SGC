"Several applications exist for a whole brain positron-emission tomography PET brain imager designed as a portable unit that can be worn on a patients head. Enabled by improvements in detector technology a lightweight high performance device would allow PET brain imaging in different environments and during behavioral tasks. Such a wearable system that allows the subjects to move their heads and walk-the Ambulatory Microdose PET AM-PET-is currently under development. This imager will be helpful for testing subjects performing selected activities such as gestures virtual reality activities and walking. The need for this type of lightweight mobile device has led to the construction of a proof of concept portable head-worn unit that uses twelve silicon photomultiplier SiPM PET module sensors built into a small ring which fits around the head. This paper is focused on the engineering design of mechanical support aspects of the AM-PET project both of the current device as well as of the coming next-generation devices. The goal of this work is to optimize design of the scanner and its mechanics to improve comfort for the subject by reducing the effect of weight and to enable diversification of its applications amongst different research activities."
