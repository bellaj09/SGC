We investigate whether an electroencephalography technique could be used for yes/no communication with auditory scanning. To be usable by the target group i.e. minimally conscious individuals such a brain-computer interface BCI has to be very simple and robust. This leads to the concept of a single-switch BCI ssBCI. With an ssBCI it is possible to reliably detect one certain individually trained brain pattern of the individual and use it to control all kinds of applications using yes/no responses. A total of 10 healthy volunteers 20-27 years participated in an initial cue-based session with a motor imagery MI task after brisk passive feet/hand movement. Four of them reached MI classification accuracies above 70% and thus fulfilled the inclusion criterion for participation in the 2nd session. In the 2nd session MI was used to communicate yes/no answers to a series of questions in an auditory scanning mode. Two of the three participants of the 2nd session were able to reliably communicate their intent with 90% or above correct and 0% false responses. This work showed for the 1st time the use of a ssBCI based on passive and imagined movements for communication in auditory scanning mode. A single-switch BCI based on passive and imagined movements: toward restoring communication in minimally conscious patients.
