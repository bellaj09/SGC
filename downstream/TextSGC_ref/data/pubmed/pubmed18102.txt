The amygdala and the cerebellum serve two distinctively different functions. The amygdala plays a role in the expression of emotional information whereas the cerebellum is involved in the timing of discrete motor responses. Interaction between these two systems is the basis of the two-stage theory of learning according to which an encounter with a challenging event triggers fast classical conditioning of fear-conditioned responses in the amygdala and slow conditioning of motor-conditioned responses in the cerebellum. A third stage was hypothesised when an apparent interaction between amygdala and cerebellar associative plasticity was observed: an adaptive rate of cerebellum-dependent motor-conditioned responses was associated with a decrease in amygdala-dependent fear-conditioned responses and was interpreted as extinction of amygdala-related fear-conditioned responses by the cerebellar output. To explore this hypothesis we mimicked some components of classical eyeblink conditioning in anesthetised rats by applying an aversive periorbital pulse as an unconditioned stimulus and a train of pulses to the cerebellar output nuclei as a cerebellar neuronal-conditioned response. The central amygdala multiple unit response to the periorbital pulse was measured with or without a preceding train to the cerebellar output nuclei. The results showed that activation of the cerebellar output nuclei prior to periorbital stimulation produced diverse patterns of inhibition of the amygdala response to the periorbital aversive stimulus depending upon the nucleus stimulated the laterality of the nucleus stimulated and the stimulus interval used. These results provide a putative extinction mechanism of learned fear behavior and could have implications for the treatment of pathologies involving abnormal fear responses by using motor training as therapy.
