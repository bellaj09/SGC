Geographical origin determination of white rice has become the major issue of food industry. However there is still lack of\xa0a high-throughput method for rapidly and reproducibly differentiating the geographical origins of commercial white rice. In this study we developed a method that employed lipidomics and deep learning to discriminate white rice from Korea to China. A total of 126 white rice of 30 cultivars from different regions were utilized for the method development and validation. By using direct infusion-mass spectrometry-based targeted lipidomics 17 lysoglycerophospholipids were simultaneously characterized within minutes per sample. Unsupervised data exploration showed a noticeable overlap of white rice between two countries. In addition lysophosphatidylcholines lysoPCs were prominent in white rice from Korea while lysophosphatidylethanolamines lysoPEs were enriched in white rice from China. A deep learning prediction model was built using 2014 white rice and validated using two different batches of 2015 white rice. The model accurately discriminated white rice from two countries. Among 10 selected predictors lysoPC18:2 lysoPC14:0 and lysoPE16:0 were the three most important features. Random forest and gradient boosting machine models also worked well in this circumstance. In conclusion this study provides an architecture for high-throughput classification of white rice from different geographical origins. Development and assessment of a lysophospholipid-based deep learning model to discriminate geographical origins of white rice.
