Decompression sickness DCS is a rare and dangerous complication from a rapid decrease in environmental pressure commonly seen in patients leaving a compressed-air environment such as scuba divers aviators and deep tunnel workers. Failure to clinically diagnose and adequately treat DCS with hydration and supplemental oxygen before bridging to hyperbaric oxygen HBO therapy can result in permanent residual symptoms or in rare cases death. Despite the increasing incidence of DCS there are limited published simulation case studies discussing this perilous environmental exposure.
