In contrast to many western nations where family medicine is a cornerstone of the primary care workforce in Japan the specialty is still developing. A number of services within the bailiwick of family medicine have yet to be fully incorporated into Japanese family medicine training programs especially those associated with sexual health. This gap constitutes a lost opportunity for addressing sexual health-related conditions including cancer prevention diagnosis and treatment. In this mixed methods case study we investigated the perceived acceptability and impact of a standardized patient instructor SPI program that trained Japanese family medicine residents in female breast pelvic male genital and prostate examinations. The cultural context of teaching and learning sexual health care examinations in Japan: a mixed methods case study assessing the use of standardized patient instructors among Japanese family physician trainees of the Shizuoka Family Medicine Program.
