This paper describes a multi-material virtual prototyping MMVP system for modelling and digital fabrication of discrete and functionally graded multi-material objects for biomedical applications. The MMVP system consists of a DMMVP module an FGMVP module and a virtual reality VR simulation module. The DMMVP module is used to model discrete multi-material DMM objects while the FGMVP module is for functionally graded multi-material FGM objects. The VR simulation module integrates these two modules to perform digital fabrication of multi-material objects which can be subsequently visualized and analysed in a virtual environment to optimize MMLM processes for fabrication of product prototypes. Using the MMVP system two biomedical objects including a DMM human spine and an FGM intervertebral disc spacer are modelled and digitally fabricated for visualization and analysis in a VR environment. These studies show that the MMVP system is a practical tool for modelling visualization and subsequent fabrication of biomedical objects of discrete and functionally graded multi-materials for biomedical applications. The system may be adapted to control MMLM machines with appropriate hardware for physical fabrication of biomedical objects. Digital fabrication of multi-material biomedical objects.
