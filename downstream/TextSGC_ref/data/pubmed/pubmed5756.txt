"The brain is a large-scale complex network whose workings rely on the interaction between its various regions. In the past few years the organization of the human brain network has been studied extensively using concepts from graph theory where the brain is represented as a set of nodes connected by edges. This representation of the brain as a connectome can be used to assess important measures that reflect its topological architecture. We have developed a freeware MatLab-based software BRAPH-BRain Analysis using graPH theory for connectivity analysis of brain networks derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI functional MRI fMRI positron emission tomography PET and electroencephalogram EEG data. BRAPH allows building connectivity matrices calculating global and local network measures performing non-parametric permutations for group comparisons assessing the modules in the network and comparing the results to random networks. By contrast to other toolboxes it allows performing longitudinal comparisons of the same patients across different points in time. Furthermore even though a user-friendly interface is provided the architecture of the program is modular object-oriented so that it can be easily expanded and customized. To demonstrate the abilities of BRAPH we performed structural and functional graph theory analyses in two separate studies. In the first study using MRI data we assessed the differences in global and nodal network topology in healthy controls patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimers disease. In the second study using resting-state fMRI data we compared healthy controls and Parkinsons patients with mild cognitive impairment."
