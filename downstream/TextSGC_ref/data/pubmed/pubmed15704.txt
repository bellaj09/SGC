"Despite the clinical importance of the question a number of methodological issues have limited firm conclusions regarding the cognitive safety of deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN in Parkinsons disease PD. Amongst these issues studies have generally failed to consider the postoperative changes that occur within individual patients. This study utilized reliable change indices RCIs derived from a PD sample to determine the frequency of clinically significant postoperative decline on a battery of neuropsychological measures. This approach addresses measurement reliability potential practice effects and disease progression. The proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant postoperative decline on measures of list learning and verbal fluency was greater than expected based on disease progression; however the majority of patients 55% did not experience a significant decline in performance on any of the cognitive tests administered and only one experienced decline on more than one test. Therefore the statistically significant declines on measures of list learning and verbal fluency observed in the sample as a whole were the result of clinically significant declines experienced by a minority of participants."
