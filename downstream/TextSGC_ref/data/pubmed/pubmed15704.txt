While people with mild cognitive impairment MCI portray noticeably incipient memory difficulty in remembering events and situations along with problems in decision making planning and finding their way in familiar environments detailed neuropsychological assessments also indicate deficits in language performance. To this day there is no cure for dementia but early-stage treatment can delay the progression of MCI; thus the development of valid tools for identifying early cognitive changes is of great importance. In this study we provide an automated machine learning method using Deep Neural Network Architectures that aims to identify MCI. Speech materials were obtained using a reading task during evaluation sessions as part of the Gothenburg MCI research study. Measures of vowel duration vowel formants F1 to F5 and fundamental frequency were calculated from speech signals. To learn the acoustic characteristics associated with MCI vs. healthy controls we have trained and evaluated ten Deep Neural Network Architectures and measured how accurately they can diagnose participants that are unknown to the model. We evaluated the models using two evaluation tasks: a 5-fold crossvalidation and by splitting the data into 90% training and 10% evaluation set. The findings suggest first that the acoustic features provide significant information for the identification of MCI; second the best Deep Neural Network Architectures can classify MCI and healthy controls with high classification accuracy M = 83%; and third the model has the potential to offer higher accuracy than 84% if trained with more data cf. SD15%. The Deep Neural Network Architecture proposed here constitutes a method that contributes to the early diagnosis of cognitive decline quantify the progression of the condition and enable suitable therapeutics.
