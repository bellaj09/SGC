Mental health disorders are the signature wounds of war resulting from extended U.S. Military conflicts in the Middle East 1. In an effort to abate the number of Service Members that develop mental health disorders in these conflicts USC-ICT has created the Stress Resilience in Virtual Environments STRIVE project a set of highly realistic virtual reality combat scenarios and resilience-building sessions designed for pre-deployed military personnel. This short-paper looks at self-reported differences in personality emotion control and presence between two different groups pre-military and non-military of pilot subjects that tested a prototype of the first four modules of STRIVE.
