The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task but in most of them predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist and for predicting the effects of sequence variants it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only.
