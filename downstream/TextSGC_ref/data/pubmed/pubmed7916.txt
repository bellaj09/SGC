Deep learning is now widely used as an efficient tool for medical image classification and segmentation. However conventional machine learning techniques are still more accurate than deep learning when only a small dataset is available. In this study we present a general data augmentation strategy using Perlin noise applying it to pixel-by-pixel image classification and quantification of various kinds of image patterns of diffuse interstitial lung disease DILD. Using retrospectively obtained high-resolution computed tomography HRCT images from 106 patients 100 regions-of-interest ROIs for each of six classes of image patterns normal ground-glass opacity reticular opacity honeycombing emphysema and consolidation were selected for deep learning classification by experienced thoracic radiologists. For extra-validation the deep learning quantification of the six classification patterns was evaluated for 92 HRCT whole lung images for which hand-labeled segmentation masks created by two experienced radiologists were available. FusionNet a convolutional neural network CNN was used for training test and extra-validation on classifications of DILD image patterns. The accuracy of FusionNet with data augmentation using Perlin noise 89.5% 49.8% and 55.0% for ROI-based classification and whole lung quantifications by two radiologists respectively was significantly higher than that with conventional data augmentation 82.1% 45.7% and 49.9% respectively. This data augmentation strategy using Perlin noise could be widely applied to deep learning studies for image classification and segmentation especially in cases with relatively small datasets.
