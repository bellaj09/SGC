Brain-computer Interfaces BCIs provide a direct pathway between the brain and the outward environment. Specifically motor imagery MI-based BCI controlling functional electric stimulation FES is a promising approach for disabled patients with intact mind to restore or rehabilitate their motor functions. This study probed for the improvement of cortical activation for motor imagery during the closed-loop BCI-FES training. We used electroencephalography EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS to inspect the cortical activation for four different training strategies i.e. MI-BCI-FES MI-FES MI and FES. Compared with the other three training conditions the MI-BCI-FES could achieve stronger cortical activation viewing from the event-related desynchronization ERD and the blood oxygen response. The results demonstrate that the closed-loop MI training using BCI-FES can prospectively increase the cortical activation of motor cortical areas. Enhancement of cortical activation for motor imagery during BCI-FES training.
