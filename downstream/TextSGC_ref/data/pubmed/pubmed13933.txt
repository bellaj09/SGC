Previous studies have suggested deep learning to be a highly effective approach for screening lead compounds for new drugs. Several deep learning models have been developed by addressing the use of various kinds of fingerprints and graph convolution architectures. However these methods are either advantageous or disadvantageous depending on whether they 1 can distinguish structural differences including chirality of compounds and 2 can automatically discover effective features.
