3D imaging sensors for the acquisition of three dimensional 3D shapes have created in recent years a considerable degree of interest for a number of applications. The miniaturization and integration of the optical and electronic components used to build them have played a crucial role in the achievement of compactness robustness and flexibility of the sensors. Today several 3D sensors are available on the market even in combination with other sensors in a "sensor fusion" approach. An importance equal to that of physical miniaturization has the portability of the measurements via suitable interfaces into software environments designed for their elaboration e.g. CAD-CAM systems virtual renders and rapid prototyping tools. In this paper following an overview of the state-of-art of 3D imaging sensors a number of significant examples of their use are presented with particular reference to industry heritage medicine and criminal investigation applications.
