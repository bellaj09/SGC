"There has been steady progress in the field of affective computing over the last two decades that has integrated artificial intelligence techniques in the construction of computational models of emotion. Having as a purpose the development of a system for treating phobias that would automatically determine fear levels and adapt exposure intensity based on the users current affective state we propose a comparative study between various machine and deep learning techniques four deep neural network models a stochastic configuration network Support Vector Machine Linear Discriminant Analysis Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors with and without feature selection for recognizing and classifying fear levels based on the electroencephalogram EEG and peripheral data from the DEAP Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals database. Fear was considered an emotion eliciting low valence high arousal and low dominance. By dividing the ratings of valence/arousal/dominance emotion dimensions we propose two paradigms for fear level estimation-the two-level 0-no fear and 1-fear and the four-level 0-no fear 1-low fear 2-medium fear 3-high fear paradigms. Although all the methods provide good classification accuracies the highest F scores have been obtained using the Random Forest Classifier-89.96% and 85.33% for the two-level and four-level fear evaluation modality."
