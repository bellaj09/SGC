"High-content analysis has revolutionized cancer drug discovery by identifying substances that alter the phenotype of a cell which prevents tumor growth and metastasis. The high-resolution biofluorescence images from assays allow precise quantitative measures enabling the distinction of small molecules of a host cell from a tumor. In this work we are particularly interested in the application of deep neural networks DNNs a cutting-edge machine learning method to the classification of compounds in chemical mechanisms of action MOAs. Compound classification has been performed using image-based profiling methods sometimes combined with feature reduction methods such as principal component analysis or factor analysis. In this article we map the input features of each cell to a particular MOA class without using any treatment-level profiles or feature reduction methods. To the best of our knowledge this is the first application of DNN in this domain leveraging single-cell information. Furthermore we use deep transfer learning DTL to alleviate the intensive and computational demanding effort of searching the huge parameters space of a DNN. Results show that using this approach we obtain a 30% speedup and a 2% accuracy improvement." High-Content Analysis of Breast Cancer Using Single-Cell Deep Transfer Learning.
