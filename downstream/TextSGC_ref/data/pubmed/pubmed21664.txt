Virtual reality VR allows for the creation of ecological environments that could be used for cognitive assessment and intervention. This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task the Virtual Shop which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence motivation and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in the Virtual Shop in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus the use of VR is feasible in older adults and the Virtual Shop is a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.
