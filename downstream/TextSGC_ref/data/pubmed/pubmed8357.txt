Domain adaptation is a promising technique when addressing limited or no labeled target data by borrowing well-labeled knowledge from the auxiliary source data. Recently researchers have exploited multi-layer structures for discriminative feature learning to reduce the domain discrepancy. However there are limited research efforts on simultaneously building a deep structure and a discriminative classifier over both labeled source and unlabeled target. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework in which the multi-layer feature extractor and a multi-class classifier are jointly learned to benefit from each other. Specifically we develop a novel semi-supervised class-wise adaptation manner to fight off the conditional distribution mismatch between two domains by assigning a probabilistic label to each target sample i.e. multiple class labels with different probabilities. Furthermore a multi-class classifier is simultaneously trained on labeled source and unlabeled target samples in a semi-supervised fashion. In this way the deep structure can formally alleviate the domain divergence and enhance the feature transferability. Experimental evaluations on several standard cross-domain benchmarks verify the superiority of our proposed approach. Semi-supervised Deep Domain Adaptation via Coupled Neural Networks.
