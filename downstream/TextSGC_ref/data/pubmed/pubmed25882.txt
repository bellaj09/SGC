Vision science is a truly interdisciplinary field of research lying at the interface between psychology computer science and neurobiology. It spans a broad range of research questions from what visual neurons in the brain do to the design and use of virtual reality technology. Here I will take one well-researched area of human vision binocular depth perception as an exemplar of the various ways in which the processes of human perception can be studied: from basic questions about the sensitivity of binocular vision to understanding how having two eyes helps us function in the natural environment. Binocular vision: moving closer to reality.
