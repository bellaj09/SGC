The unique architecture of the human connectome is defined initially by genetics and subsequently sculpted over time with experience. Thus similarities in predisposition and experience that lead to similarities in social biological and cognitive attributes should also be reflected in the local architecture of white matter fascicles. Here we employ a method known as local connectome fingerprinting that uses diffusion MRI to measure the fiber-wise characteristics of macroscopic white matter pathways throughout the brain. This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample N = 841 of subjects from the Human Connectome Project revealing a reliable degree of between-subject correlation in the local connectome fingerprints with a relatively complex low-dimensional substructure. Using a cross-validated high-dimensional regression analysis approach we derived local connectome phenotype LCP maps that could reliably predict a subset of subject attributes measured including demographic health and cognitive measures. These LCP maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but also sensitive to correlations between attributes. Collectively these results indicate that the local architecture of white matter fascicles reflects a meaningful portion of the variability shared between subjects along several dimensions. Local connectome phenotypes predict social health and cognitive factors.
