The level of realism in virtual reality trainers might not be proportional to its didactic value. As an example three exercises to train suturing skills are proposed in this article. They use a discrete thread model with a simple but good enough behaviour and constitute a training means for three laparoscopic skills: 1 Accurate grasping which trains grasping a precise point in the thread. 2 Coordinated Pulling which trains tightening the thread co-ordinately and in different space orientations; and 3 Knotting which allow the surgeon to practice this manoeuvre. These three exercises found interesting among experts in surgical training are now being validated in MIS workshops at the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre of Cceres Spain.
