"Neuroprosthetic arms might potentially restore motor functions for severely paralysed patients. Invasive measurements of cortical currents using electrocorticography have been widely used for neuroprosthetic control. Moreover magnetoencephalography MEG exhibits characteristic brain signals similar to those of invasively measured signals. However it remains unclear whether non-invasively measured signals convey enough motor information to control a neuroprosthetic hand especially for severely paralysed patients whose sensorimotor cortex might be reorganized. We tested an MEG-based neuroprosthetic system to evaluate the accuracy of using cortical currents in the sensorimotor cortex of severely paralysed patients to control a prosthetic hand. The patients attempted to grasp with or open their paralysed hand while the slow components of MEG signals slow movement fields; SMFs were recorded. Even without actual movements the SMFs of all patients indicated characteristic spatiotemporal patterns similar to actual movements and the SMFs were successfully used to control a neuroprosthetic hand in a closed-loop condition. These results demonstrate that the slow components of MEG signals carry sufficient information to classify movement types. Successful control by paralysed patients suggests the feasibility of using an MEG-based neuroprosthetic hand to predict a patients ability to control an invasive neuroprosthesis via the same signal sources as the non-invasive method."
