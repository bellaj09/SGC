The purpose of using brain-computer interface BCI is to build a bridge between brain and computer for the disable persons in order to help them to communicate with the outside world. Electroencephalography EEG has low signal to noise ratio SNR and there exist some problems in the traditional methods for the feature extraction of EEG such as low classification accuracy lack of spatial information and huge amounts of features. To solve these problems we proposed a new method based on time domain frequency domain and space domain. In this study independent component analysis ICA and wavelet transform were used to extract the temporal spectral and spatial features from the original EEG signals and then the extracted features were classified with the method combined support vector machine SVM with genetic algorithm GA. The proposed method displayed a better classification performance and made the mean accuracy of the Graz datasets in the BCI Competitions of 2003 reach 96%. The classification results showed that the proposed method with the three domains could effectively overcome the drawbacks of the traditional methods based solely on time-frequency domain when the EEG signals were used to describe the characteristics of the brain electrical signals. Feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalography based on time-frequency-space domains.
