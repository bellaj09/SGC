Long-term traumatic brain injury due to repeated head impacts RHI has been shown to be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a loss in cognitive performance. Establishing the correlation between changes in the white matter WM structural connectivity measures and neuropsychological test scores might help to identify the neural correlates of the scores that are used in daily clinical setting to investigate deficits due to repeated head blows. Hence in this study we utilized high angular diffusion MRI dMRI of 69 cognitively impaired and 70 nonimpaired active professional fighters from the Professional Fighters Brain Health Study and constructed structural connectomes to understand: a whether there is a difference in the topological WM organization between cognitively impaired and nonimpaired active professional fighters and b whether graph-theoretical measures exhibit correlations with neuropsychological scores in these groups. A dMRI derived structural connectome was constructed for every participant using brain regions defined in AAL atlas as nodes and the product of fiber number and average fractional anisotropy of the tracts connecting the nodes as edges. Our study identified a topological WM reorganization due to RHI in fighters prone to cognitive decline that was correlated with neuropsychological scores. Furthermore graph-theoretical measures were correlated differentially with neuropsychological scores between groups. We also found differentiated WM connectivity involving regions of hippocampus precuneus and insula within our cohort of cognitively impaired fighters suggesting that there is a discernible WM topological reorganization in fighters prone to cognitive decline. Understanding white matter structural connectivity differences between cognitively impaired and nonimpaired active professional fighters.
