A brain-computer interface BCI is an advanced human-machine interaction technology. The BCI speller is a typical application that detects the stimulated source-induced EEG signal to identify the expected characters of the subjects. The current mainstream matrix-based BCI speller involves two problems that remain unsolved namely gaze-dependent and space-dependent problems. Some scholars have designed gaze-independent and space-independent spelling systems. However this system still cannot achieve a satisfactory information transfer rate ITR. In this paper we propose a novel triple RSVP speller with gaze-independent and space-independent characteristics and higher ITR. The triple RSVP speller uses rapid serial visual presentation RSVP paradigm each time presents three different characters and each character is presented three times to increase the ITR. The results of the experiments show the triple RSVP speller online average accuracy of 0.790 and average online ITR of 20.259 bit/min where the system spelled at a speed of 10 s per character and the stimulus presentation interface is a 90\u2009\u2009195 pixel rectangle. Thus the triple RSVP speller can be integrated into mobile smart devices such as smartphones smart watches and others. A novel P300 BCI speller based on the Triple RSVP paradigm.
