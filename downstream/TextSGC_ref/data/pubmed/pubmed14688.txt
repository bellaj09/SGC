An array of technology-based interventions has increasingly become available to support family caregivers primarily focusing on health and well-being social isolation financial and psychological support. More recently the emergence of new technologies such as mobile and cloud robotics connected sensors virtual/augmented/mixed reality voice and the evermore ubiquitous tools supported by advanced data analytics coupled with the integration of multiple technologies through platform solutions have opened a new era of technology-enabled interventions that can empower and support family caregivers. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for identifying and addressing the challenges that may need to be overcome to effectively apply technology-enabled solutions for family caregivers. The paper identifies a number of challenges that either moderate or mediate the full use of technologies for the benefit of caregivers. The challenges include issues related to equity inclusion and access; ethical concerns related to privacy and security; political and regulatory factors affecting interoperability and lack of standards; inclusive/human-centric design and issues; and inherent economic and distribution channel difficulties. The paper concludes with a summary of research questions and issues that form a framework for global research priorities. Technology and Caregiving: Emerging Interventions and Directions for Research.
