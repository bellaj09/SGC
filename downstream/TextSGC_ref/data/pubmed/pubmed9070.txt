In this contribution we present a fully automatic approach that is based on two convolution neural networks CNN together with a spine tracing algorithm utilizing a population optimization algorithm. Based on the evaluation of 130 CT scans including heavily distorted and complicated cases it turned out that this new combination enables fast and robust detection with almost 90% of correctly determined spinal centerlines with computing time of fewer than 20 seconds. Deep-learning-based fully automatic spine centerline detection in CT data.
