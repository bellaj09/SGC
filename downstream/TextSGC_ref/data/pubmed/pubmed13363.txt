Intelligence has been considered as the major challenge in promoting economic potential and production efficiency of precision agriculture. In order to apply advanced deep-learning technology to complete various agricultural tasks in online and offline ways a large number of crop vision datasets with domain-specific annotation are urgently needed. To encourage further progress in challenging realistic agricultural conditions we present the CropDeep species classification and detection dataset consisting of 31147 images with over 49000 annotated instances from 31 different classes. In contrast to existing vision datasets images were collected with different cameras and equipment in greenhouses captured in a wide variety of situations. It features visually similar species and periodic changes with more representative annotations which have supported a stronger benchmark for deep-learning-based classification and detection. To further verify the application prospect we provide extensive baseline experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning classification and detection models. Results show that current deep-learning-based methods achieve well performance in classification accuracy over 99%. While current deep-learning methods achieve only 92% detection accuracy illustrating the difficulty of the dataset and improvement room of state-of-the-art deep-learning models when applied to crops production and management. Specifically we suggest that the YOLOv3 network has good potential application in agricultural detection tasks.
