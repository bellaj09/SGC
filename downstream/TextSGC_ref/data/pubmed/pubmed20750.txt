The present study proposes a hybrid brain-computer interface BCI with 64 selectable items based on the fusion of P300 and steady-state visually evoked potential SSVEP brain signals. With this approach row/column RC P300 and two-step SSVEP paradigms were integrated to create two hybrid paradigms which we denote as the double RC DRC and 4-D spellers. In each hybrid paradigm the target is simultaneously detected based on both P300 and SSVEP potentials as measured by the electroencephalogram. We further proposed a maximum-probability estimation MPE fusion approach to combine the P300 and SSVEP on a score level and compared this approach to other approaches based on linear discriminant analysis a nave Bayes classifier and support vector machines. The experimental results obtained from thirteen participants indicated that the 4-D hybrid paradigm outperformed the DRC paradigm and that the MPE fusion achieved higher accuracy compared with the other approaches. Importantly 12 of the 13 participants using the 4-D paradigm achieved an accuracy of over 90% and the average accuracy was 95.18%. These promising results suggest that the proposed hybrid BCI system could be used in the design of a high-performance BCI-based keyboard.
