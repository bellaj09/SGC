State-of-the-art optical see-through head-mounted displays for augmented reality AR applications lack mutual occlusion capability which refers to the ability to render correct light blocking relationship when merging digital and physical objects such that the virtual views appear to be ghost-like and lack realistic appearance. In this paper using off-the-shelf optical components we present the design and prototype of an AR display which is capable of rendering per-pixel mutual occlusion. Our prototype utilizes a miniature organic light emitting display coupled with a liquid crystal on silicon type spatial light modulator to achieve an occlusion capable AR display offering a 30 diagonal field of view and an angular resolution of 1.24 arcminutes with an optical performance of > 0.4 contrast over the full field at the Nquist frequency of 24.2 cycles/degree. We experimentally demonstrate a monocular prototype achieving >100:1 dynamic range in well-lighted environments.
