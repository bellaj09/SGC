A brain-computer interface BCI or brain-machine interface is a technology that enables the control of a computer and other external devices using signals from the brain. This technology has been tested in paralysed patients such as those with cervical spinal cord injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but it has not been tested systematically in Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD which is a severe type of muscular dystrophy due to the loss of dystrophin and is often accompanied by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Here we investigated the efficacy of a P300-based BCI for patients with DMD. Eight bedridden patients with DMD and eight age- and gender-matched able-bodied controls were instructed to input hiragana characters. We used a region-based two-step P300-based BCI with green/blue flicker stimuli. EEG data were recorded and a linear discriminant analysis distinguished the target from other non-targets. The mean online accuracy of inputted characters accuracy for the two-step procedure was 71.6% for patients with DMD and 80.6% for controls with no significant difference between the patients and controls. The P300-based BCI was operated successfully by individuals with DMD in an advanced stage and these findings suggest that this technology may be beneficial for patients with this disease.
