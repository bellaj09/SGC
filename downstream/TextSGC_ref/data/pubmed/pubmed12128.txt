As the core task of scene understanding semantic segmentation and depth completion play a vital role in lots of applications such as robot navigation AR/VR and autonomous driving. They are responsible for parsing scenes from the angle of semantics and geometry respectively. While great progress has been made in both tasks through deep learning technologies few works have been done on building a joint model by deeply exploring the inner relationship of the above tasks. In this paper semantic segmentation and depth completion are jointly considered under a multi-task learning framework. By sharing a common encoder part and introducing boundary features as inner constraints in the decoder part the two tasks can properly share the required information from each other. An extra boundary detection sub-task is responsible for providing the boundary features and constructing cross-task joint loss functions for network training. The entire network is implemented end-to-end and evaluated with both RGB and sparse depth input. Experiments conducted on synthesized and real scene datasets show that our proposed multi-task CNN model can effectively improve the performance of every single task.
