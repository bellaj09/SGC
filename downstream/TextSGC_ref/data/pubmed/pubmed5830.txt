Optimal integration and segregation of neuronal connections are necessary for efficient large-scale network communication between distributed cortical regions while allowing for modular specialization. This dynamic in the cortex is enabled at the network mesoscale by the organization of nodes into communities. Previous in vivo efforts to map the mesoscale architecture in humans had several limitations. Here we characterize a consensus multiscale community organization of the functional cortical network. We derive this consensus from the clustering of subject-level networks. We applied this analysis to magnetic resonance imaging data from 1003 healthy individuals part of the Human Connectome Project. The hierarchical atlas and code will be made publicly available for future investigators.
