"We propose a new framework to map structural connectomes using deep learning and diffusion MRI. We show that our framework not only enables connectome mapping with a convolutional neural network CNN but can also be straightforwardly incorporated into conventional connectome mapping pipelines to enhance accuracy. Our framework involves decomposing the entire brain volume into overlapping blocks. Blocks are sufficiently small to ensure that a CNN can be efficiently trained to predict each blocks internal connectivity architecture. We develop a block stitching algorithm to rebuild the full brain volume from these blocks and thereby map end-to-end connectivity matrices. To evaluate our block decomposition and stitching BDS framework independent of CNN performance we first map each blocks internal connectivity using conventional streamline tractography. Performance is evaluated using simulated diffusion MRI data generated from numerical connectome phantoms with known ground truth connectivity. Due to the redundancy achieved by allowing blocks to overlap we find that our block decomposition and stitching steps per se can enhance the accuracy of probabilistic and deterministic tractography algorithms by up to 20-30%. Moreover we demonstrate that our framework can improve the strength of structure-function coupling between in vivo diffusion and functional MRI data. We find that structural brain networks mapped with deep learning correlate more strongly with functional brain networks r\xa0\u200b=\xa0\u200b0.45 than those mapped with conventional tractography r\xa0\u200b=\xa0\u200b0.36. In conclusion our BDS framework not only enables connectome mapping with deep learning but its two constituent steps can be straightforwardly incorporated as part of conventional connectome mapping pipelines to enhance accuracy."
