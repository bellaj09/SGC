Motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs commonly use the common spatial pattern CSP as preprocessing step before classification. The CSP method is a supervised algorithm. Therefore a lot of time-consuming training data is needed to build the model. To address this issue one promising approach is transfer learning which generalizes a learning model can extract discriminative information from other subjects for target classification task. To this end we propose a transfer kernel CSP TKCSP approach to learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching distributions of source subjects and target subjects. The dataset IVa of BCI Competition III is used to demonstrate the validity by our proposed methods. In the experiment we compare the classification performance of the TKCSP against CSP CSP for subject-to-subject transfer CSP SJ-to-SJ regularizing CSP RCSP stationary subspace CSP ssCSP multitask CSP mtCSP and the combined mtCSP and ssCSP ss + mtCSP method. The results indicate that the superior mean classification performance of TKCSP can achieve 81.14% especially in case of source subjects with fewer number of training samples. Comprehensive experimental evidence on the dataset verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TKCSP approach over several state-of-the-art methods.
