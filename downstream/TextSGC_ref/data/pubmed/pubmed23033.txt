Upper-limb fatigue is a common problem that may restrict people with multiple sclerosis MS from using their electric powered wheelchair effectively and for a long period of time. The objective of this research is to evaluate whether participants with MS can drive better using a variable compliance joystick VCJ and customizable algorithms than with a conventional wheelchair joystick. Eleven participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The groups used either the VCJ in compliant or noncompliant isometric mode and a standard algorithm personally fitted algorithm or personally fitted algorithm with fatigue adaptation running in the background in order to complete virtual wheelchair driving tasks. Participants with MS showed better driving performance metrics while using the customized algorithms than while using the standard algorithm with the VCJ. Fatigue adaptation algorithms are especially beneficial in improving overall task performance while using the VCJ in isometric mode. The VCJ along with the personally fitted algorithms and fatigue adaptation algorithms has the potential to be an effective input interface for wheelchairs. Preliminary evaluation of variable compliance joystick for people with multiple sclerosis.
