Grasping force control is important for multi-fingered robotic hands to stabilize the grasped object. Humans are able to adjust their grasping force and react quickly to instabilities through tactile sensing. However grasping force control through tactile sensing with robotic hands is still relatively unexplored. In this paper we make use of tactile sensing for multi-fingered robot hands to adjust the grasping force to stabilize unknown objects without prior knowledge of their shape or physical properties. In particular an online detection module based on Deep Neural Network DNN is designed to detect contact events and object material simultaneously from tactile data. In addition a force estimation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model GMM is proposed to compute the contact information i.e. contact force and contact location from tactile data. According to the results of tactile sensing an object stabilization controller is then employed for a robotic hand to adjust the contact configuration for object stabilization. The spatio-temporal property of tactile data is exploited during tactile sensing. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated in a real-world experiment with a five-fingered Shadow Dexterous Hand equipped with BioTac sensors.
