"Considerable empirical evidence has shown influences of the action capabilities of the body on the perception of sizes and distances. Generally as ones action capabilities increase the perception of the relevant distance over which the action is to be performed decreases and vice versa. As a consequence it has been proposed that the bodys action capabilities act as a perceptual ruler which is used to measure perceived sizes and distances. In this set of studies we investigated this hypothesis by assessing the influence of arms reach on the perception of distance. By providing participant with a self-representing avatar seen in a first-person perspective in virtual reality we were able to introduce novel and completely unfamiliar alterations in the virtual arms reach to evaluate their impact on perceived distance. Using both action-based and visual matching measures we found that virtual arms reach influenced perceived distance in virtual environments. Due to the participants inexperience with the reach alterations we also were able to assess the amount of experience with the new arms reach required to influence perceived distance. We found that minimal experience reaching with the virtual arm can influence perceived distance. However some reaching experience is required. Merely having a long or short virtual arm even one that is synchronized to ones movements is not enough to influence distance perception if one has no experience reaching." "Virtual arms reach influences perceived distances but only after experience reaching."
