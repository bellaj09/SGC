"Recently functional connectome studies based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI and graph theory have greatly advanced our understanding of the topological principles of healthy and diseased brains. However how different strategies for R-fMRI data preprocessing and for connectome analyses jointly affect topological characterization and contrastive research of brain networks remains to be elucidated. Here we used two R-fMRI data sets a healthy young adult data set and an Alzheimers disease AD patient data set and up to 42 analysis strategies to comprehensively investigate the joint influence of three key factors global signal regression regional parcellation schemes and null network models on the topological analysis and contrastive research of whole-brain functional networks. At the global level we first found that these three factors affected not only the quantitative values but also the individual variability profile in small-world related metrics and modularity wherein global signal regression exhibited the predominant influence. Moreover strategies without global signal regression and with topological randomization null model enhanced the sensitivity of the detection of differences between AD and control groups in small-worldness and modularity. At the nodal level strategies of global signal regression dominantly influenced the spatial distribution of both hubs and between-group differences in terms of nodal degree centrality. Together we highlight the remarkable joint influence of global signal regression regional parcellation schemes and null network models on functional connectome analyses in both health and diseases which may provide guidance for the choice of analysis strategies in future functional network studies."
