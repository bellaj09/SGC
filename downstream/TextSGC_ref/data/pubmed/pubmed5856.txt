It has been previously shown that loss of consciousness is associated with a breakdown of dominating fronto-parietal feedback connectivity as assessed by electroencephalogram EEG recordings. Structure and strength of network connectivity may change over time. Aim of the current study is to investigate cortico-cortical connectivity at different time intervals during consciousness and unconsciousness. For this purpose EEG symbolic transfer entropy STEn was calculated to indicate cortico-cortical information transfer at different transfer times. Fronto-parietal connectivity is a non-static phenomenon with characteristic changes during unconsciousness.
