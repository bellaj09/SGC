Pain caused by a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system is known as Neuropathic pain. It has been shown that neuropathic pain can be treated with the combination of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation and the generation of the visual illusion that the patient retains control of the affected limbs. For persons with neuropathic pain in the lower limbs the visual illusion consists of an image of the patient walking normally. Such a visual illusion has classically been generated by using a physical mirror and a projector. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a computer-based version of the visual illusion including Gestural Control. The developed system has been validated in a trial and has been successfully implanted in daily clinical practice in a reference neurorehabilitation hospital. A retrospective statistical analysis shows that the patients treated with the computer-based system reduce their pain level significantly more than the patients treated with the mirror and projector treatment before the introduction of the computer-based version. Furthermore it also makes possible to bring the therapy to the home of the patients where the treatment can be self-administered while still being monitored by the clinical staff.
