The pore-lining amino acids of ion channel proteins reside on the interface between a polar the pore and a nonpolar environment the rest of the protein. The structural dynamics of this region which physically controls ionic flow are essential components of channel gating. Using large-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ BK channels we devised a systematic charge-substitution method to probe conformational changes in the pore region during channel gating. We identified a deep-pore residue 314 in hSlo1 as a marker of structural dynamics. We manipulated the charge states of this residue by substituting amino acids with different valence and pKa and by adjusting intracellular pH. We found that the charged states of the 314 residues stabilized an open state of the BK channel. With models based on known structures of related channels we postulate a dynamic rearrangement of the deep-pore region during BK channel opening/closing which involves a change of the degree of pore exposure for 314. Charge substitution for a deep-pore residue reveals structural dynamics during BK channel gating.
