In vertebrates ageing is characterized by reduced viscoelasticity of the ligamentous and tendineous structures and fibre changes in muscle. Also some vertebral joint degeneration develops with ageing. The aim of this study was to apply dynamic time warping to compare the temporal characteristics of the surface electromyography sEMG data and to illustrate the differences in the pattern of muscle use during tasks of daily life in old and mature horses. In vivo kinematics 24 skin markers and sEMG measurements of neck extensors and flexors were taken in five mature horses age 10  2 years half of mean life expectancy and five old horses age 25  5 years older than the mean life expectancy. All horses had the same level of activity in the 12 months prior to the measurement. Tasks measured were neck flexion and neck extension as well as neutral neck position. Muscle activation minimum and maximum muscle activation were collected. Quartiles of muscle activity based on the maximum observed activity of each muscle were calculated to document the relative increase of activity level during the task. Kinematics as well as overall muscle activity patterns were similar across horses and age groups. However in the neutral position old horses showed increased extensor activity compared to mature horses indicating that old equine muscle requires more activity to counteract gravity. Dynamic time warping specified optimal temporal alignments of time series and different temporal performances were identified. The age groups differed during the flexion task while extension and neutral were more similar. The results of this study show that even in the second half of life and in the absence of muscle disuse the muscular strategy employed by horses continues to be adapted. From maturity to old age: tasks of daily life require a different muscle use in horses.
