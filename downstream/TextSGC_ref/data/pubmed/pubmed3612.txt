Mild traumatic brain injury mTBI is often occult to conventional imaging techniques. However there is growing evidence that mTBI patients who lack evidence of structural intracranial injury may develop post-concussive syndrome PCS. We investigated longitudinal alterations in resting state functional connectivity rs-FC in brain networks in a population of 28 patients compared to 28 matched control participants. Rs-FC and cerebral blood flow CBF within the nodes of the Default Mode Network DMN and Task Positive Network TPN were assessed at three time points including acute sub-acute and chronic stages following mTBI. Participants received the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ANAM to assess cognitive performance. Main findings indicate that despite normalized cognitive performance chronic mTBI patients demonstrate increased rs-FC between the DMN and regions associated with the salience network SN and TPN compared to the control populations as well as reduced strength of rs-FC within the DMN at the acute stage of injury. In addition chronic mTBI patients demonstrate an imbalance in the ratio of CBF between nodes of the DMN and TPN. Furthermore preliminary exploratory analysis suggests that compared to those without chronic PCS patients with chronic PCS reveal an imbalance in the ratio of CBF between the DMN nodes and TPN nodes across multiple stages of recovery. Findings suggest that the altered network perfusion with the associated changes in rs-FC may be a possible predictor of which mTBI patients will develop chronic PCS.
