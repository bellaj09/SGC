PURPOSE\xa0 : Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound TeUS has been proposed as a new paradigm for tissue characterization based on a sequence of ultrasound radio frequency RF data. We previously used TeUS to successfully address the problem of prostate cancer detection in the fusion biopsies. METHODS\xa0 : In this paper we use TeUS to address the problem of grading prostate cancer in a clinical study of 197 biopsy cores from 132 patients. Our method involves capturing high-level latent features of TeUS with a deep learning approach followed by distribution learning to cluster aggressive cancer in a biopsy core. In this hypothesis-generating study we utilize deep learning based feature visualization as a means to obtain insight into the physical phenomenon governing the interaction of temporal ultrasound with tissue. RESULTS\xa0 : Based on the evidence derived from our feature visualization and the structure of tissue from digital pathology we build a simulation framework for studying the physical phenomenon underlying TeUS-based tissue characterization. CONCLUSION\xa0 : Results from simulation and feature visualization corroborated with the hypothesis that micro-vibrations of tissue microstructure captured by low-frequency spectral features of TeUS can be used for detection of prostate cancer.
