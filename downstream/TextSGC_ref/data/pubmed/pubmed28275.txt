"Listeners are good at attending to one auditory stream in a crowded environment. However is there an upper limit of streams present in an auditory scene at which this selective attention breaks down? Here participants were asked to attend one stream of spoken letters amidst other letter streams. In half of the trials an initial primer was played cueing subjects to the sound configuration. Results indicate that performance increases with token repetitions. Priming provided a performance benefit suggesting that stream selection not formation is the bottleneck associated with attention in an overcrowded scene. Results implications for brain-computer interfaces are discussed." Selective attention in an overcrowded auditory scene: implications for auditory-based brain-computer interface design.
