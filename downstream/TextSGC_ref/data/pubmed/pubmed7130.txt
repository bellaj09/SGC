Deep learning methods applied to problems in chemoinformatics often require the use of recursive neural networks to handle data with graphical structure and variable size. We present a useful classification of recursive neural network approaches into two classes the inner and outer approach. The inner approach uses recursion inside the underlying graph to essentially "crawl" the edges of the graph while the outer approach uses recursion outside the underlying graph to aggregate information over progressively longer distances in an orthogonal direction. We illustrate the inner and outer approaches on several examples. More importantly we provide open-source implementations available at www.github.com/Chemoinformatics/InnerOuterRNN and cdb.ics.uci.edu  for both approaches in Tensorflow which can be used in combination with training data to produce efficient models for predicting the physical chemical and biological properties of small molecules.
