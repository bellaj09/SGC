This chapter covers balance gait and falls in individuals with spinal cord injury SCI from a clinical perspective. First the consequences of an SCI on functioning are explained including etiology clinical presentation classification and epidemiologic data. Then the specific aspects of balance disorders gait disorders and falls are discussed with respect to motor complete cSCI and incomplete iSCI SCI. Typically these activities are affected by impaired afferent and efferent nerves but not by central nervous processing. Performance of daily life activities in cSCI depends on the ability to control the interaction between the center of mass and the base of support or limits of stability. In iSCI impaired proprioception and muscle strength are important factors for completing balancing tasks and for walking. Falls are common in patients with SCI. Subsequent sections describe therapy approaches aimed at modifying balance gait and the risk for falls by means of therapeutic exercises assistive devices like robots or functional electric stimulation and environmental adaptations. The last part covers recent developments and future directions. These encompass interventions for maximizing residual neural function and regeneration of axons as well as technical solutions like epidural or intraspinal electric stimulation powered exoskeletons and brain computer interfaces.
