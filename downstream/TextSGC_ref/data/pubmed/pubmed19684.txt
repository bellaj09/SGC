It is a long-lasting question whether human beings who evolved in a physical world of three dimensions are capable of overcoming this fundamental limitation to develop an intuitive understanding of four-dimensional space. Techniques of analogy and graphical illustration have been developed with some subjective reports of success. However there has been no objective evaluation of such achievements. Here we show evidence that people with basic geometric knowledge can learn to make spatial judgments on the length of and angle between line segments embedded in four-dimensional space viewed in virtual reality with minimal exposure to the task and no feedback to their responses. Their judgments incorporated information from both the three-dimensional 3-D projection and the fourth dimension and the underlying representations were not algebraic in nature but based on visual imagery although primitive and short lived. These results suggest that human spatial representations are not completely constrained by our evolution and development in a 3-D world.
