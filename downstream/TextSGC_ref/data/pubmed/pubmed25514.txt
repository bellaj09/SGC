Virtual-reality VR therapy has been distinguished from other psychotherapy interventions through the use of computer-assisted interventions that rely on the concepts of "immersion" "presence" and "synchrony." In this work these concepts are defined and their uses within the VR treatment architecture are discussed. VR therapy\s emphasis on the incorporation of biofeedback and meditation as a component of the VR treatment architecture is also reviewed. A growing body of research has documented VR therapy as a successful treatment for combat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD. The VR treatment architecture utilized to treat 30 warriors diagnosed with combat-related PTSD is summarized. Lastly case summaries of two warriors successfully treated with VR therapy are included to assist with the goal of better understanding a VR treatment architecture paradigm. Continued validation of the VR treatment model is encouraged. Lessons learned from 350 virtual-reality sessions with warriors diagnosed with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
