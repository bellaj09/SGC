Providing brain-computer interface BCI users engaging applications should be one of the main targets in BCI research. A painting application a web browser and other applications can already be controlled via BCI. Another engaging application would be a music composer for self-expression. In this work we describe Brain Composing: A BCI controlled music composing software. We tested and evaluated the implemented brain composing system with five volunteers. Using a tap water-based electrode biosignal amplifier further improved the usability of the system. Three participants reached accuracies above 77% and were able to copy-compose a given melody. Results of questionnaires support that our brain composing system is an attractive and easy way to compose music via a BCI. Sheet music by mind: Towards a brain-computer interface for composing.
