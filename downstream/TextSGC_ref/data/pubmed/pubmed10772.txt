"The purpose of this study was to develop a robust fast and markerless mobile augmented reality method for registration geovisualization and interaction in uncontrolled outdoor environments. We propose a lightweight deep-learning-based object detection approach for mobile or embedded devices; the vision-based detection results of this approach are combined with spatial relationships by means of the host devices built-in Global Positioning System receiver Inertial Measurement Unit and magnetometer. Virtual objects generated based on geospatial information are precisely registered in the real world and an interaction method based on touch gestures is implemented. The entire method is independent of the network to ensure robustness to poor signal conditions. A prototype system was developed and tested on the Wuhan University campus to evaluate the method and validate its results. The findings demonstrate that our method achieves a high detection accuracy stable geovisualization results and interaction."
