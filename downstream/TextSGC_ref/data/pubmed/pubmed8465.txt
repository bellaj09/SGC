In electrophysiology microelectrodes are the primary source for recording neural data single unit activity. These microelectrodes can be implanted individually or in the form of arrays containing dozens to hundreds of channels. Recordings of some channels contain neural activity which are often contaminated with noise. Another fraction of channels does not record any neural data but only noise. By noise we mean physiological activities unrelated to spiking including technical artifacts and neural activities of neurons that are too far away from the electrode to be usefully processed. For further analysis an automatic identification and continuous tracking of channels containing neural data is of great significance for many applications e.g. automated selection of neural channels during online and offline spike sorting. Automated spike detection and sorting is also critical for online decoding in brain-computer interface BCI applications in which only simple threshold crossing events are often considered for feature extraction. To our knowledge there is no method that can universally and automatically identify channels containing neural data. In this study we aim to identify and track channels containing neural data from implanted electrodes automatically and more importantly universally. By universally we mean across different recording technologies different subjects and different brain areas. SpikeDeeptector: a deep-learning based method for detection of neural spiking activity.
