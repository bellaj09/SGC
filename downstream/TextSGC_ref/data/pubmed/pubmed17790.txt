External ventricular drain EVD placement is one of first cranial procedures neurosurgery residents are expected to perform independently. While proper training improves patient outcomes there are few options for practicing EVD placement prior to placing the EVD in patients in a clinical setting. Proposed solutions to this include using cadaveric models and virtual simulations but barriers exist with these as well in regard to authenticity. EVD simulators using virtual reality technologies are a promising new technique for training but the cost of these devices poses a barrier to general/widespread accessibility among smaller programs or underserved hospitals. The authors desribe a novel yet simple and cost-effective technique less than $5 per mold for developing a brain model constructed of homemade ballistics gelatin that can be used for teaching and practicing the placement of EVD. A simple and cost-effective model for ventricular catheter placement training: technical note.
