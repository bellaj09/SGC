"Accurate spatial normalization SN of amyloid positron emission tomography PET images for Alzheimers disease assessment without coregistered anatomical magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the same individual is technically challenging. In this study we applied deep neural networks to generate individually adaptive PET templates for robust and accurate SN of amyloid PET without using matched 3D MR images. Using 681 pairs of simultaneously acquired 11 C-PIB PET and T1-weighted 3D MRI scans of AD MCI and cognitively normal subjects we trained and tested two deep neural networks convolutional auto-encoder CAE and generative adversarial network GAN that produce adaptive best PET templates. More specifically the networks were trained using 685100 pieces of augmented data generated by rotating 527 randomly selected datasets and validated using 154 datasets. The input to the supervised neural networks was the 3D PET volume in native space and the label was the spatially normalized 3D PET image using the transformation parameters obtained from MRI-based SN. The proposed deep learning approach significantly enhanced the quantitative accuracy of MRI-less amyloid PET assessment by reducing the SN error observed when an average amyloid PET template is used. Given an input image the trained deep neural networks rapidly provide individually adaptive 3D PET templates without any discontinuity between the slices in 0.02 s. As the proposed method does not require 3D MRI for the SN of PET images it has great potential for use in routine analysis of amyloid PET images in clinical practice and research."
