Young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder ASD have low employment rates and job interviewing presents a critical barrier to employment for them. Results from a prior randomized controlled efficacy trial suggested virtual reality job interview training VR-JIT improved interviewing skills among trainees with ASD but not controls with ASD. We conducted a brief survey with 23 of 26 participants from this study to evaluate their vocational outcomes at 6-month follow-up with a focus on whether or not they attained a competitive position employment or competitive volunteering. Logistic regression indicated VR-JIT trainees had greater odds of attaining a competitive position than controls OR 7.82 p\xa0<\xa00.05. Initial evidence suggests VR-JIT is a promising intervention that enhances vocational outcomes among young adults with high-functioning ASD.
