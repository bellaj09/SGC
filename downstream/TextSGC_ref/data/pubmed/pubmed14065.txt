The objective of this paper is to highlight the state-of-the-art machine learning ML techniques in computational docking. The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose orientation + conformation of a small molecule drug candidate when bound to a target larger receptor molecule protein in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy and hence the stability of the resulting complex molecule. Generally such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function using ML techniques. Machine learning in computational docking.
