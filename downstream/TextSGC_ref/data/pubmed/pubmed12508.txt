Non-contact vital sign monitoring enables the estimation of vital signs such as heart rate respiratory rate and oxygen saturation SpO2 by measuring subtle color changes on the skin surface using a video camera. For patients in a hospital ward the main challenges in the development of continuous and robust non-contact monitoring techniques are the identification of time periods and the segmentation of skin regions of interest ROIs from which vital signs can be estimated. We propose a deep learning framework to tackle these challenges. Cardio-respiratory signal extraction from video camera data for continuous non-contact vital sign monitoring using deep learning.
