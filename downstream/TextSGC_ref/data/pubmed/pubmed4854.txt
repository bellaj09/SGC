Structural brain connections develop atypically in very preterm children and altered functional connectivity is also evident in fMRI studies. Such alterations in brain network connectivity are associated with cognitive difficulties in this population. Little is known however about electrophysiological interactions among specific brain networks in children born very preterm. In the present study we recorded magnetoencephalography while very preterm children and full-term controls performed a visual short-term memory task. Regions expressing task-dependent activity changes were identified using beamformer analysis and inter-regional phase synchrony was calculated. Very preterm children expressed altered regional recruitment in distributed networks of brain areas across standard physiological frequency ranges including the theta alpha beta and gamma bands. Reduced oscillatory synchrony was observed among task-activated brain regions in very preterm children particularly for connections involving areas critical for executive abilities including middle frontal gyrus. These findings suggest that inability to recruit neurophysiological activity and interactions in distributed networks including frontal regions may contribute to difficulties in cognitive development in children born very preterm.
