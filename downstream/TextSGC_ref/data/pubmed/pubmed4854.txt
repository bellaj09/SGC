he middle longitudinal fasciculus MdLF was initially identified in humans as a discrete subcortical pathway connecting the superior temporal gyrus STG to the angular gyrus AG. Further anatomo-imaging studies however proposed more sophisticated but conflicting connectivity patterns and have created a vague perception on its functional anatomy. Our aim was therefore to investigate the ambiguous structural architecture of this tract through focused cadaveric dissections augmented by a tailored DTI protocol in healthy participants from the Human Connectome dataset. Three segments and connectivity patterns were consistently recorded: the MdLF-I connecting the dorsolateral Temporal Pole TP and STG to the Superior Parietal Lobule/Precuneus through the Heschl\s gyrus; the MdLF-II connecting the dorsolateral TP and the STG with the Parieto-occipital area through the posterior transverse gyri and the MdLF-III connecting the most anterior part of the TP to the posterior border of the occipital lobe through the AG. The lack of an established termination pattern to the AG and the fact that no significant leftward asymmetry is disclosed tend to shift the paradigm away from language function. Conversely the theory of "where" and "what" auditory pathways the essential relationship of the MdLF with the auditory cortex and the functional role of the cortical areas implicated in its connectivity tend to shift the paradigm towards auditory function. Allegedly the MdLF-I and MdLF-II segments could underpin the perception of auditory representations; whereas the MdLF-III could potentially subserve the integration of auditory and visual information. Mapping the human middle longitudinal fasciculus through a focused anatomo-imaging study: shifting the paradigm of its segmentation and connectivity pattern.
