In conventional Magnetic Resonance MR image based methods two stages are often involved to capture brain structural information for disease diagnosis i.e. 1 manually partitioning each MR image into a number of regions-of-interest ROIs and 2 extracting pre-defined features from each ROI for diagnosis with a certain classifier. However these pre-defined features often limit the performance of the diagnosis due to challenges in 1 defining the ROIs and 2 extracting effective disease-related features. In this paper we propose a landmark-based deep multi-instance learning LDMIL framework for brain disease diagnosis. Specifically we first adopt a data-driven learning approach to discover disease-related anatomical landmarks in the brain MR images along with their nearby image patches. Then our LDMIL framework learns an end-to-end MR image classifier for capturing both the local structural information conveyed by image patches located by landmarks and the global structural information derived from all detected landmarks. We have evaluated our proposed framework on 1526 subjects from three public datasets i.e. ADNI-1 ADNI-2 and MIRIAD and the experimental results show that our framework can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.
