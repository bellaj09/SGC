Systemic capillary leak syndrome is a rare underdiagnosed and life-threatening disease characterized by periodic episodes of hypovolaemic shock due to leakage of plasma from the intravascular to the extravascular space. It is associated with haemoconcentration hypoalbuminaemia and generalized oedema. We report the case of a patient with a history of emergent extensive small and large bowel resection and several episodes of hypovolaemic shock with acute renal injury who presented with abdominal pain headache and generalized oedema. Severe systemic capillary leak syndrome was diagnosed after a complex diagnostic approach. This case report describes the acute and prophylactic treatment administered to the patient and the 4-year follow-up. We highlight the importance of timely recognition and prompt treatment as well as the need for new investigations to prevent the serious and unusual complications seen in this case.
