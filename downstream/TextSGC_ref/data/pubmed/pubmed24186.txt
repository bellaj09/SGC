Virtual reality surgery simulators have been proved effective for training in several surgical disciplines. Nevertheless this technology is presently underutilized in orthopaedics especially for bone machining procedures due to the limited realism in haptic simulation of bone interactions. Collision detection is an integral part of surgery simulators and its accuracy and computational efficiency play a determinant role on the fidelity of simulations. To address this the primary objective of this study was to develop a new algorithm that enables faster and more accurate collision detection within 1\xa0ms required for stable haptic rendering in order to facilitate the improvement of the realism of virtual bone machining procedures. Parallelized collision detection with applications in virtual bone machining.
