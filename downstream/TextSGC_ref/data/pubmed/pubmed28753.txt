Many patients suffer from the loss of motor skills resulting from traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries stroke and many other disabling conditions. Thanks to technological advances in measuring and decoding the electrical activity of cortical neurons brain-machine interfaces BMI have become a promising technology that can aid paralyzed individuals. In recent studies on BMI robotic manipulators have demonstrated their potential as neuroprostheses. Restoring motor skills through robot manipulators controlled by brain signals may improve the quality of life of people with disability. This article reviews current robotic technologies that are relevant to BMI and suggests strategies that could improve the effectiveness of a brain-operated neuroprosthesis through robotics. Developments in brain-machine interfaces from the perspective of robotics.
