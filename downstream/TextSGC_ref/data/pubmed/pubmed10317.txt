"Currently there starts a research trend to leverage neural architecture for recommendation systems. Though several deep recommender models are proposed most methods are too simple to characterize users complex preference. In this paper for a fine-grained analysis users ratings are explained from multiple perspectives based on which we propose our neural architectures. Specifically our model employs several sequential stages to encode the user and item into hidden representations. In one stage the user and item are represented from multiple perspectives and in each perspective the representation of user and that of item put attentions to each other. Last we metric the output representations from the final stage to approach the users ratings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements against baselines."
