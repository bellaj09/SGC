"Cold-water coral CWC mounds are biogenic long-lived morphostructures composed primarily by scleractinian CWCs and hemipelagic sediments that form complex deep-sea microhabitats found globally but specifically along the European-Atlantic margin. In this work high-resolution mapping was applied to identify individual organismal distribution and zonation across a CWC Piddington Mound within the Porcupine Seabight Ireland Margin. Marine Object-Based Image Analysis MOBIA and different machine learning classification methods decision tree logistic regression and deep neural network were applied to a high-resolution 2\u2009mm reef-scale video mosaic and ROV-mounted multibeam data in order to provide new insights into the spatial organization of coral frameworks and environmental factors on CWC mounds. The results showed an accurate quantification of the amount of Coral Framework 14.5%; ~2% live and ~12.5% dead and sponges ~3.5% with heterogeneous distribution restricted to a certain portion of the mound. This is the first object level quantification of live and dead coral framework facies and individual sponges across an entire CWC mound. This approach has application for habitat and conservation studies provides a quantification tool for carbon budget assessments and can provide a baseline to assess CWC mound change. The approach can also be modified for application in other habitats." High resolution mapping of a cold water coral mound.
