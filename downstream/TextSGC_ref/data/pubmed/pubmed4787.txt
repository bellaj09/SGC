The association between stimulant drug use and aberrant reward processing is well-documented in the literature but the nature of these abnormalities remains elusive. The present study aims to disentangle the separate and interacting effects of stimulant drug use and pre-existing familial risk on abnormal reward processing associated with stimulant drug addiction. We used the Monetary Incentive Delay task a well-validated measure of reward processing during fMRI scanning in four distinct groups: individuals with familial risk who were either stimulant drug-dependent N\u2009=\u200941 or had never used stimulant drugs N\u2009=\u200946; and individuals without familial risk who were either using stimulant drugs N\u2009=\u200925 or not N\u2009=\u200948. We first examined task-related whole-brain activation followed by a psychophysiological interaction analysis to further explore brain functional connectivity. For analyses we used a univariate model with two fixed factors familial risk and stimulant drug use. Our results showed increased task-related activation in the putamen and motor cortex of stimulant-using participants. We also found altered task-related functional connectivity between the putamen and frontal regions in participants with a familial risk irrespective of whether they were using stimulant drugs or not. Additionally we identified an interaction between stimulant drug use and familial risk in task-related functional connectivity between the putamen and motor-related cortical regions in potentially at-risk individuals. Our findings suggest that abnormal task-related activation in motor brain systems is associated with regular stimulant drug use whereas abnormal task-related functional connectivity in frontostriatal brain systems in individuals with familial risk may indicate pre-existing neural vulnerability for developing addiction.
