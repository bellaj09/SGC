Currently there is a limited ability to interactively study developmental cardiac mechanics and physiology. We therefore combined light-sheet fluorescence microscopy LSFM with virtual reality VR to provide a hybrid platform for 3D architecture and time-dependent cardiac contractile function characterization. By taking advantage of the rapid acquisition high axial resolution low phototoxicity and high fidelity in 3D and 4D 3D spatial + 1D time or spectra this VR-LSFM hybrid methodology enables interactive visualization and quantification otherwise not available by conventional methods such as routine optical microscopes. We hereby demonstrate multiscale applicability of VR-LSFM to a interrogate skin fibroblasts interacting with a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel b navigate through the endocardial trabecular network during zebrafish development and c localize gene therapy-mediated potassium channel expression in adult murine hearts. We further combined our batch intensity normalized segmentation algorithm with deformable image registration to interface a VR environment with imaging computation for the analysis of cardiac contraction. Thus the VR-LSFM hybrid platform demonstrates an efficient and robust framework for creating a user-directed microenvironment in which we uncovered developmental cardiac mechanics and physiology with high spatiotemporal resolution. Integrating light-sheet imaging with virtual reality to recapitulate developmental cardiac mechanics.
