Segmenting the retinal layers in optical coherence tomography OCT images helps to quantify the layer information in early diagnosis of retinal diseases which are the main cause of permanent blindness. Thus the segmentation process plays a critical role in preventing vision impairment. However because there is a lack of practical automated techniques expert ophthalmologists still have to manually segment the retinal layers. In this study we propose an automated segmentation method for OCT images based on a feature-learning regression network without human bias. The proposed deep neural network regression takes the intensity gradient and adaptive normalized intensity score ANIS of an image segment as features for learning and then predicts the corresponding retinal boundary pixel. Reformulating the segmentation as a regression problem obviates the need for a huge dataset and reduces the complexity significantly as shown in the analysis of computational complexity given here. In addition assisted by ANIS the method operates robustly on OCT images containing intensity variances low-contrast regions speckle noise and blood vessels yet remains accurate and time-efficient. In evaluation of the method conducted using 114 images the processing time was approximately 10.596 s per image for identifying eight boundaries and the training phase for each boundary line took only 30 s. Further the Dice similarity coefficient used for assessing accuracy gave a computed value of approximately 0.966. The absolute pixel distance of manual and automatic segmentation using the proposed scheme was 0.612 which is less than a one-pixel difference on average.
