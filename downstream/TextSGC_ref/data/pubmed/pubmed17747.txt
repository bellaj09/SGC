"Surprisingly little scientific research has been conducted on the effects of colour and lightness on the perception of spaciousness. Practitioners and architects typically suggest that a rooms ceiling appears higher when it is painted lighter than the walls while darker ceilings appear lower. Employing a virtual reality setting we studied the effects of the lightness of different room surfaces on perceived height in two psychophysical experiments. Observers judged the height of rooms varying in physical height as well as in the lightness of ceiling floor and walls. Experiment 1 showed the expected increase of perceived height with increases in ceiling lightness. Unexpectedly the perceived height additionally increased with wall lightness and the effects of wall lightness and ceiling lightness were roughly additive incompatible with a simple effect of the lightness contrast between the ceiling and the walls. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the floor lightness has no significant effect on perceived height and that the total brightness of the room is not the critical factor influencing the perceived height. Neither can the results be explained by previously reported effects of brightness on apparent depth or perceived distance." Surface lightness influences perceived room height.
