Segmentation of the left ventricle LV right ventricle RV cavities and the myocardium MYO from cine cardiac magnetic resonance MR images is an important step for diagnosis and monitoring cardiac diseases. Spatial context information may be highly beneficial for segmentation performance improvement. To this end this paper proposes an iterative multi-path fully convolutional network IMFCN to effectively leverage spatial context for automatic cardiac segmentation in cine MR images. An iterative multi-path fully convolutional neural network for automatic cardiac segmentation in cine MR images.
