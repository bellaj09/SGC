"In this study we investigate the organization of the structural connectome in cognitively well participants with Parkinsons disease PD-Well; n = 31 and a subgroup of participants with Parkinsons disease who have amnestic disturbances PD-MI; n = 9. We explore correlations between connectome topology and vulnerable cognitive domains in Parkinsons disease relative to non-Parkinsons disease peers control n = 40. Diffusion-weighted MRI data and deterministic tractography were used to generate connectomes. Connectome topological indices under study included weighted indices of node strength path length clustering coefficient and small-worldness. Relative to controls node strength was reduced 4.99% for PD-Well p = 0.041 and 13.2% for PD-MI p = 0.004. We found bilateral differences in the node strength between PD-MI and controls for inferior parietal caudal middle frontal posterior cingulate precentral and rostral middle frontal. Correlations between connectome and cognitive domains of interest showed that topological indices of global connectivity negatively associated with working memory and displayed more and larger negative correlations with neuropsychological indices of memory in PD-MI than in PD-Well and controls. These findings suggest that indices of network connectivity are reduced in PD-MI relative to PD-Well and control participants."
