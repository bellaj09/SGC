This paper presents a novel algorithm CVSTSCSP for determining discriminative features from an optimal combination of temporal spectral and spatial information for motor imagery brain computer interfaces. The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique SCSP that can handle the non- stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance correlation mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers LDA and SVM are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of classification error. A reduction of 76.98% 75.65% 73.90% and 72.21% in classification error over both datasets and both classifiers can be observed using the proposed CVSTSCSP method in comparison to CSP SBCSP FBCSP and CVSCSP respectively.
