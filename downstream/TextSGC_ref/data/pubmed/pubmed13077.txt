"Non-intrusive load monitoring NILM is a cost-effective approach that electrical appliances are identified from aggregated whole-field electrical signals according to their extracted electrical characteristics with no need to intrusively deploy smart power meters power plugs installed for individual monitored electrical appliances in a practical field of interest. This work addresses NILM by a parallel Genetic Algorithm GA-embodied Artificial Neural Network ANN for Demand-Side Management DSM in a smart home. An ANNs performance in terms of classification accuracy depends on its training algorithm. Additionally training an ANN/deep NN learning from massive training samples is extremely computationally intensive. Therefore in this work a parallel GA has been conducted and used to integrate meta-heuristics evolutionary computing with an ANN neurocomputing considering its evolution in a parallel execution relating to load disaggregation in a Home Energy Management System HEMS deployed in a real residential field. The parallel GA that involves iterations to excessively cost its execution time for evolving an ANN learning model from massive training samples to NILM in the HEMS and works in a divide-and-conquer manner that can exploit massively parallel computing for evolving an ANN and thus reduce execution time drastically. This work confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the parallel GA-embodied ANN applied to NILM in the HEMS for DSM."
