"Developing a mechanistic insight into the specific brain processes that underpin improvement in negative symptoms can help us design novel chemical and physical treatments against these unrelenting symptoms. The aim of the present study is to explore the longitudinal changes in the brains regional functional efficiency that accompany improvement in negative symptoms seen in first-episode patients with schizophrenia when treated with antipsychotic for 1\xa0year. Forty-seven first-episode patients with schizophrenia were scanned at a drug-naive baseline state and followed up for 1\xa0year to identify negative symptom responders Rn and non-responders NRn. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations fALFF and Granger analysis of effective connectivity EC were used to examine the different patterns of regional function and connectivity between Rn and NRn during the 1\xa0year follow-up. Increase of fALFF in the left superior temporal gyrus STG and increase of EC from the left STG to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC was found in Rn compared to NRn. We further validated that the identified changes in fALFF/EC of STG occur specifically in relation to negative symptoms only i.e. not pseudo-specific in relation to positive extrapyramidal or depressive symptoms and occur irrespective of arbitrary clinical categorization of treatment response. An increase in fALFF in the precuneus and the inferior parietal lobule and a decrease in EC from the left STG to the occipital cortex were also found at the 1\xa0year follow-up irrespective of improvement in negative symptoms. Interventions that improve the functional efficiency of left STG and its prefrontal connectivity may show efficacy in alleviating negative symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia."
