"Recently a combination of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques and graph theoretical approaches has provided a unique opportunity for understanding the patterns of the structural and functional connectivity of the human brain referred to as the human brain connectome. Currently there is a very large amount of brain imaging data that have been collected and there are very high requirements for the computational capabilities that are used in high-resolution connectome research. In this paper we propose a hybrid CPU-GPU framework to accelerate the computation of the human brain connectome. We applied this framework to a publicly available resting-state functional MRI dataset from 197 participants. For each subject we first computed Pearsons Correlation coefficient between any pairs of the time series of gray-matter voxels and then we constructed unweighted undirected brain networks with 58 k nodes and a sparsity range from 0.02% to 0.17%. Next graphic properties of the functional brain networks were quantified analyzed and compared with those of 15 corresponding random networks. With our proposed accelerating framework the above process for each network cost 80150 minutes depending on the network sparsity. Further analyses revealed that high-resolution functional brain networks have efficient small-world properties significant modular structure a power law degree distribution and highly connected nodes in the medial frontal and parietal cortical regions. These results are largely compatible with previous human brain network studies. Taken together our proposed framework can substantially enhance the applicability and efficacy of high-resolution voxel-based brain network analysis and have the potential to accelerate the mapping of the human brain connectome in normal and disease states."
