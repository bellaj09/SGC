The Image Transceiver Device ITD design is based on combining LCOS micro-display image processing tools and back illuminated APS imager in single CMOS chip 1. The device is under development for Head-Mounted Display applications in augmented and virtual reality systems. The main issues with the present design are a high crosstalk of the backside imager and the need to shield the pixel circuitry from the photocharges generated in the silicon substrate. In this publication we present a modified "deep p-well" ITD pixel design which provides a significantly reduced crosstalk level as well as an effective shielding of photo-charges for the pixel circuitry. The simulation performed using Silvaco software ATLAS Silicon Device Simulator Ray Trace and Light Absorption programs Silvaco International 1998 shows that the new approach provides high photo response and allows increasing the optimal thickness of the die over and above the 10-15 micrometers commonly used for back illuminated imaging devices thereby improving its mechanical ruggedness following the thinning process and also providing a more efficient absorption of the long wavelength photons. The proposed deep p-well pixel structure is also a technology solution for the fabrication of high performance back illuminated CMOS image sensors.
