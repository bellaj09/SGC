"We propose a novel airway segmentation method in volumetric chest computed tomography CT and evaluate its performance on multiple datasets. The segmentation is performed voxel-by-voxel by a 2.5D convolutional neural net 2.5D CNN trained in a supervised manner. To enhance the accuracy of the segmented airway tree we simultaneously took three adjacent slices in each of the orthogonal directions including axial sagittal and coronal and fine-tuned the parameters that influence the tree length and the number of leakage. The gold standard of airway segmentation was generated by a semi-automated method using AVIEW. The 2.5D CNN was trained and evaluated on a subset of inspiratory thoracic CT scans taken from the Korean obstructive lung disease study which includes normal subjects and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The reliability and further practicality of our proposed method was demonstrated in multiple datasets. In eight test datasets collected by the same imaging protocol the percentage detected tree length false positive rate and Dice similarity coefficient of our method were 92.16% 7.74% and 0.8997\u202f\u202f0.0892 respectively. In 20 test datasets of the EXACT09 challenge the percentage detected tree length was 60.1% and the false positive rate was 4.56%. Our fully automated end-to-end segmentation method could be applied in radiologic practice."
