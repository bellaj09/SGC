Surgical performance is affected by distractors and interruptions to surgical workflow that exist in the operating room. However traditional surgical simulators are used to train surgeons in a skills laboratory that does not recreate these conditions. To overcome this limitation we have developed a novel immersive virtual reality Gen2-VR system to train surgeons in these environments. This study was to establish face and construct validity of our system. Face and construct validation of a next generation virtual reality Gen2-VR surgical simulator.
