"Complex structural connectivity of the mammalian brain is believed to underlie the versatility of neural computations. Many previous studies have investigated properties of small subsystems or coarse connectivity among large brain regions that are often binarized and lack spatial information. Yet little is known about spatial embedding of the detailed whole-brain connectivity and its functional implications. We focus on closing this gap by analyzing how spatially-constrained neural connectivity shapes synchronization of the brain dynamics based on a system of coupled phase oscillators on a mammalian whole-brain network at the mesoscopic level. This was made possible by the recent development of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas constructed from viral tracing experiments together with a new mapping algorithm. We investigated whether the network can be compactly represented based on the spatial dependence of the network topology. We found that the connectivity has a significant spatial dependence with spatially close brain regions strongly connected and distal regions weakly connected following a power law. However there are a number of residuals above the power-law fit indicating connections between brain regions that are stronger than predicted by the power-law relationship. By measuring the sensitivity of the network order parameter we show how these strong connections dispersed across multiple spatial scales of the network promote rapid transitions between partial synchronization and more global synchronization as the global coupling coefficient changes. We further demonstrate the significance of the locations of the residual connections suggesting a possible link between the network complexity and the brains exceptional ability to swiftly switch computational states depending on stimulus and behavioral context."
