Walking is for humans an essential task in our daily life. However there is a huge and growing number of people who have this ability diminished or are not able to walk due to motor disabilities. In this paper a system to detect the start and the stop of the gait through electroencephalographic signals has been developed. The system has been designed in order to be applied in the future to control a lower limb exoskeleton to help stroke or spinal cord injured patients during the gait. The brain-machine interface BMI training has been optimized through a preliminary analysis using the brain information recorded during the experiments performed by three healthy subjects. Afterward the system has been verified by other four healthy subjects and three patients in a real-time test. In both preliminary optimization analysis and real-time tests the results obtained are very similar. The true positive rates are Formula: see text and Formula: see text respectively. Regarding the false positive per minute the values are also very similar decreasing from 2.66 in preliminary tests to 1.90 in real-time. Finally the average latencies in the detection of the movement intentions are 794 and 798Formula: see textms preliminary and real-time tests respectively.
