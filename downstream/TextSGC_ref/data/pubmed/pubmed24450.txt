This paper presents a setup for the real-time extraction of Electroencephalography EEG and Electrocardiogram ECG features indicating the level of focus relaxation or meditation of a given subject. An algorithm for detecting meditation in real-time using the extracted ECG features is designed and shown to lead to accurate results using an online ECG measurement dataset. Similar methods can be used for EEG data such that the proposed measurement setup can be used for example for investigating the effect of virtual reality based EEG training with and without neurofeedback on the capability of subjects to focus relax or meditate.
