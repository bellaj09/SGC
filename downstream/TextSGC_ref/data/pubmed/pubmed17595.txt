"Animal studies have shown that substantia nigra SN dopaminergic DA neurons strengthen action-reward associations during reinforcement learning but their role in human learning is not known. Here we applied microstimulation in the SN of 11 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery for the treatment of Parkinsons disease as they performed a two-alternative probability learning task in which rewards were contingent on stimuli rather than actions. Subjects demonstrated decreased learning from reward trials that were accompanied by phasic SN microstimulation compared with reward trials without stimulation. Subjects who showed large decreases in learning also showed an increased bias toward repeating actions after stimulation trials; therefore stimulation may have decreased learning by strengthening action-reward associations rather than stimulus-reward associations. Our findings build on previous studies implicating SN DA neurons in preferentially strengthening action-reward associations during reinforcement learning." Microstimulation of the human substantia nigra alters reinforcement learning.
