Computational scanning of peptide candidates that bind to a specific major histocompatibility complex MHC can speed up the peptide-based vaccine development process and therefore various methods are being actively developed. Recently machine-learning-based methods have generated successful results by training large amounts of experimental data. However many machine learning-based methods are generally less sensitive in recognizing locally-clustered interactions which can synergistically stabilize peptide binding. Deep convolutional neural network DCNN is a deep learning method inspired by visual recognition process of animal brain and it is known to be able to capture meaningful local patterns from 2D images. Once the peptide-MHC interactions can be encoded into image-like arrayILA data DCNN can be employed to build a predictive model for peptide-MHC binding prediction. In this study we demonstrated that DCNN is able to not only reliably predict peptide-MHC binding but also sensitively detect locally-clustered interactions.
