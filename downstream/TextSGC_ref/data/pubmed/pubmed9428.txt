Untargeted steroid identification represents a great analytical challenge even when using sophisticated technology such as two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry GC\u202f\u202fGCHRMS due to the chemical similarity of the analytes. Moreover when analytical standards mass spectral and retention index databases are not available compound annotation is cumbersome. Hence there is a need for the development of retention time prediction models in order to explore new annotation approaches. In this work we evaluated the use of several in silico methods for retention time prediction in multidimensional gas chromatography. We use three classical machine learning CML algorithms Partial Least Squares PLS Support Vector Regression SVR and Random Forest Regression RFR and two deep learning approaches dense neural network DNN and three-dimensional convolutional neural network CNN. Whereas molecular descriptors were utilized for the CLM and DNN algorithms three-dimensional molecular representation based on the electrostatic potential ESP was studied as input data as is for the CNN. All the developed models showed similar performances with Q2 values over 0.9. However among all CNN showed the best performance resulting in average retention time prediction errors of 2% and 6% for the first and second separation dimension respectively. Additionally only the three-dimensional ESP representation coupled with CNN was able to extract the stereochemical information crucial for the separation of diastereomers. The combination of retention time prediction and high-resolution mass spectral data applied to clinical samples enabled the untargeted annotation of 12 steroid metabolites in the urine of new-borns.
