"Airplane engines are vital aircraft components so regular inspections of the engines are required to ensure their stable operation. A dynamic computed tomography CT system has been proposed by our group for in situ nondestructive testing of airplane engines which takes advantage of the rotors self-rotation. However static parts of the engines cause blocked artifacts in the reconstructed image leading to misinterpretations of the condition of engines. In this paper in order to remove the artifacts produced by the projection of the static parts in CT reconstruction two deep-learning-based methods are proposed which use U-Net to perform correction in the projection domain. The projection of static parts can be estimated by a well-trained U-Net and subsequently can be subtracted from the projections of the engine. Finally the rotor can be reconstructed from the corrected projections. The results shown in this paper indicate that the proposed methods are practical and effective for removing those blocked artifacts and recovering the details of rotating parts which will in turn maximize the utilization of the dynamic CT system for in situ engine tests."
