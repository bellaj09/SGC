"Emergency departments ED in hospitals usually suffer from crowdedness and long waiting times for treatment. The complexity of the patients path flows and their controls come from the patients diverse acute level personalized treatment process and interconnected medical staff and resources. One of the factors which has been controlled is the dynamic situation change such as the patients composition and resources availability. The patients scheduling is thus complicated in consideration of various factors to achieve ED efficiency. To address this issue a deep reinforcement learning RL is designed and applied in an ED patients scheduling process. Before applying the deep RL the mathematical model and the Markov decision process MDP for the ED is presented and formulated. Then the algorithm of the RL based on deep Q-networks DQN is designed to determine the optimal policy for scheduling patients. To evaluate the performance of the deep RL it is compared with the dispatching rules presented in the study. The deep RL is shown to outperform the dispatching rules in terms of minimizing the weighted waiting time of the patients and the penalty of emergent patients in the suggested scenarios. This study demonstrates the successful implementation of the deep RL for ED applications particularly in assisting decision-makers under the dynamic environment of an ED."
