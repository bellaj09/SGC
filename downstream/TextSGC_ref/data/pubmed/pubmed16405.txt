"Recently we have proposed a real-time tracker that simultaneously tracks the 3-D head pose and facial actions in monocular video sequences that can be provided by low quality cameras. This paper has two main contributions. First we propose an automatic 3-D face pose initialization scheme for the real-time tracker by adopting a 2-D face detector and an eigenface system. Second we use the proposed methods-the initialization and tracking-for enhancing the human-machine interaction functionality of an AIBO robot. More precisely we show how the orientation of the robots camera or any active vision system can be controlled through the estimation of the users head pose. Applications based on head-pose imitation such as telepresence virtual reality and video games can directly exploit the proposed techniques. Experiments on real videos confirm the robustness and usefulness of the proposed methods." Three-dimensional face pose detection and tracking using monocular videos: tool and application.
