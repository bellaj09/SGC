The research field of connectomics arose just recently with the development of new three-dimensional-electron microscopy EM techniques and increasing computing power. So far only a few model species for example mouse the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have been studied using this approach. Here we present a first attempt to expand this circle to include pycnogonids which hold a key position for the understanding of arthropod evolution. The visual neuropils in Achelia langi are studied using a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope FIB-SEM crossbeam-workstation and a three-dimensional serial reconstruction of the connectome is presented.
