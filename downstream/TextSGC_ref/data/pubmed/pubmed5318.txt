There is some evidence that functional connectivity FC measures obtained at rest may reflect individual differences in cognitive capabilities. We tested this possibility by using the FAS test as a measure of phonemic fluency. Seed regions of the main brain areas involved in this task were extracted from meta-analysis results Wagner et al. 2014 and used for pairwise resting-state FC analysis. Ninety-three undergraduates completed the FAS test outside the scanner. A correlation analysis was conducted between the F-A-S scores behavioral testing and the pairwise FC pattern of verbal fluency regions of interest. Results showed that the higher FC between the thalamus and the cerebellum and the lower FCs between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right insula and between the supplementary motor area and the right insula were associated with better performance on the FAS test. Regression analyses revealed that the first two FCs contributed independently to this better phonemic fluency reflecting a more general attentional factor FC between thalamus and cerebellum and a more specific fluency factor FC between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right insula. The results support the Spontaneous Trait Reactivation hypothesis which explains how resting-state derived measures may reflect individual differences in cognitive abilities. Functional connectivity in resting state as a phonemic fluency ability measure.
