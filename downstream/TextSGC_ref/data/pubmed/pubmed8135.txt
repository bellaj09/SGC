Obesity is increasingly prevalent and associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is an accurate method for determination of body fat volume and distribution. However quantifying body fat from numerous MRI slices is tedious and time-consuming. Here we developed a deep learning-based method for measuring visceral and subcutaneous fat in the abdominal region of mice. Congenic mice only differ from C57BL/6 B6 Apoe knockout Apoe-/- mice in chromosome 9 that is replaced by C3H/HeJ genome. Male congenic mice had lighter body weight than B6-Apoe-/- mice after being fed 14 weeks of Western diet. Axial and coronal T1-weighted sequencing at 1-mm-thickness and 1-mm-gap was acquired with a 7T Bruker ClinScan scanner. A deep learning approach was developed for segmenting visceral and subcutaneous fat based on the U-net architecture made publicly available through the open-source ANTsRNet library-a growing repository of well-known neural networks. The volumes of subcutaneous and visceral fat measured through our approach were highly comparable with those from manual measurements. The Dice score root-mean-square error RMSE and correlation analysis demonstrated the similarity between two methods in quantifying visceral and subcutaneous fat. Analysis with the automated method showed significant reductions in volumes of visceral and subcutaneous fat but not non-fat tissues in congenic mice compared to B6 mice. These results demonstrate the accuracy of deep learning in quantification of abdominal fat and its significance in determining body weight.
