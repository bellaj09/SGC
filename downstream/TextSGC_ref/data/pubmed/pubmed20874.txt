The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical validation of a Virtual Reality Environment VRE designed to normalize eating patterns in Eating Disorders ED. The efficacy of VR in eliciting emotions sense of presence and reality of the VRE were explored in 22 ED patients and 37 healthy eating individuals. The VRE non-immersive consisted of a kitchen room where participants had to eat a virtual pizza. In order to assess the sense of presence and reality produced by the VRE participants answered seven questions with a Likert scale 0-10 during the experience and then filled out the Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire RJPQ and ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory ITC-SOPI. The results showed that the VRE induced a sense of presence and was felt as real for both groups without differences in the experience of "ease" with the VRE sense of physical space or the ecological validity assigned to the virtual kitchen and eating virtually. However the ED patients reported paying more attention and experiencing greater emotional involvement and dysphoria after virtual eating. The results suggest that the VRE was clinically meaningful to the ED patients and might be a relevant therapy tool for normalizing their eating patterns.
