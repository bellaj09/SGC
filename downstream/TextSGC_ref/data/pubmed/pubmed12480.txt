Optical imaging is evolving as a key technique for advanced sensing in the operating room. Recent research has shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to address the inverse problem of converting pixel-wise multispectral reflectance measurements to underlying tissue parameters such as oxygenation. Assessment of the specific hardware used in conjunction with such algorithms however has not properly addressed the possibility that the problem may be ill-posed. Uncertainty-aware performance assessment of optical imaging modalities with invertible neural networks.
