In the current study we investigated the ways in which the acquisition and transfer of spatial knowledge were affected by a the type of spatial relations predominately experienced during learning routes determined by walkways vs. straight-line paths between locations; b environmental complexity; and c the availability of rotational body-based information. Participants learned the layout of a virtual shopping mall by repeatedly searching for target storefronts located in 1 of the buildings. We created 2 novel learning conditions to encourage participants to use either route knowledge paths on walkways between buildings or survey knowledge straight-line distances and directions from storefront to storefront to find the target and measured the development of route and survey knowledge in both learning conditions. Environmental complexity was manipulated by varying the alignment of the buildings with the enclosure and the visibility within space. Body-based information was manipulated by having participants perform the experiment in front of a computer monitor or using a head-mounted display. After navigation participants pointed to various storefronts from a fixed position and orientation. Results showed that the frequently used spatial knowledge could be developed similarly across environments with different complexities but the infrequently used spatial knowledge was less developed in the complex environment. Furthermore rotational body-based information facilitated spatial learning under certain conditions. Our results suggest that path integration may play an important role in spatial knowledge transfer both from route to survey knowledge cognitive map construction and from survey to route knowledge using cognitive map to guide wayfinding.
