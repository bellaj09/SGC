End-stage renal disease ESRD is a common complicated disorder that is generally associated with an altered central nervous system and cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging studies have recorded aberrant brain circuits in patients with ESRD that were closely associated with abnormal clinical manifestations. However whether the altered interaction was within and/or between these circuits is largely unclear. We investigated brain topological organization and/or module interaction by employing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI and modularity network analysis in 24 patients with ESRD and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy control HC subjects. Stroop task was used to evaluate the performance of cognitive control in all subjects. At the global level ESRD patients exhibited significantly decreased global and local efficiency which were mainly related to abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus IFG. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to estimate the relationships between network efficiency and blood biochemistry level urea creatine phosphate Ca2+ hematocrit cystatin hemoglobin levels parathyroid hormone K+ and Na+ and only the hematocrit level was significantly associated with global efficiency in patients with ESRD. At the modular level we discovered an aberrant brain interaction between the amygdala- and IFG-related circuits in the ESRD group and the regional efficiency of the amygdala was observably relative to the performance of cognitive control in patients with ESRD. Our results suggested that ESRD exhibited aberrant brain functional topological organization and module-level interaction between the affective and cognitive control circuits providing crucial insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of ESRD patients.
