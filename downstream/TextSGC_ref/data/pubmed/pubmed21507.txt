In this paper we present a portable wireless electrocorticography ECoG system. It uses a high resolution 32-channel flexible ECoG electrodes array to collect electrical signals of brain activities and to stimulate the lesions. Electronic circuits are designed for signal acquisition processing and transmission using Bluetooth Low Energy 4 LTE4 for wireless communication with cell phone. In-vivo experiments on a rat show that the flexible ECoG system can accurately record electrical signals of brain activities and transmit them to cell phone with a maximal sampling rate of 30 ksampling/s per channel. It demonstrates that the epilepsy lesions can be detected located and treated through the ECoG system. The wireless ECoG system has low energy consumption and high brain spatial resolution thus has great prospects for future application.
