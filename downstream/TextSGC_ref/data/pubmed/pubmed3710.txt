"Brain connectomics is a relatively new field of research that maps the brains large-scale structural and functional networks at rest. The connectome of the human brain develops progressively from early infancy to late adolescence and this review describes the theory behind the concept and its applicability to studying the development and dynamics of brain networks through graph theoretical metrics. We also describe how the brain connectome concept could further our understanding of autism spectrum disorders ASD CONCLUSION: Further research into the functional child brain connectome concept could enhance our understanding of atypical brain connectivity patterns presumed to be linked to ASD." The functional brain connectome of the child and autism spectrum disorders.
