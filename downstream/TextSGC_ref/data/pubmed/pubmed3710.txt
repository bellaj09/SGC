"As mesial temporal lobe epilepsy mTLE has been recognized as a network disorder a longitudinal connectome investigation may shed new light on the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology related to distinct surgical outcomes. Resting-state functional MRI data was acquired from mTLE patients before n\u2009=\u200937 and after n\u2009=\u200924 anterior temporal lobectomy. According to surgical outcome patients were classified as seizure-free SF n\u2009=\u200914 or non-seizure-free NSF n\u2009=\u200910. First we found higher network resilience to targeted attack on topologically central nodes in the SF group compared to the NSF group preoperatively. Next a two-way mixed analysis of variance with between-subject factor outcome SF vs. NSF and within-subject factor treatment pre-operation vs. post-operation revealed divergent dynamic reorganization in nodal topological characteristics between groups in the temporoparietal junction and its connection with the ventral prefrontal cortex. We also correlated the network damage score caused by surgical resection with postsurgical brain function and found that the damage score negatively correlated with postoperative global and local parallel information processing. Taken together dynamic connectomic architecture provides vital information for selecting surgical candidates and for understanding brain recovery mechanisms following epilepsy surgery."
