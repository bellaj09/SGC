Dj vu is the striking sense that the present situation feels familiar alongside the realization that it has to be new. According to the Gestalt familiarity hypothesis dj vu results when the configuration of elements within a scene maps onto a configuration previously seen but the previous scene fails to come to mind. We examined this using virtual reality VR technology. When a new immersive VR scene resembled a previously-viewed scene in its configuration but people failed to recall the previously-viewed scene familiarity ratings and reports of dj vu were indeed higher than for completely novel scenes. People also exhibited the contrasting sense of newness and of familiarity that is characteristic of dj vu. Familiarity ratings and dj vu reports among scenes recognized as new increased with increasing feature-match of a scene to one stored in memory suggesting that feature-matching can produce familiarity and dj vu when recall fails. Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to dj vu: a virtual reality investigation.
