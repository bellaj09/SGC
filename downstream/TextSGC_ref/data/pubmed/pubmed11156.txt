CD8+ T cells constitute an essential compartment of the adaptive immune system. During immune responses nave T cells become functional as they are primed with their cognate determinants by the antigen presenting cells. Current methods of identifying activated CD8+ T cells are laborious time-consuming and expensive due to the extensive list of required reagents. Here we demonstrate an optical imaging approach featuring quantitative phase imaging to distinguish activated CD8+ T cells from nave CD8+ T cells in a rapid and reagent-free manner. We measured the dry mass of live cells and employed transport-based morphometry to better understand their differential morphological attributes. Our results reveal that upon activation the dry cell mass of T cells increases significantly in comparison to that of unstimulated cells. By employing deep learning formalism we are able to accurately predict the population ratios of unknown mixed population based on the acquired quantitative phase images. We envision that with further refinement this label-free method of T cell phenotyping will lead to a rapid and cost-effective platform for assaying T cell responses to candidate antigens in the near future.
