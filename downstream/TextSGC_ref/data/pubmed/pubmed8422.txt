Transcriptomics data are relevant to address a number of challenges in Toxicogenomics TGx. After careful planning of exposure conditions and data preprocessing the TGx data can be used in predictive toxicology where more advanced modelling techniques are applied. The large volume of molecular profiles produced by omics-based technologies allows the development and application of artificial intelligence AI methods in TGx. Indeed the publicly available omics datasets are constantly increasing together with a plethora of different methods that are made available to facilitate their analysis interpretation and the generation of accurate and stable predictive models. In this review we present the state-of-the-art of data modelling applied to transcriptomics data in TGx. We show how the benchmark dose BMD analysis can be applied to TGx data. We review read across and adverse outcome pathways AOP modelling methodologies. We discuss how network-based approaches can be successfully employed to clarify the mechanism of action MOA or specific biomarkers of exposure. We also describe the main AI methodologies applied to TGx data to create predictive classification and regression models and we address current challenges. Finally we present a short description of deep learning DL and data integration methodologies applied in these contexts. Modelling of TGx data represents a valuable tool for more accurate chemical safety assessment. This review is the third part of a three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.
