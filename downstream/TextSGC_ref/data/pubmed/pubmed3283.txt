Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging RFMRI enables researchers to monitor fluctuations in the spontaneous brain activities of thousands of regions in the human brain simultaneously representing a popular tool for macro-scale functional connectomics to characterize normal brain function mind-brain associations and the various disorders. However the test-retest reliability of RFMRI remains largely unknown. We review previously published papers on the test-retest reliability of voxel-wise metrics and conduct a meta-summary reliability analysis of seven common brain networks. This analysis revealed that the heteromodal associative default control and attention networks were mostly reliable across the seven networks. Regarding examined metrics independent component analysis with dual regression local functional homogeneity and functional homotopic connectivity were the three mostly reliable RFMRI metrics. These observations can guide the use of reliable metrics and further improvement of test-retest reliability for other metics in functional connectomics. We discuss the main issues with low reliability related to sub-optimal design and the choice of data processing options. Future research should use large-sample test-retest data to rectify both the within-subject and between-subject variability of RFMRI measurements and accelerate the application of functional connectomics.
