Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies report age-related changes in resting-state functional connectivity rsFC suggesting altered or reorganized connectivity patterns with age. However age-related changes in neurovascular coupling might also partially account for altered connectivity patterns. Here we used resting-state magnetoencephalography MEG and a connectome approach in carefully selected healthy young adults and elders. The MEG connectome was estimated as rsFC matrices involving forty nodes from six major \xa0resting-state networks. Source-level rsFC maps were computed in relevant frequency bands using leakage-corrected envelope correlations. Group differences were statistically assessed using non-parametric permutation tests. Our results failed to evidence significant age-related differences after correction for multiple comparisons in the  and the  bands both for static and dynamic rsFC suggesting that the electrophysiological connectome is maintained in healthy ageing. Further studies should compare the evolution of the human brain connectome as estimated using fMRI and MEG in same healthy young and elder adults as well as in ageing conditions associated with cognitive decline. At present our results are in agreement with the brain maintenance theory for successful aging as they suggest that preserved intrinsic functional brain integration contributes to preserved cognitive functioning in healthy elders. The electrophysiological connectome is maintained in healthy elders: a power envelope correlation MEG study.
