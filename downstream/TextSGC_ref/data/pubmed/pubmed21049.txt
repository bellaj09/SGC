Brain computer interfaces BCI represent an alternative for patients whose cognitive functions are preserved but are unable to communicate via conventional means. A commonly used BCI paradigm is based on the detection of event-related potentials particularly the P300 immersed in the electroencephalogram EEG. In order to transfer laboratory-tested BCIs into systems that can be used by at homes it is relevant to investigate if it is possible to select a limited set of EEG channels that work for most subjects and across different sessions without a significant decrease in performance. In this work two strategies for channel selection for a single-trial P300 brain computer interface were evaluated and compared. The first strategy was tailored specifically for each subject whereas the second strategy aimed at finding a subject-independent set of channels. In both strategies genetic algorithms GAs and recursive feature elimination algorithms were used. The classification stage was performed using a linear discriminant. A dataset of EEG recordings from 18 healthy subjects was used test the proposed configurations. Performance indexes were calculated to evaluate the system. Results showed that a fixed subset of four subject-independent EEG channels selected using GA provided the best compromise between BCI setup and single-trial system performance.
