"Excessive pain during medical procedures performed in unanesthetized patients is frequently reported but can be reduced with virtual reality VR distraction. Increasing the persons illusion of going into the virtual world may increase how effectively VR distracts pain. Healthy volunteers aged 18-20 years participated in a double-blind between-groups design. Each subject received a brief baseline thermal pain stimulus and the same stimulus again minutes later with either a Low Tech or a High Tech VR distraction. Each subject provided subjective 0-10 ratings of cognitive sensory and affective components of pain and rated their illusion of going inside the virtual world. Subjects in the High Tech VR group reported a stronger illusion of going into the virtual world VR presence than subjects in the Low Tech VR group 4.2 vs. 2.5 respectively P = 0.009 and more pain reduction reduction of worst pain is 3.1 for High Tech VR vs. 0.7 for Low Tech VR P < 0.001. Across groups the amount of pain reduction was positively and significantly correlated with VR presence levels reported by subjects  r = 0.48 for worst pain P < 0.005." Manipulating presence influences the magnitude of virtual reality analgesia.
