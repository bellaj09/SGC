Neuroprosthetics are artificial devices or systems designed to generate restore or modulate a range of neurally mediated functions. These include sensorimotor visual auditory cognitive affective and volitional functions that have been impaired or lost from congenital anomalies traumatic brain injury infection amputation or neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Cochlear implants visual prosthetics deep brain stimulation brain-computer interfaces brain-to-brain interfaces and hippocampal prosthetics can bypass replace or compensate for dysfunctional neural circuits brain injury and limb loss. They can enable people with these conditions to gain or regain varying degrees of control of thought and behavior. These direct and indirect interventions in the brain raise general ethical questions about weighing the potential benefit of altering neural circuits against the potential harm from neurophysiological and psychological sequelae. Other ethical questions are more specific to the therapeutic goals of particular neuroprosthetics and the conditions for which they are indicated. These include informed consent agency autonomy free will and identity. Ethical issues in neuroprosthetics.
