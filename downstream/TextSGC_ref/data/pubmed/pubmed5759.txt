"Resting-state functional connectivity rs-FC is a promising neuromarker for cognitive decline in aging population based on its ability to reveal functional differences associated with cognitive impairment across individuals and because rs-fMRI may be less taxing for participants than task-based fMRI or neuropsychological tests. Here we employ an approach that uses rs-FC to predict the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale 11 items; ADAS11 scores which measure overall cognitive functioning in novel individuals. We applied this technique connectome-based predictive modeling to a heterogeneous sample of 59 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative including normal aging mild cognitive impairment and AD subjects. First we built linear regression models to predict ADAS11 scores from rs-FC measured with Pearsons r correlation. The positive network model tested with leave-one-out cross validation LOOCV significantly predicted individual differences in cognitive function from rs-FC. In a second analysis we considered other functional connectivity features accordance and discordance which disentangle the correlation and anticorrelation components of activity timecourses between brain areas. Using partial least square regression and LOOCV we again built models to successfully predict ADAS11 scores in novel individuals. Our study provides promising evidence that rs-FC can reveal cognitive impairment in an aging population although more development is needed for clinical application."
