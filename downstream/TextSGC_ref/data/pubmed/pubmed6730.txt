One goal of systems neuroscience is a structure-function model of nervous system organization that would allow mechanistic linking of mind brain and behavior. A necessary but not sufficient foundation is a connectome a complete matrix of structural connections between the nodes of a nervous system. Connections between two nodes can be described at four nested levels of analysis: macroconnections between gray matter regions mesoconnections between neuron types microconnections between individual neurons and nanoconnections at synapses. A long history of attempts to understand how the brain operates as a system began at the macrolevel in the fifth century was revolutionized at the meso- and microlevels by Cajal and others in the late nineteenth century and reached the nanolevel in the mid-twentieth century with the advent of electron microscopy. The greatest challenge today is extracting knowledge and understanding of nervous system structure-function architecture from vast amounts of data. From Cajal to Connectome and Beyond.
