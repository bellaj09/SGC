Multiplayer video games promoting exercise-based rehabilitation may facilitate motor learning by increasing motivation through social interaction. However a major design challenge is to enable meaningful inter-subject interaction whilst allowing for significant skill differences between players. We present a novel motor-training paradigm that allows real-time collaboration and performance enhancement across a wide range of inter-subject skill mismatches including disabled vs. able-bodied partnerships. Balancing the playing field: collaborative gaming for physical training.
