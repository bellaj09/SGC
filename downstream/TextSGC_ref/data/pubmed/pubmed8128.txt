Based on international diagnostic guidelines high-resolution CT plays a central part in the diagnosis of fibrotic lung disease. In the correct clinical context when high-resolution CT appearances are those of usual interstitial pneumonia a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can be made without surgical lung biopsy. We investigated the use of a deep learning algorithm for provision of automated classification of fibrotic lung disease on high-resolution CT according to criteria specified in two international diagnostic guideline statements: the 2011 American Thoracic Society ATS/European Respiratory Society ERS/Japanese Respiratory Society JRS/Latin American Thoracic Association ALAT guidelines for diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the Fleischner Society diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
