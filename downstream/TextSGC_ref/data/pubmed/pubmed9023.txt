In the era of Next-Generation Sequencing and shotgun proteomics the sequences of animal toxigenic proteins are being generated at rates exceeding the pace of traditional means for empirical toxicity verification. To facilitate the automation of toxin identification from protein sequences we trained Recurrent Neural Networks with Gated Recurrent Units on publicly available datasets. The resulting models are available via the novel software package TOXIFY allowing users to infer the probability of a given protein sequence being a venom protein. TOXIFY is more than 20X faster and uses over an order of magnitude less memory than previously published methods. Additionally TOXIFY is more accurate precise and sensitive at classifying venom proteins. TOXIFY: a deep learning approach to classify animal venom proteins.
