Diffusion-weighted imaging DWI quantifies water molecule diffusion within tissues and is becoming an increasingly used technique. However it is very challenging as correct quantification depends on many different factors ranging from acquisition parameters to a long pipeline of image processing. In this work we investigated the influence of voxel geometry on diffusion analysis comparing different acquisition orientations as well as isometric and anisometric voxels. Diffusion-weighted images of one rat brain were acquired with four different voxel geometries one isometric and three anisometric in different directions and three different encoding orientations coronal axial and sagittal. Diffusion tensor scalar measurements tractography and the brain structural connectome were analyzed for each of the 12 acquisitions. The acquisition direction with respect to the main magnetic field orientation affected the diffusion results. When the acquisition slice-encoding direction was not aligned with the main magnetic field there were more artifacts and a lower signal-to-noise ratio that led to less anisotropic tensors lower fractional anisotropic values producing poorer quality results. The use of anisometric voxels generated statistically significant differences in the values of diffusion metrics in specific regions. It also elicited differences in tract reconstruction and in different graph metric values describing the brain networks. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the geometric aspects of acquisitions especially when comparing diffusion data acquired using different geometries.
