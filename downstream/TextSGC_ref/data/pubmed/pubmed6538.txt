The large pose variations and misalignment errors exhibited by person images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification ReID. Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation part segmentation etc. to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations. While boosting the ReID accuracy those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune. To chase a more efficient solution we propose a Part-Guided Representation PGR composed of Pose Invariant Feature PIF and Local Descriptive Feature LDF respectively. We call PGR "Part-Guided" because it is trained and supervised by local part cues. Specifically PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization. LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation. In this way extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction. Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR. Pose-Guided Representation Learning for Person Re-Identification.
