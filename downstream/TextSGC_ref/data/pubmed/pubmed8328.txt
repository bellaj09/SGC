Radiology imaging and imaging-guided interventions which provide multi-parametric morphologic and functional information are playing an increasingly significant role in precision medicine. Radiologists are trained to understand the imaging phenotypes transcribe those observations phenotypes to correlate with underlying diseases and to characterize the images. However in order to understand and characterize the molecular phenotype to obtain genomic information of solid heterogeneous tumours the advanced sequencing of those tissues using biopsy is required. Thus radiologists image the tissues from various views and angles in order to have the complete image phenotypes thereby acquiring a huge amount of data. Deriving meaningful details from all these radiological data becomes challenging and raises the big data issues. Therefore interest in the application of radiomics has been growing in recent years as it has the potential to provide significant interpretive and predictive information for decision support. Radiomics is a combination of conventional computer-aided diagnosis deep learning methods and human skills and thus can be used for quantitative characterization of tumour phenotypes. This paper discusses the overview of radiomics workflow the results of various radiomics-based studies conducted using various radiological images such as computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI and positron-emission tomography PET the challenges we are facing and the potential contribution of radiomics towards precision medicine. Towards precision medicine: from quantitative imaging to radiomics.
