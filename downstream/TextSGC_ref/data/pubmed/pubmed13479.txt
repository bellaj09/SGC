"Artificial intelligence AI based on convolutional neural networks CNNs has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic interfaces. Methods: In this study we used a dataset of labeled 35900 optical coherence tomography OCT images obtained from age-related macular degeneration AMD patients and used them to train three types of CNNs to perform AMD diagnosis. Results: Here we present an AI- and cloud-based telemedicine interaction tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence tomography OCT imaging data our AI-based system achieved the same image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our hospital. The AI platforms detection accuracy was generally higher than 90% and was significantly superior p < 0.001 to that of medical students 69.4% and 68.9% and equal p = 0.99 to that of retinal specialists 92.73% and 91.90%. Furthermore it provided appropriate treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists. Conclusions: We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud computing based on this AI platform available at https://www.ym.edu.tw/~AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine." Artificial intelligence-based decision-making for age-related macular degeneration.
