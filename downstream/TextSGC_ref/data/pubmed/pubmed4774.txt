II-spectrin is the generally expressed member of the -spectrin family of elongated polypeptides that form micrometer-scale networks associated with plasma membranes. We addressed in vivo functions of II-spectrin in neurons by knockout of II-spectrin in mouse neural progenitors. II-spectrin deficiency caused severe defects in long-range axonal connectivity and axonal degeneration. II-spectrin-null neurons exhibited reduced axon growth loss of actin-spectrin-based periodic membrane skeleton and impaired bidirectional axonal transport of synaptic cargo. We found that II-spectrin associates with KIF3A KIF5B KIF1A and dynactin implicating spectrin in the coupling of motors and synaptic cargo. II-spectrin required phosphoinositide lipid binding to promote axonal transport and restore axon growth. Knockout of ankyrin-B AnkB a II-spectrin partner primarily impaired retrograde organelle transport while double knockout of II-spectrin and AnkB nearly eliminated transport. Thus II-spectrin promotes both axon growth and axon stability through establishing the actin-spectrin-based membrane-associated periodic skeleton as well as enabling axonal transport of synaptic cargo. II-spectrin promotes mouse brain connectivity through stabilizing axonal plasma membranes and enabling axonal organelle transport.
