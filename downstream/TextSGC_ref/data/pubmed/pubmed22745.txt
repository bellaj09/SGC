During the past decade the clinical applications of laparoscopic surgery in urology have been growing steadily. The laparoscopic version of various procedures such as nephrectomy is becoming the standard of care. This has led to an increased need for laparoscopic training in urology and focused the attention on the various modalities for laparoscopic skill acquisition. The common training modalities for laparoscopy are box trainers animal and cadaveric laparoscopy and virtual reality simulators. Each modality carries its own benefits to the practicing surgeon. The box trainers are the first practiced and are basic training simulators. They were first designed to help with training in basic laparoscopic skills and to assist surgeons in getting acquainted with instruments. However these simple boxes are being upgraded constantly by tissue- and organ-specific models allowing the surgeon to train in a convenient and cost-effective environment. This article describes the ways to work with box trainers from basic skills to advanced laparoscopic tasks and discusses the contribution of these trainers to real surgery as well as their role in defining criterion levels of surgical performance.
