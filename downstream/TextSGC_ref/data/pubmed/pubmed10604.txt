The microbiome has been shown to have an impact on the development of various diseases in the host. Being able to make an accurate prediction of the phenotype of a genomic sample based on its microbial taxonomic abundance profile is an important problem for personalized medicine. In this paper we examine the potential of using a deep learning framework a convolutional neural network CNN for such a prediction. To facilitate the CNN learning we explore the structure of abundance profiles by creating the phylogenetic tree and by designing a scheme to embed the tree to a matrix that retains the spatial relationship of nodes in the tree and their quantitative characteristics. The proposed CNN framework is highly accurate achieving a 99.47% of accuracy based on the evaluation on a dataset 1967 samples of three phenotypes. Our result demonstrated the feasibility and promising aspect of CNN in the classification of sample phenotype. Using convolutional neural networks to explore the microbiome.
