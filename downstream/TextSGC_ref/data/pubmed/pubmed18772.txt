Spatially rendering sounds using head-related transfer functions HRTFs is an important part of creating immersive audio experiences for virtual reality applications. However elevation perception remains challenging when generic non-personalized HRTFs are used. This study investigated whether digital audio effects applied to a generic set of HRTFs could improve sound localization in the vertical plane. Several of the tested effects significantly improved elevation judgment and trial-by-trial variability in spectral energy between 2 and 10\u2009kHz correlated strongly with perceived elevation. Digital audio effects may therefore be a promising strategy to improve elevation perception where personalized HRTFs are not available. Spectral manipulation improves elevation perception with non-individualized head-related transfer functions.
