"Image synthesis is a novel solution in precision medicine for scenarios where important medical imaging is not otherwise available. The convolutional neural network CNN is an ideal model for this task because of its powerful learning capabilities through the large number of layers and trainable parameters. In this research we propose a new architecture of residual inception encoder-decoder neural network RIED-Net to learn the nonlinear mapping between the input images and targeting output images. To evaluate the validity of the proposed approach it is compared with two models from the literature: synthetic CT deep convolutional neural network sCT-DCNN and shallow CNN using both an institutional mammogram dataset from Mayo Clinic Arizona and a public neuroimaging dataset from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Experimental results show that the proposed RIED-Net outperforms the two models on both datasets significantly in terms of structural similarity index mean absolute percent error and peak signal-to-noise ratio."
