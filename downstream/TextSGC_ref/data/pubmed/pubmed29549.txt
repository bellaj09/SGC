A brain-computer interface BCI system allows direct communication between the brain and the external world. Common spatial pattern CSP has been used effectively for feature extraction of data used in BCI systems. However many studies show that the performance of a BCI system using CSP largely depends on the filter parameters. The filter parameters that yield most discriminating information vary from subject to subject and manually tuning of the filter parameters is a difficult and time-consuming exercise. In this paper we propose a new automated filter tuning approach for motor imagery electroencephalography EEG signal classification which automatically and flexibly finds the filter parameters for optimal performance. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed method on two public benchmark datasets. Compared to the existing conventional CSP approach our method reduces the average classification error rate by 2.89% and 3.61% for BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV dataset I respectively. Moreover our proposed approach also achieved lowest average classification error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods studied in this paper. Thus our proposed method can be potentially used for developing improved BCI systems which can assist people with disabilities to recover their environmental control. It can also be used for enhanced disease recognition such as epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals. Graphical abstract .
