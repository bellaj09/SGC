Augmented reality AR is a versatile tool that is changing the way we interact with the world. One way is through exergaming integrating AR and gaming with traditional exercise programs. This study aimed to test three different AR systems to determine their ability to elicit physiological responses similar to those experienced while exercising or performing rehabilitation exercises. The systems tested included a head-mounted display experience Teapots a Sony EyeToy game Slap Stream and a prototype of a PC-camera-based system Drums. Physiological recordings show that Slap Stream and Drums produced significant increases p\u2009<\u20090.05 in heart rate HR and skin conductance and all three games produced nonsignificant increase in respiratory rate. Of the three games Slap Stream produced the highest rates of low- 28 percent moderate- 17 percent and high-intensity 22 percent HRs. This study successfully showed that inexpensive easy-to-use AR systems can effectively contribute to exercise programs. Future game design recommendations including feedback mixed reality and stress tracking are discussed.
