Dysarthria speakers suffer from poor communication and voice conversion VC technology is a potential approach for improving their speech quality. This study presents a joint feature learning approach to improve a sub-band deep neural network-based VC system termed J_SBDNN. In this study a listening test of speech intelligibility is used to confirm the benefits of the proposed J_SBDNN VC system with several well-known VC approaches being used for comparison. The results showed that the J_SBDNN VC system provided a higher speech intelligibility performance than other VC approaches in most test conditions. It implies that the J_SBDNN VC system could potentially be used as one of the electronic assistive technologies to improve the speech quality for a dysarthric speaker.
