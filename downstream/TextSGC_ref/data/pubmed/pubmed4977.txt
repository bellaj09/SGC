"To better understand how a nervous system controls the movements of an organism we have created a three-dimensional computational biomechanical model of the Caenorhabditis elegans body based on real anatomical structure. The body model is created with a particle system-based simulation engine known as Sibernetic which implements the smoothed particle-hydrodynamics algorithm. The model includes an elastic body-wall cuticle subject to hydrostatic pressure. This cuticle is then driven by body-wall muscle cells that contract and relax whose positions and shape are mapped from C. elegans anatomy and determined from light microscopy and electron micrograph data. We show that by using different muscle activation patterns this model is capable of producing C. elegans-like behaviours including crawling and swimming locomotion in environments with different viscosities while fitting multiple additional known biomechanical properties of the animal.\xa0This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution."
