Fourier single pixel imaging FSPI is well known for reconstructing high quality images but only at the cost of long imaging time. For real-time applications FSPI relies on under-sampled reconstructions failing to provide high quality images. In order to improve imaging quality of real-time FSPI a fast image reconstruction framework based on deep learning DL is proposed. More specifically a deep convolutional autoencoder network with symmetric skip connection architecture for real time 96  96 imaging at very low sampling rates 5-8% is employed. The network is trained on a large image set and is able to reconstruct diverse images unseen during training. The promising experimental results show that the proposed FSPI coupled with DL termed DL-FSPI outperforms conventional FSPI in terms of image quality at very low sampling rates.
