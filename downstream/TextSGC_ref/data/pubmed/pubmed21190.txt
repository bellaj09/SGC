"Brain Computer Interface BCI based environment control systems could facilitate life of people with neuromuscular diseases reduces dependence on their caregivers and improves their quality of life. As well as easy usage low-cost and robust system performance mobility is an important functionality expected from a practical BCI system in real life. In this study in order to enhance users mobility we propose internet based wireless communication between BCI system and home environment. We designed and implemented a prototype of an embedded low-cost low power easy to use web server which is employed in internet based wireless control of a BCI based home environment. The embedded web server provides remote access to the environmental control module through BCI and web interfaces. While the proposed system offers to BCI users enhanced mobility it also provides remote control of the home environment by caregivers as well as the individuals in initial stages of neuromuscular disease. The input of BCI system is P300 potentials. We used Region Based Paradigm RBP as stimulus interface. Performance of the BCI system is evaluated on data recorded from 8 non-disabled subjects. The experimental results indicate that the proposed web server enables internet based wireless control of electrical home appliances successfully through BCIs."
