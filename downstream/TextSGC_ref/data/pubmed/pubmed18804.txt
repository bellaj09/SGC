For the last 10 years a number of papers have been written that discuss human factors issues associated with virtual reality VR. The nature of these papers has gradually evolved from speculation and anecdotal report to empirical research. Despite developments in VR technology some participants still experience health and safety problems associated with VR use-termed VR-induced symptoms and effects VRISE. The key concern from the literature is VR-induced sickness experienced by a large proportion of VR participants but for the majority these effects are mild and subside quickly. This paper makes a number of recommendations regarding the future direction of research into health and safety implications of VR including the need to take into account the way in which VR is being used when conducting empirical research: first to ensure that studies consider both effects and their consequences second to ensure that empirical trials reflect the actual likely context of VR use; third to consider interactions between effects: and finally to consider ways in which effects can be managed. Health and safety implications of virtual reality: a review of empirical evidence.
