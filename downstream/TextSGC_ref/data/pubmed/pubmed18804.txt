To date human kinematics research has relied on video processing motion capture and magnetic search coil data acquisition techniques. However the use of head mounted display virtual reality systems as a novel research tool could facilitate novel studies into human movement and movement disorders. These systems have the unique ability of presenting immersive 3D stimulus while also allowing participants to make ecologically valid movement-based responses. Application of virtual reality head mounted display for investigation of movement: a novel effect of orientation of attention.
