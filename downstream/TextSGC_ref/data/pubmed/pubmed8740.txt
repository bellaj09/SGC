The aims of this study were first to evaluate a deep learning-based automatic glioblastoma GB tumor segmentation algorithm on clinical routine data from multiple centers and compare the results to a ground truth manual expert segmentation and second to evaluate the quality of the segmentation results across heterogeneous acquisition protocols of routinely acquired clinical magnetic resonance imaging MRI examinations from multiple centers. Clinical Evaluation of a Multiparametric Deep Learning Model for Glioblastoma Segmentation Using Heterogeneous Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data From Clinical Routine.
