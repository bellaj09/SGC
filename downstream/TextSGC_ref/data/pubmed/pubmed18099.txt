Neurorehabilitation therapies exploiting the use-dependent plasticity of our neuromuscular system are devised to help patients who suffer from injuries or diseases of this system. These therapies take advantage of the fact that the motor activity alters the properties of our neurons and muscles including the pattern of their connectivity and thus their functionality. Hence a sensor-motor treatment where patients makes certain movements will help them relearn how to move the affected body parts. But these traditional rehabilitation processes are usually repetitive and lengthy reducing motivation and adherence to the treatment and thus limiting the benefits for the patients.
