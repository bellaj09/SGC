The ability to identify predictors of aversive events allows organisms to appropriately respond to these events and failure to acquire these fear contingencies can lead to maladaptive contextual anxiety. Recently preclinical studies demonstrated that the corticotropin-releasing factor and serotonin systems are interactively involved in adaptive fear acquisition. Here 150 healthy medication-free human subjects completed a cue and context fear conditioning procedure in a virtual reality environment. Fear potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex FPS was measured to assess both uninstructed fear acquisition and instructed fear expression. All participants were genotyped for polymorphisms located within regulatory regions of the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 CRHR1 - rs878886 and the serotonin transporter 5HTTLPR. These polymorphisms have previously been linked to panic disorder and anxious symptomology and personality respectively. G-allele carriers of CRHR1 rs878886 showed no acquisition of fear conditioned responses FPS to the threat cue in the uninstructed phase whereas fear acquisition was present in C/C homozygotes. Moreover carrying the risk alleles of both rs878886 G-allele and 5HTTLPR short allele was associated with increased FPS to the threat context during this phase. After explicit instructions regarding the threat contingency were given the cue FPS and context FPS normalized in all genotype groups. The present results indicate that genetic variability in the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 especially in interaction with the 5HTTLPR is involved in the acquisition of fear in humans. This translates prior animal findings to the human realm. Human fear acquisition deficits in relation to genetic variants of the corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 and the serotonin transporter.
