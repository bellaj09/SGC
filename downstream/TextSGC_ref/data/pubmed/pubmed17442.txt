"The traditional navigation interface was intended only for two-dimensional observation by doctors; thus this interface does not display the total spatial information for the lesion area. Surgical navigation systems have become essential tools that enable for doctors to accurately and safely perform complex operations. The image navigation interface is separated from the operating area and the doctor needs to switch the field of vision between the screen and the patients lesion area. In this paper augmented reality AR technology was applied to spinal surgery to provide more intuitive information to surgeons. The accuracy of virtual and real registration was improved via research on AR technology. During the operation the doctor could observe the AR image and the true shape of the internal spine through the skin." Optimization of virtual and real registration technology based on augmented reality in a surgical navigation system.
