Advancements in microscopy and more recently in neuroendoscopy have revolutionized the field of neurosurgery. Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However these instruments have many limitations such as poor ergonomics constrained maneuverability and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments. A Virtual Repository of Neurosurgical Instrumentation for Neuroengineering Research and Collaboration.
