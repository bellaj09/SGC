Image reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging MRI clinical applications has become increasingly more complicated. However diagnostic and treatment require very fast computational procedure. Modern competitive platforms of graphics processing unit GPU have been used to make high-performance parallel computations available and attractive to common consumers for computing massively parallel reconstruction problems at commodity price. GPUs have also become more and more important for reconstruction computations especially when deep learning starts to be applied into MRI reconstruction. The motivation of this survey is to review the image reconstruction schemes of GPU computing for MRI applications and provide a summary reference for researchers in MRI community. A survey of GPU-based acceleration techniques in MRI reconstructions.
