We recently showed that a genetic polymorphism rs878886 in the human corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 CRHR1 is associated with reduced fear-conditioned responses to a threat cue. This is a potentially important finding considering that the failure to acquire fear contingencies can leave an individual in a maladaptive state of more generalized anxiety. Consistent with that idea the CRHR1-dependent fear acquisition deficit translated into heightened contextual anxiety when taking genetic variability within the serotonin transporter long polymorphic region 5-HTTLPR into account. To replicate our previous findings we conducted a replication study in 224 healthy medication-free human subjects using the exact same cue and context virtual reality fear-conditioning procedure as in study by Heitland et al. 2013. In the replication study consistent with the original findings CRHR1 rs878886 G-allele carriers showed reduced acquisition of cue-specific fear-conditioned responses compared with C/C homozygotes. Also in this larger sample the cue acquisition deficit of G-allele carriers translated into heightened contextual anxiety even independent of 5-HTT gene variation. In contrast to our earlier findings there was an additional interaction effect of CRHR1 rs878886 and the triallelic 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 variant on cued fear acquisition. In summary this study replicated the initially reported association of the CRHR1 rs878886 G-allele with cued fear acquisition deficits albeit with a different pattern of results regarding the interaction with 5-HTT variation. This further supports the notion that the human corticotropin-releasing hormone plays a role in the acquisition of fears. Human fear acquisition deficits in relation to genetic variants of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 and the serotonin transporter--revisited.
