Medical image processing provides core innovation for medical imaging. This paper is focused on recent developments from science to applications analyzing the past fifteen years of history of the proceedings of the German annual meeting on medical image processing BVM. Furthermore some members of the program committee present their personal points of views: i multi-modality for imaging and diagnosis ii analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging iii model-based image analysis iv registration of section images v from images to information in digital endoscopy and vi virtual reality and robotics. Medical imaging and medical image computing is seen as field of rapid development with clear trends to integrated applications in diagnostics treatment planning and treatment.
