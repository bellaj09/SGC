"This paper features a Spatial Augmented Reality system for rehabilitation of hand and arm movement. The table-top home-based system tracks a subjects hand and creates a virtual audio-visual interface for performing rehabilitation-related tasks that involve wrist elbow and shoulder movements. It measures range speed and smoothness of movements locally and can send the real-time photos and data to the clinic for further assessment. To evaluate the system it was tested on two normal subjects and proved functional." A Spatial Augmented Reality rehab system for post-stroke hand rehabilitation.
