Scene recognition is an important problem in the field of computer vision because it helps to narrow the gap between the computer and the human beings on scene understanding. Semantic modeling is a popular technique used to fill the semantic gap in scene recognition. However most of the semantic modeling approaches learn shallow one-layer representations for scene recognition while ignoring the structural information related between images often resulting in poor performance. Modeled after our own human visual system as it is intended to inherit humanlike judgment a manifold regularized deep architecture is proposed for scene recognition. The proposed deep architecture exploits the structural information of the data making for a mapping between visible layer and hidden layer. By the proposed approach a deep architecture could be designed to learn the high-level features for scene recognition in an unsupervised fashion. Experiments on standard data sets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art used for scene recognition. Scene recognition by manifold regularized deep learning architecture.
