In real-world situations speech reaching our ears is commonly corrupted by both room reverberation and background noise. These distortions are detrimental to speech intelligibility and quality and also pose a serious problem to many speech-related applications including automatic speech and speaker recognition. In order to deal with the combined effects of noise and reverberation we propose a two-stage strategy to enhance corrupted speech where denoising and dereverberation are conducted sequentially using deep neural networks. In addition we design a new objective function that incorporates clean phase during model training to better estimate spectral magnitudes which would in turn yield better phase estimates when combined with iterative phase reconstruction. The two-stage model is then jointly trained to optimize the proposed objective function. Systematic evaluations and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm improves objective metrics of speech intelligibility and quality substantially and significantly outperforms previous one-stage enhancement systems.
