"Intercepting a moving object while locomoting is a highly complex and demanding ability. Notwithstanding the identification of several informational candidates the role of perceptual variables in the control process underlying such skills remains an open question. In this study we used a virtual reality set-up for studying locomotor interception of a moving ball. The subject had to walk along a straight path and could freely modify forward velocity if necessary in order to intercept-with the head-a ball moving along a straight path that led it to cross the agents displacement axis. In a series of experiments we manipulated a local ball size and a global focus of expansion component of the visual flow but also the egocentric orientation of the ball. The experimental observations are well captured by a dynamic model linking the locomotor acceleration to properties of both global flow and egocentric direction. More precisely the changes in locomotor velocity depend on a linear combination of the change in bearing angle and the change in egocentric orientation allowing the emergence of adaptive behavior under a variety of circumstances. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying the control of different goal-directed locomotion tasks i.e. steering and interceptive tasks could share a common architecture."
