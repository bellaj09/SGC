"VREST Virtual Reality Educational Surgical Tools is developing a universal and autonomous simulation platform which can be used for training and assessment of medical students and for continuing education of physicians. A workstation consisting of two haptic devices and a 3D vision system is part of the VREST platform. Another part of the platform is a generic software environment in which lessons can be built by the teacher and performed by their students. Using the platform one can see feel and decide as in reality. With the assessment tool the progress and skills of the students can be supervised. The first lesson build on the VREST platform is an inguinal hernia repair according to Lichtenstein. This is an open surgery procedure. The VREST platform is used prior to the first operating room surgery of the resident. Interactive models and case dependent feedback is used to enlarge the residents cognition. This should reduce the training time in the operating room." Open surgery in VR: inguinal hernia repair according to Lichtenstein.
