The brain commonly exhibits spontaneous i.e. in the absence of a task fluctuations in neural activity that are correlated across brain regions. It has been established that the spatial structure or topography of these intrinsic correlations is in part determined by the fixed anatomical connectivity between regions. However it remains unclear which factors dynamically sculpt this topography as a function of brain state. Potential candidate factors are subcortical catecholaminergic neuromodulatory systems such as the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine system which send diffuse projections to most parts of the forebrain. Here we systematically characterized the effects of endogenous central neuromodulation on correlated fluctuations during rest in the human brain. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design we pharmacologically increased synaptic catecholamine levels by administering atomoxetine an NE transporter blocker and examined the effects on the strength and spatial structure of resting-state MRI functional connectivity. First atomoxetine reduced the strength of inter-regional correlations across three levels of spatial organization indicating that catecholamines reduce the strength of functional interactions during rest. Second this modulatory effect on intrinsic correlations exhibited a substantial degree of spatial specificity: the decrease in functional connectivity showed an anterior-posterior gradient in the cortex depended on the strength of baseline functional connectivity and was strongest for connections between regions belonging to distinct resting-state networks. Thus catecholamines reduce intrinsic correlations in a spatially heterogeneous fashion. We conclude that neuromodulation is an important factor shaping the topography of intrinsic functional connectivity.
