Brain-computer interfaces BCIs aim to help people with impaired movement ability by directly translating their movement intentions into command signals for assistive technologies. Despite large performance improvements over the last two decades BCI systems still make errors that need to be corrected manually by the user. This decreases system performance and is also frustrating for the user. The deleterious effects of errors could be mitigated if the system automatically detected when the user perceives that an error was made and automatically intervened with a corrective action; thus sparing users from having to make the correction themselves. Our previous preclinical work with monkeys demonstrated that task-outcome correlates exist in motor cortical spiking activity and can be utilized to improve BCI performance. Here we asked if these signals also exist in the human hand area of motor cortex and whether they can be decoded with high accuracy.
