"The objectives of the study were to describe robotic-assisted surgery training programs currently being used by ACGME-accredited obstetrics and gynecology OB/Gyn residency programs and to explore residents attitudes towards their robotic surgery training curricula to evaluate resident desire for robotics training. We conducted a cross-sectional study of OB/Gyn residents for the 2015-2016 academic year. Participants completed a 31-item online questionnaire regarding their robotic-assisted surgical training and associated perspectives. Analyses of these data were primarily descriptive. In total 98.9% of included respondents N\xa0=\xa0177 reported availability of a surgical robot at their training institution and 35.0% of participants reported not having any structured robotics training program at their institution. The most commonly used training modalities included online modules 62.2% dual-assist console 55.1% and virtual reality simulation 50.3%. The most commonly reported barriers to completing a robots training were a lack of personal time 56.2% and availability of the virtual reality simulator or access to the robotic equipment 29.2%. OB/Gyn residents desire robotics training and are exposed to a wide variety of training modalities. The ACGME should consider recommending the incorporation of a standardized formal robotics training program as part of the OB/Gyn residency curriculum." Time to consider integration of a formal robotic-assisted surgical training program into obstetrics/gynecology residency curricula.
