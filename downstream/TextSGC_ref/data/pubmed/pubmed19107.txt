The reported study employed a virtual reality VR system using a head mounted display HMD to investigate road crossing behavior in children and young adults. Younger children aged 5-9 years made the greatest number of unsafe road crossings and the oldest participants aged >19 years the fewest. Overall performance was better fewer unsafe road crossings in uniform speed than uniform distance trials consistent with previous research suggesting that pedestrians base road crossing decisions on inter-vehicle distance rather than vehicle speed. Results are discussed in terms of road crossing behavior and the use of VR simulations in the study of pedestrian behavior. An investigation of road crossing in a virtual environment.
