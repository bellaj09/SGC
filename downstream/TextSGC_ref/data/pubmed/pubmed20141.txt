"Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation significantly increases the chances of survival after a cardiac arrest. Virtual reality devices allow the integration of features of real patients into training to facilitate interaction and feedback thus improving performance. However its use as a training tool remains underexplored. The aims of this study were to undertake initial testing of a virtual reality basic life support prototype and to explore users views and experiences."
