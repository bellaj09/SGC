"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus iNPH and Alzheimers disease AD are geriatric diseases and common causes of dementia. Recently many studies on the segmentation disease detection or classification of MRI using deep learning have been conducted. The aim of this study was to differentiate iNPH and AD using a residual extraction approach in the deep learning method."
