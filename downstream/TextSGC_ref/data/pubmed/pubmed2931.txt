"This study aims to uncover brain areas that are functionally linked to complex cardiovascular oscillations in resting-state conditions. Multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and cardiovascular data were gathered from 34 healthy volunteers recruited within the human connectome project the 100-unrelated subjects release. Group-wise multi-level fMRI analyses in conjunction with complex instantaneous heartbeat correlates entropy and Lyapunov exponent revealed the existence of a specialized brain network i.e. a complex central autonomic network CCAN reflecting what we refer to as complex autonomic control of the heart. Our results reveal CCAN areas comprised the paracingulate and cingulate gyri temporal gyrus frontal orbital cortex planum temporale temporal fusiform superior and middle frontal gyri lateral occipital cortex angular gyrus precuneous cortex frontal pole intracalcarine and supracalcarine cortices parahippocampal gyrus and left hippocampus. The CCAN visible at rest does not include the insular cortex thalamus putamen amygdala and right caudate which are classical CAN regions peculiar to sympatho-vagal control. Our results also suggest that the CCAN is mainly involved in complex vagal control mechanisms with possible links with emotional processing networks."
