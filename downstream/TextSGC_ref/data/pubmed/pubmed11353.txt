The capillary nonperfusion area NPA is a key quantifiable biomarker in the evaluation of diabetic retinopathy DR using optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA. However signal reduction artifacts caused by vitreous floaters pupil vignetting or defocus present significant obstacles to accurate quantification. We have developed a convolutional neural network MEDnet-V2 to distinguish NPA from signal reduction artifacts in 66 mm2 OCTA. The network achieves strong specificity and sensitivity for NPA detection across a wide range of DR severity and scan quality. Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for distinguishing the nonperfusion area from signal reduction artifacts on OCT angiography.
