Recent advances in human neuroimaging research have revealed that white-matter connectivity can be described in terms of an integrated network which is the basis of the human connectome. However the developmental changes of this connectome in childhood are not well understood. This study made use of two independent longitudinal diffusion-weighted imaging data sets to characterize developmental changes in the connectome by estimating age-related changes in fractional anisotropy FA for reconstructed fibers edges between 68 cortical regions. The first sample included 237 diffusion-weighted scans of 146 typically developing children 4-13 years old 74 females derived from the Pediatric Longitudinal Imaging Neurocognition and Genetics PLING study. The second sample included 141 scans of 97 individuals 8-13 years old 62 females derived from the BrainTime project. In both data sets we compared edges that had the most substantial age-related change in FA to edges that showed little change in FA. This allowed us to investigate if developmental changes in white matter reorganize network topology. We observed substantial increases in edges connecting peripheral and a set of highly connected hub regions referred to as the rich club. Together with the observed topological differences between regions connecting to edges showing the smallest and largest changes in FA this indicates that changes in white matter affect network organization such that highly connected regions become even more strongly imbedded in the network. These findings suggest that an important process in brain development involves organizing patterns of inter-regional interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 39:157-170 2018.
