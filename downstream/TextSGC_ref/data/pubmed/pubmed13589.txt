DNA N6-methyladenine 6mA is an important epigenetic modification which is involved in many biology regulation processes. An accurate and reliable method for 6mA identification can help us gain a better insight into the regulatory mechanism of the modification. Although many experimental techniques have been proposed to identify 6mA sites genome-wide these techniques are time consuming and laborious. Recently several machine learning methods have been developed to identify 6mA sites genome-wide. However there is room for the improvement on their performance for predicting 6mA sites in rice genome. In this paper we developed a simple and lightweight deep learning model to identify DNA 6mA sites in rice genome. Our model needs no prior knowledge of 6mA or manually crafted sequence feature. We built our model based on two rice 6mA benchmark datasets. Our method got an average prediction accuracy of 93% and 92% on the two datasets we used. We compared our method with existing 6mA prediction tools. The comparison results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
