A structural or functional pattern of neuroplasticity that could systematically discriminate between people with impaired and preserved motor performance could help us to understand the brain networks contributing to preservation or compensation of behavior in multiple sclerosis MS. This study aimed to 1 investigate whether a machine learning-based technique could accurately classify MS participants into groups defined by upper extremity function i.e. motor function preserved MP vs. motor function impaired MI based on their regional grey matter measures GMM cortical thickness and deep grey matter volume and inter-regional functional connection FC 2 investigate which features GMM FC or GMM\xa0+\xa0FC could classify groups more accurately and 3 identify the multivariate patterns of GMM and FCs that are most discriminative between MP and MI participants and between each of these groups and the healthy controls HCs. With 26 MP 25 MI and 21 HCs age and sex matched underwent T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI at 3\xa0T we applied support vector machine SVM based classification to learn discriminant functions indicating regions in which GMM or between which FCs were most discriminative between groups. This study demonstrates that there exist structural and FC patterns sufficient for correct classification of upper limb motor ability of people with MS. The classifier with GMM\xa0+\xa0FC features yielded the highest accuracy of 85.61\xa0% p\xa0<\xa00.001 to distinguish between the MS groups using leave-one-out cross-validation. It suggests that a machine-learning approach combining structural and functional features is useful for identifying the specific neural substrates that are necessary and sufficient to preserve motor function among people with MS.
