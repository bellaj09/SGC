"In-line holographic microscopy provides an unparalleled wealth of information about the properties of colloidal dispersions. Analyzing one colloidal particles hologram with the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering yields the particles three-dimensional position with nanometer precision while simultaneously reporting its size and refractive index with part-per-thousand resolution. Analyzing a few thousand holograms in this way provides a comprehensive picture of the particles that make up a dispersion even for complex multicomponent systems. All of this valuable information comes at the cost of three computationally expensive steps: 1 identifying and localizing features of interest within recorded holograms 2 estimating each particles properties based on characteristics of the associated features and finally 3 optimizing those estimates through pixel-by-pixel fits to a generative model. Here we demonstrate an end-to-end implementation that is based entirely on machine-learning techniques. Characterizing and Tracking Colloids Holographically CATCH with deep convolutional neural networks is fast enough for real-time applications and otherwise outperforms conventional analytical algorithms particularly for heterogeneous and crowded samples. We demonstrate this systems capabilities with experiments on free-flowing and holographically trapped colloidal spheres."
