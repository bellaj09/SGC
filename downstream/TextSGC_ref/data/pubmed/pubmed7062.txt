The inner mitochondrial membrane IMM proteome plays a central role in maintaining mitochondrial physiology and cellular metabolism. Various important biochemical reactions such as oxidative phosphorylation metabolite production and mitochondrial biogenesis are conducted by the IMM proteome and mitochondria-targeted therapeutics have been developed for IMM proteins which is deeply related for various human metabolic diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However the membrane topology of the IMM proteome remains largely unclear because of the lack of methods to evaluate it in live cells in a high-throughput manner. In this article we reveal the in vivo topological direction of 135 IMM proteins using an in situ-generated radical probe with genetically targeted peroxidase APEX. Owing to the short lifetime of phenoxyl radicals generated in situ by submitochondrial targeted APEX and the impermeability of the IMM to small molecules the solvent-exposed tyrosine residues of both the matrix and intermembrane space IMS sides of IMM proteins were exclusively labeled with the radical probe in live cells by Matrix-APEX and IMS-APEX respectively and identified by mass spectrometry. From this analysis we confirmed 58 IMM protein topologies and we could determine the topological direction of 77 IMM proteins whose topology at the IMM has not been fully characterized. We also found several IMM proteins e.g. LETM1 and OXA1 whose topological information should be revised on the basis of our results. Overall our identification of structural information on the mitochondrial inner-membrane proteome can provide valuable insights for the architecture and connectome of the IMM proteome in live cells.
