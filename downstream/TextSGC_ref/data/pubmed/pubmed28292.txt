A number of tests exist to check for statistical significance of phase synchronisation within the Electroencephalogram EEG; however the majority suffer from a lack of generality and applicability. They may also fail to account for temporal dynamics in the phase synchronisation regarding synchronisation as a constant state instead of a dynamical process. Therefore a novel test is developed for identifying the statistical significance of phase synchronisation based upon a combination of work characterising temporal dynamics of multivariate time-series and Markov modelling. We show how this method is better able to assess the significance of phase synchronisation than a range of commonly used significance tests. We also show how the method may be applied to identify and classify significantly different phase synchronisation dynamics in both univariate and multivariate datasets.
