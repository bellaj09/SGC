The concept of postural synergies of the human hand has been shown to potentially reduce complexity in the neuromuscular control of grasping. By merging this concept with soft robotics approaches a multi degrees of freedom soft-synergy prosthetic hand SoftHand-Pro SHP was created. The mechanical innovation of the SHP enables adaptive and robust functional grasps with simple and intuitive myoelectric control from only two surface electromyogram sEMG channels. However the current myoelectric controller has very limited capability for fine control of grasp forces. We addressed this challenge by designing a hybrid-gain myoelectric controller that switches control gains based on the sensorimotor state of the SHP. This controller was tested against a conventional single-gain SG controller as well as against native hand in able-bodied subjects. We used the following tasks to evaluate the performance of grasp force control: 1 pick and place objects with different size weight and fragility levels using power or precision grasp and 2 squeezing objects with different stiffness. Sensory feedback of the grasp forces was provided to the user through a non-invasive mechanotactile haptic feedback device mounted on the upper arm. We demonstrated that the novel hybrid controller enabled superior task completion speed and fine force control over SG controller in object pick-and-place tasks. We also found that the performance of the hybrid controller qualitatively agrees with the performance of native human hands.
