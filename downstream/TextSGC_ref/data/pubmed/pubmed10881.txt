The recent advances of hardware technology have made the intelligent analysis equipped at the front-end with deep learning more prevailing and practical. To better enable the intelligent sensing at the front-end instead of compressing and transmitting visual signals or the ultimately utilized top-layer deep learning features we propose to compactly represent and convey the intermediate-layer deep learning features with high generalization capability to facilitate the collaborating approach between front and cloud ends. This strategy enables a good balance among the computational load transmission load and the generalization ability for cloud servers when deploying the deep neural networks for large scale cloud based visual analysis. Moreover the presented strategy also makes the standardization of deep feature coding more feasible and promising as a series of tasks can simultaneously benefit from the transmitted intermediate layer features. We also present the results for evaluations of both lossless and lossy deep feature compression which provide meaningful investigations and baselines for future research and standardization activities.
