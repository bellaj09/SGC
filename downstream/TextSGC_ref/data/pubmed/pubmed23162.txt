While there are many output brain-computer interface output BCIs studies few have examined the input pathway namely decoding the sensory input. To examine the possibility of building a BCI with sensory input using scalp electroencephalography EEG this study builds a classifier based on Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis LFDA and Gaussian Mixture Model GMM to classify neural activity generated by vibrotactile sensory stimuli delivered to the fingers. Small vibrators were placed on the fingertips of the participant. They vibrated one by one in a random sequence while the participant sat still with eyes closed. EEG data were recorded and later used to classify which finger was vibrated. There were two tasks: one focusing on differentiating between ipsilateral fingers the other one focusing on differentiating contralateral fingers. Decoding accuracies were high in both tasks: 97.6% and 99.3% respectively. Event-related EEG features in both amplitude and power domain are discussed.
