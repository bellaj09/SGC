Segmentation of magnetic resonance images MRI of the left ventricle LV plays a key role in quantifying the volumetric functions of the heart such as the area volume and ejection fraction. Traditionally LV segmentation is performed manually by experienced experts which is both time-consuming and prone to subjective bias. This study aims to develop a novel capsule-based automated segmentation method to automatically segment the LV from images obtained by cardiac MRI. Automatic left ventricle segmentation from cardiac magnetic resonance images using a capsule network.
