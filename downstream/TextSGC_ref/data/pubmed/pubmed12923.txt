Acute kidney injury AKI after liver transplantation has been reported to be associated with increased mortality. Recently machine learning approaches were reported to have better predictive ability than the classic statistical analysis. We compared the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict AKI after liver transplantation. We reviewed 1211 patients and preoperative and intraoperative anesthesia and surgery-related variables were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI defined by acute kidney injury network criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree random forest gradient boosting machine support vector machine nave Bayes multilayer perceptron and deep belief networks. These techniques were compared with logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve AUROC. AKI developed in 365 patients 30.1%. The performance in terms of AUROC was best in gradient boosting machine among all analyses to predict AKI of all stages 0.90 95% confidence interval CI 0.860.93 or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUROC of logistic regression analysis was 0.61 95% CI 0.560.66. Decision tree and random forest techniques showed moderate performance AUROC 0.86 and 0.85 respectively. The AUROC of support the vector machine nave Bayes neural network and deep belief network was smaller than that of the other models. In our comparison of seven machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis the gradient boosting machine showed the best performance with the highest AUROC. An internet-based risk estimator was developed based on our model of gradient boosting. However prospective studies are required to validate our results.
