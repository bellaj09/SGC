We have read with great care and interest the article by Li Y-C et al. The authors provide interesting elements with respect to the possible entry of SARS Cov-2 at the brain area and plead for an implication of the CNS in respiratory problems linked to COVID-19. Here we provide additional elements that support those observations notably the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata in modulating respiration. We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to cross the brain blood barrier and reach the brainstem. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
