"Research shows that students conceptions of what learning is influences both their approaches to learning and their learning outcomes. Lower level conceptions of learning are associated with surface approaches to learning encouraging poor quality learning outcomes. However more advanced conceptions are associated with deep learning approaches and high-quality learning outcomes. The Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes SOLO taxonomy was used to analyse the conceptions of learning of a new intake of physiotherapy students. The presence of a relationship between these and assessment outcomes was also investigated. As in other studies a majority of students had lower level conceptions of learning than desired in higher education. However a larger proportion of students had higher levels of conception than has been found in other research. A direct relationship between conceptions of learning and learning outcomes was also identified. The implications of these findings for achievement of high-quality learning are discussed."
