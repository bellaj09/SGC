In this paper we provide a new framework on deep learning based automated screening method for finding individuals at risk of developing Age-related Macular Degeneration AMD. We studied the appropriateness of using the transfer learning to screen AMD by using color fundus images. We make use of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study AREDS dataset with nearly 150000 images which also provided qualitative grading information by expert graders and ophthalmologists. We use ensemble learning technique with two deep neural networks namely Inception-ResNet-V2 and Xception with a custom fine-tuning approach. For our study we have identified two experiments that are most useful in the screening of AMD. First we have categorized the images into two classes based on the clinical significance: None or early AMD and Intermediate or Advanced AMD. Second we have categorized the images into four classes: No AMD early AMD Intermediate AMD and Advanced AMD. On AREDS dataset we have achieved an accuracy of over 95.3% for two-class experiment with our ensemble method. With accuracies ranging from 86% for four-class to 95.3% for two-class we have demonstrated that the training of a deep neural network with the transfer of learned features with a sufficient number of images fares very well and is comparable to human grading.
