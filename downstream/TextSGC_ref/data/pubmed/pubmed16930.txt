"In the discrete element simulation of granular materials the modelling of contacts is crucial for the prediction of the macroscopic material behaviour. From the tribological point of view friction at contacts needs to be modelled carefully as it depends on several factors e.g. contact normal load or temperature to name only two. In discrete element method DEM simulations the usage of Coulombs law of friction is state of the art in modelling particle-particle contacts. Usually in Coulombs law for all contacts only one constant coefficient of friction is used which needs to reflect all tribological effects. Thus whenever one of the influence factors of friction varies over a wide range it can be expected that the usage of only one constant coefficient of friction in Coulombs law is an oversimplification of reality. For certain materials e.g. steel it is known that a dependency of the coefficient of friction on the contact normal load exists. A more tribological tangential contact law is implemented in DEM where the interparticle friction coefficient depends on the averaged normal stress in the contact. Simulations of direct shear tests are conducted using steel spheres of different size distributions. The strong influence of interparticle friction on the bulk friction is shown via a variation of the constant interparticle friction coefficient. Simulations with constant and stress-dependent interparticle friction are compared. For the stress-dependent interparticle friction a normal stress dependency of the bulk friction is seen. In the literature measurements of different granular materials and small normal loads also show a stress dependency of the bulk friction coefficient. With increasing applied normal stress the bulk friction coefficient reduces both in the experiments and in the simulations."
