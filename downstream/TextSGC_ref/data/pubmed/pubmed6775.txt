Changes in BOLD signals are sensitive to the regional blood content associated with the vasculature which is known as V0 in hemodynamic models. In previous studies involving dynamic causal modeling DCM which embodies the hemodynamic model to invert the functional magnetic resonance imaging signals into neuronal activity V0 was arbitrarily set to a physiolog-ically plausible value to overcome the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. It is interesting to investigate how the V0 value influences DCM. In this study we addressed this issue by using both synthetic and real experiments. The results show that the ability of DCM analysis to reveal information about brain causality depends critically on the assumed V0 value used in the analysis procedure. The choice of V0 value not only directly affects the strength of system connections but more importantly also affects the inferences about the network architecture. Our analyses speak to a possible refinement of how the hemody-namic process is parameterized i.e. by making V0 a free parameter; however the conditional dependencies induced by a more complex model may create more problems than they solve. Obtaining more realistic V0 information in DCM can improve the identifiability of the system and would provide more reliable inferences about the properties of brain connectivity.
