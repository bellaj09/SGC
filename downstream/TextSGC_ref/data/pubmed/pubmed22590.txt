In this paper we propose an intelligent nursing bed system which is controlled by a hybrid brain-computer interface BCI involving steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP and P300. Specifically the hybrid BCI includes an asynchronous brain switch based on SSVEP and P300 and a P300-based BCI. The brain switch is used to turn on/off the control system of the electric nursing bed through idle/control state detection whereas the P300-based BCI is for operating the nursing bed. At the beginning the user may focus on one group of flashing buttons in the graphic user interface GUI of the brain switch which can simultaneously evoke SSVEP and P300 to switch on the control system. Here the combination of SSVEP and P300 is used for improving the performance of the brain switch. Next the user can control the nursing bed using the P300-based BCI. The GUI of the P300-based BCI includes 10 flashing buttons which correspond to 10 functional operations namely left-side up left-side down back up back down bedpan open bedpan close legs up legs down right-side up and right-side down. For instance he/she can focus on the flashing button "back up" in the GUI of the P300-based BCI to activate the corresponding control such that the nursing bed is adjusted up. Eight healthy subjects participated in our experiment and obtained an average accuracy of 93.75% and an average false positive rate FPR of 0.15 event/min. The effectiveness of our system was thus demonstrated. Control of a nursing bed based on a hybrid brain-computer interface.
