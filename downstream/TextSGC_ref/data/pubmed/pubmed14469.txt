"Based on evidence suggesting that deep brain stimulation DBS may promote certain cognitive processes we have been interested in developing DBS as a means of mitigating memory and learning impairments in Alzheimers disease AD. In this study we used an animal model of AD TgCRND8 mice to determine the effects of high-frequency stimulation HFS on non-amyloidogenic -secretase activity and DBS in short-term memory. We tested our hypothesis using hippocampal slices in vitro studies from TgCRND8 mice to evaluate whether HFS increases -secretase activity non-amyloidogenic pathway in the CA1 region. In a second set of experiments we performed in vivo studies to evaluate whether DBS in midline thalamic region re-establishes hippocampal dependent short-term memory in TgCRND8 mice. The results showed that application of HFS to isolated hippocampal slices significantly increased synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region and promoted a 2-fold increase of non-amyloidogenic -secretase activity in comparison to low frequency stimulated controls from TgCRND8 mice. In the in vivo studies DBS treatment facilitated acquisition of object recognition memory in TgCRND8 mice in comparison to their own baseline before treatment. These results provide evidence that DBS could enhance short-term memory in the CA1 region of hippocampus in a mouse model of AD."
