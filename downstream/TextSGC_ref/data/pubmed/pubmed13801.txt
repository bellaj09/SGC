For diagnosis of arrhythmic heart problems electrocardiogram ECG signals should be recorded and monitored. The long-term signal records obtained are analyzed by expert cardiologists. Devices such as the Holter monitor have limited hardware capabilities. For improved diagnostic capacity it would be helpful to detect arrhythmic signals automatically. In this study a novel approach is presented as a candidate solution for these issues. A new approach for arrhythmia classification using deep coded features and LSTM networks.
