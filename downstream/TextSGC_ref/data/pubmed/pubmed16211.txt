"Differential diagnosis between Parkinsons disease PD and atypical parkinsonism such as multiple system atrophy MSA can be difficult especially in the early stages of the disease. Deep learning using neural networks NNs makes possible the prediction of the diagnosis using various types of biomarkers unlike conventional linear statistics. We aimed to differentiate the Parkinsons variant of MSA MSA-P from PD both in the early stages by clinical utilization of NN analyses before the hot cross-bun and putaminal rim imaging features of MSA appeared. Analysis by NN involved the data of voxel-based morphometry VBM that indicate morphological changes and magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS that indicate qualitative changes. VBM analysis showed that compared with PD patients MSA-P patients showed atrophy in the superior cerebellar peduncle middle cerebellar peduncle cerebellar hemisphere pons midbrain and putamen but not in the globus pallidus. Proton MRS on the globus pallidus in the diseased hemisphere lacking atrophy as observed with VBM revealed decreased neurons and gliosis in both groups. Clinical differentiation of MSA-P from PD using NN analysis involved measuring the prediction potential using the area under the receiver operator characteristic ROC curves AUC. Using both VBM and MRS data NNs contributed adequately to the clinical diagnosis."
