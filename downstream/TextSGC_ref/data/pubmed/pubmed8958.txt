Temporal enhanced ultrasound TeUS comprising the analysis of variations in backscattered signals from a tissue over a sequence of ultrasound frames has been previously proposed as a new paradigm for tissue characterization. In this paper we propose to use deep recurrent neural networks RNN to explicitly model the temporal information in TeUS. By investigating several RNN models we demonstrate that long short-term memory LSTM networks achieve the highest accuracy in separating cancer from benign tissue in the prostate. We also present algorithms for in-depth analysis of LSTM networks. Our in vivo study includes data from 255 prostate biopsy cores of 157 patients. We achieve area under the curve sensitivity specificity and accuracy of 0.96 0.76 0.98 and 0.93 respectively. Our result suggests that temporal modeling of TeUS using RNN can significantly improve cancer detection accuracy over previously presented works.
