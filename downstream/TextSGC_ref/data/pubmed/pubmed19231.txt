A successful date collection visualization should satisfy a set of many requirements: unification of diverse data formats support for serendipity research support of hierarchical structures algorithmizability vast information density Internet-readiness and other. Recently virtual reality has made significant progress in engineering architectural design entertainment and communication. We experiment with the possibility of using the immersive abstract three-dimensional visualizations of the metabolic networks. We present the trial Metabolic Network Visualizer software which produces graphical representation of a metabolic network as a VRML world from a formal description written in a simple SGML-type scripting language.
