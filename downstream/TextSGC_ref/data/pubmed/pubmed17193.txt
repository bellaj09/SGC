This study examined the effect of virtual social facilitation and competitiveness on exercise effort in exergaming older adults. Fourteen exergaming older adults participated. Competitiveness was assessed prior to the start of exercise. Participants were trained to ride a "cybercycle;" a virtual reality-enhanced stationary bike with interactive competition. After establishing a cybercycling baseline competitive avatars were introduced. Pedaling effort watts was assessed. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant group high vs low competitiveness  time pre- to post-avatar interaction F112 = 13.1 P = 0.003. Virtual social facilitation increased exercise effort among more competitive exercisers. Exercise programs that match competitiveness may maximize exercise effort. Social facilitation in virtual reality-enhanced exercise: competitiveness moderates exercise effort of older adults.
