"Monitoring the activity of elderly individuals in nursing homes is key as it has been shown that physical activity leads to significant health improvement. In this work we introduce NurseNet a system that combines an unobtrusive affordable and robust piezoelectric floor sensor with a convolutional neural network algorithm which aims at measuring elderly physical activity. Our algorithm is trained using signal embedding based on atoms of a pre-learned dictionary and focuses the networks attention on step-related signals. We show that NurseNet is able to avoid the main limitation of floor sensors by recognizing relevant signals i.e. signals produced by patients and ignoring events related to the medical staff offering a new tool to monitor elderly activity in nursing homes efficiently."
