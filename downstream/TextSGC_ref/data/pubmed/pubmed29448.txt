A widely discussed paradigm for brain-computer interface BCI is the motor imagery task using noninvasive electroencephalography EEG modality. It often requires long training session for collecting a large amount of EEG data which makes user exhausted. One of the approaches to shorten this session is utilizing the instances from past users to train the learner for the novel user. In this work direct transferring from past users is investigated and applied to multiclass motor imagery BCI. Then active learning AL driven informative instance transfer learning has been attempted for multiclass BCI. Informative instance transfer shows better performance than direct instance transfer which reaches the benchmark using a reduced amount of training data 49% less in cases of 6 out of 9 subjects. However none of these methods has superior performance for all subjects in general. To get a generic transfer learning framework for BCI an optimal ensemble of informative and direct transfer methods is designed and applied. The optimized ensemble outperforms both direct and informative transfer method for all subjects except one in BCI competition IV multiclass motor imagery dataset. It achieves the benchmark performance for 8 out of 9 subjects using average 75% less training data. Thus the requirement of large training data for the new user is reduced to a significant amount.
