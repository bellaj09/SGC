Motion sickness MS is a common experience of travelers. To provide insights into brain dynamics associated with MS this study recruited 19 subjects to participate in an electroencephalogram EEG experiment in a virtual-reality driving environment. When riding on consecutive winding roads subjects experienced postural instability and sensory conflict between visual and vestibular stimuli. Meanwhile subjects rated their level of MS on a six-point scale. Independent component analysis ICA was used to separate the filtered EEG signals into maximally temporally independent components ICs. Then reduced logarithmic spectra of ICs of interest using principal component analysis were decomposed by ICA again to find spectrally fixed and temporally independent modulators IMs. Results demonstrated that a higher degree of MS accompanied increased activation of alpha r = 0.421 and gamma r =0.478 IMs across remote-independent brain processes covering motor parietal and occipital areas. This co-modulatory spectral change in alpha and gamma bands revealed the neurophysiological demand to regulate conflicts among multi-modal sensory systems during MS.
