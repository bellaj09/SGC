The aim of this study was to investigate the cervicocephalic kinaesthesia of healthy subjects for gender and age effects and its reliability in a new virtual reality test procedure. 57 healthy subjects 30 male 27 females; 18-64 years were immersed into a virtual 3D scene via a headmounted display which generated specific head movements. The joint repositioning error was determined in a static and dynamic test at the times T0 T1 T0+10 minutes and T2 T0+24 hours. The intrasession reliability T0-T1 and the intersession reliability T0-T2 were analysed. In both tests no gender- or age-specific effects were found. In the overall group the means of the static test were 6.2 degrees -6.9 degrees and of the dynamic test were 4.5 degrees -4.9 degrees . The intratest difference in the static test was -0.16 degrees and the intertest difference was 0.47 degrees . The intratest difference in the dynamic test was 0.42 degrees and the intertest difference was 0.37 degrees . The static and dynamic test was reproducible in healthy subjects with minor deviations irrespective of gender and age. The smaller interindividual differences in the dynamic test could be beneficial in the comparison of healthy individuals and individuals with cervical spine disorders. Reliability of a new virtual reality test to measure cervicocephalic kinaesthesia.
