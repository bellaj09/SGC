An electroencephalographic-based brain-computer interface BCI can provide a non-muscular method of communication. A general model for P300-based BCI stimulus presentations is introduced--the "m choose n" or Cm number of flashes per sequence n number of flashes per item paradigm which is a universal extension of the previously reported checkerboard paradigm CBP. Cmn captures all possible unconstrained ways to flash target items and then applies constraints to enhance ERP\s produced by attended matrix items. We explore a C365 instance of Cmn called the "five flash paradigm" FFP and compare its performance to the CBP. Eight subjects were tested in each paradigm counter-balanced. Twelve minutes of calibration data were used as input to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to derive classification coefficients used for online classification. Accuracy was consistently high for FFP 88% and CBP 90%; information transfer rate was significantly higher for the FFP 63 bpm than the CBP 48 bpm. The Cmn is a novel and effective general strategy for organizing stimulus groups. Appropriate choices for "m" "n" and specific constraints can improve presentation paradigms by adjusting the parameters in a subject specific manner. This may be especially important for people with neuromuscular disabilities. A general P300 brain-computer interface presentation paradigm based on performance guided constraints.
