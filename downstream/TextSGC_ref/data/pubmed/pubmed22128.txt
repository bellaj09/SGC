Our aim was to expand knowledge of cybersickness - a subtype of motion sickness provoked by immersion into a moving computer-generated virtual reality. Fourteen healthy subjects experienced a 15-min rollercoaster ride presented via a head-mounted display Oculus Rift for 3 consecutive days. Heart rate respiration finger and forehead skin conductance were measured during the experiment; this was complemented by a subjective nausea rating during the ride and by Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire before immediately after and then 1 2 and 3h post-ride. Physiological measurements were analysed in three dimensions: ride time association with subjective nausea rating and experimental day. Forehead and to a lesser extent finger phasic skin conductance activity showed a correlation with the reported nausea ratings while alteration in other measured parameters were mostly related to autonomic arousal during the virtual ride onset. A significant habituation was observed in subjective symptom scores and in the duration of tolerated provocation. The latter increased from 7.01.3min on the first day to 12.02.5min on the third day p<0.05; this was associated with a reduced slope of nausea rise from 1.30.3units/min on the first to 0.70.1units/min on the third day p<0.01. Furthermore habituation with repetitive exposure was also determined in the total symptom score post-ride: it fell from 1.60.1 on the first day to 1.20.1 on the third p<0.001. We conclude that phasic changes of skin conductance on the forehead could be used to objectively quantify nausea; and that repetitive exposure to provocative VR content results in habituation. Profiling subjective symptoms and autonomic changes associated with cybersickness.
