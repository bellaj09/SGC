Inflammation impairs cognitive performance and is implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Rodent studies demonstrated key roles for inflammatory mediators in many processes critical to memory including long-term potentiation synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. They also demonstrated functional impairment of medial temporal lobe MTL structures by systemic inflammation. However human data to support this position are limited. Peripheral inflammation acutely impairs human spatial memory via actions on medial temporal lobe glucose metabolism.
