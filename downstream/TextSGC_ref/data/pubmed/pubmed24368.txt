We experience our visual environment as a seamless immersive panorama. Yet each view is discrete and fleeting separated by expansive eye movements and discontinuous views of our spatial surroundings. How are discrete views of a panoramic environment knit together into a broad unified memory representation? Regions of the brain\s "scene network" are well poised to integrate retinal input and memory 1: they are visually driven 2 3 but also densely interconnected with memory structures in the medial temporal lobe 4. Further these regions harbor memory signals relevant for navigation 5-8 and adapt across overlapping shifts in scene viewpoint 9 10. However it is unknown whether regions of the scene network support visual memory for the panoramic environment outside of the current field of view and further how memory for the surrounding environment influences ongoing perception. Here we demonstrate that specific regions of the scene network-the retrosplenial complex RSC and occipital place area OPA-unite discrete views of a\xa0360 panoramic environment both current and out of sight in a common representational space. Further individual scene views prime associated representations of the panoramic environment in behavior facilitating subsequent perceptual judgments. We propose that this dynamic interplay between memory and perception plays an important role in weaving the fabric of continuous visual experience. Neural Representations Integrate the Current Field of View with the Remembered 360 Panorama in Scene-Selective Cortex.
