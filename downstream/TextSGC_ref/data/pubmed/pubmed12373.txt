The density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive TH-IR axons in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects may be reduced by as much as 50% in the deep cortical layers Am J Psychiatry 156:1580-1589 1999. Previously we demonstrated that approximately 60% loss of TH-IR axons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex mPFC decreases local basal and stress-evoked extracellular dopamine DA concentrations suggesting that moderate loss of DA axons in the mPFC is sufficient to alter the neurochemical activity of the remaining DA neurons Neuroscience 93:497-505 1999. Desipramine attenuates working memory impairments induced by partial loss of catecholamines in the rat medial prefrontal cortex.
