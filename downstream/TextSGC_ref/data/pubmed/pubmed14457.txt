Prolyl oligopeptidase POP has been connected to learning memory and mood. Changes in serum or plasma POP activity have been linked to psychiatric disorders. POP has been thought to interfere in these conditions by cleaving neuroactive peptides or via the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. However little is known about the possible POP inhibition of commonly used psychoactive drugs. In this study we measured the effects of various psychotropic drugs including antidepressants antipsychotics mood stabilisers and anxiolytics on the activity of the rat brain homogenate POP. Of the 38 compounds tested 18 inhibited POP by at least 20% at 10 M buspirone chlorpromazine citalopram clozapine desipramine duloxetine escitalopram flupenthixol imipramine ketanserin lamotrigine levomepromazine prazosin prochlorperazine promazine risperidone ritanserin and thioridazine. Thioridazine and valproate VPA acted at therapeutic plasma levels. Kinetically VPA was a competitive inhibitor thioridazine a non-competitive inhibitor and ketanserin a mixed type inhibitor. Being lipophilic many of the psychoactive compounds are present in the brain at several-times higher concentrations than in plasma. At concentrations reported to be reached in the brain chlorpromazine clozapine desipramine imipramine prochlorperazine and promazine inhibited POP by 30-50% suggesting that they could inhibit POP in vivo. However when studied ex vivo a single dose of 10 mg/kg thioridazine caused a deep sedation in the mice but did not inhibit the activity of POP. In conclusion compared with conventional POP inhibitors all psychopharmacological compounds tested are very weak inhibitors in vitro and we doubt that their POP inhibition would be therapeutically meaningful.
