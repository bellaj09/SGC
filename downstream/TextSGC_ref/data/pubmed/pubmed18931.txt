Sensor fusion techniques have made a significant contribution to the success of the recently emerging mobile applications era because a variety of mobile applications operate based on multi-sensing information from the surrounding environment such as navigation systems fitness trackers interactive virtual reality games etc. For these applications the accuracy of sensing information plays an important role to improve the user experience UX quality especially with gyroscopes and accelerometers. Therefore in this paper we proposed a novel mechanism to resolve the gyro drift problem which negatively affects the accuracy of orientation computations in the indirect Kalman filter based sensor fusion. Our mechanism focuses on addressing the issues of external feedback loops and non-gyro error elements contained in the state vectors of an indirect Kalman filter. Moreover the mechanism is implemented in the device-driver layer providing lower process latency and transparency capabilities for the upper applications. These advances are relevant to millions of legacy applications since utilizing our mechanism does not require the existing applications to be re-programmed. The experimental results show that the root mean square errors RMSE before and after applying our mechanism are significantly reduced from 6.3  10-1 to 5.3  10-7 respectively.
