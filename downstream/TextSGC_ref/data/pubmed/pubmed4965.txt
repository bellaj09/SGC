"Network science and graph theory applications have recently spread widely to help in understanding how human cognitive functions are linked to neuronal network structure thus providing a conceptual frame that can help in reducing the analytical brain complexity and underlining how network topology can be used to characterize and model vulnerability and resilience to brain disease and dysfunction. The present review focuses on few pivotal recent studies of our research team regarding graph theory application in functional dynamic connectivity investigated by electroencephalographic EEG analysis. The article is divided into two parts. The first describes the methodological approach to EEG functional connectivity data analysis. In the second part network studies of physiological aging and neurological disorders are explored with a particular focus on epilepsy and neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimers disease."
