Background: Traumatic brain injury TBI is a clinical condition characterized by damage due to a mechanical physical event which has a devastating impact on both the patient and his/her family. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of robotic neurorehabilitation using Lokomat with virtual reality VR on attention processes and executive functions in patients with TBI.Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. Fifty-six TBI patients have been included in the analysis using an electronic recovery data system. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups: the experimental group LPG underwent rehabilitation training with Lokomat Pro equipped with a VR screen whereas the control group LNG performed rehabilitation training using Lokomat Nanos without VR. The two groups matched for age sex education brain lesions interval from TBI. The rehabilitation protocol consisted of a total of 40 training sessions.Results: LPG and LNG had a significant improvement in mood and in the perception of physical well-being. However only the LPG had a significant improvement in global cognitive executive and attention functions. Furthermore LPG presented a significant enhancement of the quality of life with regard to the perception of the mental and physical state.Conclusion: Our study supports the idea that Lokomat is a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with TBI; in particular the integration of the VR device can implement the cognitive and behavioral functions of TBI patients enhancing also their physical and mental well-being.
