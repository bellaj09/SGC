We present a new technique to fully automate the segmentation of an organ from 3D ultrasound 3D-US volumes using the placenta as the target organ. Image analysis tools to estimate organ volume do exist but are too time consuming and operator dependant. Fully automating the segmentation process would potentially allow the use of placental volume to screen for increased risk of pregnancy complications. The placenta was segmented from 2393 first trimester 3D-US volumes using a semiautomated technique. This was quality controlled by three operators to produce the "ground-truth" data set. A fully convolutional neural network OxNNet was trained using this ground-truth data set to automatically segment the placenta. OxNNet delivered state-of-the-art automatic segmentation. The effect of training set size on the performance of OxNNet demonstrated the need for large data sets. The clinical utility of placental volume was tested by looking at predictions of small-for-gestational-age babies at term. The receiver-operating characteristics curves demonstrated almost identical results between OxNNet and the ground-truth. Our results demonstrated good similarity to the ground-truth and almost identical clinical results for the prediction of SGA.
