Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality training using Nintendo Wii on balance and walking for stroke patients. Subjects and Methods Forty stroke patients with stroke were randomly divided into two exercise program groups: virtual reality training n=20 and treadmill n=20. The subjects underwent their 40-minute exercise program three times a week for eight weeks. Their balance and walking were measured before and after the complete program. We measured the left/right weight-bearing and the anterior/posterior weight-bearing for balance as well as stance phase swing phase and cadence for walking. Results For balance both groups showed significant differences in the left/right and anterior/posterior weight-bearing with significant post-program differences between the groups. For walking there were significant differences in the stance phase swing phase and cadence of the virtual reality training group. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that virtual reality training providing visual feedback may enable stroke patients to directly adjust their incorrect weight center and shift visually. Virtual reality training may be appropriate for patients who need improved balance and walking ability by inducing their interest for them to perform planned exercises on a consistent basis.
