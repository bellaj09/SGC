Segmentation of colorectal tumors is the basis of preoperative prediction staging and therapeutic response evaluation. Due to the blurred boundary between lesions and normal colorectal tissue it is hard to realize accurate segmentation. Routinely manual or semi-manual segmentation methods are extremely tedious time-consuming and highly operator-dependent. In the framework of FCNs a segmentation method for colorectal tumor was presented. Normalization was applied to reduce the differences among images. Borrowing from transfer learning VGG-16 was employed to extract features from normalized images. We conducted five side-output blocks from the last convolutional layer of each block of VGG-16 along the network these side-output blocks can deep dive multiscale features and produced corresponding predictions. Finally all of the predictions from side-output blocks were fused to determine the final boundaries of the tumors. A quantitative comparison of 2772 colorectal tumor manual segmentation results from T2-weighted magnetic resonance images shows that the average Dice similarity coefficient positive predictive value specificity sensitivity Hammoude distance and Hausdorff distance were 83.56 82.67 96.75 87.85% 0.2694 and 8.20 respectively. The proposed method is superior to U-net in colorectal tumor segmentation P\u2009<\u20090.05. There is no difference between cross-entropy loss and Dice-based loss in colorectal tumor segmentation P\u2009>\u20090.05. The results indicate that the introduction of FCNs contributed to accurate segmentation of colorectal tumors. This method has the potential to replace the present time-consuming and nonreproducible manual segmentation method.
