Heterogeneity in intratumoral cancers leads to discrepancies in drug responsiveness due to diverse genomics profiles. Thus prediction of drug responsiveness is critical in precision medicine. So far in drug responsiveness prediction drugs\ molecular "fingerprints" along with mutation statuses have not been considered. Here we constructed a 1-dimensional convolution neural network model DeepIC50 to predict three drug responsiveness classes based on 27756 features including mutation statuses and various drug molecular fingerprints. As a result DeepIC50 showed better cell viability IC50 prediction accuracy in pan-cancer cell lines over two independent cancer cell line datasets. Gastric cancer GC is not only one of the lethal cancer types in East Asia but also a heterogeneous cancer type. Currently approved targeted therapies in GC are only trastuzumab and ramucirumab. Responsive GC patients for the drugs are limited and more drugs should be developed in GC. Due to the importance of GC we applied DeepIC50 to a real GC patient dataset. Drug responsiveness prediction in the patient dataset by DeepIC50 when compared to the other models were comparable to responsiveness observed in GC cell lines. DeepIC50 could possibly accurately predict drug responsiveness to new compounds in diverse cancer cell lines in the drug discovery process.
