The use of computer-based surgical simulators for training of prospective surgeons has been a topic of research for more than a decade. As a result a large number of academic projects have been carried out and a growing number of commercial products are available on the market. Keeping track of all these endeavors for established groups as well as for newly started projects can be quite arduous. Gathering information on existing methods already traveled research paths and problems encountered is a time consuming task. To alleviate this situation we have established a modifiable online repository of existing projects. It contains detailed information about a large number of simulator projects gathered from web pages papers and personal communication. The database is modifiable with password protected sections and also allows for a simple statistical analysis of the collected data. For further information the surgical repository web page can be found at www.virtualsurgery.vision.ee.ethz.ch. A web-based repository of surgical simulator projects.
