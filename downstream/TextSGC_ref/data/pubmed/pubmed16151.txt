"Richard F. Thompsons cerebellar model of classical eyeblink conditioning highlights Purkinje cells in cerebellar cortex and principal cells in the deep cerebellar nucleus as the integrating cells for acquisition of conditioned responses CRs. CR acquisition is significantly slower in rabbits with lesions to cerebellar cortex and in Purkinje cell-deficient mice that lose all cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells are the largest neurons in the cerebellum and contribute significantly to cerebellar volume. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI was used to assess cerebellar volume in humans. Cerebellar volume was related to eyeblink conditioning 400-ms delay procedure in 8 adults 21-35 years and compared to 8 older adults 77-95 years tested previously Woodruff-Pak Goldenberg Downey-Lamb Boyko & Lemieux 2000. In the young adult sample there was a high correlation between percentage of CRs in a session and cerebellar volume corrected for total intracranial volume TIV r =.58 p =.066. There were statistically significant age differences in cerebellar volume t14 = 8.96 p <.001 and percentage of CRs t14 = 3.85 p <.002 but no age difference in TIV. Combining the young and older adult sample the correlation between percentage of CRs and cerebellar volume corrected for TIV was.832 p <.001. Cerebellar volume showed age-related deficits likely due to Purkinje cell loss. Individual differences in classical eyeblink conditioning are associated with differences in cerebellar volume supporting Thompsons model of a cerebellar cortical role in facilitating this form of associative learning." MRI-assessed volume of cerebellum correlates with associative learning.
