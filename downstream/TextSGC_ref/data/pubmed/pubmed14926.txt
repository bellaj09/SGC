In this article a new deep reinforcement learning RL method called asynchronous advantage actor-critic A3C method is developed to solve the optimal control problem of elevator group control systems EGCSs. The main contribution of this article is that the optimal control law of EGCSs is designed via a new deep RL method such that the elevator system sends passengers to the desired destination floors as soon as possible. Deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks which can update themselves during applications are designed to dispatch elevators. Then the structure of the A3C method is developed and the training phase for the learning optimal law is discussed. Finally simulation results illustrate that the developed method effectively reduces the average waiting time in a complex building environment. Comparisons with traditional algorithms further verify the effectiveness of the developed method. Optimal Elevator Group Control via Deep Asynchronous Actor-Critic Learning.
