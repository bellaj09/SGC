"Six teenagers with Autistic Spectrum Disorders ASDs experienced a Virtual Environment VE of a caf. They also watched three sets of videos of real cafs and buses and judged where they would sit and explained why. Half of the participants received their VE experience between the first and second sets of videos and half experienced it between the second and third. Ten nave raters independently coded participants judgments and reasoning. In direct relation to the timing of VE use there were several instances of significant improvement in judgments and explanations about where to sit both in a video of a caf and a bus. The results demonstrate the potential of Virtual Reality for teaching social skills." Using virtual environments for teaching social understanding to 6 adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders.
