The motor cortex orchestrates simple to complex motor behaviors through its output projections to target areas. The primary MOp and secondary MOs motor cortices are known to produce specific output projections that are targeted to both similar and different target areas. These projections are further divided into layer 5 and 6 neuronal outputs thereby producing four cortical outputs that may target other areas in a combinatorial manner. However the precise network structure that integrates these four projections remains poorly understood. Here we constructed a whole-brain three-dimensional 3D map showing the tract pathways and targeting locations of these four motor cortical outputs in mice. Remarkably these motor cortical projections showed unique and separate tract pathways despite targeting similar areas. Within target areas various combinations of these four projections were defined based on specific 3D spatial patterns reflecting anterior-posterior dorsal-ventral and core-capsular relationships. This 3D topographic map ultimately provides evidence for the relevance of comparative connectomics: motor cortical projections known to be convergent are actually segregated in many target areas with unique targeting patterns a finding that has anatomical value for revealing functional subdomains that have not been classified by conventional methods.
