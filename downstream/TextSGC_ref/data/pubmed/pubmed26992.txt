Event-related potentials ERPs are the brain response directly related to specific events or stimuli. The P300 ERP is a positive deflection nominally 300ms post-stimulus that is related to mental decision making processes and also used in P300-based speller systems. Single-trial estimation of P300 responses will help to understand the underlying cognitive process more precisely and also to improve the speed of speller brain-computer interfaces BCIs. This paper aims to develop a single-trial estimation of the P300 amplitudes and latencies by using the least mean squares LMS adaptive filtering method. Results for real data from people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS have shown that the LMS filter can be effectively used to estimate P300 latencies.
