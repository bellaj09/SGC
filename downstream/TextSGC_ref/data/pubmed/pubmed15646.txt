In this study we show that landmark detection or face alignment task is not a single and independent problem. Instead its robustness can be greatly improved with auxiliary information. Specifically we jointly optimize landmark detection together with the recognition of heterogeneous but subtly correlated facial attributes such as gender expression and appearance attributes. This is non-trivial since different attribute inference tasks have different learning difficulties and convergence rates. To address this problem we formulate a novel tasks-constrained deep model which not only learns the inter-task correlation but also employs dynamic task coefficients to facilitate the optimization convergence when learning multiple complex tasks. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed task-constrained learning i outperforms existing face alignment methods especially in dealing with faces with severe occlusion and pose variation and ii reduces model complexity drastically compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on cascaded deep model.
