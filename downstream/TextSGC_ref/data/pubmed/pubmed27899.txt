The current development of brain-machine interface technology is limited among other factors by concerns about the long-term stability of single- and multi-unit neural signals. In addition the understanding of the relation between potentially more stable neural signals such as local field potentials and motor behavior is still in its early stages. High accuracy decoding of movement target direction in non-human primates based on common spatial patterns of local field potentials.
