"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are expected to be used to assist seriously disabled persons communications and reintegrate their motor functions. One of the difficult problems to realize practical BMI is how to record neural activity clearly and safely. Conventional invasive methods require electrodes inside the dura mater and noninvasive methods do not involve surgery but have poor signal quality. Thus a low-invasive method of recording is important for safe and practical BMI. In this study the authors used epidural electrodes placed between the skull and dura mater to record a rats neural activity for low-invasive BMI. The signals were analyzed using a short-time Fourier transform and the power spectra were classified into rat motions by a support vector machine. Classification accuracies were up to 96% in two-class discrimination including that when the rat stopped walked and rested. The feasibility of a low-invasive BMI based on an epidural neural recording was shown in this study." Motion classification using epidural electrodes for low-invasive brain-machine interface.
