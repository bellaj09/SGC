"Connectomics has proved promising in quantifying and understanding the effects of development aging and an array of diseases on the brain. In this work we propose a new structural connectivity measure from diffusion MRI that allows us to incorporate direct brain connections as well as indirect ones that would not be otherwise accounted for by standard techniques and that may be key for the better understanding of function from structure. From our experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset we find that our measure of structural connectivity better correlates with functional connectivity than streamline tractography does meaning that it provides new structural information related to function. Through additional experiments on the ADNI-2 dataset we demonstrate the ability of this new measure to better discriminate different stages of Alzheimers disease. Our findings suggest that this measure is useful in the study of the normal brain structure and for quantifying the effects of disease on the brain structure."
