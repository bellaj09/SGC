"Ongoing curricular renewal is a necessary phenomenon in nursing education to align learning with ever-changing professional practice demands. The McMaster Mohawk Conestoga BScN Program in Hamilton Ontario Canada recently engaged in a comprehensive curriculum renewal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of curricular changes on students deep learning. Faculty perceptions about student learning outcomes during final year clinical placements were gathered through a combination of individual interviews and focus groups using Interpretive Descriptive qualitative research methodology. Twenty five faculty members who supervised BScN students in clinical placements before and after curriculum renewal shared perceptions of changes in students overall performance. The chosen clinical learning outcomes were: changes in students performance related to person-centred care clinical reasoning and judgment pathophysiology and evidence-informed decision-making. Faculty described three major themes in students performance 1 pulling it all together 2 seeing the whole person and 3 finding their nursing voices. This reflected a shift to person-centred care increasing professional confidence and improved clinical reasoning and judgment and no changes to integrating pathophysiology or evidence-informed decision-making. In this study curriculum renewal provided an excellent starting point for the scholarship of teaching and learning within nursing education."
