"Sleep plays an important role in stabilizing new memory traces after learning 1-3. Here we investigate whether sleeps role in memory processing is similar in evolutionarily distant species and demonstrate that a context trigger during deep-sleep phases improves memory in invertebrates as it does in humans. We show that in honeybees Apis mellifera exposure to an odor during deep sleep that has been present during learning improves memory performance the following day. Presentation of the context odor during wake phases or novel odors during sleep does not enhance memory. In humans memory consolidation can be triggered by presentation of a context odor during slow-wave sleep that had been present during learning 3-5. Our results reveal that deep-sleep phases in honeybees have the potential to prompt memory consolidation just\xa0as they do in humans. This study provides strong evidence for a conserved role of sleep-and how it\xa0affects memory processes-from insects to mammals." Context odor presentation during sleep enhances memory in honeybees.
