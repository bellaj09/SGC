Human bodies exhibit various shapes for different identities or poses but the body shape has certain similarities in structure and thus can be embedded in a low-dimensional space. This paper presents an autoencoder-like network architecture to learn disentangled shape and pose embedding specifically for the 3D human body. This is inspired by recent progress of deformation-based latent representation learning. To improve the reconstruction accuracy we propose a hierarchical reconstruction pipeline for the disentangling process and construct a large dataset of human body models with consistent connectivity for the learning of the neural network. Our learned embedding can not only achieve superior reconstruction accuracy but also provide great flexibility in 3D human body generation via interpolation bilinear interpolation and latent space sampling. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate the powerfulness of our learned 3D human body embedding in various applications.
