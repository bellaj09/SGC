"The N2pc is a lateralised Event-Related Potential ERP that signals a shift of attention towards the location of a potential object of interest. We propose a single-trial target-localisation collaborative Brain-Computer Interface cBCI that exploits this ERP to automatically approximate the horizontal position of targets in aerial images. Images were presented by means of the rapid serial visual presentation technique at rates of 5 6 and 10 Hz. We created three different cBCIs and tested a participant selection method in which groups are formed according to the similarity of participants performance. The N2pc that is elicited in our experiments contains information about the position of the target along the horizontal axis. Moreover combining information from multiple participants provides absolute median improvements in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of up to 21% for groups of size 3 with respect to single-user BCIs. These improvements are bigger when groups are formed by participants with similar individual performance and much of this effect can be explained using simple theoretical models. Our results suggest that BCIs for automated triaging can be improved by integrating two classification systems: one devoted to target detection and another to detect the attentional shifts associated with lateral targets."
