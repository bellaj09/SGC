The University of Virginia School of Medicine recently transformed its pre-clerkship medical education programme to emphasise student engagement and active learning in the classroom. As in other medical schools many students are opting out of attending class and others are inattentive while in class. We sought to understand why especially with a new student-centred curriculum so many students were still opting to learn on their own outside of class or to disengage from educational activities while in class. "Why are medical students checking out of active learning in a new curriculum?"
