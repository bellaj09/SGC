To date invasive brain-computer interface BCI research has largely focused on replacing lost limb functions using signals from the hand/arm areas of motor cortex. However the oculomotor system may be better suited to BCI applications involving rapid serial selection from spatial targets such as choosing from a set of possible words displayed on a computer screen in an augmentative and alternative communication AAC application. Here we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a BCI utilizing the oculomotor system. Decoding of intended saccade direction in an oculomotor brain-computer interface.
