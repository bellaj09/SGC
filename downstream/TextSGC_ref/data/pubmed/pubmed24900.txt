In this paper we propose an intelligent wheelchair system that relies on a brain computer interface BCI and automatic navigation. When in operation candidate destinations and waypoints are automatically generated on the basis of the current environment. Then the user selects a destination using a P300-based BCI. Finally the navigation system plans a path and navigates the wheelchair to the determined destination. While the wheelchair is in motion the user can issue a stop command with the BCI. Using our system the mental burden of the user can be alleviated to a large degree. Furthermore our system can adapt to changes in the environment. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our system. An intelligent wheelchair based on automated navigation and BCI techniques.
