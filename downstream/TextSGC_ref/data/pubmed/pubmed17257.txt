Background and purpose - Simulation is an adjunct to surgical education. However nothing can accurately simulate fluoroscopic procedures in orthopedic trauma. Current options for training with fluoroscopy are either intraoperative which risks radiation or use of expensive and unrealistic virtual reality simulators. We introduce FluoroSim an inexpensive digital fluoroscopy simulator without the need for radiation. Patients and methods - This was a multicenter study with 26 surgeons in which everyone completed 1 attempt at inserting a guide-wire into a femoral dry bone using surgical equipment and FluoroSim. 5 objective performance metrics were recorded in real-time to assess construct validity. The surgeons were categorized based on the number of dynamic hip screws DHS performed: novices < 10 intermediates 10-39 and experts  40. A 7-point Likert scale questionnaire assessed the face and content validity of FluoroSim. Results - Construct validity was present for 2 clinically validated metrics in DHS surgery. Experts and intermediates statistically significantly outperformed novices for tip-apex distance and for cut-out rate. Novices took the least number of radiographs. Face and content validity were also observed. Interpretation - FluoroSim discriminated between novice and intermediate or expert surgeons based on tip-apex distance and cut-out rate while demonstrating face and content validity. FluoroSim provides a useful adjunct to orthopedic training. Our findings concur with results from studies using other simulation modalities. FluoroSim can be implemented for education easily and cheaply away from theater in a safe and controlled environment. Teaching basic trauma: validating FluoroSim a digital fluoroscopic simulator for guide-wire insertion in hip surgery.
