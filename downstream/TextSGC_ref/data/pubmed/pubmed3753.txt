The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between fluid intelligence gF and the pattern of the functional characteristics in the resting state in adults using multivariate pattern analysis. Resting-state functional images from 100 participants in the Human Connectome Project data set were analyzed. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation ALFF was first calculated and a support vector regression approach was used to identify the association with gF. To discover whether the connectivity of the gF-associated areas was also related to gF we further checked the seed-based functional connectivity using the seeds from the ALFF. The ALFF showed that gF was correlated with the left anterior cingulate cortex which is involved in high cognitive control processes. The functional connectivity showed that the connection between the right prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 8 and the left anterior cingulate cortex could predict gF. The multivariate pattern analysis result indicated that the brain functional activity and functional integrity that we identified have the potential to become an objective biomarker for evaluating individual differences in gF. Fluid intelligence relates to the resting state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and functional connectivity: a multivariate pattern analysis.
