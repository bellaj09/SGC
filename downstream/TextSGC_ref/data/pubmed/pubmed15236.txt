Due to the recent advances in deep learning this model attracted researchers who have applied it to medical image analysis. However pathological image analysis based on deep learning networks faces a number of challenges such as the high resolution gigapixel of pathological images and the lack of annotation capabilities. To address these challenges we propose a training strategy called deep-reverse active learning DRAL and atrous DenseNet ADN for pathological image classification. The proposed DRAL can improve the classification accuracy of widely used deep learning networks such as VGG-16 and ResNet by removing mislabeled patches in the training set. As the size of a cancer area varies widely in pathological images the proposed ADN integrates the atrous convolutions with the dense block for multiscale feature extraction. Reverse active learning based atrous DenseNet for pathological image classification.
