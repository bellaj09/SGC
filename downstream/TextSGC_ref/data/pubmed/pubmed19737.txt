We present a system to assist in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias by catheter ablation. A patient-specific three-dimensional 3-D anatomical model constructed from magnetic resonance images is merged with fluoroscopic images in an augmented reality environment that enables the transfer of electrocardiography ECG measurements and cardiac activation times onto the model. Accurate mapping is realized through the combination of: a new calibration technique adapted to catheter guided treatments; a visual matching registration technique allowing the electrophysiologist to align the model with contrast-enhanced images; and the use of virtual catheters which enable the annotation of multiple ECG measurements on the model. These annotations can be visualized by color coding on the patient model. We provide an accuracy analysis of each of these components independently. Based on simulation and experiments we determined a segmentation error of 0.6 mm a calibration error in the order of 1 mm and a target registration error of 1.04 +/- 0.45 mm. The system provides a 3-D visualization of the cardiac activation pattern which may facilitate and improve diagnosis and treatment of the arrhytmia. Because of its low cost and similar advantages we believe our approach can compete with existing commercial solutions which rely on dedicated hardware and costly catheters. We provide qualitative results of the first clinical use of the system in 11 ablation procedures. An augmented reality system for patient-specific guidance of cardiac catheter ablation procedures.
