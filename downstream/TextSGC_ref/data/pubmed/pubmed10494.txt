Comprehensive molecular profiling of various cancers and other diseases has generated vast amounts of multi-omics data. Each type of -omics data corresponds to one feature space such as gene expression miRNA expression DNA methylation etc. Integrating multi-omics data can link different layers of molecular feature spaces and is crucial to elucidate molecular pathways underlying various diseases. Machine learning approaches to mining multi-omics data hold great promises in uncovering intricate relationships among molecular features. However due to the "big p small n" problem i.e. small sample sizes with high-dimensional features training a large-scale generalizable deep learning model with multi-omics data alone is very challenging. Integrate multi-omics data with biological interaction networks using Multi-view Factorization AutoEncoder MAE.
