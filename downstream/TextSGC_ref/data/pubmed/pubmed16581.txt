The drive for a more community-focused approach to pre-registration nursing education as identified in Modernising Nursing Careers Department of Health 2006a has continued to gather momentum. The research literature identifies that the community context impacts significantly on care delivery with student nurses often missing the underlying complexities of working in this context; focusing on the task in hand rather than the broader landscape of care Carr 2004. In 2008 a community focused pre-registration adult nursing degree pathway was started at Canterbury Christ Church University CCCU to prepare a cohort of 16 nursing students to work in the community and general practice setting at the point of registration. Placement learning has been focused within general practice and community through a hub and spoke approach to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the complexities of care in this setting with particular reference to the management of risk and unpredictability. The pilot is being formally evaluated with a particular emphasis on the meaning and relevance of practice learning within these settings. The emerging data will not only provide evidence to promote the community and general practice agenda within pre-registration curricula but help to clarify the essential skills and knowledge required to prepare students nurses for working in these settings.
