Existing literature regarding social communication outcomes of interventions in autism spectrum disorder ASD depends upon human raters with limited generalizability to real world settings. Technological innovation particularly virtual reality VR and collaborative virtual environments CVE could offer a replicable low cost measurement platform when endowed with intelligent agent technology and peer-based interactions. We developed and piloted a novel collaborative virtual environment and intelligent agent CRETA for the assessment of social communication and collaboration within system and peer interactions. The system classified user statements with moderate to high accuracies. We found moderate to high agreement in displayed communication and collaboration skills between human-human and human-agent interactions. CRETA offers a promising avenue for future development of autonomous measurement systems for ASD research.
