Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks SNNs to artificial intelligence AI tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking counterparts most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper we introduce SpykeTorch an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules both spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP and reward-modulated STDP R-STDP are implemented but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the aforementioned properties SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions which in turn brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs GPUs or Multi-GPU platforms.
