Registration and fusion of magnetic resonance imaging MRI and transrectal ultrasound TRUS of prostate can provide guidance for prostate brachytherapy. However accurate registration remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground-truth regarding voxel-level spatial correspondence limited field of view low contrast-to-noise ratio in TRUS. In this study we proposed a weakly supervised deep learning approach to address these issues. Label-driven MRI-US registration using weakly-supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.
