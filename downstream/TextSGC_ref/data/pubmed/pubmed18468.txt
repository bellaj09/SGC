"A substantial body of research has examined the speed-accuracy tradeoff captured by Fitts law demonstrating increases in movement time that occur as aiming tasks are made more difficult by decreasing target width and/or increasing the distance between targets. Yet serial aiming movements guided by internal spatial representations rather than by visual views of targets have not been examined in this manner and the value of confirmatory feedback via different sensory modalities within this paradigm is unknown. Here we examined goal-directed serial aiming movements tapping back and forth between two targets wherein targets were visually unavailable during the task. However confirmatory feedback auditory haptic visual and bimodal combinations of each was delivered upon each target acquisition in a counterbalanced within-subjects design. Each participant performed the aiming task with their pointer finger represented within an immersive virtual environment as a 1\u202fcm white sphere while wearing a head-mounted display. Despite visual target occlusion movement times increased in accordance with Fitts law. Though Fitts law captured performance for each of the sensory feedback conditions the slopes differed. The effect of increasing difficulty on movement times was least influential in the haptic condition suggesting more efficient processing of confirmatory haptic feedback during aiming movements guided by internal spatial representations."
