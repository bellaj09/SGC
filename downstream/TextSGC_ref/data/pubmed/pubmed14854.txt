With an increase in the number of traffic accidents and enhanced attention to the rule of law technical appraisement to reconstruct traffic accidents is attracting increasing attention. Accident videos are important aspects in identification; however we cannot reconstruct an accident scene onsite using video for many reasons. In this paper we introduce a computer-based virtual reality method that can digitally reconstruct a traffic accident. This method employs accident videos to perform a three-dimensional 3D reconstruction of accident scenes. Using video screenshots it constructs a model of humans and vehicles in 3D space to achieve the goal of dynamic restoration. The results indicate that this method has relatively high accuracy requires little time and is easy to use. In this paper we analyse the sources of errors for this method and summarize the application conditions. A virtual reality method for digitally reconstructing traffic accidents from videos or still images.
