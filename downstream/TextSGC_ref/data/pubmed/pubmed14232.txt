Introduction: Detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules is an important issue because the process is the first step in the management of lung cancers.Areas covered: Literature review was performed on May 15 2019 by using the PubMed US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health and the National Center for Biotechnology information. CT features helping identify the druggable mutations and predict the prognosis of malignant nodules were presented. Technical advancements in MRI and PET/CT were introduced for providing functional information about malignant nodules. Advances in various tissue biopsy techniques enabling molecular analysis and histologic diagnosis of indeterminate nodules were also presented. New techniques such as radiomics deep learning DL technology and artificial intelligence showing promise in differentiating between malignant and benign nodules were summarized. Recently updated management guidelines for solid and subsolid nodules incidentally detected on CT were described. Risk stratification and prediction models for indeterminate nodules under active investigation were briefly summarized.Expert opinion: Advancement in CT knowledge has led to a better correlation between CT features and genomic alterations or tumor histology. Recent advances like PET/CT MRI radiomics and DL-based approach have shown promising results in the characterization and prognostication of pulmonary nodules. Management of incidental pulmonary nodules: current strategies and future perspectives.
