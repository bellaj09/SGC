Genetic G and environmental E factors are involved in the etiology and course of the major psychoses MP i.e. major depressive disorder MDD bipolar disorder BD schizoaffective disorder SZA and schizophrenia SZ. The neurobiological correlates by which these predispositions exert their influence on brain structure function and course of illness are poorly understood. In the FOR2107 consortium animal models and humans are investigated. A human cohort of MP patients healthy subjects at genetic and/or environmental risk and control subjects N\u2009=\u20092500 has been established. Participants are followed up after 2\xa0years and twice underwent extensive deep phenotyping MR imaging clinical course neuropsychology personality risk/protective factors biomaterials: blood stool urine hair saliva. Methods for data reduction quality assurance for longitudinal MRI data and deep machine learning techniques are employed. In the parallelised animal cluster genetic risk was introduced by a rodent model Cacna1c deficiency and its interactions with environmental risk and protective factors are studied. The animals are deeply phenotyped regarding cognition emotion and social function paralleling the variables assessed in humans. A set of innovative experimental projects connect and integrate data from the human and animal parts investigating the role of microRNA neuroplasticity immune signatures epi-genetics and gene expression. Biomaterial from humans and animals are analyzed in parallel. The FOR2107 consortium will delineate pathophysiological entities with common neurobiological underpinnings "biotypes" and pave the way for an etiologic understanding of the MP potentially leading to their prevention the prediction of individual disease courses and novel therapies in the future.
