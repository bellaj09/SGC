"This work addresses the development of a low-cost hybrid interface with eye tracking and brain signals. Eye movement detection is used for search task and EEG-based brain computer interface BCI for selection task. Multi-directional target selection experiments with the hybrid interface device were conducted with five subjects to evaluate the proposed hybrid interface scheme. The task asked each user to move a cursor onto a circular target among twelve possible positions and select it. Using the Fitts law the interface performance was compared with the computer mouse. With two BCI selection confirmation schemes the hybrid interface attained 2-2.7 bit/s overall. Based on the results the potential of the proposed hybrid interface was discussed."
