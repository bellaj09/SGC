Motor imagery MI tasks classification provides an important basis for designing brain-computer interface BCI systems. If the MI tasks are reliably distinguished through identifying typical patterns in electroencephalography EEG data a motor disabled people could communicate with a device by composing sequences of these mental states. In our earlier study we developed a cross-correlation based logistic regression CC-LR algorithm for the classification of MI tasks for BCI applications but its performance was not satisfactory. This study develops a modified version of the CC-LR algorithm exploring a suitable feature set that can improve the performance. The modified CC-LR algorithm uses the C3 electrode channel in the international 10-20 system as a reference channel for the cross-correlation CC technique and applies three diverse feature sets separately as the input to the logistic regression LR classifier. The present algorithm investigates which feature set is the best to characterize the distribution of MI tasks based EEG data. This study also provides an insight into how to select a reference channel for the CC technique with EEG signals considering the anatomical structure of the human brain. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight of the most recently reported well-known methods including the BCI III Winner algorithm. The findings of this study indicate that the modified CC-LR algorithm has potential to improve the identification performance of MI tasks in BCI systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique provides a classification improvement over the existing methods tested.
