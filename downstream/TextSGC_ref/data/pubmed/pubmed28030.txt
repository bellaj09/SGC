Whether an event-related potential ERP N170 related to facial recognition was modulated by emotion has always been a controversial issue. Some researchers considered the N170 to be independent of emotion whereas a recent study has shown the opposite view. In the current study electroencephalogram EEG recordings while responding to facial pictures with emotion were utilized to investigate whether the N170 was modulated by emotion. We found that there was a significant difference between ERP trials with positive and negative emotions of around 170 ms at the occipitotemporal electrodes i.e. N170. Then we further proposed the application of the single-trial N170 as a feature for the classification of facial emotion which could avoid the fact that ERPs were obtained by averaging most of the time while ignoring the trial-to-trial variation. In order to find an optimal classifier for emotional classification with single-trial N170 as a feature three types of classifiers namely linear discriminant analysis LDA L1-regularized logistic regression L1LR and support vector machine with radial basis function RBF-SVM were comparatively investigated. The results showed that the single-trial N170 could be used as a classification feature to successfully distinguish positive emotion from negative emotion. L1-regularized logistic regression classifiers showed a good generalization whereas LDA showed a relatively poor generalization. Moreover when compared with L1LR the RBF-SVM required more time to optimize the parameters during the classification which became an obstacle while applying it to the online operating system of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. The findings suggested that face-related N170 could be affected by facial expression and that the single-trial N170 could be a biomarker used to monitor the emotional states of subjects for the BCI domain.
