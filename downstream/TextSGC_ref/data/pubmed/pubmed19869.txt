"It is crucial to examine patient reactions to genomics-informed approaches to weight management within a clinical context and understand the influence of patient characteristics here emotion and race. Examining nonverbal reactions offers a window into patients implicit cognitive attitudinal and affective processes related to clinical encounters. We simulated a weight management clinical interaction with a virtual reality-based physician and experimentally manipulated patient emotional state anger/fear and whether the physician made genomic or personal behavior attributions for weight. Participants were 190 overweight females who racially identified as either Black or White. Participants made less visual contact when receiving genomic information in the anger condition and Black participants exhibited lowered voice pitch when receiving genomic information. Black participants also increased their interpersonal distance when receiving genomic information in the anger condition. By studying non-conscious nonverbal behavior we can better understand the nuances of these interactions. Trial registry clinicaltrials.gov NCT01888913." Nonverbal and paraverbal behavior in simulated medical visits related to genomics and weight: a role for emotion and race.
