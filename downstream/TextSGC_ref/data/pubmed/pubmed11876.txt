Cancer has become a complex health problem due to its high mortality. Over the past few decades with the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing technology and the application of various machine learning methods remarkable progress in cancer research has been made based on gene expression data. At the same time a growing amount of high-dimensional data has been generated such as RNA-seq data which calls for superior machine learning methods able to deal with mass data effectively in order to make accurate treatment decision. A semi-supervised deep learning method based on stacked sparse auto-encoder for cancer prediction using RNA-seq data.
