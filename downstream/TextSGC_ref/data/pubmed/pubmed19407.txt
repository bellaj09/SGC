Background. With the introduction of three-dimensional 3D ultrasound it has become possible to measure volumes. The relative increase in embryonic volume EV is much larger than that of the crown-rump length CRL over the same time period. We examined whether EV is a better parameter to determine growth restriction in fetuses with structural congenital abnormalities. Study Design Subjects and Outcome Measures. CRL and EV were measured using a Virtual Reality VR system in prospectively collected 3D ultrasound volumes of 56 fetuses diagnosed with structural congenital abnormalities in the first trimester of pregnancy gestational age 7+5 to 14+5 weeks. Measured CRL and EV were converted to z-scores and to percentages of the expected mean using previously published reference curves of euploid fetuses. The one-sample t-test was performed to test significance. Results. The EV was smaller than expected for GA in fetuses with structural congenital abnormalities -35%\u2009\u2009p < 0.001 z-score -1.44\u2009\u2009p < 0.001 whereas CRL was not -6.43%\u2009\u2009p = 0.118 z-score -0.43\u2009\u2009p = 0.605. Conclusions. CRL is a less reliable parameter to determine growth restriction in fetuses with structural congenital abnormalities as compared with EV. By measuring EV growth restriction in first-trimester fetuses with structural congenital abnormalities becomes more evident and enables an earlier detection of these cases.
