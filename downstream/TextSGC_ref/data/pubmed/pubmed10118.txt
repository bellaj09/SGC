Video super-resolution VSR has become one of the most critical problems in video processing. In the deep learning literature recent works have shown the benefits of using adversarial-based and perceptual losses to improve the performance on various image restoration tasks; however these have yet to be applied for video super-resolution. In this paper we propose a generative adversarial network GAN-based formulation for VSR. We introduce a new generator network optimized for the VSR problem named VSRResNet along with new discriminator architecture to properly guide VSRResNet during the GAN training. We further enhance our VSR GAN formulation with two regularizers a distance loss in feature-space and pixel-space to obtain our final VSRResFeatGAN model. We show that pre-training our generator with the mean-squared-error loss only quantitatively surpasses the current state-of-the-art VSR models. Finally we employ the PercepDist metric to compare the state-of-the-art VSR models. We show that this metric more accurately evaluates the perceptual quality of SR solutions obtained from neural networks compared with the commonly used PSNR/SSIM metrics. Finally we show that our proposed model the VSRResFeatGAN model outperforms the current state-of-the-art SR models both quantitatively and qualitatively.
