A transformation function TF that reconstructs neutral speech articulatory trajectories NATs from whispered speech articulatory trajectories WATs is investigated such that the dynamic time warped DTW distance between the transformed whispered and the original neutral articulatory movements is minimized. Three candidate TFs are considered: an affine function with a diagonal matrix  Ad which reconstructs one NAT from the corresponding WAT an affine function with a full matrix  Af and a deep neural network DNN based nonlinear function which reconstruct each NAT from all WATs. Experiments reveal that the transformation could be approximated well by Af since it generalizes better across subjects and achieves the least DTW distance of 5.20 1.27 mm on average with an improvement of 7.47% 4.76% and 7.64% relative compared to that with Ad DNN and the best baseline scheme respectively. Further analysis to understand the differences in neutral and whispered articulation reveals that the whispered articulators exhibit exaggerated movements in order to reconstruct the lip movements during neutral speech. It is also observed that among the articulators considered in the study the tongue exhibits a higher precision and stability while whispering implying that subjects control their tongue movements carefully in order to render an intelligible whispered speech.
