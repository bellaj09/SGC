"Recently coronary heart disease has attracted more and more attention where segmentation and analysis for vascular lumen contour are helpful for treatment. And intravascular optical coherence tomography IVOCT images are used to display lumen shapes in clinic. Thus an automatic segmentation method for IVOCT lumen contour is necessary to reduce the doctors workload while ensuring diagnostic accuracy. In this paper we proposed a deep residual segmentation network of multi-scale feature fusion based on attention mechanism RSM-Network Residual-Squeuzed Multiscale Network to segment the lumen contour in IVOCT images. Firstly three different data augmentation methods including mirror level turnover rotation and vertical flip are considered to expand the training set. Then in the proposed RSM-Network U-Net is contained as the main body considering its characteristic of accepting input images with any sizes. Meanwhile the combination of residual network and attention mechanism is applied to improve the ability of global feature extraction and solve the vanishing gradient problem. Moreover the pyramid feature extraction structure is introduced to enhance the learning ability for multi-scale features. Finally in order to increase the matching degree between the actual output and expected output the cross entropy loss function is also used. A series of metrics are presented to evaluate the performance of our proposed network and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RSM-Network can learn the contour details better contributing to strong robustness and accuracy for IVOCT lumen contour segmentation."
