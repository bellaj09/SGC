In radiotherapy computed tomography CT datasets are mostly used for radiation treatment planning to achieve a high-conformal tumor coverage while optimally sparing healthy tissue surrounding the tumor referred to as organs-at-risk OARs. Based on CT scan and/or magnetic resonance images OARs have to be manually delineated by clinicians which is one of the most time-consuming tasks in the clinical workflow. Recent multi-atlas MA or deep-learning DL based methods aim to improve the clinical routine by an automatic segmentation of OARs on a CT dataset. However so far no studies investigated the performance of these MA or DL methods on dual-energy CT DECT datasets which have been shown to improve the image quality compared to conventional 120\u2009kVp single-energy CT. In this study the performance of an in-house developed MA and a DL method two-step three-dimensional U-net was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on various DECT-derived pseudo-monoenergetic CT datasets ranging from 40\u2009keV to 170\u2009keV. At lower energies the MA method resulted in more accurate OAR segmentations. Both the qualitative and quantitative metric analysis showed that the DL approach often performed better than the MA method.
