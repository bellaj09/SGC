"In area CA1 of the hippocampus the selection of place cells to represent a new environment is biased towards neurons with higher excitability. However different environments are represented by orthogonal cell ensembles suggesting that regulatory mechanisms exist. Activity-dependent plasticity of intrinsic excitability as observed in vitro is an attractive candidate. Here using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in anesthetized rats we have examined how inducing theta-bursts of action potentials affects their intrinsic excitability over time. We observed a long-lasting homeostatic depression of intrinsic excitability which commenced within minutes and in contrast to in vitro observations was not mediated by dendritic Ih. Instead it was attenuated by the Kv1.1 channel blocker dendrotoxin K suggesting an axonal origin. Analysis of place cells out-of-field firing in mice navigating in virtual reality further revealed an experience-dependent reduction consistent with decreased excitability. We propose that this mechanism could reduce memory interference." Kv1.1 contributes to a rapid homeostatic plasticity of intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo.
