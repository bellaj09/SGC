Virtual reality VR simulation provides a means of making experiential learning reproducible and reusable. This study was designed to determine the efficiency and satisfaction components of usability. Previously it was found that first year medical students using a VR simulation for medical education demonstrated effectiveness in learning as measured by knowledge structure improvements both with and without a head mounted display HMD but students using a HMD showed statistically greater improvement in knowledge structures compared to those not using a HMD. However in this current analysis of other components of usability there were no overall significance differences in efficiency ease of use nor in satisfaction within this same group of randomized subjects comparing students using a HMD to those not using a HMD. These types of studies may be important in determining the most appropriate cost effective VR simulation technology needed to achieve specific learning goals and objectives.
