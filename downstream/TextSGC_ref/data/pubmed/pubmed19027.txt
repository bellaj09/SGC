Despite advances in optical coherence tomography OCT three-dimensional 3D renderings of OCT images remain limited to scanning consecutive two-dimensional 2D OCT slices. The authors describe a method of reconstructing 2D OCT data for 3D retinal analysis and visualization in a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment CAVE. Using customized signal processing software raw data from 2D slice-based spectral-domain OCT images were rendered into high-resolution 3D images for segmentation and quantification analysis. Reconstructed OCT images were projected onto a four-walled space and viewed through stereoscopic glasses resulting in a virtual reality perception of the retina. These 3D retinal renderings offer a novel method for segmentation and isolation of volumetric images. The ability to manipulate the images in a virtual reality environment allows visualization of complex spatial relationships that may aid our understanding of retinal pathology. More importantly these 3D retinal renderings can be viewed manipulated and analyzed on traditional 2D monitors independent of the CAVE.
