In this study we use a deep convolutional neural network CNN to develop a model that predicts ozone concentrations 24\xa0h in advance. We have evaluated the model for 21 continuous ambient monitoring stations CAMS across Texas. The inputs for the CNN model consist of meteorology e.g. wind field temperature and air pollution concentrations NO x and ozone from the previous day. The model is trained for predicting next-day 24-hour ozone concentrations. We acquired meteorological and air pollution data from 2014 to 2017 from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ. For 19 of the 21 stations in the study results show that the yearly index of agreement IOA is above 0.85 confirming the acceptable accuracy of the CNN model. The results also show the model performed well even for stations with varying monthly trends of ozone concentrations specifically CAMS-012 located in El-Paso and CAMS-013 located in Fort Worth both with IOA=0.89. In addition to ensure that the model was robust we tested it on stations where fewer meteorological variables are monitored. Although these stations have fewer input features their performance is similar to that of other stations. However despite its success at capturing daily trends the model mostly underpredicts the daily maximum ozone which provides a direction for future study and improvement. As this model predicts ozone concentrations 24\xa0h in advance with greater accuracy and computationally fewer resources it can serve as an early warning system for individuals susceptible to ozone and those engaging in outdoor activities.
