Cognitive control is the ability to coordinate thoughts and actions to achieve goals. Cognitive control impairments are one of the most persistent and devastating sequalae of traumatic brain injuries TBI. There have been efforts to improve cognitive control in individuals with post-acute TBI. Several studies have reported changes in neuropsychological measures suggesting the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive control. Yet the neural substrates of improved cognitive control after training remains poorly understood. In the current study we identified neural plasticity induced by cognitive control training for TBI using resting-state functional connectivity rsFC. Fifty-six individuals with chronic mild TBI 9\u202fyears post-injury on average were randomized into either a strategy-based cognitive training group N\u202f=\u202f26 or a knowledge-based training group active control condition; N\u202f=\u202f30 for 8\u202fweeks. We acquired a total of 109 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from 45 individuals before training immediately post-training and 3\u202fmonths post-training. Relative to the controls the strategy-based cognitive training group showed monotonic increases in connectivity in two cognitive control networks i.e. cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks across time points in multiple brain regions pvoxel\u202f<\u202f0.001 pcluster\u202f<\u202f0.05. Analyses of brain-behavior relationships revealed that fronto-parietal network connectivity over three time points within the strategy-based cognitive training group was positively associated with the trail making scores pvoxel\u202f<\u202f0.001 pcluster\u202f<\u202f0.05. These findings suggest that training-induced neuroplasticity continues through chronic phases of TBI and that rsFC can serve as a neuroimaging biomarker of evaluating the efficacy of cognitive training for TBI.
