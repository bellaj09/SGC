"This study presents the integration of three different teaching scenarios during biology laboratory lessons with the overall aim of exploring the potential predominant effectiveness of teaching and improvement of students learning by the use of the three-dimensional virtual reality educational tool Onlabs versus more traditional didactic practices. A sample of 83 fourth year undergraduate students of the Primary Education Department of Patras University in Greece were equally separated into three cognitively balanced groups to be educated on the light microscopy experiment by three different educational scenarios. Students conceptual understanding in the domain of microscopy was evaluated during all learning procedure with Pre and Post tests whereas their skill to handle properly a real light microscope in the wet biology lab was summatively assessed via a specially designed work sheet. Results of the present study provide evidence in favor of the virtual reality application."
