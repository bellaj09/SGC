Segmentation of anatomical structures of the heart from cardiac magnetic resonance images MRI has a significant impact on the quantitative analysis of the cardiac contractile function. Although deep convolutional neural networks ConvNets have achieved considerable success in medical imaging segmentation it is still a challenging task for existing deep ConvNets to precisely and automatically segment multiple heart structures from cardiac MRI. This paper presents a novel recurrent interleaved attention network RIANet to comprehensively tackle this issue. RIANet: Recurrent interleaved attention network for cardiac MRI segmentation.
