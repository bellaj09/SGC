When gathering valued goods risk and reward are often coupled and escalate over time for instance during foraging trading or gambling. This escalating frame requires agents to continuously balance expectations of reward against those of risk. To address how the human brain dynamically computes these tradeoffs we performed whole-brain fMRI while healthy young individuals engaged in a sequential gambling task. Participants were repeatedly confronted with the option to continue with throwing a die to accumulate monetary reward under escalating risk or the alternative option to stop to bank the current balance. Within each gambling round the accumulation of gains gradually increased reaction times for "continue" choices indicating growing uncertainty in the decision to continue. Neural activity evoked by "continue" choices was associated with growing activity and connectivity of a cortico-subcortical "braking" network that positively scaled with the accumulated gains including pre-supplementary motor area pre-SMA inferior frontal gyrus caudate and subthalamic nucleus STN. The influence of the STN on continue-evoked activity in the pre-SMA was predicted by interindividual differences in risk-aversion attitudes expressed during the gambling task. Furthermore activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ACC reflected individual choice tendencies by showing increased activation when subjects made nondefault "continue" choices despite an increasing tendency to stop but ACC activity did not change in proportion with subjective choice uncertainty. Together the results implicate a key role of dorsal ACC pre-SMA inferior frontal gyrus and STN in computing the trade-off between escalating reward and risk in sequential decision-making.
