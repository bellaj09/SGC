It is known that prior knowledge can facilitate memory acquisition. It is unclear however whether prior knowledge can affect post-encoding brain activity to facilitate memory consolidation. In this fMRI study we asked participants to associate novel houses with famous/nonfamous faces and investigated how associative-encoding tasks with/without prior knowledge differentially affected post-encoding brain connectivity during rest. Besides memory advantages in the famous condition we found that post-encoding hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform face area FFA and ventral-medial-prefrontal cortex vmPFC was stronger following encoding of associations with famous than non-famous faces. Importantly post-encoding functional connectivity between the hippocampus HPC and FFA and between the anterior temporal pole region aTPL and posterior perceptual regions i.e. FFA and the parahippocampal place area together predicted a large proportion of the variance in subsequent memory performance. This prediction was specific for face-house associative memory not face/house item memory and only in the famous condition where prior knowledge was involved. These results support the idea that when prior knowledge is involved the HPC vmPFC and aTPL which support prior episodic social-evaluative/schematic and semantic memories respectively continue to interact with each other and posterior perceptual brain regions during the post-encoding rest to facilitate off-line processing of the newly formed memory and enhance memory consolidation. The effect of prior knowledge on post-encoding brain connectivity and its relation to subsequent memory.
