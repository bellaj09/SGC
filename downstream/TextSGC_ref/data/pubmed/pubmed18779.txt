Numerous reports have demonstrated low-frequency oscillations during navigation using invasive recordings in the hippocampus of both rats and human patients. Given evidence in some cases of low-frequency synchronization between midline cortex and hippocampus it is also possible that low-frequency movement-related oscillations manifest in healthy human neocortex. However this possibility remains largely unexplored in part due to the difficulties of coupling free ambulation and effective scalp EEG recordings. In the current study participants freely ambulated on an omnidirectional treadmill and explored an immersive virtual reality city rendered on a head-mounted display while undergoing simultaneous wireless scalp EEG recordings. We found that frontal-midline FM delta-theta 2-7.21 Hz oscillations increased during movement compared to standing still periods consistent with a role in navigation. In contrast posterior alpha 8.32-12.76 Hz oscillations were suppressed in the presence of visual input independent of movement. Our findings suggest that FM delta-theta and posterior alpha oscillations arise at independent frequencies under complementary behavioral conditions and at least for FM delta-theta oscillations at independent recordings sites. Together our findings support a double dissociation between movement-related FM delta-theta and resting-related posterior alpha oscillations. Our study thus provides novel evidence that FM delta-theta oscillations arise in part from real-world ambulation and are functionally independent from posterior alpha oscillations.
