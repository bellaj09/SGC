Disruptions of brain anatomical connectivity are believed to play a central role in several neurological and psychiatric illnesses. The structural brain connectome is typically derived from diffusion tensor imaging DTI which may be influenced by methodological factors related to signal processing MRI scanners and biophysical properties of neuroanatomical regions. In this study we evaluated how these variables affect the reproducibility of the structural connectome. Reproducibility of the Structural Brain Connectome Derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
