Predicting one-dimensional structure properties has played an important role to improve prediction of protein three-dimensional structures and functions. The most commonly predicted properties are secondary structure and accessible surface area ASA representing local and nonlocal structural characteristics respectively. Secondary structure prediction is further complemented by prediction of continuous main-chain torsional angles. Here we describe a newly developed method SPIDER2 that utilizes three iterations of deep learning neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy of several structural properties simultaneously. For an independent test set of 1199 proteins SPIDER2 achieves 82 % accuracy for secondary structure prediction 0.76 for the correlation coefficient between predicted and actual solvent accessible surface area 19 and 30 for mean absolute errors of backbone  and  angles respectively and 8 and 32 for mean absolute errors of C-based  and  angles respectively. The method provides state-of-the-art all-in-one accurate prediction of local structure and solvent accessible surface area. The method is implemented as a webserver along with a standalone package that are available in our website: http://sparks-lab.org .
