Multiprojector large-scale displays are used in scientific visualization virtual reality and other visually intensive applications. In recent years a number of camera-based computer vision techniques have been proposed to register the geometry and color of tiled projection-based display. These automated techniques use cameras to "calibrate" display geometry and photometry computing per-projector corrective warps and intensity corrections that are necessary to produce seamless imagery across projector mosaics. These techniques replace the traditional labor-intensive manual alignment and maintenance steps making such displays cost-effective flexible and accessible. In this paper we present a survey of different camera-based geometric and photometric registration techniques reported in the literature to date. We discuss several techniques that have been proposed and demonstrated each addressing particular display configurations and modes of operation. We overview each of these approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We examine techniques that address registration on both planar video walls and arbitrary display surfaces and photometric correction for different kinds of display surfaces. We conclude with a discussion of the remaining challenges and research opportunities for multiprojector displays. Camera-based calibration techniques for seamless multiprojector displays.
