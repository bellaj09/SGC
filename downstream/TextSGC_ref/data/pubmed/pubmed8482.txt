In robotic-assisted kidney surgery computational methods make it possible to augment the surgical scene and potentially improve patient outcome. Most often soft-tissue registration is a prerequisite for the visualization of tumors and vascular structures hidden beneath the surface. State-of-the-art volume-to-surface registration methods however are computationally demanding and require a sufficiently large target surface. To overcome this limitation the first step toward registration is the extraction of the outer edge of the kidney.
