Nowadays getting an efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation in Multi-Sequence MR images as soon as possible gives an early clinical diagnosis treatment and follow-up. The aim of this study is to develop a new deep learning model for the segmentation of brain tumors. The proposed models are used to segment the brain tumors of Glioblastomas with both high and low grade. Glioblastomas have four properties: different sizes shapes contrasts in addition Glioblastomas appear anywhere in the brain.
