Recently there has been much interest in the community structure or mesoscale organization of complex networks. This structure is characterised either as a set of sparsely inter-connected modules or as a highly connected core with a sparsely connected periphery. However it is often difficult to disambiguate these two types of mesoscale structure or indeed to summarise the full network in terms of the relationships between its mesoscale constituents. Here we estimate a community structure with a stochastic blockmodel approach the Erds-Rnyi Mixture Model and compare it to the much more widely used deterministic methods such as the Louvain and Spectral algorithms. We used the Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans nervous system connectome as a model system in which biological knowledge about each node or neuron can be used to validate the functional relevance of the communities obtained. The deterministic algorithms derived communities with 4-5 modules defined by sparse inter-connectivity between all modules. In contrast the stochastic Erds-Rnyi Mixture Model estimated a community with 9 blocks or groups which comprised a similar set of modules but also included a clearly defined core made of 2 small groups. We show that the "core-in-modules" decomposition of the worm brain network estimated by the Erds-Rnyi Mixture Model is more compatible with prior biological knowledge about the C. elegans nervous system than the purely modular decomposition defined deterministically. We also show that the blockmodel can be used both to generate stochastic realisations simulations of the biological connectome and to compress network into a small number of super-nodes and their connectivity. We expect that the Erds-Rnyi Mixture Model may be useful for investigating the complex community structures in other nervous systems.
