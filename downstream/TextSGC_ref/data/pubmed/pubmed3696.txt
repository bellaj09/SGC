Primary patterns in adult brain connectivity are established during development by coordinated networks of transiently expressed genes; however neural networks remain malleable throughout life. The present study hypothesizes that structural connectivity from key seed regions may induce effects on their connected targets which are reflected in gene expression at those targeted regions. To test this hypothesis analyses were performed on data from two brains from the Allen Human Brain Atlas for which both gene expression and DW-MRI were available. Structural connectivity was estimated from the DW-MRI data and an approach motivated by network topology that is weighted gene coexpression network analysis WGCNA was used to cluster genes with similar patterns of expression across the brain. Group exponential lasso models were then used to predict gene cluster expression summaries as a function of seed region structural connectivity patterns. In several gene clusters brain regions located in the brain stem diencephalon and hippocampal formation were identified that have significant predictive power for these expression summaries. These connectivity-associated clusters are enriched in genes associated with synaptic signaling and brain plasticity. Furthermore using seed region based connectivity provides a novel perspective in understanding relationships between gene expression and connectivity. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3126-3140 2017.
