"Virtual reality VR has recently been explored as a tool for neurorehabilitation to enable individuals with Parkinsons disease PD to practice challenging skills in a safe environment. Current technological advances have enabled the use of affordable fully immersive head-mounted displays HMDs for potential therapeutic applications. However while previous studies have used HMDs in individuals with PD these were only used for short bouts of walking. Clinical applications of VR for gait training would likely involve an extended exposure to the virtual environment which has the potential to cause individuals with PD to experience simulator-related adverse effects due to their age or pathology. Thus our objective was to evaluate the safety of using an HMD for longer bouts of walking in fully immersive VR for older adults and individuals with PD."
