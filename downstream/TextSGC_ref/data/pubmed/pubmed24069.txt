Virtual reality augmented reality robotics and autonomous driving have recently attracted much attention from both academic and industrial communities in which image-based camera localization is a key task. However there has not been a complete review on image-based camera localization. It is urgent to map this topic to enable individuals enter the field quickly. In this paper an overview of image-based camera localization is presented. A new and complete classification of image-based camera localization approaches is provided and the related techniques are introduced. Trends for future development are also discussed. This will be useful not only to researchers but also to engineers and other individuals interested in this field. Image-based camera localization: an overview.
