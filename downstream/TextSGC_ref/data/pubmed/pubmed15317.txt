Machine learning has been used extensively in clinical text classification tasks. Deep learning approaches using word embeddings have been recently gaining momentum in biomedical applications. In an effort to automate the identification of altered mental status AMS in emergency department provider notes for the purpose of decision support we compare the performance of classic bag-of-words-based machine learning classifiers and novel deep learning approaches. Automated detection of altered mental status in emergency department clinical notes: a deep learning approach.
