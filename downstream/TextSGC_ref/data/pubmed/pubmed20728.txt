The purpose of the present study was to compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography EMG biofeedback augmented by virtual reality VR and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps T:B muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor taskOBJECTIVE: To compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography EMG biofeedback augmented by virtual reality VR and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor task in normal children and children with spastic cerebral palsy CP. Augmented effects of EMG biofeedback interfaced with virtual reality on neuromuscular control and movement coordination during reaching in children with cerebral palsy.
