Cognitive control and working memory rely upon a common fronto-parietal network that includes the inferior frontal junction IFJ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlPFC pre-supplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex pSMA/dACC and intraparietal sulcus IPS. This network is able to flexibly adapt its function in response to changing behavioral goals mediating a wide range of cognitive demands. Here we apply dynamic causal modeling to functional magnetic resonance imaging data to characterize task-related alterations in the strength of network interactions across distinct cognitive processes. Evidence in favor of task-related connectivity dynamics was accrued across a very large space of possible network structures. Cognitive control and working memory demands were manipulated using a factorial combination of the multi-source interference task and a verbal 2-back working memory task respectively. Both were found to alter the sensitivity of the IFJ to perceptual information and to increase IFJ-to-pSMA/dACC connectivity. In contrast increased connectivity from the pSMA/dACC to the IPS as well as from the dlPFC to the IFJ was uniquely driven by cognitive control demands; a task-induced negative influence of the dlPFC on the pSMA/dACC was specific to working memory demands. These results reflect a system of both shared and unique context-dependent dynamics within the fronto-parietal network. Mechanisms supporting cognitive engagement response selection and action evaluation may be shared across cognitive domains while dynamic updating of task and context representations within this network are potentially specific to changing demands on cognitive control. Effective connectivity within the frontoparietal control network differentiates cognitive control and working memory.
