Liver disease is an important public health problem. Liver Function Tests LFT is the most achievable test for liver disease diagnosis. Most liver diseases are manifested as abnormal LFT. Liver disease screening by LFT data is helpful for computer aided diagnosis. In this paper we propose a densely connected deep neural network DenseDNN on 13 most commonly used LFT indicators and demographic information of subjects for liver disease screening. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 76914 samples more than 100 times of data than the previous datasets. The Area Under Curve AUC of DenseDNN is 0.8919 that of DNN is 0.8867 that of random forest is 0.8790 and that of logistic regression is 0.7974. The performance of deep learning models are significantly better than conventional methods. As for the deep learning methods DenseDNN shows better performance than DNN. Liver disease screening based on densely connected deep neural networks.
