The fMRI-based functional connectome was shown to be sufficiently unique to allow individual identification fingerprinting. We aimed to test whether a fNIRS-based connectome could also be used to identify individuals. Forty-four participants performed experimental protocols that consisted of two periods of resting-state interleaved by a cognitive task period. Connectome identification was performed for all possible pairwise combinations of the three periods. The influence of hemodynamic global variation was tested using global signal regression and principal component analysis. High identification accuracies well-above chance level 2.3% were observed overall being particularly high 93% to the oxyhemoglobin signal between resting conditions. Our results suggest that fNIRS is a suitable technique to assess connectome fingerprints. Identifying individuals using fNIRS-based cortical connectomes.
