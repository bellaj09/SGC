"Personal identity is critical to provider--patient interactions. Patients and doctors tend to self-select ideally forming therapeutic units that maximise the patients benefit. Recently however reality has changed. The internet and virtual worlds such as Second Life http://www.secondlife.com/ allow models of identity and provider--patient interactions that go beyond the limits of mainstream personal identity. In this paper some of the ethical implications of virtual patient--provider interactions especially those that have to do with personal identity are explored."
