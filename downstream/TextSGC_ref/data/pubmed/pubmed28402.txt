Functional electrical stimulation FES is a promising technology for restoring movement to paralyzed limbs. Intracortical brain-computer interfaces iBCIs have enabled intuitive control over virtual and robotic movements and more recently over upper extremity FES neuroprostheses. However electrical stimulation of muscles creates artifacts in intracortical microelectrode recordings that could degrade iBCI performance. Here we investigate methods for reducing the cortically recorded artifacts that result from peripheral electrical stimulation. Signal processing methods for reducing artifacts in microelectrode brain recordings caused by functional electrical stimulation.
