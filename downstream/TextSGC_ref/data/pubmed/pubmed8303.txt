Pulse detection during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains challenging for both novel and expert rescuers because current methods are inaccurate and time-consuming. There is still a need to develop automatic methods for pulse detection where the most challenging scenario is the discrimination between pulsed rhythms PR pulse and pulseless electrical activity PEA no pulse. Thoracic impedance TI acquired through defibrillation pads has been proven useful for detecting pulse as it shows small fluctuations with every heart beat. In this study we analyse the use of deep learning techniques to detect pulse using only the TI signal. The proposed neural network composed by convolutional and recurrent layers outperformed state of the art methods and achieved a balanced accuracy of 90% for segments as short as 3 s.
