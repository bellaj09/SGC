Professional societies provide visibility and legitimacy to the work of their post secondary educator members advocate best practices in courses and sponsored student research and establish deep networks and communities that catalyze members to collectively engage in undergraduate teaching and learning scholarship. Within the American Society for Microbiology ASM the Education Board established in the mid-1970s assumes this role. I have been fortunate enough to watch several pivotal programs support our growth and change the status quo by providing opportunities for biology educators to flourish. In this retrospective review the background and details I offer about each initiative help explain ASM Education offerings how our growth has been supported and how the status quo has changed. In this prospective look I offer my vision of the future in post secondary education where classroom learning is student-centered and focused on global problems affecting our health and environment. For the profession to proliferate the ASM must provide members as many opportunities in learning biology as they do with advancing biology to new frontiers. A Retrospective Look at 20 Years of ASM Education Programs 1990-2010 and a Prospective Look at the Next 20 Years 2011-2030.
