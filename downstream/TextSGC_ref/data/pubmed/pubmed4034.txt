"As a component of self-regulation delay discounting DD refers to an individuals tendency to prefer smaller-but-sooner rewards over larger-but-later rewards and plays an essential role in many aspects of human behavior. Although numerous studies have examined the neural underpinnings of DD in adults there are far fewer studies focusing on the neurobiological correlates underlying DD in adolescents. Here we investigated the associations between individual differences in DD and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations fALFF and resting-state functional connectivity RSFC in 228 high school students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging RS-fMRI. At the regional level we found an association between higher DD and greater fALFF in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dACC which is involved in conflict monitoring and strategy adaptation. At the connectivity level DD was positively correlated with the RSFC between the dACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC a critical functional circuit in the cognitive control network. Furthermore these effects persisted even after adjusting for the influences of general intelligence and trait impulsivity. Overall this study reveals the fALFF and RSFC as the functional brain basis of DD in late adolescents aiding to strengthen and corroborate our understanding of the neural underpinnings of DD." Delay discounting is associated with the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and resting-state functional connectivity in late adolescence.
