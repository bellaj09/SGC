Independent component analysis ICA as a promising spatial filtering method can separate motor-related independent components MRICs from the multichannel electroencephalogram EEG signals. However the unpredictable burst interferences may significantly degrade the performance of ICA-based brain-computer interface BCI system. In this study we proposed a new algorithm frame to address this issue by combining the single-trial-based ICA filter with zero-training classifier. We developed a two-round data selection method to identify automatically the badly corrupted EEG trials in the training set. The "high quality" training trials were utilized to optimize the ICA filter. In addition we proposed an accuracy-matrix method to locate the artifact data segments within a single trial and investigated which types of artifacts can influence the performance of the ICA-based MIBCIs. Twenty-six EEG datasets of three-class motor imagery were used to validate the proposed methods and the classification accuracies were compared with that obtained by frequently used common spatial pattern CSP spatial filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed optimizing strategy could effectively improve the stability practicality and classification performance of ICA-based MIBCI. The study revealed that rational use of ICA method may be crucial in building a practical ICA-based MIBCI system.
