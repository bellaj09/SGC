Stroke is a common disabling condition which declines the functional and mobility level. The purpose of the case series was to determine the effect of virtual reality training on sensorimotor function and mobility level in stroke patients. Ten male 40-60 year patients of stroke 08 Infarction 02 Haemorrhagic were selected from Physiotherapy department of Pakistan Railway Hospital Rawalpindi. The additional virtual reality training 15-20 minutes was provided 03 days per week for 06weeks along with task oriented training. All patients were assessed through Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower Extremity FMA-LE and Timed Get Up and Go Test TUG at baseline and after 06 weeks of training. The results showed that there was significant improvement in mobility level of stroke patients. It is concluded that combination of task oriented and virtual reality training considerably improves the physical performance and mobility level in stroke patients. Effects of virtual reality training on mobility and physical function in stroke.
