Clinical decision support systems CDSS have been designed implemented and validated to help clinicians and practitioners for decision-making about diagnosing some diseases. Within the CDSSs we can find Fuzzy inference systems. For the reasons above the objective of this study was to design to implement and to validate a methodology for developing data-driven Mamdani-type fuzzy clinical decision support systems using clusters and pivot tables. For validating the proposed methodology we applied our algorithms on five public datasets including Wisconsin Coimbra breast cancer wart treatment Immunotherapy and cryotherapy and caesarian section and compared them with other related works Literature. The results show that the Kappa Statistics and accuracies were close to 1.0% and 100% respectively for each output variable which shows better accuracy than some literature results. The proposed framework could be considered as a deep learning technique because it is composed of various processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Framework for the Development of Data-Driven Mamdani-Type Fuzzy Clinical Decision Support Systems.
