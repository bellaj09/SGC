This article provides an overview and synthesis of the 100 most cited healthcare simulation publications to provide insight into the articles that have shaped current knowledge and practice. Searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases were conducted in July 2017. Most articles were concerned with medical education and training 86% and were most often published in surgical journals 33%. Manikins 20% standardized patients 16% inanimate part-task trainers 16% fully simulated environments 17% and virtual reality part-task trainers 14% were the most commonly featured types of simulators. Healthcare simulation research has matured and grown during the preceding decades. There has been a move away from research questions focused on "does simulation work?" to an assessment of the conditions under which simulation is most effective. It is hoped that providing an overview of highly cited works will help identify topics for further research. The 100 Most Cited Articles on Healthcare Simulation: A Bibliometric Review.
