Visual and idiothetic information is coupled in forming multimodal spatial representations during navigation Tcheang et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1083:1152-1157 2011. We investigated whether idiothetic representations activate visual representations but not vice versa unidirectional coupling or whether these two representations activate each other bidirectional coupling. In a virtual reality environment participants actively rotated in place to face certain orientations to become adapted to a new vision-locomotion relationship gain. In particular the visual turning angle was equal to 0.7 times the physical turning angle. After adaptation participants walked a path with a turn in darkness idiothetic input only or watched a video of the traversed path visual input only. Then the participants pointed to the origin of the path. The participants who were presented with only idiothetic input showed that their pointing responses were influenced by the new gain adaptation effect. By contrast the participants who were presented with only visual input did not show any adaptation effect. These results suggest that idiothetic input contributed to spatial representations indirectly via the coupling which resulted in the adaptation effect whereas vision alone contributed to spatial representations directly which did not result in the adaptation effect. Hence the coupling between vision and locomotion is unidirectional. Unidirectional influence of vision on locomotion in multimodal spatial representations acquired from navigation.
