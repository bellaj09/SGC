"We provide behavioral evidence using monkey smooth pursuit eye movements for four principles of cerebellar learning. Using a circuit-level model of the cerebellum we link behavioral data to learnings neural implementation. The four principles are: 1 early fast acquisition driven by climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellar cortex with poor retention; 2 learned responses of Purkinje cells guide transfer of learning from the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nucleus with excellent retention; 3 functionally different neural signals are subject to learning in the cerebellar cortex versus the deep cerebellar nuclei; and 4 negative feedback from the cerebellum to the inferior olive reduces the magnitude of the teaching signal in climbing fibers and limits learning. Our circuit-level model based on these four principles explains behavioral data obtained by strategically manipulating the signals responsible for acquisition and recall of direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements across multiple timescales."
