The laparoscopic minimally invasive surgical technique is widely employed on a global scale. However the efficient and ethical teaching of this technique requires equipment for surgical simulation. These educational devices are present on the market in the form of box trainers and virtual reality simulators or some combination of those. In this article we present a systematic overview of commercially available surgical simulators describing the most important features of each product. Our overview elaborates on box trainers and virtual reality simulators and also touches on surgical robotics simulators together with operating room workflow simulators for the sake of completeness. Apart from presenting educational tools we evaluated the literature of laparoscopic surgical education and simulation to provide a complete picture of the unfolding trends in this field.
