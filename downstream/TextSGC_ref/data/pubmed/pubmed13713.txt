Manual segmentation of the brain tumors for cancer diagnosis from MRI images is a difficult tedious and time-consuming task. The accuracy and the robustness of brain tumor segmentation therefore are crucial for the diagnosis treatment planning and treatment outcome evaluation. Mostly the automatic brain tumor segmentation methods use hand designed features. Similarly traditional methods of deep learning such as convolutional neural networks require a large amount of annotated data to learn from which is often difficult to obtain in the medical domain. Here we describe a new model two-pathway-group CNN architecture for brain tumor segmentation which exploits local features and global contextual features simultaneously. This model enforces equivariance in the two-pathway CNN model to reduce instabilities and overfitting parameter sharing. Finally we embed the cascade architecture into two-pathway-group CNN in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source and concatenated at the last layer. Validation of the model on BRATS2013 and BRATS2015 data sets revealed that embedding of a group CNN into a two pathway architecture improved the overall performance over the currently published state-of-the-art while computational complexity remains attractive.
