To develop a deep learning system based on 3D convolutional neural networks CNNs and to automatically predict EGFR-mutant pulmonary adenocarcinoma in CT images. A dataset of 579 nodules with EGFR mutation status labels of mutant Mut or wild-type WT was retrospectively analyzed. A deep learning system namely 3D DenseNets was developed to process 3D patches of nodules from CT data and learn strong representations with supervised end-to-end training. The 3D DenseNets were trained with a training subset of 348 nodules and tuned with a development subset of 116 nodules. A strong data augmentation technique mixup was used for better generalization. We evaluated our model on a holdout subset of 115 nodules. An independent public dataset of 37 nodules from the cancer imaging archive TCIA was also used to test the generalization of our method. Conventional radiomics analysis was also performed for comparison. Our method achieved promising performance on predicting EGFR mutation status with AUCs of 75.8% and 75.0% for our holdout test set and public test set respectively. Moreover strong relations were found between deep learning feature and conventional radiomics while deep learning worked through an enhanced radiomics manner that is deep learned radiomics DLR in terms of robustness compactness and expressiveness. The proposed deep learning system predicts EGFR-mutant of lung adenocarcinomas in CT images noninvasively and automatically indicating its potential to help clinical decision-making by identifying eligible patients of pulmonary adenocarcinoma for EGFR-targeted therapy. Toward automatic prediction of EGFR mutation status in pulmonary adenocarcinoma with 3D deep learning.
