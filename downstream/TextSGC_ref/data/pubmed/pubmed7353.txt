Background fluorescence especially when it exhibits undesired spatial features is a primary factor for reduced image quality in optical microscopy. Structured background is particularly detrimental when analyzing single-molecule images for 3-dimensional localization microscopy or single-molecule tracking. Here we introduce BGnet a deep neural network with a U-net-type architecture as a general method to rapidly estimate the background underlying the image of a point source with excellent accuracy even when point-spread function PSF engineering is in use to create complex PSF shapes. We trained BGnet to extract the background from images of various PSFs and show that the identification is accurate for a wide range of different interfering background structures constructed from many spatial frequencies. Furthermore we demonstrate that the obtained background-corrected PSF images for both simulated and experimental data lead to a substantial improvement in localization precision. Finally we verify that structured background estimation with BGnet results in higher quality of superresolution reconstructions of biological structures.
