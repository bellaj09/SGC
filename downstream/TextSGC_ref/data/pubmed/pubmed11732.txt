"From the start Kurt Godel observed that computer and brain paradigms were considered on a par by researchers and that researchers had misunderstood his theorems. He hailed with displeasure that the brain transcends computers. In this brief article we point out that Artificial Intelligence AI comprises multitudes of human-made methodologies systems and languages and implemented with computer technology. These advances enhance development in the electron and quantum realms. In the biological realm animal neurons function also utilizing electron flow and are products of evolution. Mirror neurons are an important paradigm in neuroscience research. Moreover the paradigm shift proposed here - hall of mirror neurons - is a potentially further productive research tactic. These concepts further expand AI and brain research." Artificial Intelligence and brain.
