In this paper we introduce the Neural Acoustic Processing Library NAPLib a toolbox containing novel processing methods for real-time and offline analysis of neural activity in response to speech. Our method divides the speech signal and resultant neural activity into segmental units e.g. phonemes allowing for fast and efficient computations that can be implemented in real-time. NAPLib contains a suite of tools that characterize various properties of the neural representation of speech which can be used for functionality such as characterizing electrode tuning properties brain mapping and brain computer interfaces. The library is general and applicable to both invasive and non-invasive recordings including electroencephalography EEG electrocorticography ECoG and magnetoecnephalography MEG. In this work we describe the structure of NAPLib as well as demonstrating its use in both EEG and ECoG. We believe NAPLib provides a valuable tool to both clinicians and researchers who are interested in the representation of speech in the brain.
