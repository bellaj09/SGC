Collecting and curating large medical-image datasets for deep neural network DNN algorithm development is typically difficult and resource-intensive. While transfer learning TL decreases reliance on large data collections current TL implementations are tailored to two-dimensional 2D datasets limiting applicability to volumetric imaging e.g. computed tomography. Targeting performance enhancement of a DNN algorithm based on a small image dataset we assessed incremental impact of 3D-to-2D projection methods one supporting novel data augmentation DA; photometric grayscale-to-color conversion GCC; and/or TL on training of an algorithm from a small coronary computed tomography angiography CCTA dataset 200 examinations 50% with atherosclerosis and 50% atherosclerosis-free producing 245 diseased and 1127 normal coronary arteries/branches. Volumetric CCTA data was converted to a 2D format creating both an Aggregate Projection View APV and a Mosaic Projection View MPV supporting DA per vessel; both grayscale and color-mapped versions of each view were also obtained. Training was performed both without and with TL and algorithm performance of all permutations was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Without TL APV performance was 0.74 and 0.87 on grayscale and color images respectively compared to 0.90 and 0.87 for MPV. With TL APV performance was 0.78 and 0.88 on grayscale and color images respectively compared with 0.93 and 0.91 for MPV. In conclusion TL enhances performance of a DNN algorithm from a small volumetric dataset after proposed 3D-to-2D reformatting but additive gain is achieved with application of either GCC to APV or the proposed novel MPV technique for DA.
