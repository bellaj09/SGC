"Ultrasonography is a widespread diagnostic technique that can take advantage of virtual reality for the purpose of training and rehearsal. The placement orientation and body interaction of the probe is fundamental for the execution of the exploration. This paper introduces a virtual reality setup that employs visuo-haptic feedback for virtual ultrasonography. The haptic feedback is provided by desktop delta-like haptic interface with a 3D printed ultrasonography probe and features haptic point-cloud rendering with implicit surface rendering. The visual feedback is provided by a Head Mounted Display that displays the virtual body the probe and the operators hand while not in contact with the probe. The system provides a co-located experience by means of precise calibration of the reference system allowing to synchronize the display of the hand and the probe with the location of the corresponding physical entities." Co-located haptic interaction for virtual USG exploration.
