Picture Wise Just Noticeable Difference PW-JND which accounts for the minimum difference of a picture that human visual system can perceive can be widely used in perception-oriented image and video processing. However the conventional Just Noticeable Difference JND models calculate the JND threshold for each pixel or sub-band separately which may not reflect the total masking effect of a picture accurately. In this paper we propose a deep learning based PW-JND prediction model for image compression. Firstly we formulate the task of predicting PW-JND as a multi-class classification problem and propose a framework to transform the multi-class classification problem to a binary classification problem solved by just one binary classifier. Secondly we construct a deep learning based binary classifier named perceptually lossy/lossless predictor which can predict whether an image is perceptually lossy to another or not. Finally we propose a sliding window based search strategy to predict PW-JND based on the prediction results of the perceptually lossy/lossless predictor. Experimental results show that the mean accuracy of the perceptually lossy/lossless predictor reaches 92% and the absolute prediction error of the proposed PW-JND model is 0.79 dB on average which shows the superiority of the proposed PW-JND model to the conventional JND models.
