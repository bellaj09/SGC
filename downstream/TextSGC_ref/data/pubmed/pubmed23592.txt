Cadaver training for prehospital surgical procedures is a valid training model. The limitation to date has been that perfused cadavers have only been used in wet laboratories in hospitals or university centers. We endeavor to describe a transportable central-perfused cadaver model suitable for training in the battlefield environment. Goals of design were to create a simple easily reproducible and realistic model to simulate procedures in field and austere conditions. A Novel Expeditionary Perfused Cadaver Model for Trauma Training in the Out-of-Hospital Setting.
