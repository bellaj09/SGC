Three-dimensional models can be generated from slice images such as those obtained from computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI using a variety of techniques. A popular method for rendering 3D anatomical models is the creation of polygonal mesh surfaces representing the boundary between tissues. Mesh surfaces can be rendered extremely quickly using conventional personal computers without recourse to more expensive graphic workstations. The dissemination of three-dimensional 3D models across the Internet has been made significantly easier by the definition of the Virtual Reality Markup Language VRML format. The VRML definition allows the parameters and relationships of 3D objects to be described in a text format. The text file can be transfered from a host computer to a remote client computer through the World Wide Web and viewed using readily available software See Appendix. VRML is based on the definition of primitive 3D objects such as polygons and spheres. Consequently the transition from a mesh surface derived from a clinical image data set to a VRML object is relatively simple allowing for convenient and cost-effective dissemination of 3D clinical models across the internet.
