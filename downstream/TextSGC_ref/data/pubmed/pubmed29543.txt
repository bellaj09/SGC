The motor-imagery based brain-computer interface supplies a potential approach for motor-impaired patients not only to control rehabilitation facilities but also to promote recovery from motor dysfunctions. To improve event-related desynchronization during motor imagery and obtain improved brain-computer interface classification accuracy we introduce dynamic video guidance and complex motor tasks to the motor imagery paradigm. Improvements in event-related desynchronization and classification performance of motor imagery using instructive dynamic guidance and complex tasks.
