Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy often have marked hand involvement with excessive thumb adduction and flexion and limited active wrist extension from infancy. Post-lesional aberrant plasticity can lead to progressive abnormalities of the developing motor system. Disturbances of somatosensory and visual function and developmental disregard contribute to difficulties with hand use. Progressive soft tissue and bony changes may occur leading to contractures which further limit function in a vicious cycle. Early intervention might help to break this cycle however the precise nature and appropriateness of the intervention must be carefully considered. Traditional approaches to the hemiplegic upper limb include medications and botulinum toxin injections to manage abnormalities of tone and surgical interventions. Therapist input including provision of orthoses remains a mainstay although many therapies have not been well evaluated. There has been a recent increase in interventions for the hemiplegic upper limb mostly aimed outside the period of infancy. These include trials of constraint-induced movement therapy CIMT and bimanual therapy as well as the use of virtual reality and robot-assisted therapy. In future non-invasive brain stimulation may be combined with therapy. Interventions under investigation in the infant age group include modified CIMT and action observation therapy. A further approach which may be suited to the infant with thumb-in-palm deformity but which requires evaluation is the use of elastic taping. Enhanced cutaneous feedback through mechanical stimulation to the skin provided by the tape during movement has been postulated to modulate ongoing muscle activity. If effective this would represent a low-cost safe widely applicable early intervention. Early intervention to improve hand function in hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
