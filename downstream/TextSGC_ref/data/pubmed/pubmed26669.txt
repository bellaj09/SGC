"Regularization has been one of the most popular approaches to prevent overfitting in electroencephalogram EEG classification of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation CV. However the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1 a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2 it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the systems practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors namely SBLaplace for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification."
