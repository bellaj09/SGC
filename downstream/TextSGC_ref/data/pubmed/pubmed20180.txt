Many people sustaining a traumatic brain injury experience vestibular pathology requiring physical therapy for treatment. This study measured improvements in gait speed and weight shift for subjects receiving vestibular physical therapy using a Computer-Assisted Rehabilitation Environment CAREN. A 6-session CAREN 6-session traditional vestibular therapy group was compared with a 12-session CAREN only 0 traditional sessions therapy group. These two groups were compared to each other and with data from healthy controls performing similar tasks on the CAREN. Those participating in 12 CAREN sessions had greater improvements in gait speed p=0.014 and weight shift scores p<0.001 and demonstrated similar values achieved by a healthy control population. Improvements in gait speed and weight shift of persons with traumatic brain injury and vestibular dysfunction using a virtual reality computer-assisted rehabilitation environment.
