Image-guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are related to or performed under some kind of imaging. Such imaging may be direct inspection as in open surgery or indirect inspection as in endoscopy or laparoscopy. Common to all these techniques is the transformation of optical and visible information to a monitor or the eye of the operator. Image-guided therapy IGT differs by using processed imaging data acquired before during and after a wide range of different imaging techniques. This means that the planning performing and monitoring as well as the control of the therapeutic procedure are based and dependent on the "virtual reality" provided by imaging investigations. Since most of such imaging involves radiology in the broadest sense there is a need to characterise IGT in more detail. In this paper the technical medico-legal and medico-political issues will be discussed. The focus will be put on state-of-the-art imaging technical developments methodological and legal requisites concerning radiation protection and licensing speciality-specific limitations and crossing specialty borders definition of technical and quality standards and finally to the issue of awareness of IGT within the medical and public community. The specialty-specific knowledge should confer radiologists with a significant role in the overall responsibility for the imaging-related processes in various non-radiological specialties. These processes may encompass purchase servicing quality management radiation protection and documentation also taking responsibility for the definition and compliance with the legal requirements regarding all radiological imaging performed by non-radiologists.
