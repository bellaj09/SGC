We propose a single network trained by pixel-to-label deep learning to address the general issue of automatic multiple organ segmentation in three-dimensional 3D computed tomography CT images. Our method can be described as a voxel-wise multiple-class classification scheme for automatically assigning labels to each pixel/voxel in a 2D/3D CT image. Deep learning of the sectional appearances of 3D CT images for anatomical structure segmentation based on an FCN voting method.
