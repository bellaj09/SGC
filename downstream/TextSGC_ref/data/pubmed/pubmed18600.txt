Currently very little is published about the application and efficacy of various forms of SHTs for problem gambling.

Although the problem gambling literature has mainly reported on two forms of SHTs with problem gamblers i.e. use of self-help manuals and audiotapes the review discuss utilizing a wide range of SHTs with problem gamblers. These include written materials e.g. self-help books and treatment manuals audiotapes videotapes computer-based SHTs implemented on palmtop computers desktop computers via telephone Interactive Voice Response systems--IVR or via the Internet and virtual reality applications. These SHTs would suit those problem gamblers who are not accessing professional treatment due to shame guilt fear of stigma privacy concerns or financial difficulties as well as those living in rural areas or with less severe gambling problems. The review also suggest future protocols for conducting further research in this area with problem gamblers highlighting a need for a cohesive theory to guide research.
