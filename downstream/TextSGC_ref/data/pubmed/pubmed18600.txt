Despite a proliferation in digital intervention tools for autism many studies lack comparison with standard intervention tools and are not evaluated with objective and standardized measures. In this article we present research on the potential of mixed reality MR experiences using full-body interaction to foster social initiation behaviors in children with autism while playing with a child without autism in a face-to-face colocated configuration. The primary goal was to test whether practicing socialization in a virtual environment catered toward individuals with autism spectrum disorders ASDs could be a way to reduce anxiety while simultaneously forming collaborative behavioral patterns. Building on the results of a preliminary study this second phase compares our system with a typical LEGO social intervention strategy using construction tools and toys as an aid to the psychologist therapist or caregiver. Results are based on four data sources: a video coding of the externally observed behaviors during the video-recorded play sessions b log files of our system showing the events triggered and the real-time decisions taken c physiologic data heart rate variability and electrodermal activity gathered through child-appropriate wearable d and a standardized anxiety questionnaire. The results obtained show that the MR setting generated as many social initiations as the control condition and no significant difference existed in the reported anxiety levels of the children after playing in the two conditions.
