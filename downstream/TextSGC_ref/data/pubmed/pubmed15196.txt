As an important physical property of molecules absorption energy can characterize the electronic property and structural information of molecules. Moreover the accurate calculation of molecular absorption energies is highly valuable. Present linear and nonlinear methods hold low calculation accuracies due to great errors especially irregular complicated molecular systems for structures. Thus developing a prediction model for molecular absorption energies with enhanced accuracy efficiency and stability is highly beneficial. By combining deep learning and intelligence algorithms we propose a prediction model based on the chaos-enhanced accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm and deep artificial neural network CAPSO BP DNN that possesses a seven-layer 8-4-4-4-4-4-1 structure. Eight parameters related to molecular absorption energies are selected as inputs such as a theoretical calculating value Ec of absorption energy B3LYP/STO-3G molecular electron number Ne oscillator strength Os number of double bonds Ndb total number of atoms Na number of hydrogen atoms Nh number of carbon atoms Nc and number of nitrogen atoms NN; and one parameter representing the molecular absorption energy is regarded as the output. A prediction experiment on organic molecular absorption energies indicates that CAPSO BP DNN exhibits a favourable predictive effect accuracy and correlation. The tested absolute average relative error predicted root-mean-square error and square correlation coefficient are 0.033 0.0153 and 0.9957 respectively. Relative to other prediction models the CAPSO BP DNN model exhibits a good comprehensive prediction performance and can provide references for other materials chemistry and physics fields such as nonlinear prediction of chemical and physical properties QSAR/QAPR and chemical information modelling etc. Prediction Model of Organic Molecular Absorption Energies based on Deep Learning trained by Chaos-enhanced Accelerated Evolutionary algorithm.
