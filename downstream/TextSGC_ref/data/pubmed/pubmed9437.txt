This study presents a novel research approach to predict user interaction for social media post using machine learning algorithms. The posts are converted to vector form using word2vec and doc2vec model. These two methods are used to analyse the best approach for generating word embeddings. The generated word embeddings of post combined with other attributes like post published time type of post and total interactions are used to train machine learning algorithms. Deep neural network DNN Extreme Learning Machine ELM and Long Short-Term Memory LSTM are used to compare the prediction of total interaction for a particular post. For word2vec the word vectors are created using both continuous bag-of-words CBOW and skip-gram models. Also the pre-trained word vectors provided by google is used for the analysis. For doc2vec the word embeddings are created using both the Distributed Memory model of Paragraph Vectors PV-DM and Distributed Bag of Words model of Paragraph Vectors PV-DBOW. A word embedding is also created using PV-DBOW combined with skip-gram. Comparative analysis on Facebook post interaction using DNN ELM and LSTM.
