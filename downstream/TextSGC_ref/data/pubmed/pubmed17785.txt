Automatic localization of the standard plane containing complicated anatomical structures in ultrasound US videos remains a challenging problem. In this paper we present a learning-based approach to locate the fetal abdominal standard plane FASP in US videos by constructing a domain transferred deep convolutional neural network CNN. Compared with previous works based on low-level features our approach is able to represent the complicated appearance of the FASP and hence achieve better classification performance. More importantly in order to reduce the overfitting problem caused by the small amount of training samples we propose a transfer learning strategy which transfers the knowledge in the low layers of a base CNN trained from a large database of natural images to our task-specific CNN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method for the FASP localization as well as the CNN only trained on the limited US training samples. The proposed approach can be easily extended to other similar medical image computing problems which often suffer from the insufficient training samples when exploiting the deep CNN to represent high-level features.
