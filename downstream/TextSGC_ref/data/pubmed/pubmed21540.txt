This paper presents a framework to build medical training applications by using virtual reality and a tool that helps the class instantiation of this framework. The main purpose is to make easier the building of virtual reality applications in the medical training area considering systems to simulate biopsy exams and make available deformation collision detection and stereoscopy functionalities. The instantiation of the classes allows quick implementation of the tools for such a purpose thus reducing errors and offering low cost due to the use of open source tools. Using the instantiation tool the process of building applications is fast and easy. Therefore computer programmers can obtain an initial application and adapt it to their needs. This tool allows the user to include delete and edit parameters in the functionalities chosen as well as storing these parameters for future use. In order to verify the efficiency of the framework some case studies are presented. Building a open source framework for virtual medical training.
