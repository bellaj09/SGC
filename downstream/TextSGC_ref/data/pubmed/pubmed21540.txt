"Two brain signal acquisition BSA front-ends incorporating two CMOS ultralow power low-noise amplifier arrays and serializers operating in mosfet weak inversion region are presented. To boost the amplifiers gain for a given current budget cross-coupled-pair active load topology is used in the first stages of these two amplifiers. These two BSA front-ends are fabricated in 130 and 180 nm CMOS processes occupying 5.45 mm 2 and 0.352 mm 2 of die areas respectively excluding pad rings. The CMOS 130-nm amplifier array is comprised of 64 elements where each amplifier element consumes 0.216 W from 0.4 V supply has input-referred noise voltage IRNoise of 2.19 VFormula: see text corresponding to a power efficiency factor PEF of 11.7 and occupies 0.044\xa0mm 2 of die area. The CMOS 180 nm amplifier array employs 4 elements where each element consumes 0.69 W from 0.6 V supply with IRNoise of 2.3 VFormula: see text corresponding to a PEF of 31.3 and 0.051 mm 2 of die area. Noninvasive electroencephalographic and invasive electrocorticographic signals were recorded real time directly on able-bodied human subjects showing feasibility of using these analog front-ends for future fully implantable BSA and brain- computer interface systems."
