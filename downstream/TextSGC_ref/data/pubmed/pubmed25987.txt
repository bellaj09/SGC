Brain-machine interfaces BMIs have been applied as new rehabilitation tools for motor disabled individuals. Active involvement of cerebral activity has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and thus to restore mobility. Various studies have focused on the detection of upper-limb movement intention while the fewer study has investigated the lower-limb movement intention decoding. This study presents a BMI to decode the self-paced lower-limb movement intention with 10 healthy subjects participating in the experiment. We varied four influence factors including the movement type dorsiflexion or plantar flexion the limb side left or right leg the processing method time-series analysis based on MRCP i.e. movement-related cortical potential or frequency-domain estimation based on SMR i.e. sensory motor rhythm and the frequency band e.g. delta theta mu beta and MRCP band at 0.1 1 Hz to estimate both single-trial and sample-based performance. Feature analysis was then conducted to show the discriminant power DP and brain modulations. The average detection latency was -0.334  0.216 s in single-trial basis across all conditions. An average area under the curve AUC of 91.0  3.5% and 68.2  4.6% was obtained for the MRCP-based and SMR-based method in the classification respectively. The best performance was yielded from plantar flexion with left leg using time-series analysis on the MRCP band. The feature analysis indicated a cross-subject consistency of DP with the MRCP-based method and subject-specific variance of DP with the SMR-based method. The results presented here might be further exploited in a rehabilitation scenario. The comprehensive factor analysis might be used to shed light on the design of an effective brain switch to trigger external robotic devices.
