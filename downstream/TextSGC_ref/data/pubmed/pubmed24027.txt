Altered states of consciousness such as psychotic or pharmacologically-induced hallucinations provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms underlying conscious perception. However the phenomenological properties of these states are difficult to isolate experimentally from other more general physiological and cognitive effects of psychoactive substances or psychopathological conditions. Thus simulating phenomenological aspects of altered states in the absence of these other more general effects provides an important experimental tool for consciousness science and psychiatry. Here we describe such a tool which we call the Hallucination Machine. It comprises a novel combination of two powerful technologies: deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs and panoramic videos of natural scenes viewed immersively through a head-mounted display panoramic VR. By doing this we are able to simulate visual hallucinatory experiences in a biologically plausible and ecologically valid way. Two experiments illustrate potential applications of the Hallucination Machine. First we show that the system induces visual phenomenology qualitatively similar to classical psychedelics. In a second experiment we find that simulated hallucinations do not evoke the temporal distortion commonly associated with altered states. Overall the Hallucination Machine offers a valuable new technique for simulating altered phenomenology without directly altering the underlying neurophysiology.
