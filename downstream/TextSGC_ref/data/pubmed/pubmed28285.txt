The local field potentials LFPs underlying specific behavior were recorded and analyzed in this paper from primary motor cortex M1 with several medium such as the self-made single channel micro-electrodes the system of multi-channels physiological signal acquisition and processing and so on. During the experiment the specific behavior was divided into four periods according to the changes of the recorded LFPs and the changes of the specific behavior recorded simultaneously in rats. The four periods were named prophase of catching period planning period catching period and the completion period respectively. Then several methods were used for the analysis of the LFPs by MATLAB such as time domain analysis power spectral distribution analysis and time-frequency analysis. The results suggested that the LFPs which were caused by different behavior from a large number of movement-related neurons of M1 during the specific behavior in the process of catching play an important part in the "code" guiding role in rats. The results demonstrat that the LFPs of M1 may provide a feasibility to discriminate the motor behavior of forelimb. Changes of local field potentials in M1 underlying the specific behavior in rat.
