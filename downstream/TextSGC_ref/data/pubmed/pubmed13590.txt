"The Named Entity Recognition NER task as a key step in the extraction of health information has encountered many challenges in Chinese Electronic Medical Records EMRs. Firstly the casual use of Chinese abbreviations and doctors personal style may result in multiple expressions of the same entity and we lack a common Chinese medical dictionary to perform accurate entity extraction. Secondly the electronic medical record contains entities from a variety of categories of entities and the length of those entities in different categories varies greatly which increases the difficult in the extraction for the Chinese NER. Therefore the entity boundary detection becomes the key to perform accurate entity extraction of Chinese EMRs and we need to develop a model that supports multiple length entity recognition without relying on any medical dictionary." A deep learning model incorporating part of speech and self-matching attention for named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records.
