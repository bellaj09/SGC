Functional connectivity FC is typically altered in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis MS. However in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis RRMS patients the relationship between brain FC tissue integrity and cognitive impairment is still unclear as contradictory findings have been documented. In this exploratory study we compared both the whole brain connectome and resting state networks RSNs FC of twenty-one RRMS and seventeen healthy controls HCs using combined network based statistics and independent component analyses. The total white matter WM lesion volume and information processing efficiency were also correlated with FC in the RRMS group. Both whole brain connectome and individual RSNs FC were diminished in patients with RRMS compared to HC. Additionally the reduction in FC was found to be a function of the total WM lesion volume with greatest impact in those harboring the largest lesion volume. Finally a positive correlation between FC and information processing efficiency was observed in RRMS. This complimentary whole brain and RSNs FC approach can contribute to clarify literature inconsistencies regarding FC alterations and provide new insights on the white matter structural damage in explaining functional abnormalities in RRMS. Alterations in functional connectivity are associated with white matter lesions and information processing efficiency in multiple sclerosis.
