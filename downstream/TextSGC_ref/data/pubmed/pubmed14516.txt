"The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of interleukin 35 IL35 in esophageal carcinoma by comparing the mRNA level in Barretts esophageal mucosa and in matched normal squamous mucosa and to understand how the diagnosis model works with two other genes: hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B HNF1B and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 1 CREB3L1. By comparing carcinoma tissue and normal tissue samples we extracted all the differentially expressed mRNAs. The bioinformatics analysis resulted in the discovery of three prominent genes. Eventually the three genes were utilized to train a deep-learning model. An additional wet experiment was conducted to validate the effect of IL35. All the differentially expressed genes were enriched into nine groups each of which has specific biological functions. Given that the three significant genes HNF1B CREB3L1 and IL35 as diagnostic features a deep-learning model was constructed reaching an accuracy of 93% in the training set and 87% in the test set. Our findings suggest that IL35 along with the other two signatures can distinguish esophageal tumor samples from normal samples precisely."
