In order to explore the application of hyperspectral technology in the pathological diagnosis of tumor tissue we used microscopic hyperspectral imaging technology to establish a hyperspectral database of 30 patients with gastric cancer. Based on the difference in spectral-spatial features between gastric cancer tissue and normal tissue in the wavelength of 410-910 nm we propose a deep-learning model-based analysis method for gastric cancer tissue. The microscopic hyperspectral feature and individual difference of gastric tissue spatial-spectral joint feature and medical contact are studied. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of proposed model for cancerous and normal gastric tissue is 97.57% the sensitivity and specificity of gastric cancer tissue are 97.19% and 97.96% respectively. Compared with the shallow learning method CNN can fully extract the deep spectral-spatial features of tumor tissue. The combination of deep learning model and micro-spectral analysis provides new ideas for the research of medical pathology. Tumor tissue classification based on micro-hyperspectral technology and deep learning.
