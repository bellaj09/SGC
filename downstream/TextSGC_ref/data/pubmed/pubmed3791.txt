The human brain is a large interacting dynamic network and its architecture of coupling among brain regions varies across time termed the "chronnectome". However very little is known about whether and how the dynamic properties of the chronnectome can characterize individual uniqueness such as identifying individuals as a "fingerprint" of the brain. Here we employed multiband resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project N\u2009=\u2009105 and a sliding time-window dynamic network analysis approach to systematically examine individual time-varying properties of the chronnectome. We revealed stable and remarkable individual variability in three dynamic characteristics of brain connectivity i.e. strength stability and variability which was mainly distributed in three higher order cognitive systems i.e. default mode dorsal attention and fronto-parietal and in two primary systems i.e. visual and sensorimotor. Intriguingly the spatial patterns of these dynamic characteristics of brain connectivity could successfully identify individuals with high accuracy and could further significantly predict individual higher cognitive performance e.g. fluid intelligence and executive function which was primarily contributed by the higher order cognitive systems. Together our findings highlight that the chronnectome captures inherent functional dynamics of individual brain networks and provides implications for individualized characterization of health and disease.
