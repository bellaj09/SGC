In this paper a new vector phase diagram differentiating the initial decreasing phase i.e. initial dip and the delayed hemodynamic response HR phase of oxy-hemoglobin changes   HbO of functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is developed. The vector phase diagram displays the trajectories of  HbO and deoxy-hemoglobin changes   HbR as orthogonal components in the  HbO-  HbR polar coordinates. To determine the occurrence of an initial dip dual threshold circles an inner circle from the resting state an outer circle from the peak values of the initial dip and the main HR are incorporated into the phase diagram for making decisions. The proposed scheme is then applied to a brain-computer interface scheme and its performance is evaluated in classifying two finger tapping tasks right-hand thumb and little finger from the left motor cortex. Three gamma functions are used to model the initial dip the main HR and the undershoot in generating the designed HR function. In classifying two tapping tasks the signal mean and signal minimum values during 0-2.5  s as features of initial dip are used. The linear discriminant analysis was utilized as a classifier. The experimental results show that the active brain locations of the two tasks were quite distinctive  p < 0.05  and moreover spatially specific if using the initial dip map at 4  s in comparison to the map of HRs at 14  s. Also the average classification accuracy was improved from 59% to 74.9% when using the phase diagram of dual threshold circles.
