"Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired disability leaving numerous adults with cognitive and motor impairments and affecting patients capability to live independently. There is substancial evidence on post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation benefits but its implementation is generally limited by the use of paper-and-pencil methods insufficient personalization and suboptimal intensity. Virtual reality tools have shown potential for improving cognitive rehabilitation by supporting carefully personalized ecologically valid tasks through accessible technologies. Notwithstanding important progress in VR-based cognitive rehabilitation systems specially with Activities of Daily Living ADLs simulations there is still a need of more clinical trials for its validation. In this work we present a one-month randomized controlled trial with 18 stroke in and outpatients from two rehabilitation units: 9 performing a VR-based intervention and 9 performing conventional rehabilitation." Benefits of virtual reality based cognitive rehabilitation through simulated activities of daily living: a randomized controlled trial with stroke patients.
