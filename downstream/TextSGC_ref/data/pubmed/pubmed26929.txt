Wireless brain-computer interfaces BCIs are used to study neural activity in freely moving non-human primates NHPs. However the high energy consumption of conventional active radios is proving to be an obstacle as research drives for wireless BCIs that can provide continuous high-rate data uplinks for longer durations i.e. multiple days. We present a differential quadrature phase shift keying DQPSK backscatter uplink for the NeuroDisc BCI as an alternative to active radios. The uplink achieves a 25\xa0Mbps throughput while operating in the 915\xa0MHz industrial scientific and medical ISM band. The DQPSK backscatter modulator was measured to have an error-vector magnitude EVM of 9.7% and a measured power consumption of 309\xa0 W during continuous full-rate transmissions yielding an analog communication efficiency of 12.4\xa0pJ/bit. The NeuroDisc is capable of recording 16 channels of neural data with 16-bit resolution at up to 20\xa0kSps per channel with a measured input-referred noise of 2.35\xa0 V. In previous work we demonstrated the DQPSK backscatter uplink but bandwidth constraints in the signal chain limited the uplink rate to 6.25\xa0Mbps and the neural sampling rate to 5\xa0kSps. This work provides new innovations to increase the bandwidth of the system including an ultra-high frequency UHF antenna design with a -10\xa0dB return loss bandwidth of 12.5\xa0MHz and a full-duplex receiver with an average self-jammer cancellation of 89\xa0dB. We present end-to-end characterization of the NeuroDisc and validate the backscatter uplink using pre-recorded neural data as well as in vivo recordings from a pigtail macaque.
