Although the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 COVID-19 it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RNAaemia could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. However it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load RNAaemia is closely correlated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 IL-6 level in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
