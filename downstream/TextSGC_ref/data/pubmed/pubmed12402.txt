Many injuries from recent wars involve extremity trauma secondary to blasts which predispose patients to developing extremity compartment syndrome. In military studies 17% of fasciotomies required revision on arrival to a Role 4 hospital and 41% of these had missed compartments which is similar to that seen in civilian centers. While training has decreased this rate to 8% this number is still too high. We conducted a focused needs assessment to guide the development of lower-extremity fasciotomy training.
