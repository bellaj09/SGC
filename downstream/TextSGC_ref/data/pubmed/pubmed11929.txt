The early identification of malignant pulmonary nodules is critical for a better lung cancer prognosis and less invasive chemo or radio therapies. Nodule malignancy assessment done by radiologists is extremely useful for planning a preventive intervention but is unfortunately a complex time-consuming and error-prone task. This explains the lack of large datasets containing radiologists malignancy characterization of nodules; METHODS: In this article we propose to assess nodule malignancy through 3D convolutional neural networks and to integrate it in an automated end-to-end existing pipeline of lung cancer detection. For training and testing purposes we used independent subsets of the LIDC dataset; RESULTS: Adding the probabilities of nodules malignity in a baseline lung cancer pipeline improved its F1-weighted score by 14.7% whereas integrating the malignancy model itself using transfer learning outperformed the baseline prediction by 11.8% of F1-weighted score; CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited size of the lung cancer datasets integrating predictive models of nodule malignancy improves prediction of lung cancer. Integration of convolutional neural networks for pulmonary nodule malignancy assessment in a lung cancer classification pipeline.
