This paper presents a novel virtual reality navigation VRN input device called the VRNChair offering an intuitive and natural way to interact with virtual reality VR environments. Traditionally VR navigation tests are performed using stationary input devices such as keyboards or joysticks. However in case of immersive VR environment experiments such as our recent VRN assessment the user may feel kinetosis motion sickness as a result of the disagreement between vestibular response and the optical flow. In addition experience in using a joystick or any of the existing computer input devices may cause a bias in the accuracy of participant performance in VR environment experiments. Therefore we have designed a VR navigational environment that is operated using a wheelchair VRNChair. The VRNChair translates the movement of a manual wheelchair to feed any VR environment. We evaluated the VRNChair by testing on 34 young individuals in two groups performing the same navigational task with either the VRNChair or a joystick; also one older individual 55 years performed the same experiment with both a joystick and the VRNChair. The results indicate that the VRNChair does not change the accuracy of the performance; thus removing the plausible bias of having experience using a joystick. More importantly it significantly reduces the effect of kinetosis. While we developed VRNChair for our spatial cognition study its application can be in many other studies involving neuroscience neurorehabilitation physiotherapy and/or simply the gaming industry.
