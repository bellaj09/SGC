Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties including repetitive patterns of behavior known as stereotypical motor movements SMM. So far several techniques have been implemented to track and identify SMMs. In this context we propose a deep learning approach for SMM recognition namely convolutional neural networks CNN in time and frequency-domains. To solve the intrasubject SMM variability we propose a robust CNN model for SMM detection within subjects whose parameters are set according to a proper analysis of SMM signals thereby outperforming state-of-the-art SMM classification works. And to solve the intersubject variability we propose a global fast and light-weight framework for SMM detection across subjects which combines a knowledge transfer technique with an SVM classifier therefore resolving the "real-life" medical issue associated with the lack of supervised SMMs per testing subject in particular. We further show that applying transfer learning across domains instead of transfer learning within the same domain also generalizes to the SMM target domain thus alleviating the problem of the lack of supervised SMMs in general.
