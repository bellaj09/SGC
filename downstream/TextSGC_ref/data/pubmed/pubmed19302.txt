"Memory complaints of patients sometimes are not verified via standard cognitive testing. Acquisition of information in everyday life requires memorization in complex three-dimensional environments. The authors mimicked this with a photorealistic virtual environment VE. Memory for verbal material and spatial scenery was tested in healthy controls HC and patients with mild Alzheimers disease AD; mini-mental state evaluation MMSE 25.7  1.8 mean  standard deviation. The number of memorized items increased to 90% in both classical list learning and for items memorized in VE in HC. In contrast only 40% of items were recalled in list learning and 20% in VE in AD patients. Unlike the gender difference favoring female HC on list learning performance was alike for both genders in VE. We conclude that verbal learning abilities in healthy elderly subjects are alike in standard settings and under virtual reality conditions. In AD patients memory deficits that are relevant to everyday life yet not detectable with list learning are unmasked in virtual reality. In future this may aid objective appraisal of interventions with regard to their everyday relevance." "Everyday memory deficits in very mild Alzheimers disease."
