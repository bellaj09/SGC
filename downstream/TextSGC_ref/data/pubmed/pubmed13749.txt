"Acute e.g. traumatic brain injury or stroke and chronic e.g. dementia or Parkinsons disease dementia neurological disorders that involve cognitive impairment and dysfunctional neural circuits always lead to a dreadful and costly experience for patients and their families. The application of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders has shown great potential to modulate pathological neural circuits and trigger endogenous neurogenesis. We summarize several important clinical and translational studies that utilize deep brain stimulation to improve cognition based on the potentiation of neural plasticity and neurogenesis. In addition we discuss the neuroanatomy and cerebral circuits implicated in such studies as well as the potential mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefits."
