High-frequency oscillations HFOs are spontaneous magnetoencephalography MEG patterns that have been acknowledged as a putative biomarker to identify epileptic foci. Correct detection of HFOs in the MEG signals is crucial for the accurate and timely clinical evaluation. Since the visual examination of HFOs is time-consuming error-prone and with poor inter-reviewer reliability an automatic HFOs detector is highly desirable in clinical practice. However the existing approaches for HFOs detection may not be applicable for MEG signals with noisy background activity. Therefore we employ the stacked sparse autoencoder SSAE and propose an SSAE-based MEG HFOs SMO detector to facilitate the clinical detection of HFOs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to conduct HFOs detection in MEG using deep learning methods. After configuration optimization our proposed SMO detector is outperformed other classic peer models by achieving 89.9% in accuracy 88.2% in sensitivity and 91.6% in specificity. Furthermore we have tested the performance consistency of our model using various validation schemes. The distribution of performance metrics demonstrates that our model can achieve steady performance.
