A deep learning approach has been taken to improve detection characteristics of surface plasmon microscopy SPM of light scattering. Deep learning based on the convolutional neural network algorithm was used to estimate the effect of scattering parameters mainly the number of scatterers. The improvement was assessed on a quantitative basis by applying the approach to SPM images formed by coherent interference of scatterers. It was found that deep learning significantly improves the accuracy over conventional detection: the enhancement in the accuracy was shown to be significantly higher by almost 6 times and useful for scattering by polydisperse mixtures. This suggests that deep learning can be used to find scattering objects effectively in the noisy environment. Furthermore deep learning can be extended directly to label-free molecular detection assays and provide considerably improved detection in imaging and microscopy techniques.
