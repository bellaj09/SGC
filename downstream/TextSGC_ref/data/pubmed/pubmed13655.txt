In the recent years machine learning algorithms have been more widely and increasingly applied in biomedical fields. In particular their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry for instance as diagnostic tests/tools for autism spectrum disorder ASD. However given their complexity and potential clinical implications there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy.
