The literature is not univocal about the effects of Peer Review PR within the context of constructivist learning. Due to the predominant focus on using PR as an assessment tool rather than a constructivist learning activity and because most studies implicitly assume that the benefits of PR are limited to the reviewee little is known about the effects upon students who are required to review their peers. Much of the theoretical debate in the literature is focused on explaining how and why constructivist learning is beneficial. At the same time these discussions are marked by an underlying presupposition of a causal relationship between reviewing and deep learning. Does reviewing lead to better learning and decision making?
