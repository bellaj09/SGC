"While some evidence-based vocational studies exist for adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD most focus on social interaction. This mixed methods exploratory study investigated a multimedia approach to training ASD adults as a strategy for increasing self-efficacy and producing positive training outcomes during the anticipatory socialization and encounter phases of organizational assimilation. Ten ASD adults seven men and three women 19 to 42 years of age participated in the study which utilized video and virtual reality to instruct participants on how to wire an electrical socket. Significant increases in the participants self-efficacy were found using a modified version of the New General Self-Efficacy NGSE scale. In addition a thematic analysis of post-training comments showed that participants overall were engaged and had fun during the training. These findings suggest that a multimedia approach may be an effective strategy for achieving positive outcomes by increasing self-efficacy and engagement when training newly hired employees diagnosed with ASD to perform vocational tasks."
