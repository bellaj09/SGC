The 3D reconstruction of coronary artery from X-ray angiograms rotationally acquired on C-arm has great clinical value. While cardiac-gated reconstruction has shown promising results it suffers from the problem of residual motion. This work proposed a new local motion-compensated reconstruction method to handle this issue. An initial image was firstly reconstructed using a regularized iterative reconstruction method. Then a 3D/2D registration method was proposed to estimate the residual vessel motion. Finally the residual motion was compensated in the final reconstruction using the extended iterative reconstruction method. Through quantitative evaluation it was found that high-quality 3D reconstruction could be obtained and the result was comparable to state-of-the-art method. Local motion-compensated method for high-quality 3D coronary artery reconstruction.
