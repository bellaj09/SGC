"Ketamine acts as a rapid clinical antidepressant at 25\u2009min after injection with effects sustained for 7 days. As dissociative effects emerging acutely after injection are not entirely discernible from therapeutic action we aimed to dissect the differences between short-term and long-term response to ketamine to elucidate potential imaging biomarkers of ketamines antidepressant effect. We used a genetical model of depression in which we bred depressed negative cognitive state NC and non-depressed positive cognitive state PC rat strains. Four parallel rat groups underwent stress-escape testing and a week later received either S-ketamine 12 NC 13 PC or saline 12 NC 12 PC. We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging time series before injection and at 30\u2009min and 48\u2009h after injection. Graph analysis was used to calculate brain network properties. We identified ketamines distinct action over time in a qualitative manner. The rapid response entailed robust and strain-independent topological modifications in cognitive sensory emotion and reward-related circuitry including regions that exhibited correlation of connectivity metrics with depressive behavior and which could explain ketamines dissociative and antidepressant properties. At 48\u2009h ketamine had mainly strain-specific action normalizing habenula midline thalamus and hippocampal connectivity measures in depressed rats. As these nodes mediate cognitive flexibility impaired in depression action within this circuitry presumably reflects ketamines procognitive effects induced only in depressed patients. This finding is especially valid as our model represents cognitive aspects of depression. These empirically defined circuits explain ketamines distinct action over time and might serve as translational imaging correlates of antidepressant response in preclinical testing."
