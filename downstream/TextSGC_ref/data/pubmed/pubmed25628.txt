"Previous studies have identified two powerful ways to regulate emotional responses to a stressor: experiencing incidental positive emotions and using cognitive reappraisal to reframe the stressor. Several cognitive and motivational theories of positive emotion support the formulation that incidental positive emotions may facilitate cognitive reappraisal. To test the separate and interacting effects of positive emotions and cognitive reappraisal we first adapted an established picture-based reappraisal paradigm by interspersing blocks of positive emotion inducing and neutral pictures. Across two pre-registered studies Studies 1 2 reappraisal effectively decreased self-reported negative emotions and increased self-reported positive emotions; however experiencing incidental positive emotions did not facilitate reappraisal success. In another preregistered study Study 3 we employed a more powerful positive emotion induction via virtual reality VR used a social stress anticipation task and instructed participants to reappraise the anticipated stressor positively. Although there was a robust effect of the positive emotion induction relative to the neutral induction on feeling more positive emotions throughout stress anticipation the results again indicated that incidental positive emotions did not facilitate cognitive reappraisal. We propose that incidental positive emotions and cognitive reappraisal may constitute separate pathways of influence when regulating ones responses to negative events."
