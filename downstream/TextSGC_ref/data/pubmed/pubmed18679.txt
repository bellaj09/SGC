The uncanny valley hypothesis Mori 1970 predicts differential experience of negative and positive affect as a function of human likeness. Affective experience of humanlike robots and computer-generated characters avatars dominates "uncanny" research but findings are inconsistent. Importantly it is unknown how objects are actually perceived along the hypothesis\ dimension of human likeness DOH defined in terms of human physical similarity. To examine whether the DOH can also be defined in terms of effects of categorical perception CP stimuli from morph continua with controlled differences in physical human likeness between avatar and human faces as endpoints were presented. Two behavioral studies found a sharp category boundary along the DOH and enhanced visual discrimination i.e. CP of fine-grained differences between pairs of faces at the category boundary. Discrimination was better for face pairs presenting category change in the human-to-avatar than avatar-to-human direction along the DOH. To investigate brain representation of physical change and category change along the DOH an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study used the same stimuli in a pair-repetition priming paradigm. Bilateral mid-fusiform areas and a different right mid-fusiform area were sensitive to physical change within the human and avatar categories respectively whereas entirely different regions were sensitive to the human-to-avatar caudate head putamen thalamus red nucleus and avatar-to-human hippocampus amygdala mid-insula direction of category change. These findings show that Mori\s DOH definition does not reflect subjective perception of human likeness and suggest that future "uncanny" studies consider CP and the DOH\s category structure in guiding experience of non-human objects. The human likeness dimension of the "uncanny valley hypothesis": behavioral and functional MRI findings.
