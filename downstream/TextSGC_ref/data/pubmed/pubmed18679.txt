Training medical providers to care for traumatically injured patients is a difficult undertaking and currently used training strategies are often suboptimal. The further strains placed on trauma care in the military environment only add to the challenge. Simulation applications ranging from simple physical models to complex computer-based virtual reality systems have either been developed or are being developed to help support and improve trauma care training. Several of these applications have been shown to be as good as or better than the standard training methods they are designed to replace. Simulators are available for training in the treatment of disorders of the airway difficulty with breathing and problems dealing with circulation as well as various non-life-threatening but disabling injuries. Some of these simulators have already drastically changed how the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support course is taught. Advances in both technology and application of simulators will continue to affect trauma skills training for the foreseeable future. Simulation for trauma and combat casualty care.
