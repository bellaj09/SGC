Three dimensional 3D limb motion trajectory is predictable with a non-invasive brain-computer interface BCI. To date most non-invasive motion trajectory prediction BCIs use potential values of electroencephalographic EEG signals as the input to a multiple linear regression mLR based kinetic data estimator. We investigated the possible improvement in accuracy of 3D hand movement prediction i.e. the correlation of registered and reconstructed hand velocities by replacing raw EEG potentials with spectrum power values of specific EEG bands. We also investigated if a non-linear neural network based estimator outperformed the mLR approach. The spectrum power model provided significantly higher accuracy R~0.60 compared to the similar EEG potentials based approach R~0.45. Additionally when replacing the mLR based kinetic data estimation module with a feed-forward neural network NN we found the NN based spectrum power model provided higher accuracy R~0.70 compared to the similar mLR based approach R~0.60.
