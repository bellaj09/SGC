Single-particle cryoelectron microscopy cryo-EM continues to grow into a mainstream structural biology technique. Recent developments in data collection strategies alongside new sample preparation devices herald a future where users will collect multiple datasets per microscope session. To make cryo-EM data processing more automatic and user-friendly we have developed an automatic pipeline for cryo-EM data preprocessing and assessment using a combination of deep-learning and image-analysis tools. We have verified the performance of this pipeline on a number of datasets and extended its scope to include sample screening by the user-free assessment of the qualities of a series of datasets under different conditions. We propose that our workflow provides a decision-free solution for cryo-EM making data preprocessing more generalized and robust in the high-throughput era as well as more convenient for users from a range of backgrounds.
