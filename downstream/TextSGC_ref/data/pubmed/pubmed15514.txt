Extreme skeletal muscle atrophy is rampant in astronauts exposed to extended periods of microgravity muG and it is one of the main problems in human space exploration. A "Hybrid training" HYB method utilizing combined electrical stimulation and voluntary muscle contraction has been developed as a possible solution. A wearable HYB device and a virtual reality VR system were developed for use in space and were verified at muG generated by parabolic flight PF. A 36-year-old male subject performed HYB of reciprocal flexion and extension as a knee joint exercise training in a seated position at 1G 2G and muG. The wearable HYB device and VR system developed for the study functioned well during the flight. However knee extension was insufficient at 1G and 2G and the maximum knee extension angles at 1G and 2G were smaller than at muG. The extension velocity in the latter half of each motion was slower than in the first half at 1G and 2G but no difference in velocity was observed at muG. The subject could extend the knee joint sufficiently and keep a constant extension velocity because his legs were weightless at muG. The congruity between the subject\s actual joint motions and instructed joint motions during muG was improved when VR was employed with or without body fixation; accordingly the subject was able to perform the desired joint motion. The VR system improved HYB exercise performance at muG during PF. HYB is considered a useful training method for future human space exploration.
