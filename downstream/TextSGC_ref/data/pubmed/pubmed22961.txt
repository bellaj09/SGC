The Si elegans platform targets the complete virtualization of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its environment. This paper presents a suite of unified web-based Graphical User Interfaces GUIs as the main user interaction point and discusses their underlying technologies and methods. The user-friendly features of this tool suite enable users to graphically create neuron and network models and behavioral experiments without requiring knowledge of domain-specific computer-science tools. The framework furthermore allows the graphical visualization of all simulation results using a worm locomotion and neural activity viewer. Models experiment definitions and results can be exported in a machine-readable format thereby facilitating reproducible and cross-platform execution of in silico C. elegans experiments in other simulation environments. This is made possible by a novel XML-based behavioral experiment definition encoding format a NeuroML XML-based model generation and network configuration description language and their associated GUIs. User survey data confirms the platform usability and functionality and provides insights into future directions for web-based simulation GUIs of C. elegans and other living organisms. The tool suite is available online to the scientific community and its source code has been made available.
