Differential phase-contrast computed tomography DPC-CT is a powerful analysis tool for soft-tissue and low-atomic-number samples. Limited by the implementation conditions DPC-CT with incomplete projections happens quite often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms face difficulty when given incomplete data. They usually involve complicated parameter selection operations which are also sensitive to noise and are time-consuming. In this paper we report a new deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data DPC-CT. It involves the tight coupling of the deep learning neural network and DPC-CT reconstruction algorithm in the domain of DPC projection sinograms. The estimated result is not an artifact caused by the incomplete data but a complete phase-contrast projection sinogram. After training this framework is determined and can be used to reconstruct the final DPC-CT images for a given incomplete projection sinogram. Taking the sparse-view limited-view and missing-view DPC-CT as examples this framework is validated and demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data sets. Compared with other methods our framework can achieve the best imaging quality at a faster speed and with fewer parameters. This work supports the application of the state-of-the-art deep learning theory in the field of DPC-CT.
