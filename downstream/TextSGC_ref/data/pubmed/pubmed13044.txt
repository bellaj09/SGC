"While the number and structural features of white blood cells WBC can provide important information about the health status of human beings the ratio of sub-types of these cells and the deformations that can be observed serve as a good indicator in the diagnosis process of some diseases. Hence correct identification and classification of the WBC types is of great importance. In addition the fact that the diagnostic process that is carried out manually is slow and the success is directly proportional to the experts skills makes this problem an excellent field of application for computer-aided diagnostic systems. Unfortunately both the ethical reasons and the cost of image acquisition process is one of the biggest obstacles to the fact that researchers working with medical images are able to collect enough data to produce a stable model. For that reasons researchers who want to perform a successful analysis with small data sets using classical machine learning methods need to undergo their data a long and error-prone pre-process while those using deep learning methods need to increase the data size using augmentation techniques. As a result there is a need for a model that does not need pre-processing and can perform a successful classification in small data sets." Classification of white blood cells using capsule networks.
