We propose a deep learning-based restoration method to remove honeycomb patterns and improve resolution for fiber bundle FB images. By building and calibrating a dual-sensor imaging system we capture FB images and corresponding ground truth data to train the network. Images without fiber bundle fixed patterns are restored from raw FB images as direct inputs and spatial resolution is significantly enhanced for the trained sample type. We also construct the brightness mapping between the two image types for the effective use of all data providing the ability to output images of the expected brightness. We evaluate our framework with data obtained from lens tissues and human histological specimens using both objective and subjective measures. Fiber bundle image restoration using deep learning.
