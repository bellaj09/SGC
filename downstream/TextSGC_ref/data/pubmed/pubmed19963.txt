A significant proportion of severe psychological problems in recent large-scale peacekeeping operations underscores the importance of effective methods for strengthening the stress resilience. Virtual reality VR adaptive stimulation based on the estimation of the participant\s emotional state from physiological signals may enhance the mental readiness training MRT. Understanding neurobiological mechanisms by which the MRT based on VR adaptive stimulation can affect the resilience to stress is important for practical application in the stress resilience management. After the delivery of a traumatic audio-visual stimulus in the VR the cascade of events occurs in the brain which evokes various physiological manifestations. In addition to the "limbic" emotional and visceral brain circuitry other large-scale sensory cognitive and memory brain networks participate with less known impact in this physiological response. The MRT based on VR adaptive stimulation may strengthen the stress resilience through targeted brain-body interactions. Integrated interdisciplinary efforts which would integrate the brain imaging and the proposed approach may contribute to clarifying the neurobiological foundation of the resilience to stress. Virtual reality adaptive stimulation of limbic networks in the mental readiness training.
