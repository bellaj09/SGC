Automated segmentation of the portal vein PV for liver radiotherapy planning is a challenging task due to potentially low vasculature contrast complex PV anatomy and image artifacts originated from fiducial markers and vasculature stents. In this paper we propose a novel framework for automated segmentation of the PV from computed tomography CT images. We apply convolutional neural networks CNNs to learn the consistent appearance patterns of the PV using a training set of CT images with reference annotations and then enhance the PV in previously unseen CT images. Markov random fields MRFs were further used to smooth the results of the enhancement of the CNN enhancement and remove isolated mis-segmented regions. Finally CNN-MRF-based enhancement was augmented with PV centerline detection that relied on PV anatomical properties such as tubularity and branch composition. The framework was validated on a clinical database with 72 CT images of patients scheduled for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy. The obtained accuracy of the segmentation was Formula: see text 0.83 and Formula: see text 1.08\u2009mm in terms of the median Dice coefficient and mean symmetric surface distance respectively when segmentation is encompassed into the PV region of interest. The obtained results indicate that CNNs and anatomical analysis can be used for the accurate segmentation of the PV and potentially integrated into liver radiation therapy planning. Combining deep learning with anatomical analysis for segmentation of the portal vein for liver SBRT planning.
