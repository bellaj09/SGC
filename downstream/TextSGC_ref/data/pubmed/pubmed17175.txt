"In this article I argue that an awareness of the study episode that arises involuntarily during an implicit stem/fragment completion test can under some conditions lead to enhanced repetition priming effects even though subjects are not engaged in intentional retrieval. I review findings that are consistent with this possibility which include the effects of depth of processing and of typography match and new association priming following deep encoding. A theoretical account of involuntary aware memory couched within Moscovitchs 1995b memory systems framework which suggests that the medial-temporal lobe/hippocampal MTL/H complex functions as a memory module is outlined. A putative mechanism is proposed in which involuntary aware memory of a studied item enhances the size of repetition priming effects by guiding its selection in preference to the competitors." The role of involuntary aware memory in the implicit stem and fragment completion tasks: a selective review.
