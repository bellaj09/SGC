Efficient viral vectors for mapping and manipulating long-projection neuronal circuits are crucial in structural and functional studies of the brain. The SAD strain rabies virus with the glycoprotein gene deleted pseudotyped with the N2C glycoprotein SAD-RVG-N2CG shows strong neuro-tropism in cell culture but its in vivo efficiency for retrograde gene transduction and neuro-tropism have not been systematically characterized. We compared these features in different mouse brain regions for SAD-RV-N2CG and two other widely-used retrograde tracers SAD-RVG-B19G and rAAV2-retro. We found that SAD-RVG-N2CG enhanced the infection efficiency of long-projecting neurons by ~10 times but with very similar neuro-tropism compared with SAD-RVG-B19G. On the other hand SAD-RVG-N2CG had an infection efficiency comparable with rAAV2-retro but a more restricted diffusion range and broader tropism to different types and regions of long-projecting neuronal populations. These results demonstrate that SAD-RVG-N2CG can serve as an effective retrograde vector for studying neuronal circuits.
