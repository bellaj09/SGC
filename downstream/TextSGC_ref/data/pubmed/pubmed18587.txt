Background: Virtual Reality VR is acquiring increasing credibility as a tool for teaching independent living skills to people with Intellectual Disability ID. Generalization of skills acquired during VR training into real environment seems to be feasible. Objective: To assess feasibility and verify effectiveness of a remote home-based rehabilitation focused on functional living skills for adolescents and young adults with ID by using virtual apps installed on tablets. In particular to assess if this tool can be managed independently if it is enjoyable and simple to be used and if the acquired skills can be generalized to the real environment of everyday life. Subjects and method: A single group pre- and post-test research design was used. Sixteen participants with ID were included. A digital system was arranged with a server managing communication between the database and the apps installed on tablets. In vivo tests were performed before and after the eleven sessions of VR training. Satisfaction questionnaires were also administered. Results: Statistically significant improvements were found between the pre- and post-in vivo tests as well as between the VR training sessions in almost all the parameters taken into account for each app. Final questionnaires showed a good satisfaction level for both the participants and their families. Conclusion: The highly technological system was managed independently by participants with ID who found it simple to be used useful and even fun; generalization across settings was obtained. Results obtained require to be confirmed by future controlled studies with larger samples.
