It has been documented that due to limited attentional resources the size of the attentional focus is inversely correlated with processing efficiency. Moreover by adopting a variety of two-dimensional size illusions induced by pictorial depth cues e.g. the Ponzo illusion previous studies have revealed that the perceived rather than the retinal size of an object determines its detection. It remains unclear however whether and how the retinal versus perceived size of a cue influences the process of attentional orienting to subsequent targets and whether the corresponding influencing processes differ between two-dimensional 2-D and three-dimensional 3-D space. In the present study we incorporated the dot probe paradigm with either a 2-D Ponzo illusion induced by pictorial depth cues or a virtual 3-D world in which the Ponzo illusion turned into visual reality. By varying the retinal size of the cue while keeping its perceived size constant Exp. 1 we found that a cue with smaller retinal size significantly facilitated attentional orienting as compared to a cue with larger retinal size and that the effects were comparable between 2-D and 3-D displays. Furthermore when the pictorial background was removed and the cue display was positioned in either the farther or the closer depth plane Exp. 2 or when both the depth and the background were removed Exp. 3 the retinal size rather than the depth of the cue still affected attentional orienting. Taken together our results suggest that the retinal size of a cue plays the crucial role in the visuospatial orienting of attention in both 2-D and 3-D.
