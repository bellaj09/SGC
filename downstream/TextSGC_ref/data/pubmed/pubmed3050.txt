Neuroimaging studies have identified functional interactions between the thalamus precuneus and default mode network DMN in studies of consciousness. However less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging DTI to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest ROIs in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity RSFC among the precuneus thalamus and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus where connection fractional anisotropy FA increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus mPFC sFG and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus precuneus and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity such as between the precuneus and AG may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.
