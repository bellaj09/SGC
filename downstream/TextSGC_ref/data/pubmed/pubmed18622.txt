Virtual reality simulation in surgical training has become more widely used and intensely investigated in an effort to develop safer more efficient measurable training processes. The development of virtual reality simulation of surgical procedures has begun but well-described technical obstacles must be overcome to permit varied training in a clinically realistic computer-generated environment. These challenges include development of realistic surgical interfaces and physical objects within the computer-generated environment modeling of realistic interactions between objects rendering of the surgical field and development of signal processing for complex events associated with surgery. Of these the realistic modeling of tissue objects that are fully responsive to surgical manipulations is the most challenging. Threats to early success include relatively limited resources for development and procurement as well as smaller potential for return on investment than in other simulation industries that face similar problems. Despite these difficulties steady progress continues to be made in these areas. If executed properly virtual reality offers inherent advantages over other training systems in creating a realistic surgical environment and facilitating measurement of surgeon performance. Once developed complex new virtual reality training devices must be validated for their usefulness in formative training and assessment of skill to be established.
