Wearable devices have evolved as screening tools for atrial fibrillation AF. A photoplethysmographic PPG AF detection algorithm was developed and applied to a convenient smartphone-based device with good accuracy. However patients with paroxysmal AF frequently exhibit premature atrial complexes PACs which result in poor unmanned AF detection mainly because of rule-based or handcrafted machine learning techniques that are limited in terms of diagnostic accuracy and reliability.
