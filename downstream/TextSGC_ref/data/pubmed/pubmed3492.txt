Identifying the genotypes underlying human disease phenotypes is a fundamental step in human genetics and medicine. High-throughput genomic technologies provide thousands of genetic variants per individual. The causal genes of a specific phenotype are usually expected to be functionally close to each other. According to this hypothesis candidate genes are picked from high-throughput data on the basis of their biological proximity to core genes - genes already known to be responsible for the phenotype. There is currently no effective gene-centric online interface for this purpose. HGCS: an online tool for prioritizing disease-causing gene variants by biological distance.
