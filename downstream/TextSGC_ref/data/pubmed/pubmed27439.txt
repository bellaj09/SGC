Electroencephalogram- EEG- based brain-computer interface BCI systems usually utilize one type of changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations for control such as event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/ERS steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP and P300 evoked potentials. There is a recent trend to detect more than one of these signals in one system to create a hybrid BCI. However in this case EEG data were always divided into groups and analyzed by the separate processing procedures. As a result the interactive effects were ignored when different types of BCI tasks were executed simultaneously. In this work we propose an improved tensor based multiclass multimodal scheme especially for hybrid BCI in which EEG signals are denoted as multiway tensors a nonredundant rank-one tensor decomposition model is proposed to obtain nonredundant tensor components a weighted fisher criterion is designed to select multimodal discriminative patterns without ignoring the interactive effects and support vector machine SVM is extended to multiclass classification. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can not only identify the different changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations induced by different types of tasks but also capture the interactive effects of simultaneous tasks properly. Therefore it has great potential use for hybrid BCI. EEG Classification for Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface Using a Tensor Based Multiclass Multimodal Analysis Scheme.
