As one of the most common human helminths hookworm is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity which seriously threatens human health. Recently wireless capsule endoscopy WCE has been applied to automatic hookworm detection. Unfortunately it remains a challenging task. In recent years deep convolutional neural network CNN has demonstrated impressive performance in various image and video analysis tasks. In this paper a novel deep hookworm detection framework is proposed for WCE images which simultaneously models visual appearances and tubular patterns of hookworms. This is the first deep learning framework specifically designed for hookworm detection in WCE images. Two CNN networks namely edge extraction network and hookworm classification network are seamlessly integrated in the proposed framework which avoid the edge feature caching and speed up the classification. Two edge pooling layers are introduced to integrate the tubular regions induced from edge extraction network and the feature maps from hookworm classification network leading to enhanced feature maps emphasizing the tubular regions. Experiments have been conducted on one of the largest WCE datasets with WCE images which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hookworm detection framework. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The high sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed method in detecting hookworms shows its potential for clinical application.
