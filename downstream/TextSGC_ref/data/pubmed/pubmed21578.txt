Segmentation of MRI scans is a critical part of the workflow process before we can further analyze neuroimaging data. Although there are several automatic tools for segmentation no segmentation software is perfectly accurate and manual correction by visually inspecting the segmentation errors is required. The process of correcting these errors is tedious and time-consuming so we present a novel method of performing this task in a head-mounted virtual reality interactive system with a new software Virtual Brain Segmenter VBS. We provide the results of user testing on 30 volunteers to show the benefits of our tool as a more efficient intuitive and engaging alternative compared with the current method of correcting segmentation errors.
