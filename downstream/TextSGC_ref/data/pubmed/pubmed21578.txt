A fully automated and online artifact removal method for the electroencephalogram EEG is developed for use in brain-computer interfacing BCI. The method FORCe is based upon a novel combination of wavelet decomposition independent component analysis and thresholding. FORCe is able to operate on a small channel set during online EEG acquisition and does not require additional signals e.g. electrooculogram signals. Evaluation of FORCe is performed offline on EEG recorded from 13 BCI particpants with cerebral palsy CP and online with three healthy participants. The method outperforms the state-of the-art automated artifact removal methods Lagged Auto-Mutual Information Clustering LAMIC and Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection FASTER and is able to remove a wide range of artifact types including blink electromyogram EMG and electrooculogram EOG artifacts.
