"Brain regions with high connectivity have high metabolic cost and their disruption is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified at the group-level local functional connectivity density  L: FCD hubs network nodes with high degree of connectivity with neighboring regions in occipito-parietal cortices. However the individual patterns and the precision for the location of the hubs were limited by the restricted spatiotemporal resolution of the magnetic resonance imaging MRI measures collected at rest. In this work we show that MRI datasets with higher spatiotemporal resolution 2-mm isotropic; 0.72 s collected under the Human Connectome Project HCP provide a significantly higher precision for hub localization and for the first time reveal L: FCD patterns with gray matter GM specificity >96% and sensitivity >75%. High temporal resolution allowed effective 0.01-0.08 Hz band-pass filtering significantly reducing spurious L: FCD effects in white matter. These high spatiotemporal resolution L: FCD measures had high reliability intraclass correlation ICC31 > 0.6 but lower reproducibility >67% than the low spatiotemporal resolution equivalents. GM sensitivity and specificity benchmarks showed the robustness of L: FCD to changes in model parameter and preprocessing steps. Mapping individuals brain hubs with high sensitivity specificity and reproducibility supports the use of L: FCD as a biomarker for clinical applications in neuropsychiatric disorders."
