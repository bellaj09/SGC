While new generations of implantable brain computer interface BCI devices are being developed evidence in the literature about their impact on the patient experience is lagging. In this article we address this knowledge gap by analysing data from the first-in-human clinical trial to study patients with implanted BCI advisory devices. We explored perceptions of self-change across six patients who volunteered to be implanted with artificially\xa0intelligent BCI devices. We used qualitative methodological tools grounded in phenomenology to conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results show that on the one hand BCIs can positively increase a sense of the self and control; on the other hand they can induce radical distress feelings of loss of control and a rupture of patient identity. We conclude by offering suggestions for the proactive creation of preparedness protocols specific to intelligent-predictive and advisory-BCI technologies essential to prevent potential iatrogenic harms.
