The aim of this research is to provide a light and easy-handling shoulder model for surgeons in order to ease the preoperative and peroperative work required when replacing the shoulder joint with a prosthesis. The digital mock-up of the shoulder is simplified according to the criteria of the surgeon allowing easy manipulation of the model for a virtual operation. The model can be parameterized from X-rays or CT images. This paper describes the method used to obtain a virtual mock-up that is useful for preoperative simulation. Furthermore it is shown that a real-time augmented reality system could be achieved for peroperative application. Computer aided surgery system for shoulder prosthesis placement.
