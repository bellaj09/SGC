"Cells in culture display diverse motility behaviors that may reflect differences in cell state and function providing motivation to discriminate between different motility behaviors. Current methods to do so rely upon manual feature engineering. However the types of features necessary to distinguish between motility behaviors can vary greatly depending on the biological context and it is not always clear which features may be most predictive in each setting for distinguishing particular cell types or disease states. Convolutional neural networks CNNs are machine learning models ideally suited to the analysis of spatial data allowing for relevant spatial features to be learned as parameters of a model. Given that motility data is inherently spatial we apply CNNs to classify different motility behaviors using two novel approaches. The first approach represents motility explicitly as a 3D space with markers denoting a cells location at each time point and the second utilizes recurrent long-term short-term memory LSTM units to represent the temporal dimension implicitly. Both 3D CNNs and convolutionalrecurrent neural networks RNNs provide accurate classification of simulated motility behaviors the experimentally measured motility behaviors of multiple cell types and characteristic motility behaviors of muscle stem cell differentiation states."
