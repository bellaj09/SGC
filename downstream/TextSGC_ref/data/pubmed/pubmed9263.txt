"Wrong-site surgeries can occur due to the absence of an appropriate surgical time-out. However during a time-out surgical participants are unable to review the patients charts due to their aseptic hands. To improve the conditions in surgical time-outs we introduce a deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm the surgical information prior to cataract surgeries. This pilot study utilized the publicly available audio vocabulary dataset and recorded audio data published by the authors. The audio clips of the target words such as left right cataract phacoemulsification and intraocular lens were selected to determine and confirm surgical information in the time-out speech. A deep convolutional neural network model was trained and implemented in the smart speaker that was developed using a mini development board and commercial speakerphone. To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech. Future studies should focus on collecting real-world time-out data and automatically connecting the device to electronic health records. Adopting smart speaker-assisted time-out phases will improve the patients safety during cataract surgeries particularly in relation to wrong-site surgeries."
