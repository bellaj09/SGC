Reducing dose level to achieve ALARA is an important task in diagnostic and therapeutic applications of computed tomography CT imaging. Effective image quality enhancement strategies are crucial to compensate for the degradation caused by dose reduction. In the past few years deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising denoising performance on natural/synthetic images. This study tailors a neural network model for ultra-low-dose CT denoising and assesses its performance in enhancing CT image quality and emphysema quantification. A convolutional neural network for ultra-low-dose CT denoising and emphysema screening.
