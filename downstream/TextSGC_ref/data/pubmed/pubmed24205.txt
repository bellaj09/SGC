"Neurotransmitter release in chemical synapses is fundamental to diverse brain functions such as motor action learning cognition emotion perception and consciousness. Moreover improper functioning or abnormal release of neurotransmitter is associated with numerous neurological disorders such as epilepsy sclerosis schizophrenia Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. We have utilized hysteresis engineering in a back-gated MoS2 field effect transistor FET in order to mimic such neurotransmitter release dynamics in chemical synapses. All three essential features i.e. quantal stochastic and excitatory or inhibitory nature of neurotransmitter release were accurately captured in our experimental demonstration. We also mimicked an important phenomenon called long-term potentiation LTP which forms the basis of human memory. Finally we demonstrated how to engineer the LTP time by operating the MoS2 FET in different regimes. Our findings could provide a critical component toward the design of next-generation smart and intelligent human-like machines and human-machine interfaces."
