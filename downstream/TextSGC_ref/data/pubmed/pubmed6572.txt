Photoplethysmography PPG-based continuous heart rate monitoring is essential in a number of domains e.g. for healthcare or fitness applications. Recently methods based on time-frequency spectra emerged to address the challenges of motion artefact compensation. However existing approaches are highly parametrised and optimised for specific scenarios of small public datasets. We address this fragmentation by contributing research into the robustness and generalisation capabilities of PPG-based heart rate estimation approaches. First we introduce a novel large-scale dataset called PPG-DaLiA including a wide range of activities performed under close to real-life conditions. Second we extend a state-of-the-art algorithm significantly improving its performance on several datasets. Third we introduce deep learning to this domain and investigate various convolutional neural network architectures. Our end-to-end learning approach takes the time-frequency spectra of synchronised PPG- and accelerometer-signals as input and provides the estimated heart rate as output. Finally we compare the novel deep learning approach to classical methods performing evaluation on four public datasets. We show that on large datasets the deep learning model significantly outperforms other methods: The mean absolute error could be reduced by 31 % on the new dataset PPG-DaLiA and by 21 % on the dataset WESAD.
