The radiologic community is rapidly integrating a revolution that has not fully entered daily practice. It necessitates a close collaboration between computer scientists and radiologists to move from concepts to practical applications. This article reviews the current littrature on machine learning and deep neural network applications in the field of pulmonary embolism chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension aorta and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network Applications in the Thorax: Pulmonary Embolism Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Aorta and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
