The growth of Internet applications has substantially broadened the potential for its use in global telehealth. This pilot project used the virtual reality world of Second Life for diabetic patients to meet with their nurse practitioners for their maintenance visits. Using avatars and the online patient portal these scheduled visits were designed to meet the needs of the patients as determined by the results from a questionnaire completed by patients prior to the visit. The virtual visits took place in the replicated building where patients typically receive their care the Eskind Diabetes Clinic. Orientation sessions to Second Life were made available prior to the actual visit and additional online resources were made available after the visit was over. Although only seven pilot patients have currently completed visits data illustrate the positive potential use of this treatment modality for future study.
