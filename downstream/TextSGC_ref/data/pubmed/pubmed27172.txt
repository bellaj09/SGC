Brain-computer interface BCI users can control very complex applications such as multimedia players or even web browsers. Therefore different biosignal acquisition systems are available to noninvasively measure the electrical activity of the brain the electroencephalogram EEG. To make BCIs more practical hardware and software are nowadays designed more user centered and user friendly. In this paper we evaluated one of the latest innovations in the area of BCI: A wireless EEG amplifier with dry electrode technology combined with a web browser which enables BCI users to use standard webmail. With this system ten volunteers performed a daily life task: Write read and answer an email. Experimental results of this study demonstrate the power of the introduced BCI system. "Write read and answer emails with a dry n wireless brain-computer interface system."
