: We sought to investigate whether systematic balance training modulates brain area activity responsible for postural control and influence brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF mRNA protein expression. Seventy-four older adults were randomly divided into three groups mean age 65.34  3.79 years 30 females: Classic balance exercises CBT virtual reality balance exercises VBT and control CON. Neuroimaging studies were performed at inclusion and after completion of the training or 12 weeks later CON. Blood samples were obtained to measure BDNF expression. The study revealed significant interaction of sessions and groups: In the motor imagery MI condition for supplementary motor area SMA activity Fat peak = 5.25 p < 0.05; in the action observation AO condition for left and right supramarginal gyrus/posterior insula left: Fat peak = 6.48 p < 0.05; right: Fat peak = 6.92 p < 0.05; in the action observation together with motor imagery AOMI condition for the middle occipital gyrus laterally/area V5 left: Fat peak = 6.26 p < 0.05; right: Fat peak = 8.37 p < 0.05 and in the cerebellum-inferior semilunar lobule/tonsil Fat peak = 5.47 p < 0.05. After the training serum BDNF level has increased in CBT p < 0.001 and in CBT compared to CON p < 0.05. Systematic balance training may reverse the age-related cortical over-activations and appear to be a factor mediating neuroplasticity in older adults.
