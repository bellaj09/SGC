"Neural mechanisms of attention are extensively studied in the neocortex; comparatively little is known about how subcortical regions contribute to attention. The superior colliculus SC is an evolutionarily conserved subcortical midbrain structure that has been implicated in controlling visuospatial attention. Yet how the SC contributes mechanistically to attention remains unknown. We investigated the role of the SC in attention combining model-based psychophysics diffusion imaging and tractography in human participants. Specifically we asked whether the SC contributes to enhancing sensitivity d to attended information or whether it contributes to biasing choices criteria in favor of attended information. We tested human participants on a multialternative change detection task with endogenous spatial cueing and quantified sensitivity and bias with a recently developed multidimensional signal detection model m-ADC model. At baseline sensitivity and bias exhibited complementary patterns of asymmetries across the visual hemifields: While sensitivity was consistently higher for detecting changes in the left hemifield bias was higher for reporting changes in the right hemifield. Remarkably white matter connectivity of the SC with the neocortex mirrored this pattern of asymmetries. Specifically the asymmetry in SC-cortex connectivity correlated with the asymmetry in choice bias but not in sensitivity. In addition SC-cortex connectivity strength could predict cueing-induced modulation of bias but not of sensitivity across individuals. In summary the SC may be a key node in an evolutionarily conserved network for controlling choice bias during visuospatial attention."
