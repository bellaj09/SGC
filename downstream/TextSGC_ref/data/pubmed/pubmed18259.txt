As a response to the criticisms evidence-based practice currently faces groups of health care researchers and guideline makers have started to call for the appraisal and inclusion of different kinds of knowledge in guideline production other than randomized controlled trials RCTs to better link with the informal knowledge used in clinical practice. In an ethnographic study Gabbay and Le May showed that clinicians in everyday practice situations do not explicitly or consciously use guidelines. Instead they use mindlines: collectively shared mostly tacit knowledge that is shaped by many sources including accumulated personal experiences education formal and informal guidance and the narratives about patients that are shared among colleagues. In this study on informal knowledge we consider virtual networks of clinicians as representative of the mindlines in the wider medical community as holders of knowledge as well as catalysts of knowing.
