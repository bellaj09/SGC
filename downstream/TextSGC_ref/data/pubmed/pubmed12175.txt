Colonoscopy is a standard method for screening polyps by highly trained physicians. Miss-detected polyps in colonoscopy are potential risk factor for colorectal cancer. In this study we investigate an automatic polyp classification framework. We aim to compare two different approaches named hand-craft feature method and convolutional neural network CNN based deep learning method. Combined shape and color features are used for hand craft feature extraction and support vector machine SVM method is adopted for classification. For CNN approach three convolution and pooling based deep learning framework is used for classification purpose. The proposed framework is evaluated using three public polyp databases. From the experimental results we have shown that the CNN based deep learning framework shows better classification performance than the hand-craft feature based methods. It achieves over 90% of classification accuracy sensitivity specificity and precision. Comparison of hand-craft feature based SVM and CNN based deep learning framework for automatic polyp classification.
