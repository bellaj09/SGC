The manual review of an electroencephalogram EEG for seizure detection is a laborious and error-prone process. Thus automated seizure detection based on machine learning has been studied for decades. Recently deep learning has been adopted in order to avoid manual feature extraction and selection. In the present study we systematically compared the performance of different combinations of input modalities and network structures on a fixed window size and dataset to ascertain an optimal combination of input modalities and network structures. The raw time-series EEG periodogram of the EEG 2D images of short-time Fourier transform results and 2D images of raw EEG waveforms were obtained from 5-s segments of intracranial EEGs recorded from a mouse model of epilepsy. A fully connected neural network FCNN recurrent neural network RNN and convolutional neural network CNN were implemented to classify the various inputs. The classification results for the test dataset showed that CNN performed better than FCNN and RNN with the area under the curve AUC for the receiver operating characteristics curves ranging from 0.983 to 0.984 from 0.985 to 0.989 and from 0.989 to 0.993 for FCNN RNN and CNN respectively. As for input modalities 2D images of raw EEG waveforms yielded the best result with an AUC of 0.993. Thus CNN can be the most suitable network structure for automated seizure detection when applied to the images of raw EEG waveforms since CNN can effectively learn a general spatially-invariant representation of seizure patterns in 2D representations of raw EEG.
