"The clinical use of virtual reality VR has proven its efficacy especially when used as an exposure technique. A prominent property of VRs utility is its equivalence with the reality it represents. In this study we explored this equivalence in a clinical context using neuroimaging. A sample of 32 adults with specific phobias i.e. to cockroaches spiders or lizards was divided into two groups: One was exposed to phobic stimuli using VR and the other was exposed to real phobic images RI. We used brain activations as a dependent measure focusing specifically on brain areas usually associated with fear processing. Whole-brain analysis detected higher activations for RI in the hippocampus occipital and calcarine areas. A specific analysis of the amygdala and insula also detected higher activations and extensions in response to RI but VR stimuli also activated those areas in a significant manner. These results suggest that even in those cases where RI stimuli activate all of the brains fear-processing circuits VR stimuli do so as well. This implies that VR can be useful as an exposure technique similar to RI and applied as more than a mere training mechanism."
