This study aims to investigate how basic training contributes to the performance of complex laparoscopic tasks performed in a virtual reality VR environment. An assessment methodology is proposed based on quantitative error analysis of key components of laparoscopic competence. Twenty-five inexperienced surgeons were trained on four basic tasks. The effect of training was assessed on three independent scenarios two procedural: adhesiolysis and bowel suturing and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy LC. Several error parameters were post hoc analyzed to yield a quantitative performance index for two fundamental skills: proficiency and safety. Time and instrument path length were also measured and compared. Correlation analysis was performed to study how these indices correlate one another. Significant learning curves were demonstrated during training. For adhesiolysis all four indices improved significantly P < 0.05. Time and path length presented plateaus for all basic tasks whereas proficiency and safety only for two and one tasks respectively. For bowel suturing only time and safety errors showed a decrease P < 0.05. Significant performance enhancement was observed for LC in which errors and path length reduced after training P < 0.05. Our results revealed also an increased number of correlations after training especially for proficiency. This study finds it possible to assess key competence skills based on the quantitative analysis of various parameters generated by a VR simulator. The improvement in basic training is transferred to more complex tasks. The proposed methodology is useful for structured evaluation of laparoscopic performance demonstrating fundamental elements of surgical competence. The contribution of simulation training in enhancing key components of laparoscopic competence.
