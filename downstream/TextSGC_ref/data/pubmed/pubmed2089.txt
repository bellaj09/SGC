"Cellular network architecture plays a crucial role as the structural substrate for the brain functions. Therefore it represents the main rationale for the emerging field of connectomics defined as the comprehensive study of all aspects of central nervous system connectivity. Accordingly in the present paper the main emphasis will be on the communication processes in the brain namely wiring transmission WT i.e. the mapping of the communication channels made by cell components such as axons and synapses and volume transmission VT i.e. the chemical signal diffusion along the interstitial brain fluid pathways. Considering both processes can further expand the connectomics concept since both WT-connectomics and VT-connectomics contribute to the structure of the brain connectome. A consensus exists that such a structure follows a hierarchical or nested architecture and macro- meso- and microscales have been defined. In this respect however several lines of evidence indicate that a nanoscale nano-connectomics should also be considered to capture direct protein-protein allosteric interactions such as those occurring for example in receptor-receptor interactions at the plasma membrane level. In addition emerging evidence points to novel mechanisms likely playing a significant role in the modulation of intercellular connectivity increasing the plasticity of the system and adding complexity to its structure. In particular the roamer type of VT i.e. the intercellular transfer of RNA proteins and receptors by extracellular vesicles will be discussed since it allowed us to introduce a new concept of transient changes of cell phenotype that is the transient acquisition of new signal release capabilities and/or new recognition/decoding apparatuses."
