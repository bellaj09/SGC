In the context of brain-computer interface BCI system the common spatial patterns CSP method has been used to extract discriminative spatial filters for the classification of electroencephalogram EEG signals. However the classification performance of CSP typically deteriorates when a few training samples are collected from a new BCI user. In this paper we propose an approach that maintains or improves the recognition accuracy of the system with only a small size of training data set. The proposed approach is formulated by regularizing the classical CSP technique with the strategy of transfer learning. Specifically we incorporate into the CSP analysis inter-subject information involving the same task by minimizing the difference between the inter-subject features. Experimental results on two data sets from BCI competitions show that the proposed approach greatly improves the classification performance over that of the conventional CSP method; the transformed variant proved to be successful in almost every case based on a small number of available training samples. Regularized common spatial patterns with subject-to-subject transfer of EEG signals.
