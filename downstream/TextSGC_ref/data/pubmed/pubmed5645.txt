Converging evidence from neuroimaging and neuromodulation literature suggests that the cerebellum plays a broad role in motor as well as cognitive processes through its participation in resting-state networks. A recent study by Halko et al. J Neurosci 34: 12049-12056 2014 demonstrates for the first time the ability to modulate functional connectivity of some of these distinct resting-state networks using site-specific repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS of the cerebellum. In this Neuro Forum we discuss and critically analyze this study emphasizing important findings potential therapeutic relevance and areas worthy of further inquiry. Modulation of cerebello-cerebral resting state networks by site-specific stimulation.
