We measured and compared heritability estimates for measures of functional brain connectivity extracted using the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis ENIGMA rsfMRI analysis pipeline in two cohorts: the genetics of brain structure GOBS cohort and the HCP the Human Connectome Project cohort. These two cohorts were assessed using conventional GOBS and advanced HCP rsfMRI protocols offering a test case for harmonization of rsfMRI phenotypes and to determine measures that show consistent heritability for in-depth genome-wide analysis. The GOBS cohort consisted of 334 Mexican-American individuals 124M/210F average age\u2009=\u200947.9\u2009\u200913.2\u2009years from 29 extended pedigrees average family size\u2009=\u20099 people; range 5-32. The GOBS rsfMRI data was collected using a 7.5-min acquisition sequence spatial resolution\u2009=\u20091.72\u2009\u20091.72\u2009\u20093 mm3 . The HCP cohort consisted of 518 twins and family members 240M/278F; average age\u2009=\u200928.7\u2009\u20093.7\u2009years. rsfMRI data was collected using 28.8-min sequence spatial resolution\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u20092\u2009\u20092 mm3 . We used the single-modality ENIGMA rsfMRI preprocessing pipeline to estimate heritability values for measures from eight major functional networks using 1 seed-based connectivity and 2 dual regression approaches. We observed significant heritability h2 =\u20090.2-0.4 p\u2009<\u2009.05 for functional connections from seven networks across both cohorts with a significant positive correlation between heritability estimates across two cohorts. The similarity in heritability estimates for resting state connectivity measurements suggests that the additive genetic contribution to functional connectivity is robustly detectable across populations and imaging acquisition parameters. The overarching genetic influence and means to consistently detect it provides an opportunity to define a common genetic search space for future gene discovery studies.
