"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs have great potential for applications that restore and assist communication for paralyzed individuals. Recently BMIs decoding speech have gained considerable attention due to their potential for high information transfer rates. In this study we propose a novel decoding approach based on hidden Markov models HMMs that uses the timing of neural signal changes to decode speech. We tested the decoders performance by predicting vowels from electrocorticographic ECoG data of three human subjects. Our results show that timing-based features of ECoG signals are informative of vowel production and enable decoding accuracies significantly above the level of chance. This suggests that leveraging the temporal structure of neural activity to decode speech could play an important role towards developing highperformance robust speech BMIs."
