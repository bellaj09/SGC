Neurological trauma can have a devastating effect on activities of daily living. One of the consequences is an increased amount of variability in the system which can challenge individuals to stay within safe and stable regions of operation. There are multiple sources of movement variability; two of these are neuromotor noise and action-tolerance variability. The amount of neuromotor noise that is uncontrollable can impose limitations on reshaping variability. Action-tolerance variability which can be reshaped through experience and neuromotor noise a certain amount of which cannot be altered are often conflated when discussing motor variability. We attempted to disambiguate the two using an adaptive model producing distinct "signatures" of neuromotor noise and action-tolerance variability within a task and compare with experimental data on stroke and healthy. Not all stroke survivors could adapt to the task as predicted for those with greater neuromotor noise. Possible applications of this model can inform us of potential to influence distributions in stroke survivors and other individuals who have had a neurological injury. Additionally we could design new training environments specifically tailored to the needs of the individual. This technique may also help disambiguate the type of brain injury suffered by stroke survivors. Dissociating two sources of variability using a safety-margin model.
