"Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others i.e. mentalizing. Furthermore using objectively logged friendship network data we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants friendship networks an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics." Brain connectivity dynamics during social interaction reflect social network structure.
