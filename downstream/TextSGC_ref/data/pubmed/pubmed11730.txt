As an interesting and emerging topic cosaliency detection aims at simultaneously extracting common salient objects in multiple related images. It differs from the conventional saliency detection paradigm in which saliency detection for each image is determined one by one independently without taking advantage of the homogeneity in the data pool of multiple related images. In this paper we propose a novel cosaliency detection approach using deep learning models. Two new concepts called intrasaliency prior transfer and deep intersaliency mining are introduced and explored in the proposed work. For the intrasaliency prior transfer we build a stacked denoising autoencoder SDAE to learn the saliency prior knowledge from auxiliary annotated data sets and then transfer the learned knowledge to estimate the intrasaliency for each image in cosaliency data sets. For the deep intersaliency mining we formulate it by using the deep reconstruction residual obtained in the highest hidden layer of a self-trained SDAE. The obtained deep intersaliency can extract more intrinsic and general hidden patterns to discover the homogeneity of cosalient objects in terms of some higher level concepts. Finally the cosaliency maps are generated by weighted integration of the proposed intrasaliency prior deep intersaliency and traditional shallow intersaliency. Comprehensive experiments over diverse publicly available benchmark data sets demonstrate consistent performance gains of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art cosaliency detection methods.
