We report an electro-optic image shifter to enhance the resolution of display devices with a Pancharatnam-Berry phase deflector PBD. The switching time of our PBD is less than 1\xa0ms. Through synchronizing and computational factorization we are able to double the display resolution for reducing the screen door effect. Such a thin and lightweight PBD image shifter can be easily integrated into wearable display devices. Its potential application for virtual reality and augmented reality is emphasized.
