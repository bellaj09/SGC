We present the self-paced 3-class Graz brain-computer interface BCI which is based on the detection of sensorimotor electroencephalogram EEG rhythms induced by motor imagery. Self-paced operation means that the BCI is able to determine whether the ongoing brain activity is intended as control signal intentional control or not non-control state. The presented system is able to automatically reduce electrooculogram EOG artifacts to detect electromyographic EMG activity and uses only three bipolar EEG channels. Two applications are presented: the freeSpace virtual environment VE and the Brainloop interface. The freeSpace is a computer-game-like application where subjects have to navigate through the environment and collect coins by autonomously selecting navigation commands. Three subjects participated in these feedback experiments and each learned to navigate through the VE and collect coins. Two out of the three succeeded in collecting all three coins. The Brainloop interface provides an interface between the Graz-BCI and Google Earth. The self-paced graz brain-computer interface: methods and applications.
