Since the first use of robotic surgical system in 2000 the robot-assisted technology has gained wide popularity throughout the world. Robot-assisted surgical training is a complex issue that requires significant efforts from students and teacher. During the last two decades simulation-based training had received active development due to wide-spread occurrence and popularization of laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgical techniques. We performed a systematic review to identify the currently available simulators for robot-assisted surgery. We searched the Medline and Pubmed English sources of literature data using the following key words and phrases: "robotics" "robotic surgery" "computer assisted surgery" "simulation" "computer simulation" "virtual reality" "surgical training" and "surgical education". There were identified 565 publications which meet the key words and phrases; 19 publications were selected for the final analysis. It was established that simulation-based training is the most promising teaching tool that can be used in the training of the next generation robotic surgeons. Today the use of simulators to train surgeons is validated. Price of devices is an obvious barrier for inclusion in the program for training of robotic surgeons but the lack of this tool will result in a sharp increase in the duration of specialists training.
