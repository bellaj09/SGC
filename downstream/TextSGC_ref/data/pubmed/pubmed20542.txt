"Most brain-computer interfaces BCIs are non-time-restraint systems. However the method used to design a real-time BCI paradigm for controlling unstable devices is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a real-time feedback BCI paradigm for controlling an inverted pendulum on a cart IPC. In this paradigm sensorimotor rhythms SMRs were recorded using 15 active electrodes placed on the surface of the subjects scalp. Subsequently common spatial pattern CSP was used as the basic filter to extract spatial patterns. Finally linear discriminant analysis LDA was used to translate the patterns into control commands that could stabilize the simulated inverted pendulum. Offline trainings were employed to teach the subjects to execute corresponding mental tasks such as left/right hand motor imagery. Five subjects could successfully balance the online inverted pendulum for more than 35s. The results demonstrated that BCIs are able to control nonlinear unstable devices. Furthermore the demonstration and extension of real-time continuous control might be useful for the real-life application and generalization of BCI."
