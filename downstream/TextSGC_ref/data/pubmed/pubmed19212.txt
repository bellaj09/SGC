The mechanism underlying cybersickness during virtual reality VR exposure is still poorly understood although research has highlighted a causal role for visual-vestibular sensory conflict. Recently established methods for reducing cybersickness include galvanic vestibular stimulation GVS to mimic absent vestibular cues in VR or vibration of the vestibular organs to add noise to the sensory modality. Here we examined if applying noise to the vestibular system using noisy-current GVS affects sickness severity in VR. Participants were exposed to one of the two VR games that were classified as either moderately or intensely nauseogenic. The VR content lasted for 50\xa0min and was broken down into three blocks: 30\xa0min of gameplay during exposure to either noisy GVS \u20091750\xa0A or sham stimulation 0\xa0A and 10\xa0min of gameplay before and after this block. We characterized the effects of noisy GVS in terms of post-minus-pre-exposure cybersickness scores. In the intense VR condition we found a main effect of noisy vestibular stimulation on a verbal cybersickness scale but not for questionnaire measures of cybersickness. Participants reported lower cybersickness scores during and directly after exposure to GVS. However this difference was quickly extinguished ~\u20093-6\xa0min after further VR exposure indicating that sensory adaptation did not persist after stimulation was terminated. In contrast there were no differences between the sham and GVS group for the moderate VR content. The results show the potential for reducing cybersickness with non-invasive sensory stimulation. We address possible mechanisms for the observed effects including noise-induced sensory re-weighting. Reduction of cybersickness during and immediately following noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation.
