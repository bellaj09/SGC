In robotic surgery the coordination between the console-side surgeon and bed-side assistant is crucial more than in standard surgery or laparoscopy where the surgical team works in close contact. Xperience Team Trainer XTT is a new optional component for the dv-Trainer platform and simulates the patient-side working environment. We present preliminary results for face content and the workload imposed regarding the use of the XTT virtual reality platform for the psychomotor and communication skills training of the bed-side assistant in robot-assisted surgery. Participants were categorized into "Beginners" and "Experts". They tested a series of exercises Pick & Place Laparoscopic Demo Pick & Place 2 and Team Match Board 1 and completed face validity questionnaires. "Experts" assessed content validity on another questionnaire. All the participants completed a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to assess the workload imposed by XTT. Twenty-one consenting participants were included 12 "Beginners" and 9 "Experts". XTT was shown to possess face and content validity as evidenced by the rankings given on the simulator\s ease of use and realism parameters and on the simulator\s usefulness for training. Eight out of nine "Experts" judged the visualization of metrics after the exercises useful. However face validity has shown some weaknesses regarding interactions and instruments. Reasonable workload parameters were registered. XTT demonstrated excellent face and content validity with acceptable workload parameters. XTT could become a useful tool for robotic surgery team training. Face and content validity of Xperience Team Trainer: bed-side assistant training simulator for robotic surgery.
