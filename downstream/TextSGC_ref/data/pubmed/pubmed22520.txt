Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP based Brain-Computer Interface BCI system is an important BCI modality. It has advantages such as ease of use little training and high Information Transfer Rate ITR. Traditional SSVEP based BCI systems are based on the Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA approach in telecommunications. Recently Time Division Multiple Access TDMA was also introduced to SSVEP based BCI to enhance the system performance. This study designed a new time-frequency joint coding method to utilize the information coding from both time and frequency domains. TDMA using Different Frequency DF mode and Same Frequency SF mode were compared to the traditional FDMA mode in the offline experiment. The result showed that the DF mode had better performance than the other two modes. The mean and the standard deviation of accuracy and ITR of the online experiment was 83.3%5.5% and 130.3 + 14.9 bits/min trial time: 1.25s and 92.0%7.5% and 136.6 + 19.8 bit/min trial time: 1.5s. The average typing speed for the word-copy spelling task was 14.9 characters per minute cpm trial time: 1.25s and 14.8 cpm trial time: 1.5s. The overall results demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed time-frequency joint coding method.
