The delivery of nurse education has changed radically in the past two decades. Increasingly nurse educators are using new technology in the classroom to enhance their teaching and learning. One recent technological development to emerge is the user-generated content website YouTube. Originally YouTube was used as a repository for sharing home-made videos more recently online content is being generated by political parties businesses and educationalists. We recently delivered a module to undergraduate student nurses in which the teaching and learning were highly populated with YouTube resources. We found that the use of YouTube videos increased student engagement critical awareness and facilitated deep learning. Furthermore these videos could be accessed at any time of the day and from a place to suit the student. We acknowledge that there are some constraints to using YouTube for teaching and learning particularly around the issue of unregulated content which is often misleading inaccurate or biased. However we strongly urge nurse educators to consider using YouTube for teaching and learning in and outside the classroom to a generation of students who are native of a rapidly changing digital world. Can YouTube enhance student nurse learning?
