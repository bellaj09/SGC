"The neural basis of suppressing conscious access to ones own memories has recently received considerable attention with several studies suggesting this process engages frontal-parietal cognitive control regions. However researchers to date have not examined the way right and left hemisphere cognitive control networks coordinate with one another to accomplish this. We had 48 participants 25 female complete a Think/No Think T/NT task for memories of emotionally unpleasant visual scenes while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used generalized psychophysiologic interaction analyses to examine functional connectivity between right and left hemisphere frontal-parietal regions during memory suppression. Participants who were better at memory suppression as assessed by greater numbers of forgotten memories in the NT than T conditions also showed greater functional connectivity between multiple right and left hemisphere control regions. This suggests that individual differences in memory suppression ability may be partially explained by differences in task-specific inter-hemispheric coordination." Successful Goal-Directed Memory Suppression is Associated With Increased Inter-Hemispheric Coordination Between Right and Left Frontoparietal Control Networks.
