Contextual modulation of neuronal responses by surrounding environments is a fundamental attribute of sensory processing. In the mammalian retina responses of On-Off direction selective ganglion cells DSGCs are modulated by motion contexts. However the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that posterior-preferring DSGCs pDSGCs are sensitive to discontinuities of moving contours owing to contextually modulated cholinergic excitation from starburst amacrine cells SACs. Using a combination of synapse-specific genetic manipulations patch clamp electrophysiology and connectomic analysis we identified distinct circuit motifs upstream of On and Off SACs that are required for the contextual modulation of pDSGC activity for bright and dark contrasts. Furthermore our results reveal a class of wide-field amacrine cells WACs with straight unbranching dendrites that function as "continuity detectors" of moving contours. Therefore divergent circuit motifs in the On and Off pathways extend the information encoding of On-Off DSGCs beyond their direction selectivity during complex stimuli.
