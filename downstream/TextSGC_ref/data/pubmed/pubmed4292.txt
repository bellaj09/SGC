We present a Human Connectome Project study tailored toward adolescent anxiety and depression. This study is one of the first studies of the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases initiative and is collecting structural functional and diffusion-weighted brain imaging data from up to 225 adolescents ages 14-17 years 150 of whom are expected to have a current diagnosis of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder. Comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluations and longitudinal clinical data are also being collected. This article provides an overview of task functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI protocols and preliminary findings N\xa0=\xa0140 as well as clinical and neuropsychological characterization of adolescents. Data collection is ongoing for an additional 85 adolescents most of whom are expected to have a diagnosis of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder. Data from the first 140 adolescents are projected for public release through the National Institutes of Health Data Archive NDA with the timing of this manuscript. All other data will be made publicly-available through the NDA at regularly scheduled intervals. This article is intended to serve as an introduction to this project as well as a reference for those seeking to clinical neurocognitive and task fMRI data from this public resource.
