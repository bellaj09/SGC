The Second International Workshop on Advances in Electrocorticography ECoG was convened in San Diego CA USA on November 11-12 2010. Between this meeting and the inaugural 2009 event a much clearer picture has been emerging of cortical ECoG physiology and its relationship to local field potentials and single-cell recordings. Innovations in material engineering are advancing the goal of a stable long-term recording interface. Continued evolution of ECoG-driven brain-computer interface technology is determining innovation in neuroprosthetics. Improvements in instrumentation and statistical methodologies continue to elucidate ECoG correlates of normal human function as well as the ictal state. This proceedings document summarizes the current status of this rapidly evolving field. Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Advances in Electrocorticography.
