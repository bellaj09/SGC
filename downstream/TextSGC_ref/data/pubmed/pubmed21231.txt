We investigated the morphological and electrochemical properties of an explanted laser-machined 32 channel electrocorticogram ECoG electrode array made of platinum-iridium and silicone rubber. It was connected to a wireless brain-computer interface BCI and implanted in a sheep for more than 15 months. Recordings and stimulations of cortical activity were conducted over the whole period on a regularly basis. Currently this is the longest in vivo study for this type of ECoG electrode array. Results were compared with an unused electrode array of same dimensions material and production method. Visual inspections revealed no significant material alterations despite organic residuals which could be easily removed though. Electrochemical impedance measurements also attested proper long-term stability of magnitude and phase the difference between explanted electrode contacts and those of the unused array were found negligible.
