Practice of movement in virtual-reality and other artificially altered environments has been proposed as a method for rehabilitation following neurological injury and for training new skills in healthy humans.\xa0 For such training to be useful there must be transfer of learning from the artificial environment to the performance of desired skills in the natural environment.\xa0 Therefore an important assumption of such methods is that practice in the altered environment engages the same learning and plasticity mechanisms that are required for skill performance in the natural environment.\xa0 We test the hypothesis that transfer of learning may fail because the learning and plasticity mechanism that adapts to the altered environment is different from the learning mechanism required for improvement of motor skill.\xa0 In this paper we propose that a model that separates skill learning and environmental adaptation is necessary to explain the learning and aftereffects that are observed in virtual reality experiments.\xa0 In particular we studied the condition where practice in the altered environment should lead to correct skill performance in the original environment. Our 2-mechanism model predicts that aftereffects will still be observed when returning to the original environment indicating a lack of skill transfer from the artificial environment to the original environment. To illustrate the model prediction we tested 10 healthy participants on the interaction between a simple overlearned motor skill straight hand movements to targets in different directions and an artificially altered visuomotor environment rotation of visual feedback of the results of movement.\xa0 As predicted by the models participants show adaptation to the altered environment and after-effects on return to the baseline environment even when practice in the altered environment should have led to correct skill performance. \xa0The presence of aftereffect under all conditions that involved changes in environment demonstrates separation of environmental adaptation and skill learning. Our results support the existence of two distinct learning modules with different adaptation properties.\xa0 Therefore we suggest that adaptation to an altered environment may not be useful for training new skills. Two different motor learning mechanisms contribute to learning reaching movements in a rotated visual environment.
