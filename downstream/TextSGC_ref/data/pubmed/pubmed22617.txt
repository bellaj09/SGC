Cardiovascular computed tomographic angiography CCTA 3-D thoracic reconstruction can serve as a "virtual patient avatar" providing surgical views for approach to complex anomalous coronary artery anatomy. Images demonstrated a single coronary artery ostium arising from the right aortic sinus with trifurcation into a prepulmonic left anterior descending coronary artery LAD an interarterial circumflex with a subsequent intraseptal course and normal course of the right coronary artery. Virtual 3-D CCTA reconstructions were important to planning an incisional plane for surgical correction.
