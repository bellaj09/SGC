Reflection has been identified as a deep learning strategy necessary for radiation therapists to foster professional growth to monitor current practice and to evaluate the effects of change. To further develop reflective practice in radiation therapists a department-based reflective practice program was designed and implemented in 2010. The program continues to be delivered annually to each new cohort of graduates. Long-term objectives of the program included the continued use of reflective practice and participation in reflective activities; the ability to communicate knowledge skills and values through reflective discussion within the team environment; the further development of clinical knowledge and skills; and the promotion of a reflective culture within the department.
