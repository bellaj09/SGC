Detecting blood content in the gastrointestinal tract is one of the crucial applications of capsule endoscopy CE. The suspected blood indicator SBI is a conventional tool used to automatically tag images depicting possible bleeding in the reading system. We aim to develop a deep learning-based system to detect blood content in images and compare its performance with that of the SBI. Automatic detection of blood content in capsule endoscopy images based on a deep convolutional neural network.
