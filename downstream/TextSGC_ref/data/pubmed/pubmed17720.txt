A new technique for shaping microfluid flow known as flow sculpting offers an unprecedented level of passive fluid flow control with potential breakthrough applications in advancing manufacturing biology and chemistry research at the microscale. However efficiently solving the inverse problem of designing a flow sculpting device for a desired fluid flow shape remains a challenge. Current approaches struggle with the many-to-one design space requiring substantial user interaction and the necessity of building intuition all of which are time and resource intensive. Deep learning has emerged as an efficient function approximation technique for high-dimensional spaces and presents a fast solution to the inverse problem yet the science of its implementation in similarly defined problems remains largely unexplored. We propose that deep learning methods can completely outpace current approaches for scientific inverse problems while delivering comparable designs. To this end we show how intelligent sampling of the design space inputs can make deep learning methods more competitive in accuracy while illustrating their generalization capability to out-of-sample predictions.
