"The maintenance of a timely reliable and accurate spatial database on current forest ecosystem conditions and changes is essential to characterize and assess forest resources and support sustainable forest management. Information for such a database can be obtained only through a continuous forest inventory. The National Forest Continuous Inventory NFCI is the first level of Chinas three-tiered inventory system. The NFCI is administered by the State Forestry Administration; data are acquired by five inventory institutions around the country. Several important components of the database include land type forest classification and ageclass/ age-group. The NFCI database in China is constructed based on 5-year inventory periods resulting in some of the data not being timely when reports are issued. To address this problem a forest growth simulation model has been developed to update the database for years between the periodic inventories. In order to aid in forest plan design and management a three-dimensional virtual reality system of forest landscapes for selected units in the database compartment or sub-compartment has also been developed based on Virtual Reality Modeling Language. In addition a transparent internet publishing system for a spatial database based on open source WebGIS UMN Map Server has been designed and utilized to enhance public understanding and encourage free participation of interested parties in the development implementation and planning of sustainable forest management."
