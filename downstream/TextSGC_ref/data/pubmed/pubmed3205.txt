"Maternal bonding early postpartum lays an important foundation for child development. Changing brain structure and function during pregnancy and postpartum may underscore maternal bonding. We employed connectome-based predictive modeling CPM to measure brain functional connectivity and predict self-reported maternal bonding in mothers at 2 and 8\xa0months postpartum. At 2\xa0months CPM predicted maternal anxiety in the bonding relationship: Greater integration between cerebellar and motor-sensory-auditory networks and between frontoparietal and motor-sensory-auditory networks were associated with more maternal anxiety toward their infant. Furthermore greater segregation between the cerebellar and frontoparietal and within the motor-sensory-auditory networks was associated with more maternal anxiety regarding their infant. We did not observe CPM prediction of maternal bonding impairments or rejection/anger toward the infant. Finally considering 2 and 8\xa0months of data changes in network connectivity were associated with changes in maternal anxiety in the bonding relationship. Our results suggest that changing connectivity among maternal brain networks may provide insight into the mother-infant bond specifically in the context of anxiety and the representation of the infant in the mothers mind. These findings provide an opportunity to mechanistically investigate approaches to enhance the connectivity of these networks to optimize the representational and behavioral quality of the caregiving relationship."
