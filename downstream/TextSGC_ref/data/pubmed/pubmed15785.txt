Driver fatigue is attracting more and more attention as it is the main cause of traffic accidents which bring great harm to society and families. This paper proposes to use deep convolutional neural networks and deep residual learning to predict the mental states of drivers from electroencephalography EEG signals. Accordingly we have developed two mental state classification models called EEG-Conv and EEG-Conv-R. Tested on intra- and inter-subject our results show that both models outperform the traditional LSTM- and SVM-based classifiers. Our major findings include 1 Both EEG-Conv and EEG-Conv-R yield very good classification performance for mental state prediction; 2 EEG-Conv-R is more suitable for inter-subject mental state prediction; 3 EEG-Conv-R converges more quickly than EEG-Conv. In summary our proposed classifiers have better predictive power and are promising for application in practical brain-computer interaction .
