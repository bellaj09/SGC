The deep inferior epigastric artery perforator DIEAP flap became the gold standard in breast reconstruction but the dissection has a steep learning curve and the most demanding stage is the intramuscular dissection of the vascular pedicle. We present a retrograde technique to dissect the deep inferior epigastric pedicle that permits completion of the dissection and check the viability of the flap on one side before progressing to the other which can be used as a lifeboat. We consider this technique reliable safer than the conventional technique and a brilliant training model in DIEAP flap harvesting.
