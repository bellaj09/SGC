"Little research has been published about the impact of simulation technology on the learning process of novel motor skills. Especially the role of augmented feedback FB on the quality of performance and the transfer of the acquired behaviour to a no-augmented FB condition require further investigation. Therefore novice dental students were randomly assigned to one of three groups and given the task of drilling a geometrical class 1 cavity. The FB group trained under augmented visual FB conditions provided by the virtual reality VR system DentSim. The no-FB group practised under normal vision conditions in the absence of augmented FB. A control group performed the test sessions without participating in any training programme. All preparations were evaluated by the VR grading system according to four traditional outline shape floor depth floor smoothness and wall inclination and two critical criteria pulp exposure and damage to adjacent teeth. Performance analyses revealed an overall trend towards significant improvement with training for the experimental groups. The FB group obtained the highest scores. It scored better for floor depth P < 0.001 whilst the no-FB group was best for floor smoothness P < 0.005. However at the retention tests the FB group demonstrated inferior performance in comparison with the no-FB group. The transfer test on a traditional unit revealed no significant differences between the training groups. Consequently drilling experience on a VR system under the condition of frequently provided FB and lack of any tutorial input was considered to be not beneficial to learning. The present data are discussed in view of the guidance hypothesis of FB which refers to the apprentices dependence on FB."
