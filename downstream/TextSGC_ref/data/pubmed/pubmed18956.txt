We studied the electrophysiological basis of object recognition by recording scalp electroencephalograms while participants played a virtual-reality taxi driver game. Participants searched for passengers and stores during virtual navigation in simulated towns. We compared oscillatory brain activity in response to store views that were targets or nontargets during store search or neutral during passenger search. Even though store category was solely defined by task context rather than by sensory cues frontal electrophysiological activity in the low frequency bands primarily in the 4-8 Hz band reliably distinguished between the target nontarget and neutral store views. These results implicate low-frequency oscillatory brain activity in frontal regions as an important variable in the study of the cognitive processes involved in object recognition categorization and other forms of high-level perception. Electrophysiological correlates of high-level perception during spatial navigation.
