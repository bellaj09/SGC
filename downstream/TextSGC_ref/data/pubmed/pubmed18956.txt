"Cooperation between healthcare institutions on the subject of Information Technology in Healthcare is an important main objective in the region Delft Westland Oostland/Nieuwe Waterweg Noord in the mid-western part of the Netherlands. This is a densely populated area with approximately 1 million inhabitants. In 2004 a project to uniquely identify patients was initiated. The aim was to build a Regional Referral Index containing only general patient data which knows where patient information resides serving as the fundament of a regional Virtual Electronic Patient Record. Initially the Regional Referral Index was filled with the patient files from two hospitals in the region. A connection was made between the Regional Referral Index and the Hospital Information Systems. Since then the Regional Referral Index has been updated automatically. The patient files have been tested and matched in order to obtain a clean patient index. Since December 2005 the Regional Referral Index is operational and ready for further developments. Precautions are taken to guarantee patient privacy and security of data. Only authorized users will be given access to patient data. Administration and maintenance of this Regional Referral Index is arranged by establishing a Patient Information Point. Currently patient files of the other care providers in the region are being added and pilot projects to accomplish access to medical patient information are being realised. The regional activities run parallel and in line with national initiatives aiming to link up with these initiatives over time." Health information exchange on a regional level: dream or reality?
