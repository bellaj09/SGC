Small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels SK channels distributing in the nervous system play an important role in learning memory and synaptic plasticity. Most pharmacological properties of them are determined by short-chain scorpion toxins. Different from most voltage-gated potassium channels and large-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels SK channels are only inhibited by a small quantity of scorpion toxins. Recently a novel peptide screener in the extracellular pore entryway of SK channels was considered as the structural basis of toxin selective recognition. In this review we summarized the unique interactions between scorpion toxins and SK channels which is crucial not only in deep-researching for physiological function of SK channels but also in developing drugs for SK channel-related diseases. Unique interactions between scorpion toxins and small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels.
