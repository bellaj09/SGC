Previous work has examined whether immersive technologies can benefit learning in virtual environments but the potential benefits of technology in this context are confounded by individual differences such as spatial ability. We assessed spatial knowledge acquisition in male and female participants using a technology not previously examined empirically: the digital fulldome. Our primary aim was to examine whether performance on a test of survey knowledge was better in a fulldome N\u2009=\u200928 12 males relative to a large flat screen display N\u2009=\u200927 13 males. Regression analysis showed that compared to a flat screen display males showed higher levels of performance on a test of survey knowledge after learning in the fulldome but no benefit occurred for females. Furthermore performance correlated with spatial visualization ability in male participants but not in female participants. Thus the digital fulldome is a potentially useful learning aid capable of accommodating multiple users but individual differences and use of strategy need to be considered.
