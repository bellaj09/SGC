Combined source-imaging techniques and directional connectivity analysis can provide useful information about the underlying brain networks in a noninvasive fashion. Source-imaging techniques have been used successfully to either determine the source of activity or to extract source time-courses for Granger causality analysis previously. In this work we utilize source-imaging algorithms to both find the network nodes regions of interest ROI and then extract the activation time series for further Granger causality analysis. The aim of this work is to find network nodes objectively from noninvasive electromagnetic signals extract activation time-courses and apply Granger analysis on the extracted series to study brain networks under realistic conditions.
