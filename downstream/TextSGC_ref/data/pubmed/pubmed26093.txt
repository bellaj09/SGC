"Music is a way of expressing our feelings and emotions. Suitable music can positively affect people. However current multimedia control methods such as manual selection or automatic random mechanisms which are now applied broadly in MP3 and CD players cannot adaptively select suitable music according to the users physiological state. In this study a brain computer interface-based smart multimedia controller was proposed to select music in different situations according to the users physiological state. Here a commercial mobile tablet was used as the multimedia platform and a wireless multi-channel electroencephalograph EEG acquisition module was designed for real-time EEG monitoring. A smart multimedia control program built in the multimedia platform was developed to analyze the users EEG feature and select music according his/her state. The relationship between the users state and music sorted by listeners preference was also examined in this study. The experimental results show that real-time music biofeedback according a users EEG feature may positively improve the users attention state."
