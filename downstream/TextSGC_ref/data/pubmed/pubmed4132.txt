Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is associated with reduced executive functioning and verbal memory performance as well as abnormal task-specific activity in prefrontal cortex PFC and anterior cingulate cortices ACC. The current study examined how PTSD symptoms and neuropsychological performance in combat veterans relates to 1 medial PFC and ACC activity during cognitive inhibition and 2 task-independent PFC functional connectivity. PTSD and cognitive symptoms relate to inhibition-related prefrontal activation and functional connectivity.
