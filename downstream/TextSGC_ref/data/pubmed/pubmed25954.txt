In this work we share our experiences made at the world-wide first CYBATHLON an event organized by the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule Zrich ETH Zrich which took place in Zurich in October 2016. It is a championship for severely motor impaired people using assistive prototype devices to compete against each other. Our team the Graz BCI Racing Team MIRAGE91 from Graz University of Technology participated in the discipline "Brain-Computer Interface Race". A brain-computer interface BCI is a device facilitating control of applications via the user\s thoughts. Prominent applications include assistive technology such as wheelchairs neuroprostheses or communication devices. In the CYBATHLON BCI Race pilots compete in a BCI-controlled computer game. Cybathlon experiences of the Graz BCI racing team Mirage91 in the brain-computer interface discipline.
