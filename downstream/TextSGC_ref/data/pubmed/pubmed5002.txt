Over the last years the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis has developed into an attractive marine animal model for evolutionary developmental studies that offers several advantages over existing experimental organisms. It is easy to rear in laboratory conditions with embryos available year-round and amenable to numerous kinds of embryological and functional genetic manipulations. However beyond these developmental and genetic analyses research on the architecture of its nervous system is fragmentary. In order to provide a first neuroanatomical atlas of the brain we investigated P. hawaiensis using immunohistochemical labelings combined with laser-scanning microscopy X-ray microcomputed tomography histological sectioning and 3D reconstructions. The "amphi"-brains of amphipods: new insights from the neuroanatomy of Parhyale hawaiensis Dana 1853.
