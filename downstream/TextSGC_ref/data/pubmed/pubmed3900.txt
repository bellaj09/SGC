Autism spectrum disorder ASD is characterized by atypical brain network organization but findings have been inconsistent. While methodological and maturational factors have been considered the network specificity of connectivity abnormalities remains incompletely understood. We investigated intrinsic functional connectivity iFC for four "core" functional networks-default-mode DMN salience SN and left lECN and right executive control rECN. Resting-state functional MRI data from 75 children and adolescents 37 ASD 38 typically developing TD were included. Functional connectivity within and between networks was analyzed for regions of interest ROIs and whole brain compared between groups and correlated with behavioral scores. ROI analyses showed overconnectivity ASD > TD especially between DMN and ECN. Whole-brain results were mixed. While predominant overconnectivity was found for DMN posterior cingulate seed and rECN right inferior parietal seed predominant underconnectivity was found for SN right anterior insula seed and lECN left inferior parietal seed. In the ASD group reduced SN integrity was associated with sensory and sociocommunicative symptoms. In conclusion atypical connectivity in ASD is network-specific ranging from extensive overconnectivity DMN rECN to extensive underconnectivity SN lECN. Links between iFC and behavior differed between groups. Core symptomatology in the ASD group was predominantly related to connectivity within the salience network. Patterns of Atypical Functional Connectivity and Behavioral Links in Autism Differ Between Default Salience and Executive Networks.
