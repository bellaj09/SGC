Virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR have become valuable tools to study brains and behaviors resulting in development of new methods of diagnostics and treatment. Neurodegenertion is one of the best examples demonstrating efficacy of VR/R technologies in modern neurology. Development of novel VR systems for rodents and combination of VR tools with up-to-date imaging techniques i.e. MRI imaging of neural networks etc. brain electrophysiology EEG patch-clamp precise analytics microdialysis allowed implementing of VR protocols into the animal neurobiology to study brain plasticity sensorimotor integration spatial navigation memory and decision-making. VR/AR for rodents is  young field of experimental neuroscience and has already provided more consistent testing conditions less human-animal interaction opportunities to use a wider variety of experimental parameters. Here we discuss present and future perspectives of using VR/AR to assess brain plasticity neurogenesis and complex behavior in rodent and human study and their advantages for translational neuroscience. Current approaches to modeling the virtual reality in rodents for the assessment of brain plasticity and behavior.
