A deep learning algorithm to detect low ejection fraction EF using routine 12-lead electrocardiogram ECG has recently been developed and validated. The algorithm was incorporated into the electronic health record EHR to automatically screen for low EF encouraging clinicians to obtain a confirmatory transthoracic echocardiogram TTE for previously undiagnosed patients thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.
