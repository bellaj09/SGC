The P300-based brain-computer interface BCI is designed to help patients with motor disabilities to control their environment and it has been used successfully in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. However some ALS patients were unable to use the visual P300-BCI with the conventional row/column presentation. In this study we evaluated the effect of a newly developed region-based two-step P300 speller which has a larger flashing area than the conventional visual array. A region-based two-step P300-based brain-computer interface for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
