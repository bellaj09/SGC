The current study explored whether immersive virtual reality VR continues to reduce pain via distraction during more than one wound care session per patient. Thirty-six patients aged 8 to 57 years mean age 27.7 years with an average of 8.4% TBSA burned range 0.25-25.5 TBSA received bandage changes and wound cleaning. Each patient received one baseline wound cleaning/debridement session with no-VR control condition followed by one or more up to seven subsequent wound care sessions during VR. After each wound care session one session per day worst pain intensity was measured using a visual analog thermometer the dependent variable. Using a within-subjects design worst pain intensity during wound care with no-VR baseline day 0 was compared with pain during wound care while using immersive VR up to 7 days of wound care during VR. Compared with pain during no-VR baseline day 0 pain ratings during wound debridement were statistically lower when patients were in VR on days 1 2 and 3 and although not significant beyond day 3 the pattern of results from days 4 5 and 6 are consistent with the notion that VR continues to reduce pain when used repeatedly. Results from the present study suggest that VR continues to be effective when used for three or possibly more treatments during severe burn wound debridement. Repeated use of immersive virtual reality therapy to control pain during wound dressing changes in pediatric and adult burn patients.
