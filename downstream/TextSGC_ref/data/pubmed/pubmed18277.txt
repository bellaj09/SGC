"We report an experiment where participants observed an attack on their virtual body as experienced in an immersive virtual reality IVR system. Participants sat by a table with their right hand resting upon it. In IVR they saw a virtual table that was registered with the real one and they had a virtual body that substituted their real body seen from a first person perspective. The virtual right hand was collocated with their real right hand. Event-related brain potentials were recorded in two conditions one where the participants virtual hand was attacked with a knife and a control condition where the knife only struck the virtual table. Significantly greater P450 potentials were obtained in the attack condition confirming our expectations that participants had a strong illusion of the virtual hand being their own which was also strongly supported by questionnaire responses. Higher levels of subjective virtual hand ownership correlated with larger P450 amplitudes. Mu-rhythm event-related desynchronization in the motor cortex and readiness potential C3-C4 negativity were clearly observed when the virtual hand was threatened-as would be expected if the real hand was threatened and the participant tried to avoid harm. Our results support the idea that event-related potentials may provide a promising non-subjective measure of virtual embodiment. They also support previous experiments on pain observation and are placed into context of similar experiments and studies of body perception and body ownership within cognitive neuroscience." A threat to a virtual hand elicits motor cortex activation.
