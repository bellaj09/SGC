We present preliminary results from a virtual reality VR-based system for hand rehabilitation that uses a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove. This system trains finger range of motion finger flexion speed independence of finger motion and finger strength. Eight chronic post-stroke subjects participated. In keeping with variability in both the lesion site and in initial upper extremity function each subject showed improvement on a unique combination of movement parameters in VR training. These improvements transferred to gains on clinical tests as well as to significant reductions in task completion times for the prehension of real objects. These results are indicative of the potential feasibility of this exercise system for rehabilitation in patients with hand dysfunction resulting from neurological impairment.
