Aerobic exercise is associated with changes in brain morphology and improvement of cognitive functions. Physical activity may be especially important after age 60 when cognitive decline is more pronounced. In this paper the effect of chronic practice of aerobic sports was studied in old adults by assessing their executive and mnesic functions supported by frontal and temporal brain structures. Two groups were formed according to their age 60-69 and 70-79\u202fyears-old including sportsmen n\u202f=\u202f23 and sedentary men n\u202f=\u202f24. Spatial memory and efficiency of attentional networks were measured as well as general intelligence. Results showed that sportsmen outperformed sedentary participants in many of the tests employed. Thus their alerting orienting and executive networks worked more effectively in the ANT-I task for executive functions and they were more accurate in the spatial memory task displaying a better spatial orientation. Scores in other neuropsychological tasks followed the same tendency. These data support the protective effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive functions. Ten years younger: Practice of chronic aerobic exercise improves attention and spatial memory functions in ageing.
