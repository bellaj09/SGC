Structure-based drug design is becoming an essential tool for faster and more cost-efficient lead discovery relative to the traditional method. Genomic proteomic and structural studies have provided hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. This situation poses a major problem: the necessity to handle the "big data" generated by combinatorial chemistry. Artificial intelligence AI and deep learning play a pivotal role in the analysis and systemization of larger data sets by statistical machine learning methods. Advanced AI-based sophisticated machine learning tools have a significant impact on the drug discovery process including medicinal chemistry. In this review we focus on the currently available methods and algorithms for structure-based drug design including virtual screening and de novo drug design with a special emphasis on AI- and deep-learning-based methods used for drug discovery. A Structure-Based Drug Discovery Paradigm.
