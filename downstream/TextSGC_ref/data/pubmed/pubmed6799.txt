Neuroimaging studies have revealed brain functional abnormalities in frontal-mesolimbic regions in obesity. However the effects of obesity on brain network topology remains largely unknown. In the current study we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory methods to investigate obesity-related changes in brain network topology in 26 obese patients and 28 normal weight subjects. Results revealed that the whole-brain networks of the two groups exhibited typical features of small-world topology. Obese patients showed significantly increased shortest path length Lp and decreased global efficiency Eglob. Moreover decreased nodal-degree/efficiency was found in frontal medial orbitofrontal cortex-mOFC rostral anterior cingulate cortex-rACC striatal caudate/nucleus accumbens and limbic regions insula amygdala hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus in obese patients. Network-based statistics showed that a sub-network composed of 31 nodes and 30 edges was significantly disrupted in obese patients; 29 out of 30 connections were associated with the right rACC. In the obese group Lp and Eglob were negatively correlated with body mass index BMI P\u2009<\u20090.005 and BMI was negatively correlated with nodal-degree/efficiency of the mOFC P\u2009<\u20090.001. Findings suggest disruption of the small-world organization and a global reduction of integration of functional brain networks involving the right rACC in obesity and implicating the mOFC in mediating severity.
