"Using advanced virtual reality technology we demonstrate that exposure to virtual inclinations visually simulating inclined walking induces gait modulations in a manner consistent with expected gravitational forces i.e. acting upon a free body suggesting vision-based perception of gravity. The force of gravity critically impacts the regulation of our movements. However how humans perceive and incorporate gravity into locomotion is not well understood. In this study we introduce a novel paradigm for exposing humans to incongruent sensory information under conditions constrained by distinct gravitational effects facilitating analysis of the consistency of human locomotion with expected gravitational forces. Young healthy adults walked under conditions of actual physical inclinations as well as virtual inclinations. We identify and describe braking and exertion effects - locomotor adaptations accommodating gravito-inertial forces associated with physical inclines. We show that purely visual cues from virtual inclinations induce consistent locomotor adaptations to counter expected gravity-based changes consistent with indirect prediction mechanisms. Specifically downhill visual cues activate the braking effect in anticipation of a gravitational boost whereas uphill visual cues promote an exertion effect in anticipation of gravitational deceleration. Although participants initially rely upon vision to accommodate environmental changes a sensory reweighting mechanism gradually reprioritizes body-based cues over visual ones. A high-level neural model outlines a putative pathway subserving the observed effects. Our findings may be pivotal in designing virtual reality-based paradigms for understanding perception and action in complex environments with potential translational benefits."
