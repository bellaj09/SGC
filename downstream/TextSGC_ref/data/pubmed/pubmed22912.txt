"Virtual environments VEs let users navigate and interact with computer-generated three-dimensional 3-D environments in real time allowing for the control of complex stimuli presentation. These VEs have attracted much attention in medicine especially in remote or augmented surgery and surgical training which are critically dependent on hand-eye coordination. Recently however some research projects have begun to test the possibility of using VEs for the study and rehabilitation of human cognitive and functional activities. This paper highlights recent and ongoing research related to the applications of VEs in the neuroscience arena. In particular it focuses on the American and European initiatives in this field including a description of the European Commission EC-funded VREPAR projects. Finally the paper provides a general introduction to virtual reality VR as it relates to its impact on cognitive and functional abilities." Virtual environments in neuroscience.
