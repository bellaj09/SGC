Even though it has long been felt that psychological state influences the performance of brain-computer interfaces BCI formal analysis to support this hypothesis has been scant. This study investigates the inter-relationship between motor imagery MI and mental fatigue using EEG: a. whether prolonged sequences of MI produce mental fatigue and b. whether mental fatigue affects MI EEG class separability. Eleven participants participated in the MI experiment 5 of which quit in the middle because of experiencing high fatigue. The growth of fatigue was monitored using the Kernel Partial Least Square KPLS algorithm on the remaining 6 participants which shows that MI induces substantial mental fatigue. Statistical analysis of the effect of fatigue on motor imagery performance shows that high fatigue level significantly decreases MI EEG separability. Collectively these results portray an MI-fatigue inter-connection emphasizing the necessity of developing adaptive MI BCI by tracking mental fatigue.
