Virtual reality VR pain distraction has been applied across medical surgical and behavioral healthcare domains marking a shift in pain attenuation practices. However there is little research that has been performed to compare the efficacy of traditional head-mounted displays HMDs versus portable VR devices. The present study evaluated 44 outpatients in need of lipoma resection. Randomized into two groups-HMD versus mobile phone VR-participants navigated pain distraction virtual environments while undergoing surgery. Vital signs and subjective pain measurements via a visual analog scale were taken before during and after the surgery. Results indicate that the HMD group reported greater pain reduction than the Mobile group. Overall this study points to the efficacy of nonpharmacological pain attenuation practices. Although both systems reduced pain during surgery the clinically validated VR environments seen in the HMD group were more effective. This study does show that inexpensive solutions can work in surgical settings. Future research should be performed to identify the most effective VR pain distraction systems.
