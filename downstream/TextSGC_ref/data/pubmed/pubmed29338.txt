In this paper an asynchronous control paradigm based on sequential motor imagery sMI is proposed to enrich the control commands of a motor imagery -based brain-computer interface. We test the feasibility and report the performance of this paradigm in wheelchair navigation control. By sequentially imaging left- and right-hand movements the subjects can complete four sMI tasks in an asynchronous mode that are then encoded to control six steering functions of a wheelchair including moving forward turning left turning right accelerating decelerating and stopping. Two experiments a simulated experiment and an online wheelchair navigation experiment were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in seven subjects. In summary the subjects completed 99 of 105 experimental trials along a predefined route. The success rate was 94.2% indicating the practicality and the effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous control paradigm in wheelchair navigation control.
