"Competency in flexible endoscopy is a major goal of small animal internal medicine residency training programs. Hands-on laboratories to teach entry-level skills have traditionally used anesthetized laboratory dogs live dog laboratory LDL. Virtual-reality endoscopy trainers VRET are used for this purpose in human medicine with the clear benefits of avoiding live animal use decreasing trainee stress and allowing repeated independent training sessions. However there are currently no commercially available veterinary endoscopy simulators. The purpose of the study was to determine whether a human VRET can be a reasonable alternative to a LDL for teaching early veterinary endoscopy skills. Twelve veterinarians with limited or no endoscopy experience underwent training with a VRET n = 6 or a LDL n = 6 performed two recorded esophagogastroduodenoscopies EGD on anesthetized dogs for evaluation purposes outcomes laboratory and then underwent training with the alternative method. Participants completed questionnaires before any training and following each training session. No significant differences were found between training methods based on: measured parameters from the outcomes laboratory including duration of time to perform EGD; evaluators assessment of skills; and assessment of skills through blinded review of the esophageal portion of EGD recordings. The VRET was less stressful for participants than the LDL p = .02. All participants found that the VRET was a useful and acceptable alternative to the LDL for training of early endoscopy skills. Based on this limited study VRET can serve as a reasonable alternative to LDL for teaching endoscopy skills to veterinarians."
