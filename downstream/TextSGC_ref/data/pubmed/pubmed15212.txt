Updating navigational memories is important for everyday tasks. It was recently found that older adults are impaired in updating spatial representations in small bi-dimensional layouts. Because performance in small-scale areas cannot predict navigational behavior we investigated how aging affects the updating of navigational memories encoded in large 3-dimensional environments. Moreover since locations can be encoded relative to the observer egocentric encoding or relative to landmarks allocentric encoding we tested whether the presumed age-related spatial updating deficit depends on the available spatial cues. By combining whole-body motion tracking with immersive virtual reality we could dissociate egocentric and allocentric spatial cues and assess navigational memory under ecologically valid conditions i.e. providing body-based and visual cues. In the task objects were relocated overnight and young and older participants had to navigate to the updated locations of the objects. In addition to replicating age-related deficits in allocentric memory we found age-related impairments in updating navigational memories following egocentric encoding. Finally older participants depicted stronger representations of the previous navigational context that were correlated with their spatial updating deficits. Given that these effects may stem from inefficient suppression of former navigational memories our findings propose a mechanism that helps explain the navigational decline in aging. Aging and spatial cues influence the updating of navigational memories.
