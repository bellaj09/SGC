"Brain-Computer Interface BCI research and future applications raise important ethical issues that need to be addressed to promote societal acceptance and adequate policies. Here we report on a survey we conducted among 145 BCI researchers at the 4th International BCI conference which took place in May-June 2010 in Asilomar California. We assessed respondents opinions about a number of topics. First we investigated preferences for terminology and definitions relating to BCIs. Second we assessed respondents expectations on the marketability of different BCI applications BCIs for healthy people BCIs for assistive technology BCIs-controlled neuroprostheses and BCIs as therapy tools. Third we investigated opinions about ethical issues related to BCI research for the development of assistive technology: informed consent process with locked-in patients risk-benefit analyses team responsibility consequences of BCI on patients and families lives liability and personal identity and interaction with the media. Finally we asked respondents which issues are urgent in BCI research." "The Asilomar Survey: Stakeholders Opinions on Ethical Issues Related to Brain-Computer Interfacing."
