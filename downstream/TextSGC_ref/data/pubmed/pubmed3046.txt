In recent years a large amount of data was published about resting state networks RSN namely continu- ously recorded brain activity in a state of quiet wakefulness. In particular such states are reflected in the spa- tial maps of active regions of the brain obtained by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. RSNs have stable and reproducible spatial structure over time in healthy subjects but may differ substantially in clinical pathology. One of the important parameters of the brain activity is functional connectivity FC of individual elements within a network or between resting state networks. This review considers results of the studies focused at correlation of behavioral indicators and FC of brain areas activated during resting state. In addition we describe data on reproducibility of RSN over time in healthy subjects as well as data on changes in FC-of networks depending on the individual experience.
