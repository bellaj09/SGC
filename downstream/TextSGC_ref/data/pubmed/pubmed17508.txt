"Virtual reality VR simulation training can improve temporal bone TB cadaver dissection skills and distributed self-regulated practice is optimal for skills consolidation. Decentralized training DT at the trainees own department or home offers more convenient access compared with centralized VR simulation training where the simulators are localized at one facility. The effect of DT in TB surgical training is unknown. We investigated the effect of decentralized VR simulation training of TB surgery on subsequent cadaver dissection performance."
