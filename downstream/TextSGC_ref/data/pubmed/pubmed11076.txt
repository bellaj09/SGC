The prediction of protein folding rates is of paramount importance in describing the protein folding mechanism which has broad applications in fields such as enzyme engineering and protein engineering. Therefore predicting protein folding rates using the first-order of protein sequence secondary structure and amino acid properties has become a very active research topic in recent years. This paper presents a new fuzzy cognitive map FCM model based on deep learning neural networks which uses data obtained from biological experiments to predict the protein folding rate. FCM extracts the important data features from the protein sequence which then initializes the deep neural networks effectively. It was found that the Levenberg-Marquardt LM algorithm for deep neural networks can improve the prediction accuracy of the protein folding rates. The correlation coefficient between the predicted values and those real values obtained from experiments reached 0.94 and 0.9 in two independent numerical tests. A novel model-based on FCM-LM algorithm for prediction of protein folding rate.
