"Parkinsons disease PD is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. The diagnosis of PD based on neuroimaging is usually with low-level or deep learning features which results in difficulties in achieving precision classification or interpreting the clinical significance. Herein we aimed to extract high-order features by using radiomics approach and achieve acceptable diagnosis accuracy in PD." "Use of radiomic features and support vector machine to distinguish Parkinsons disease cases from normal controls."
