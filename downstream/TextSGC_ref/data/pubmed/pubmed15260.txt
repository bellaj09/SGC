The automatic and unsupervised analysis of biomedical time series is of primary importance for diagnostic and preventive medicine enabling fast and reliable data processing to reveal clinical insights without the need for human intervention. Representation learning RL methods perform an automatic extraction of meaningful features that can be used e.g. for a subsequent classification of the measured data. The goal of this study is to explore and quantify the benefits of RL techniques of varying degrees of complexity focusing on modern deep learning DL architectures. We focus on the automatic classification of atrial fibrillation AF events from noisy single-lead electrocardiographic signals ECG obtained from wireless sensors. This is an important task as it allows the detection of sub-clinical AF which is hard to diagnose with a short in-clinic 12-lead ECG. The effectiveness of the considered architectures is quantified and discussed in terms of classification performance memory/data efficiency and computational complexity.
