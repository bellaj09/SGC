After experiencing a stroke in the right hemisphere almost 50% of patients show unilateral spatial neglect USN. Virtual Reality technologies offer impressive opportunities for both the rehabilitation and assessment of different cognitive deficits including USN. A 57-year-old woman affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage presented a severe left hemiparesis with severe cognitive and behavioral alterations including temporal and spatial disorientation reduction of attention and memory process slowing ideation USN and depression of mood. She underwent two different rehabilitation trainings including standard cognitive training SCT in addition to semi-immersive virtual training with her shadow S-IVT_s and SCT in addition to a Semi- immersive virtual training without her shadow S-IVT. The patient was assessed before and after each of the two different trainings by using a specific psychometric battery and the event related potential P300. Only at the end of the use of the S-IVT we observed a significant improvement in the motor and cognitive function with regard to USN. SCT in addition to S-IVT with Bts-Nirvana System may be a promising approach in improving attention process spatial cognition and mood in patients with post stroke USN as also demonstrated by the electrophysiological parameters.
