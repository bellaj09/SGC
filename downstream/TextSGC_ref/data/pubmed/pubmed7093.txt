The reconstruction of gene regulatory network GRN from gene expression data can discover regulatory relationships among genes and gain deep insights into the complicated regulation mechanism of life. However it is still a great challenge in systems biology and bioinformatics. During the past years numerous computational approaches have been developed for this goal and Bayesian network BN methods draw most of attention among these methods because of its inherent probability characteristics. However Bayesian network methods are time consuming and cannot handle large-scale networks due to their high computational complexity while the mutual information-based methods are highly effective but directionless and have a high false-positive rate. An improved Bayesian network method for reconstructing gene regulatory network based on candidate auto selection.
