The Virtual Environments Laboratory at the University of Southern California USC has initiated a research program aimed at developing virtual reality VR technology applications for the study assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive processes. This technology is seen to offer many advantages for these aims. The status of two ongoing VR projects will be discussed in this article. The projects outlined are being conducted via cooperative efforts with both the Integrated Media Systems Center and the Information Sciences Institute at USC. These departments consist of a multidisciplinary group of scientists that represents engineering computer science communications information technology education and psychology. This mix of expertise has served to facilitate the development of these projects via an integrated approach to VR application development. The first project involves the development of a series of ImmersaDesk-delivered visuospatial tests and training tools that leverage the interactive dynamic and 3D assets that are available with current VR technology. The second project involves a head mounted display HMD VR system for the study assessment and possible rehabilitation of attention disorders. It is believed that these projects target cognitive variables that are well matched to the current strengths and limitations that exist with presently available VR technology.
