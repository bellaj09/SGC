Simulated environments are increasingly being used to evaluate human behavior in a wide variety of situations. These virtual environments are particularly useful in the study of behavior involving dangerous conditions. Quantifying the impact of these environments on the subject is essential to validate the efficacy of the simulation as a virtualization of reality. We have developed a prototypical environment that simulates a common agricultural setting that provides the potential for acute injuries. We report on an exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy of our design to illicit a sense of realism and subsequently evoke a physiological response of anxiety in the subject. We present on the components that comprise the environment our study design and preliminary results. Evaluating elicited anxiety in a simulated environment.
