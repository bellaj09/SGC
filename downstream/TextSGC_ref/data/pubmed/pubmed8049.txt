"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN is a proven and effective therapy for the management of the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD. While accurate positioning of the stimulating electrode is critical for success of this therapy precise identification of the STN based on imaging can be challenging. We developed a method to accurately visualize the STN on a standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The method incorporates a database of 7-Tesla T MRIs of PD patients together with machine-learning methods hereafter 7\u2009T-ML."
