We first give a brief introduction to graph theoretical analysis and its application to the study of brain network topology or connectomics. Within this framework we review the existing empirical data on developmental changes in brain network organization across a range of experimental modalities including structural and functional MRI diffusion tensor imaging magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans. Annual research review: Growth connectomics--the organization and reorganization of brain networks during normal and abnormal development.
