First trimester human villous vascularization is mainly studied by conventional two-dimensional 2D microscopy. With this 2D technique it is not possible to observe the spatial arrangement of the haemangioblastic cords and vessels transition of cords into vessels and the transition of vasculogenesis to angiogenesis. The Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy CLSM allows for a three-dimensional 3D reconstruction of images of early pregnancy villous vascularization. These 3D reconstructions however are normally analyzed on a 2D medium lacking depth perception. We performed a descriptive morphologic study using an immersive Virtual Reality system to utilize the full third dimension completely. This innovative 3D technique visualizes 3D datasets as enlarged 3D holograms and provided detailed insight in the spatial arrangement of first trimester villous vascularization the beginning of lumen formation within various junctions of haemangioblastic cords between 5 and 7 weeks gestational age and in the gradual transition of vasculogenesis to angiogenesis. This innovative immersive Virtual Reality system enables new perspectives for vascular research and will be implemented for future investigation.
