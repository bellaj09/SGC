"Parkinsons disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various motor symptoms including balance and gait impairment. Several studies have shown that physiotherapy cueing techniques treadmill training and cognitive movement strategies are useful in improving balance and gait in patients with PD. Devices employing virtual reality VR have been shown to be promising in neurorehabilitation as they can provide the patients with multisensory stimulation creating a realistic environment and improve the motivation and the adhesion of patients to the rehabilitation program. This preliminary study is aimed at testing the efficacy and feasibility of gait training based on the computer-assisted virtual reality environment CAREN in a sample of PD."
