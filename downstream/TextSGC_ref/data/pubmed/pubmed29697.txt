Understanding how the brain controls movements is a critical issue in neuroscience. The role of brain changes rapidly according to movement states. To elucidate the motor control mechanism of brain it is essential to investigate the changes in brain network in motor-related regions according to movement states. Therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the brain network transitions according to movement states. We measured whole brain magnetoencephalography MEG signals and extracted source signals in 24 motor-related areas. Functional connectivity and centralities were calculated according to time flow. Our results showed that brain networks differed between states of motor planning and movement. Connectivities between most motor-related areas were increased in the motor-planning state. In contrast only connectivities with cerebellum and basal ganglia were increased while those of other motor-related areas were decreased during movement. Our results indicate that most processes involved in motor control are completed before movement. Further brain developed network related to feedback rather than motor decision during movements. Our findings also suggest that neural signals during motor planning might be more predictive than neural signals during movement. They facilitate accurate prediction of movement for brain-machine interfaces and provide insight into brain mechanisms in motor control.
