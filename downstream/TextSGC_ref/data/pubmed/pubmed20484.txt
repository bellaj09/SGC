Sixty percent to 70% of pedestrian injuries in children under the age of 10 years are the result of the child either improperly crossing intersections or dashing out in the street between intersections. The purpose of this injury prevention research study was to evaluate a desktop virtual reality VR program that was designed to educate and train children to safely cross intersections. Specifically the objectives were to determine whether children can learn pedestrian safety skills while working in a virtual environment and whether pedestrian safety learning in VR transfers to real world behavior. Following focus groups with a number of key experts a virtual city with eight interactive intersections was developed. Ninety-five children participated in a community trial from two schools urban and suburban. Approximately half were assigned to a control group who received an unrelated VR program and half received the pedestrian safety VR intervention. Children were identified by group and grade by colored tags on their backpacks and actual street crossing behavior of all children was observed 1 week before and 1 week after the interventions. There was a significant change in performance after three trials with the VR intervention. Children learned safe street crossing within the virtual environment. Learning identified as improved street-crossing behavior transferred to real world behavior in the suburban school children but not in the urban school. The results are discussed in relation to possibilities for future VR interventions for injury prevention. Effectiveness of virtual reality for teaching pedestrian safety.
