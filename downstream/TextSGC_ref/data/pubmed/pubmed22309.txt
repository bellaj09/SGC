"Ubiquity of Alzheimers disease AD coupled with relatively ineffectual pharmacologic treatments has spurred interest in nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions for prevention or risk reduction. However evidence of neuroplasticity notwithstanding there are few scientifically rigorous ecologically relevant brain training studies focused on building cognitive reserve in middle age to protect against cognitive decline. This pilot study will examine the ability of virtual reality VR cognitive training to improve cognition and cerebral blood flow CBF in middle-aged individuals at high AD risk due to parental history."
