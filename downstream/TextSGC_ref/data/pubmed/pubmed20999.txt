In light of the technological social and political changes taking place in the world today it is important that nurses are not just culturally competent but globally informed and engaged. The goal of this paper is to help nurses help their patients and themselves to benefit from globalization. The use of guided simulation virtual reality and augmented reality learning experiences is considered for each of five areas of global nursing; global aesthetics global intelligence global ethics global politics and global health. This approach invites nurses and student nurses to discern new patterns take charge of their learning and build multiple iterations to facilitate the processing of new and different information and "realities."
