Virtual reality robotic simulation has gained widespread momentum. In order to determine the value of virtual reality robotic simulation and its objective metrics a reality-based robotic surgical training platform with similar analytic capabilities must be developed and validated. The ProMIS laparoscopic surgical simulator is a widely available reality-based simulation platform that has been previously validated as an objective measure of laparoscopic task performance. In this study we evaluated the validity of the ProMIS laparoscopic surgical simulator as an objective measure of robotic task performance. Volunteers were recruited from two experience groups novice and expert. All subjects completed three tasks peg transfer precision cutting intracorporeal suture/knot in the ProMIS laparoscopic simulator using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. Motion analysis data was obtained by the ProMIS computerized optical tracking system and objective metrics recorded included time path length economy of motion and observer-recorded penalty scores. The novice group consisted of 10 subjects with no previous robotic surgical experience. The expert group consisted of 10 subjects with robotic experience. The expert group outperformed the novice group in all three tasks. Subjects rated this training platform as easy to use as an accurate measure of their robotic surgical proficiency and as relevant to robotic surgery. The experts described the simulator platform as useful for training and agreed with incorporating it into a residency curriculum. This study demonstrates that the ProMIS laparoscopic simulator is a face content and construct valid reality-based simulation platform that can be used for objectively measuring robotic task performance. Initial validation of the ProMIS surgical simulator as an objective measure of robotic task performance.
