Multi-scale virtual environments contain geometric details ranging over several orders of magnitude and typically employ out-of-core rendering techniques. When displayed in virtual reality systems this entails using a 7 degree-of-freedom DOF view model where view scale is a separate 7th DOF in addition to 6DOF view pose. Dynamic adjustment of this and other view parameters become very important to usability. In this paper we evaluate how two adjustment techniques interact with uni- and bi-manual 7DOF navigation in DesktopVR and a CAVE. The travel task has two stages an initial targeted zoom and a detailed geometric inspection. The results show benefits of the auto-adjustments on completion time and stereo fusion issues but only in certain circumstances. Peculiar view configuration examples show the difficulty of creating robust adjustment rules. Multi-Scale 7DOF View Adjustment.
