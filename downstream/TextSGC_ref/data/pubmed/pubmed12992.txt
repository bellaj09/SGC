Genotyping-by sequencing has enabled approaches for genomic selection to improve yield stress resistance and nutritional value. More and more resource studies are emerging providing 1000 and more genotypes and millions of SNPs of one species and covering a hitherto inaccessible intraspecific genetic variation. The larger the databases are growing the better statistical approaches for genomic selection will be. However there are clear limitations on the statistical but also on the biological part. Intraspecific genetic variation is able to explain a high proportion of the phenotypes but a large part of phenotypic plasticity also stems from environmentally-driven post-transcriptional translational post-translational epigenetic and metabolic regulation. Moreover the same gene regulation can have different phenotypic outputs in different environments. Consequently to explain and understand environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity based on the available genotype variation we have to integrate the analysis of further molecular levels reflecting the complete information flow from the gene to metabolism to phenotype. Interestingly metabolomics platforms are already more cost-effective than NGS platforms and are decisive for prediction of nutritional value or stress resistance. Here we propose three fundamental pillars for future breeding strategies in the framework of Green Systems Biology: i Combining genome selection with environment-dependent PANOMICS analysis and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy for marker-dependent trait performance. ii PANOMICS resolution at sub-tissue cellular and subcellular level provides information about fundamental functions of selected markers. iii Combining PANOMICS with genome editing and speed breeding tools to accelerate and enhance large scale functional validation of trait-specific precision breeding. PANOMICS meets Germplasm.
