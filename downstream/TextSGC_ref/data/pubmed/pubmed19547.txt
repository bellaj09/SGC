The visual system exploits multiple signals including monocular and binocular cues to determine the motion of objects through depth. In the laboratory sensitivity to different three-dimensional 3D motion cues varies across observers and is often weak for binocular cues. However laboratory assessments may reflect factors beyond inherent perceptual sensitivity. For example the appearance of weak binocular sensitivity may relate to extensive prior experience with two-dimensional 2D displays in which binocular cues are not informative. Here we evaluated the impact of experience on motion-in-depth MID sensitivity in a virtual reality VR environment. We tested a large cohort of observers who reported having no prior VR experience and found that binocular cue sensitivity was substantially weaker than monocular cue sensitivity. As expected sensitivity was greater when monocular and binocular cues were presented together than in isolation. Surprisingly the addition of motion parallax signals appeared to cause observers to rely almost exclusively on monocular cues. As observers gained experience in the VR task sensitivity to monocular and binocular cues increased. Notably most observers were unable to distinguish the direction of MID based on binocular cues above chance level when tested early in the experiment whereas most showed statistically significant sensitivity to binocular cues when tested late in the experiment. This result suggests that observers may discount binocular cues when they are first encountered in a VR environment. Laboratory assessments may thus underestimate the sensitivity of inexperienced observers to MID especially for binocular cues. Cue-dependent effects of VR experience on motion-in-depth sensitivity.
