Studies on antisocial personality disorder ASPD subjects focus on brain functional alterations in relation to antisocial behaviors. Neuroimaging research has identified a number of focal brain regions with abnormal structures or functions in ASPD. However little is known about the connections among brain regions in terms of inter-regional whole-brain networks in ASPD patients as well as possible alterations of brain functional topological organization. In this study we employ resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI to examine functional connectome of 32 ASPD patients and 35 normal controls by using a variety of network properties including small-worldness modularity and connectivity. The small-world analysis reveals that ASPD patients have increased path length and decreased network efficiency which implies a reduced ability of global integration of whole-brain functions. Modularity analysis suggests ASPD patients have decreased overall modularity merged network modules and reduced intra- and inter-module connectivities related to frontal regions. Also network-based statistics show that an internal sub-network composed of 16 nodes and 16 edges is significantly affected in ASPD patients where brain regions are mostly located in the fronto-parietal control network. These results suggest that ASPD is associated with both reduced brain integration and segregation in topological organization of functional brain networks particularly in the fronto-parietal control network. These disruptions may contribute to disturbances in behavior and cognition in patients with ASPD. Our findings may provide insights into a deeper understanding of functional brain networks of ASPD.
