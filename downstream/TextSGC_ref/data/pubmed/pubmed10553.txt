"Self-determination theory has shown that autonomy support in the classroom is associated with an increase of students intrinsic motivation. Moreover intrinsic motivation is related with positive outcomes. This study examines the relationships between autonomy support intrinsic motivation to learn and two motivational consequences deep learning and vitality. Specifically the hypotheses were that autonomy support predicts the two types of consequences and that autonomy support directly and indirectly predicts the vitality and the deep learning through intrinsic motivation to learn. Participants were 276 undergraduate students. The mean age was 21.80 years SD = 2.94. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between variables and delta method was used to analyze the mediating effect of intrinsic motivation to learn. Results indicated that student perception of autonomy support had a positive effect on deep learning and vitality p < .001. In addition these associations were mediated by intrinsic motivation to learn. These findings suggest that teachers are key elements in generating of autonomy support environment to promote intrinsic motivation deep learning and vitality in classroom. Educational implications are discussed." The Mediating Effect of Intrinsic Motivation to Learn on the Relationship between Students Autonomy Support and Vitality and Deep Learning.
