The use of IoT Internet of Things technology for the management of pet dogs left alone at home is increasing. This includes tasks such as automatic feeding operation of play equipment and location detection. Classification of the vocalizations of pet dogs using information from a sound sensor is an important method to analyze the behavior or emotions of dogs that are left alone. These sounds should be acquired by attaching the IoT sound sensor to the dog and then classifying the sound events e.g. barking growling howling and whining. However sound sensors tend to transmit large amounts of data and consume considerable amounts of power which presents issues in the case of resource-constrained IoT sensor devices. In this paper we propose a way to classify pet dog sound events and improve resource efficiency without significant degradation of accuracy. To achieve this we only acquire the intensity data of sounds by using a relatively resource-efficient noise sensor. This presents issues as well since it is difficult to achieve sufficient classification accuracy using only intensity data due to the loss of information from the sound events. To address this problem and avoid significant degradation of classification accuracy we apply long short-term memory-fully convolutional network LSTM-FCN which is a deep learning method to analyze time-series data and exploit bicubic interpolation. Based on experimental results the proposed method based on noise sensors i.e. Shapelet and LSTM-FCN for time-series was found to improve energy efficiency by 10 times without significant degradation of accuracy compared to typical methods based on sound sensors i.e. mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient MFCC spectrogram and mel-spectrum for feature extraction and support vector machine SVM and k-nearest neighbor K-NN for classification.
