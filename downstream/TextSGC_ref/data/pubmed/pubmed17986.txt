"This study examined the relative influence of environmental variables corridor width and brightness and signage directional and exit signs when presented in competition on participants route-choices in two situational variables everyday vs. emergency during indoor wayfinding in virtual environments. A virtual reality-based methodology was used. Thus participants attempted to find a room everyday situation in a virtual hotel followed by a fire-related emergency egress emergency situation. Different behaviours were observed. In the everyday situation for no-signs condition participants choose mostly the wider and brighter corridors suggesting a heavy reliance on the environmental affordances. Conversely for signs condition participants mostly complied with signage suggesting a greater reliance on the signs rather than on the environmental cues. During emergency without signage reliance on environmental affordances seems to be affected by the intersection type. In the sign condition the reliance on environmental affordances that started strong decreases along the egress route." Effects of competing environmental variables and signage on route-choices in simulated everyday and emergency wayfinding situations.
