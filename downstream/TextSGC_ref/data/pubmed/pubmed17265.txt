"National Institutes of Health NIH funding has contributed to improvements in the health of the nation but the pace of progress particularly in the war on cancer has been frustratingly slow. Departments of family medicine receive less NIH funding than all other specialties. Although numerous factors contribute to low family medicine funding levels persistent undervaluing of primary care plays a paramount role. Fueled by the harsh reality that our nations health is unconscionably poor we are entering a new era in our nations research enterprise a virtual research revolution. The 3 components of this revolution are the NIH roadmap personalized medicine and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. Each of these elements will contribute to a growing emphasis on translational research. Translational research demands formation of innovative structures in academic health centers AHCs to enable them to address questions of vital relevance to improving public health. Service research funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and foundations defines a new approach to research with high potential to improve the health of communities. To be a part of the research revolution departments must rely on senior researchers to secure funding and provide mentorship for junior investigators. Junior investigators must relentlessly pursue answers to questions of direct relevance to improving health. Finally department chairs have the obligation to identify research mentors find ways to fund research gaps and create a culture of scholarship and investigation. Advocating for AHCs to commit to improving the health of the regions they serve can have a substantial impact on the types of questions that centers choose to study and ultimately on the health of the communities they serve."
