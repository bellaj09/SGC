"Universal design principles advocate inclusion of end users in every design stage including research and development. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have long been described as potential tools to enable people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS to operate technology without moving. Therefore the objective of the current study is to determine the opinions and priorities of people with ALS regarding BCI design. This information will guide BCIs in development to meet end-user needs. A telephone survey was undertaken of 61 people with ALS from the University of Michigans Motor Neuron Disease Clinic. With regard to BCI design participants prioritized accuracy of command identification of at least 90% satisfying 84% of respondents speed of operation comparable to at least 15-19 letters per minute satisfying 72% and accidental exits from a standby mode not more than once every 2-4 h satisfying 84%. While 84% of respondents would accept using an electrode cap 72% were willing to undergo outpatient surgery and 41% to undergo surgery with a short hospital stay in order to obtain a BCI. In conclusion people with ALS expressed a strong interest in obtaining BCIs but current BCIs do not yet provide desired BCI performance." What would brain-computer interface users want? Opinions and priorities of potential users with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
