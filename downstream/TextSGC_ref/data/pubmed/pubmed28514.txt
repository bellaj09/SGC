"The hemodynamic response measured by Near Infrared Spectroscopy NIRS is temporally delayed from the onset of the underlying neural activity. As a consequence NIRS based brain-computer-interfaces BCIs and neurofeedback learning systems may have a latency of several seconds in responding to a change in participants behavioral or mental states severely limiting the practical use of such systems. To explore the possibility of reducing this delay we used a multivariate pattern classification technique linear support vector machine SVM to decode the true behavioral state from the measured neural signal and systematically evaluated the performance of different feature spaces signal history history gradient oxygenated or deoxygenated hemoglobin signal and spatial pattern. We found that the latency to decode a change in behavioral state can be reduced by 50% from 4.8 s to 2.4 s which will enhance the feasibility of NIRS for real-time applications."
