"Although alterations of topological organization have previously been reported in the brain functional network of Parkinsons disease PD patients the topological properties of the brain network in early-stage PD patients who received antiparkinson treatment are largely unknown. This study sought to determine the topological characteristics of the large-scale functional network in early-stage PD patients. First 26early-stage PD patients Hoehn and Yahr stage:1-2 and 30 age-matched normal controls were scanned using resting-state functional MRI. Subsequently graph theoretical analysis was employed to investigate the abnormal topological configuration of the brain network in early-stage PD patients. We found that both the PD patient and control groups showed small-world properties in their functional brain networks. However compared with the controls the early-stage PD patients exhibited abnormal global properties characterized by lower global efficiency. Moreover the modular structure and the hub distribution were markedly altered in early-stage PD patients. Furthermore PD patients exhibited increased nodal centrality primarily in the bilateral pallidum the inferior parietal lobule and the medial superior frontal gyrus and decreased nodal centrality in the caudate nucleus the supplementary motor areas the precentral gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. There were significant negative correlations between the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores and nodal centralities of superior parietal gyrus. These results suggest that the topological organization of the brain functional network was altered in early-stage PD patients who received antiparkinson treatment and we speculated that the antiparkinson treatment may affect the efficiency of the brain network to effectively relieve clinical symptoms of PD."
