"It is common wisdom that practice makes perfect; but why do some adults learn better than others? Here we investigate individuals cognitive and social profiles to test which variables account for variability in learning ability across the lifespan. In particular we focused on visual learning using tasks that test the ability to inhibit distractors and select task-relevant features. We tested the ability of young and older adults to improve through training in the discrimination of visual global forms embedded in a cluttered background. Further we used a battery of cognitive tasks and psycho-social measures to examine which of these variables predict training-induced improvement in perceptual tasks and may account for individual variability in learning ability. Using partial least squares regression modeling we show that visual learning is influenced by cognitive i.e. cognitive inhibition attention and social strategic and deep learning factors rather than an individuals age alone. Further our results show that independent of age strong learners rely on cognitive factors such as attention while weaker learners use more general cognitive strategies. Our findings suggest an important role for higher-cognitive circuits involving executive functions that contribute to our ability to improve in perceptual tasks after training across the lifespan."
