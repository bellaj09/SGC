Understanding brain-wide neuronal dynamics requires a detailed map of the underlying circuit architecture. We built an interactive cellular-resolution atlas of the zebrafish brain at 6\xa0days post-fertilization dpf based on the reconstructions of over 2000 individually GFP-labeled neurons. We clustered our dataset in "morphotypes" establishing a unique database of quantitatively described neuronal morphologies together with their spatial coordinates in\xa0vivo. Over 100 transgene expression patterns were imaged separately and co-registered with the single-neuron atlas. By annotating 72 non-overlapping brain regions we generated from our dataset an inter-areal wiring diagram of the larval brain which serves as ground truth for synapse-scale electron microscopic reconstructions. Interrogating our atlas by "virtual tract tracing" has already revealed previously unknown wiring principles in the tectum and the cerebellum. In conclusion we present here an evolving computational resource and visualization tool which will be essential to map function to structure in a vertebrate brain. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
