Independent component analysis ICA is a widely used technique for investigating functional connectivity fc in functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Masked independent component analysis mICA that is ICA restricted to a defined region of interest has been shown to detect local fc networks in particular brain regions including the cerebellum brainstem posterior cingulate cortex operculo-insular cortex hippocampus and spinal cord. Here we present the mICA toolbox an open-source GUI toolbox based on FSL command line tools that performs mICA and related analyses in an integrated way. Functions include automated mask generation from atlases essential preprocessing mICA-based parcellation back-reconstruction of whole-brain fc networks from local ones and reproducibility analysis. Automated slice-wise calculation and cropping are additional functions that reduce computational time and memory requirements for large analyses. To validate our toolbox we tested these different functions on the cerebellum hippocampus and brainstem using resting-state and task-based data from the Human Connectome Project. In the cerebellum mICA detected six local networks together with their whole-brain counterparts closely replicating previous results. MICA-based parcellation of the hippocampus showed a longitudinally discrete configuration with greater heterogeneity in the anterior hippocampus consistent with animal and human literature. Finally brainstem mICA detected motor and sensory nuclei involved in the motor task of tongue movement thereby replicating and extending earlier results. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3544-3556 2016.
