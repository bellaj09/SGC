"The authors goal was to develop a computer graphics model to represent the microsurgical anatomy of the basilar artery BA bifurcation and surrounding structures to simulate surgery of a BA bifurcation aneurysm performed via the transsylvian approach. The source of the input data was a variety of publications that showed detailed anatomy of the area. A computer graphics model of the area near the BA bifurcation including relevant structures such as perforating branches or cranial nerves was depicted in detail. A BA bifurcation aneurysm was added to the computer graphics model and it was rotated to simulate the transsylvian approach. After the internal carotid artery was displaced using a virtual retractor the aneurysm was exposed thus providing an understanding of the three-dimensional surgical orientation of the area. Designing a standard anatomical model on the basis of data culled from a variety of publications and adding morphological changes by using a virtual retractor to displace structures that obstruct the view along a critical path at the base of the brain are useful strategies of computer manipulation for surgical simulation in open microneurosurgery. This methodological tool would be useful in teaching surgical microanatomy and in introducing a new navigational system for virtual reality. Both concept and technical details are discussed."
