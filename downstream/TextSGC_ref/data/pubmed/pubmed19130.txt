Moving platforms were introduced in the field of the study of posturography since the 1970s. Commercial platforms have some limits: a limited number of degrees of freedom pre-configured protocols and usually they are expensive. In order to overcome these limits we developed a robotic platform: Dynamic Oriented Rehabilitative Integrated System DORIS. We aimed at realizing a versatile solution that can be applied both for research purposes but also for personalizing the training of equilibrium and gait. We reached these goals by means of a Stewart platform that was realized with linear actuators and a supporting plate. Each actuator is provided by an ad hoc built monoaxial load cell. Position control allows a large range of movements and load cells measure the reactive force applied by the subject. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol TCP/IP guarantees the communication between the platform and other systems. We integrated DORIS with a motion analysis system an electromyography EMG system and a virtual reality environment VR. This integration and the custom design of the platform offer the opportunity to manipulate the available information of the subject under analysis which uses visual vestibular and plantar feet pressure inputs. The full access to the human movements and to the dynamic interaction is a further benefit for the identification of innovative solutions for research and physical rehabilitation purposes in a field that is widely investigated but still open.
