Classification of optical coherence tomography OCT images can be achieved with high accuracy using classical convolution neural networks CNN a commonly used deep learning network for computer-aided diagnosis. Classical CNN has often been criticized for suppressing positional relations in a pooling layer. Therefore because capsule networks can learn positional information from images we attempted application of a capsule network to OCT images to overcome that shortcoming. This study is our attempt to improve classification accuracy by replacing CNN with a capsule network. Classification of optical coherence tomography images using a capsule network.
