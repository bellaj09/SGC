A large body of literature supports the effectiveness of using video simulations to improve decision-making skills in invasion sports. However whether these improvements are transferable from the laboratory to the court/field and generalizable from trained to untrained plays remains unknown. In addition it remains to be determined whether presenting the video simulations using virtual reality provides an added-value. To investigate these questions varsity-level basketball players underwent four training sessions during which they observed video clips of basketball plays presented either on a computer screen CS group or using a virtual reality headset VR group. A third group watched footage from NCAA playoff games on a computer screen CTRL group. Decision-making was assessed on-court before and after the training sessions using two types of plays: "trained" plays presented during the CS and VR training sessions and "untrained" plays presented only during the on-court tests. When facing the trained plays in the posttest both VR and CS groups significantly outperformed the CTRL group. In contrast when facing the untrained plays the VR group outperformed both the CS and CTRL groups. Our results indicate that CS training leads to transferable but non-generalized decision-making gains while VR training leads to transferable and generalized gains.
