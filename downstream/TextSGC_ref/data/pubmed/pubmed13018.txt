This paper proposes a deep learning based ensemble regression estimator with asymptotic techniques and offers a method that can decrease uncertainty for oscillometric blood pressure BP measurements using the bootstrap and Monte-Carlo approach. While the former is used to estimate SBP and DBP the latter attempts to determine confidence intervals CIs for SBP and DBP based on oscillometric BP measurements. Deep learning ensemble with asymptotic techniques for oscillometric blood pressure estimation.
