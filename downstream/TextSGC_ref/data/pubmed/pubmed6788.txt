"We applied deep convolutional neural networks CNNs to detect periodontal bone loss PBL on panoramic dental radiographs. We synthesized a set of 2001 image segments from panoramic radiographs. Our reference test was the measured % of PBL. A deep feed-forward CNN was trained and validated via 10-times repeated group shuffling. Model architectures and hyperparameters were tuned using grid search. The final model was a seven-layer deep neural network parameterized by a total number of 4299651 weights. For comparison six dentists assessed the image segments for PBL. Averaged over 10 validation folds the mean SD classification accuracy of the CNN was 0.81 0.02. Mean SD sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 0.04 0.81 0.05 respectively. The mean SD accuracy of the dentists was 0.76 0.06 but the CNN was not statistically significant superior compared to the examiners p\u2009=\u20090.067/t-test. Mean sensitivity and specificity of the dentists was 0.92 0.02 and 0.63 0.14 respectively. A CNN trained on a limited amount of radiographic image segments showed at least similar discrimination ability as dentists for assessing PBL on panoramic radiographs. Dentists diagnostic efforts when using radiographs may be reduced by applying machine-learning based technologies." Deep Learning for the Radiographic Detection of Periodontal Bone Loss.
