High numbers of consumable medical materials eg sterile needles and swabs are used during the daily routine of intensive care units ICUs worldwide. Although medical consumables largely contribute to total ICU hospital expenditure many hospitals do not track the individual use of materials. Current tracking solutions meeting the specific requirements of the medical environment like barcodes or radio frequency identification require specialized material preparation and high infrastructure investment. This impedes the accurate prediction of consumption leads to high storage maintenance costs caused by large inventories and hinders scientific work due to inaccurate documentation. Thus new cost-effective and contactless methods for object detection are urgently needed.
