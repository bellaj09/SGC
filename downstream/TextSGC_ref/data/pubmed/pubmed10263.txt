Although correlation filter CF-based visual tracking algorithms have achieved appealing results there are still some problems to be solved. When the target object goes through long-term occlusions or scale variation the correlation model used in existing CF-based algorithms will inevitably learn some non-target information or partial-target information. In order to avoid model contamination and enhance the adaptability of model updating we introduce the keypoints matching strategy and adjust the model learning rate dynamically according to the matching score. Moreover the proposed approach extracts convolutional features from a deep convolutional neural network DCNN to accurately estimate the position and scale of the target. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker has achieved satisfactory performance in a wide range of challenging tracking scenarios.
