Micro aerial vehicles equipped with high-resolution cameras can be used to create aerial reconstructions of an area of interest. In that context automatic flight path planning and autonomous flying is often applied but so far cannot fully replace the human in the loop supervising the flight on-site to assure that there are no collisions with obstacles. Unfortunately this workflow yields several issues such as the need to mentally transfer the aerial vehicle&#146;s position between 2D map positions and the physical environment and the complicated depth perception of objects flying in the distance. Augmented Reality can address these issues by bringing the flight planning process on-site and visualizing the spatial relationship between the planned or current positions of the vehicle and the physical environment. In this paper we present Augmented Reality supported navigation and flight planning of micro aerial vehicles by augmenting the user&#146;s view with relevant information for flight planning and live feedback for flight supervision. Furthermore we introduce additional depth hints supporting the user in understanding the spatial relationship of virtual waypoints in the physical world and investigate the effect of these visualization techniques on the spatial understanding.
