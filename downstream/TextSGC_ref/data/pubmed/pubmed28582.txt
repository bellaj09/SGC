In this paper a general purpose wireless Brain-Machine-Brain Interface BMBI system is presented. The system integrates four battery-powered wireless devices for the implementation of a closed-loop sensorimotor neural interface including a neural signal analyzer a neural stimulator a body-area sensor node and a graphic user interface implemented on the PC end. The neural signal analyzer features a four channel analog front-end with configurable bandpass filter gain stage digitization resolution and sampling rate. The target frequency band is configurable from EEG to single unit activity. A noise floor of 4.69 Vrms is achieved over a bandwidth from 0.05 Hz to 6 kHz. Digital filtering neural feature extraction spike detection sensing-stimulating modulation and compressed sensing measurement are realized in a central processing unit integrated in the analyzer. A flash memory card is also integrated in the analyzer. A 2-channel neural stimulator with a compliance voltage up to  12 V is included. The stimulator is capable of delivering unipolar or bipolar charge-balanced current pulses with programmable pulse shape amplitude width pulse train frequency and latency. A multi-functional sensor node including an accelerometer a temperature sensor a flexiforce sensor and a general sensor extension port has been designed. A computer interface is designed to monitor control and configure all aforementioned devices via a wireless link according to a custom designed communication protocol. Wireless closed-loop operation between the sensory devices neural stimulator and neural signal analyzer can be configured. The proposed system was designed to link two sites in the brain bridging the brain and external hardware as well as creating new sensory and motor pathways for clinical practice. Bench test and in vivo experiments are performed to verify the functions and performances of the system. The PennBMBI: Design of a General Purpose Wireless Brain-Machine-Brain Interface System.
