Pediatric movement disorders PMDs are common and have recently received increasing attention. As these disorders have special clinical features the selection of appropriate behavioral assessment tools that can clearly distinguish movement disorders from other diseases eg epilepsy and neuromuscular disorders is crucial for achieving an accurate diagnosis and treatment. However few studies have focused on behavioral assessments in children. The present report attempts to provide a critical review of the available subjective and objective assessment tests for common PMDs. We believe that the principles of objectification multi-purpose use and simplification are also applicable to the selection and development of satisfactory pediatric behavioral assessment tools. We expect that the development of wearable sensors virtual reality and augmented reality will lead to the establishment of more reliable and simple tests. In addition more rigorous randomized controlled trials that have been specifically designed to evaluate behavioral testing in children are also expected in the future. Current behavioral assessments of movement disorders in children.
