Automatic skin lesion analysis of dermoscopy images remains a challenging topic. In this paper we propose an end-to-end multi-task deep learning framework for automatic skin lesion analysis. The proposed framework can perform skin lesion detection classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously without requiring additional pre-processing or post-processing steps. To address the class imbalance issue in the dataset as often observed in medical image datasets and meanwhile to improve the segmentation performance a loss function based on the focal loss and the jaccard distance is proposed. During the framework training we employ a three-phase joint training strategy to ensure the efficiency of feature learning. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmarks ISBI 2016 challenge dataset towards melanoma classification and ISIC 2017 challenge dataset towards melanoma segmentation  especially for the segmentation task. The proposed framework should be a promising computer-aided tool for melanoma diagnosis. An End-to-end Multi-task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Analysis.
