"Capabilities of inference and prediction are the significant components of visual systems. Visual path prediction is an important and challenging task among them with the goal to infer the future path of a visual object in a static scene. This task is complicated as it needs high-level semantic understandings of both the scenes and underlying motion patterns in video sequences. In practice cluttered situations have also raised higher demands on the effectiveness and robustness of models. Motivated by these observations we propose a deep learning framework which simultaneously performs deep feature learning for visual representation in conjunction with spatiotemporal context modeling. After that a unified path-planning scheme is proposed to make accurate path prediction based on the analytic results returned by the deep context models. The highly effective visual representation and deep context models ensure that our framework makes a deep semantic understanding of the scenes and motion patterns consequently improving the performance on visual path prediction task. In experiments we extensively evaluate the models performance by constructing two large benchmark datasets from the adaptation of video tracking datasets. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and owns a better generalization capability."
