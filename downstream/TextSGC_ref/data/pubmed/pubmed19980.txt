BACKGROUND Virtual reality reflection therapy VRRT is a technically enhanced version of the mirror therapy concept. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VRRT could improve the postural balance and gait ability of patients with chronic stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five patients with chronic stroke were randomly allocated into the VRRT group n=13 and the control group n=12. The participants in both groups performed a conventional rehabilitation program for 30 minutes. The VRRT group also performed a VRRT program for 30 minutes five times a week for 4 weeks. The control group performed conventional rehabilitation program and a placebo VRRT program. Outcome measures included Berg Balance Scale BBS the Functional Reaching Test FRT and the Timed Up and Go TUG test for dynamic balance ability postural sway for static balance ability and 10 meter walking velocity 10 mWV for gait ability. RESULTS There were statistically significant improvements in the VRRT group compared with the control group for BBS FRT TUG postural sway mediolateral sway distance with eyes open and eyes closed anteroposterior and total sway distance with eyes open but not with eyes closed and 10 mWV p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS Applying VRRT even as a home treatment along with a conventional rehabilitation program for patients with chronic stroke might be even more beneficial than conventional rehabilitation program alone in improving affected lower limb function. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of VRRT with optimal patient selection and duration and intensity of training.
