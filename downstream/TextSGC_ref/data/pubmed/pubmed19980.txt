"Transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic discectomy TPED is one of the most commonly used minimally invasive spine surgeries around the world. However conventional surgical planning and intraoperative procedures for TPED have relied on surgeons experience which limits its standardization and popularization. Virtual reality VR is a novel technology for pre-surgical planning in various fields of medicine while isocentric navigation can guide intraoperative procedures for TPED. The present study aimed to explore the feasibility of applying VR combined with isocentric navigation in TPED on cadavers."
