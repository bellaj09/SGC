"We introduce a novel technique to analyze nonstationarity in single-channel Electroencephalogram EEG traces: the Embedding Transform. The approach is based on Walter J. Freemans studies concerning active and rest stages and deviations from Gaussianity. Specifically we generalize his idea in order to include cases where the neuromodulations are sparse in time. Specifically the transform maps the temporal sequences to a set of $\\ell ^{2}$-norms where modulated patters are emphasized. In this way the background chaotic activity can be modeled as the main lobe of the distribution while the relevant synchronizations or desynchronizations fall on the right or left tail of the density of such norms. We test the algorithm on two different datasets: alpha bursts on synthetic data simulated in the BESA software and low-gamma oscillations in the motor cortex from the Brain-Computer Interface BCI Competition 4 Dataset 4. The results are promising and place the Embedding Transform as a quick single-parameter tool to effectively assess which channels or regions are actively engaged in particular behaviors and which are in a more silent type of stage."
