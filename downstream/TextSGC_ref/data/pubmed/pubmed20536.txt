We propose a diversity-guided group search optimizer-based approach for solving the location management problem in mobile computing. The location management problem which is to find the optimal network configurations of management under the mobile computing environment is considered here as an optimization problem. The proposed diversity-guided group search optimizer algorithm is realized with the aid of diversity operator which helps alleviate the premature convergence problem of group search optimizer algorithm a successful optimization algorithm inspired by the animal behavior. To address the location management problem diversity-guided group search optimizer algorithm is exploited to optimize network configurations of management by minimizing the sum of location update cost and location paging cost. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Group search optimizer for the mobile location management problem.
