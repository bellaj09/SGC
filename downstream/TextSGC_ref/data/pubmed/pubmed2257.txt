"The ability to quantify differentiation potential of single cells is a task of critical importance. Here we demonstrate using over 7000 single-cell RNA-Seq profiles that differentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signalling promiscuity or entropy of a cells transcriptome in the context of an interaction network without the need for feature selection. We show that signalling entropy provides a more accurate and robust potency estimate than other entropy-based measures driven in part by a subtle positive correlation between the transcriptome and connectome. Signalling entropy identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency and drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes including those derived from circulating tumour cells. It further reveals that expression heterogeneity within single-cell populations is regulated. In summary signalling entropy allows in silico estimation of the differentiation potency and plasticity of single cells and bulk samples providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem-cell phenotypes."
