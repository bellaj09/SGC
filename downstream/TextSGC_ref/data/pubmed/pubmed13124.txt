This paper presents a systematic review of the literature focused on the lung nodule detection in chest computed tomography CT images. Manual detection of lung nodules by the radiologist is a sequential and time-consuming process. The detection is subjective and depends on the radiologist\s experiences. Owing to the variation in shapes and appearances of a lung nodule it is very difficult to identify the proper location of the nodule from a huge number of slices generated by the CT scanner. Small nodules <\u200910\xa0mm in diameter may be missed by this manual detection process. Therefore computer-aided diagnosis CAD system acts as a "second opinion" for the radiologists by making final decision quickly with higher accuracy and greater confidence. The goal of this survey work is to present the current state of the artworks and their progress towards lung nodule detection to the researchers and readers in this domain. This review paper has covered the published works from 2009 to April 2018. Different nodule detection approaches are described elaborately in this work. Recently it is observed that deep learning DL-based approaches are applied extensively for nodule detection and characterization. Therefore emphasis has been given to convolutional neural network CNN-based DL approaches by describing different CNN-based networks.
