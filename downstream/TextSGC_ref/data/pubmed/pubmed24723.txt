Despite the apparent usefulness of efficient mental workload assessment in various real-world situations the underlying neural mechanism remains largely unknown and studies of the mental workload are limited to well-controlled cognitive tasks using a 2D computer screen. In this paper we investigated functional brain network alterations in a simulated flight experiment with three mental workload levels and compared the reorganization pattern between computer screen 2D and virtual reality 3D interfaces. We constructed multiband functional networks in electroencephalogram EEG source space which were further assessed in terms of network efficiency and workload classification performances. We found that increased alpha band efficiencies and beta band local efficiency were associated with elevated mental workload levels while beta band global efficiency exhibited distinct development trends between 2D and 3D interfaces. Furthermore using a small subset of connectivity features we achieved a satisfactory multi-level workload classification accuracy in both interfaces 82% for both 2D and 3D. Further inspection of these discriminative connectivity subsets we found predominant alpha band connectivity features followed by beta and theta band features with different topological patterns between 2D and 3D interfaces. These findings allow for a more comprehensive interpretation of the neural mechanisms of mental workload in relation to real-world assessment.
