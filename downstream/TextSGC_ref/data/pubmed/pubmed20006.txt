Exposure therapy ET has been observed to be an effective modality for the treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. Recently efforts have been made to use virtual reality VR to enhance outcome with modes of ET. How such therapy applies to service members who are facing the reality of a combat deployment has been unknown. This case series documents the first use of VR-based therapy to the treatment of PTSD in a combat theater. Results of therapy are reported from a mental health clinic in Camp Fallujah Iraq. Combat PTSD constituted a relatively small percentage of overall mental health patients seen. Those who did present with PTSD were offered VR-based ET or traditional ET. Patients who received either treatment modality showed significant gains and no service member in treatment had to be medically evacuated because of ongoing PTSD symptoms. This demonstrates that ET with or without the use of VR can be an effective means of helping service members with mental health issues while they serve in theater. Exposure therapy with and without virtual reality to treat PTSD while in the combat theater: a parallel case series.
