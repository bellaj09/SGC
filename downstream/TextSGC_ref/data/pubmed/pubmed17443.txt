A dissociation between categorization and similarity was found by Rips 1989. In one experiment Rips found that a stimulus halfway between a pizza and a quarter was categorized as a pizza but was rated as more similar to a quarter. Smith and Sloman 1994 discussed these results in terms of the role of necessary and characteristic features. In two experiments participants had to learn to categorize novel artificial shapes composed of a nonsalient necessary feature combined with a salient characteristic feature. Participants categorized stimuli on the basis of a necessary feature whereas their similarity judgments relied on characteristic features. The role of deep essential features in dissociations is considered. Results are discussed in terms of the differences between requirements of categorization and similarity judgments. Dissociations between categorization and similarity judgments as a result of learning feature distributions.
