Spatiotemporal activity that emerges spontaneously "at rest" has been proposed to reflect individual a priori biases in cognitive processing. This research focused on testing neurocognitive models of visual attention by studying the functional connectivity FC of the superior parietal lobule SPL given its central role in establishing priority maps during visual search tasks. Twenty-three human participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session that featured a resting-state scan followed by a visual search task based on the alphanumeric category effect. As expected the behavioral results showed longer reaction times and more errors for the within-category i.e. searching a target letter among letters than the between-category search i.e. searching a target letter among numbers. The within-category condition was related to greater activation of the superior and inferior parietal lobules occipital cortex inferior frontal cortex dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the superior colliculus than the between-category search. The resting-state FC analysis of the SPL revealed a broad network that included connections with the inferotemporal cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal frontal areas like the supplementary motor area and frontal eye field. Noteworthy the regression analysis revealed that the more efficient participants in the visual search showed stronger FC between the SPL and areas of primary visual cortex V1 related to the search task. We shed some light on how the SPL establishes a priority map of the environment during visual attention tasks and how FC is a valuable tool for assessing individual differences while performing cognitive tasks. Functional Connectivity Between Superior Parietal Lobule and Primary Visual Cortex "at Rest" Predicts Visual Search Efficiency.
