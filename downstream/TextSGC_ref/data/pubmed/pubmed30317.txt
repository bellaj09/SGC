During the last years several studies have suggested that Brain-Computer Interface BCI can play a critical role in the field of motor rehabilitation. In this case report we aim to investigate the feasibility of a covert visuospatial attention CVSA driven BCI in three patients with left spatial neglect SN. We hypothesize that such a BCI is able to detect attention task-specific brain patterns in SN patients and can induce significant changes in their abnormal cortical activity -power modulation feature recruitment and connectivity. The three patients were asked to control online a CVSA BCI by focusing their attention at different spatial locations including their neglected left space. As primary outcome results show a significant improvement of the reaction time in the neglected space between calibration and online modalities p < 0.01 for the two out of three patients that had the slowest initial behavioral response. Such an evolution of reaction time negatively correlates p < 0.05 with an increment of the Individual -Power computed in the pre-cue interval. Furthermore all patients exhibited a significant reduction of the inter-hemispheric imbalance p < 0.05 over time in the parieto-occipital regions. Finally analysis on the inter-hemispheric functional connectivity suggests an increment across modalities for regions in the affected right hemisphere and decrement for those in the healthy. Although preliminary this feasibility study suggests a possible role of BCI in the therapeutic treatment of lateralized attention-based visuospatial deficits.
