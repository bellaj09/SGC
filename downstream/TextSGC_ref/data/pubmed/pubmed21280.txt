The physical spaces within which the work of health occurs - the home the intensive care unit the emergency room even the bedroom - influence the manner in which behaviors unfold and may contribute to efficacy and effectiveness of health interventions. Yet the study of such complex workspaces is difficult. Health care environments are complex chaotic workspaces that do not lend themselves to the typical assessment approaches used in other industrial settings. This paper provides two methodological advances for studying internal health care environments: a strategy to capture salient aspects of the physical environment and a suite of approaches to visualize and analyze that physical environment. We used a Faro laser scanner to obtain point cloud data sets of the internal aspects of home environments. The point cloud enables precise measurement including the location of physical boundaries and object perimeters color and light in an interior space that can be translated later for visualization on a variety of platforms. The work was motivated by vizHOME a multi-year program to intensively examine the home context of personal health information management in a way that minimizes repeated intrusive and potentially disruptive in vivo assessments. Thus we illustrate how to capture process display and analyze point clouds using the home as a specific example of a health care environment. Our work presages a time when emerging technologies facilitate inexpensive capture and efficient management of point cloud data thus enabling visual and analytical tools for enhanced discharge planning new insights for designers of consumer-facing clinical informatics solutions and a robust approach to context-based studies of health-related work environments.
