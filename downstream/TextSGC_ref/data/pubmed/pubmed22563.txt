"Natural communication often occurs in dialogue differentially\xa0engaging auditory and sensorimotor brain regions during listening and speaking. However previous attempts to decode speech directly from the human brain typically consider listening or speaking tasks in isolation. Here human participants listened to questions and responded aloud with answers while we used high-density electrocorticography ECoG recordings to detect when they heard or said an utterance and to then decode the utterances identity. Because certain answers were only plausible responses to certain questions we could dynamically update the prior probabilities of each answer using the decoded question likelihoods as context. We decode produced and perceived utterances with accuracy rates as high as 61% and 76% respectively chance is 7% and 20%. Contextual integration of decoded question likelihoods significantly improves answer decoding. These results demonstrate real-time decoding of speech in an interactive conversational setting which has important implications for patients who are unable to communicate."
