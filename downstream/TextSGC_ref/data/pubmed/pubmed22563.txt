The immersive technologies of Virtual and Augmented Reality offer a new medium for visualisation. Where previous technologies allowed us only two-dimensional representations constrained by a surface or a screen these new immersive technologies will soon allow us to experience three dimensional environments that can occupy our entire field of view. This is a technological breakthrough for any field that requires visualisation and in this chapter I explore the implications for medical visualisation in the near-to-medium future.First I introduce Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality respectively and identify the essential characteristics and current state-of-the-art for each. I will then survey some prominent applications already in-use within the medical field and suggest potential use cases that remain under-explored. Finally I will offer practical advice for those seeking to exploit these new tools. Immersive Technology and Medical Visualisation: A Users Guide.
