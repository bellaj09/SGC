Mandibular distraction osteogenesis DO has become an accepted method to manage severe cases of micrognathia-induced airway obstruction in neonates. Current imaging used to plan these procedures aids in surgical planning but offers only a rough guide for the operating room. To our knowledge the following report offers the first description of virtual surgery used to guide DO in the mandible of a neonate. The plan provided a valuable link between the simulated procedure and the actual operative steps. Such technology can serve an important role in DO and offers objective guidance in device selection vector planning and operative guide positioning. Neonatal mandibular distraction osteogenesis: converting virtual surgical planning into an operative reality.
