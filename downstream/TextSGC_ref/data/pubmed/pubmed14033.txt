Speed-accuracy tradeoff SAT methods have been used to contrast single- and dual-process accounts of recognition memory. In these procedures subjects are presented with individual test items and are required to make recognition decisions under various time constraints. In this experiment we presented word lists under incidental learning conditions varying the modality of presentation and level of processing. At test we manipulated the interval between each visually presented test item and a response signal thus controlling the amount of time available to retrieve target information. Study-test modality match had a beneficial effect on recognition accuracy at short response-signal delays < or =300 msec. Conversely recognition accuracy benefited more from deep than from shallow processing at study only at relatively long response-signal delays > or =300 msec. The results are congruent with views suggesting that both fast familiarity and slower recollection processes contribute to recognition memory. One process is not enough!
