Adverse drug reactions particularly those that result in drug-induced liver injury DILI are a major cause of drug failure in clinical trials and drug withdrawals. Hepatotoxicity-mediated drug attrition occurs despite substantial investments of time and money in developing cellular assays animal models and computational models to predict its occurrence in humans. Underperformance in predicting hepatotoxicity associated with drugs and drug candidates has been attributed to existing gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in driving hepatic injury after these compounds perfuse and are metabolized by the liver. Herein we assess in vitro in vivo animal and in silico strategies used to develop predictive DILI models. We address the effectiveness of several two- and three-dimensional in vitro cellular methods that are frequently employed in hepatotoxicity screens and how they can be used to predict DILI in humans. We also explore how humanized animal models can recapitulate human drug metabolic profiles and associated liver injury. Finally we highlight the maturation of computational methods for predicting hepatotoxicity the untapped potential of artificial intelligence for improving in silico DILI screens and how knowledge acquired from these predictions can shape the refinement of experimental methods.
