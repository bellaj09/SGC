In everyday life the motivational value of faces is bound to the contexts in which faces are perceived. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that inherent negatively valent contexts modulate cortical face processing as assessed with ERP components. However it is not well understood whether learned rather than inherent and three-dimensional aversive contexts similarly modulate the neural processing of faces. Using full immersive virtual reality VR and mobile EEG techniques 25 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm in which one virtual room was paired with an aversive noise burst threat context and another with a nonaversive noise burst safe context. Subsequently avatars with neutral or angry facial expressions were presented in the threat and safe contexts while EEG was recorded. Analysis of the late positive potential LPP which presumably indicates motivational salience revealed a significant interaction of context threat vs. safe and face type neutral vs. angry. Neutral faces evoked increased LPP amplitudes in threat versus safe contexts while angry faces evoked increased early LPP amplitudes regardless of context. In addition to indicating that threat-conditioned contexts alter the processing of ambiguous faces the present study demonstrates the successful integration of EEG and VR with particular relevance for affective neuroscience research.
