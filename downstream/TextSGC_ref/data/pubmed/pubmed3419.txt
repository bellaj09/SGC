Imaging studies in adults with irritable bowel syndrome IBS have shown both morphological and resting state RS functional connectivity FC alterations related to cortical modulation of sensory processing. Because analogous differences have not been adequately investigated in children this study compared gray matter volume GMV and RS-FC between girls with IBS and healthy controls HC and tested the correlation between brain metrics and laboratory-based pain thresholds Pth. Altered Brain Structure and Functional Connectivity and Its Relation to Pain Perception in Girls With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
