Electrocorticogram ECoG is a well-known recording method for the less invasive brain machine interface BMI. Our previous studies have succeeded in predicting muscle activities and arm trajectories from ECoG signals. Despite such successful studies there still remain solving works for the purpose of realizing an ECoG-based prosthesis. We suggest a neuromuscular interface to control robot using decoded muscle activities and joint angles. We used sparse linear regression to find the best fit between band-passed ECoGs and electromyograms EMG or joint angles. The best coefficient of determination for 100\u2009s continuous prediction was 0.6333  0.0033 muscle activations and 0.6359  0.0929 joint angles respectively. We also controlled a 4 degree of freedom DOF robot arm using only decoded 4 DOF angles from the ECoGs in this study. Consequently this study shows the possibility of contributing to future advancements in neuroprosthesis and neurorehabilitation technology.
