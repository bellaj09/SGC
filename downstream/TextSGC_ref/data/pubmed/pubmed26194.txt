Brain-Computer Interface BCI systems use some permanent features of brain signals to recognize their corresponding cognitive states with high accuracy. However these features are not perfectly permanent and BCI system should be continuously trained over time which is tedious and time consuming. Thus analyzing the permanency of signal features is essential in determining how often to repeat training. In this paper we monitor electroencephalogram EEG signals and analyze their behavior through continuous and relatively long period of time. In our experiment we record EEG signals corresponding to rest state eyes open and closed from one subject everyday for three and a half months. The results show that signal features such as auto-regression coefficients remain permanent through time while others such as power spectral density specifically in 5-7 Hz frequency band are not permanent. In addition eyes open EEG data shows more permanency than eyes closed data. Permanency analysis on human electroencephalogram signals for pervasive Brain-Computer Interface systems.
