For the time-consuming and stressful body measuring task of Qinchuan cattle and farmers the demand for the automatic measurement of body dimensions has become more and more urgent. It is necessary to explore automatic measurements with deep learning to improve breeding efficiency and promote the development of industry. In this paper a novel approach to measuring the body dimensions of live Qinchuan cattle with on transfer learning is proposed. Deep learning of the Kd-network was trained with classical three-dimensional 3D point cloud datasets PCD of the ShapeNet datasets. After a series of processes of PCD sensed by the light detection and ranging LiDAR sensor the cattle silhouettes could be extracted which after augmentation could be applied as an input layer to the Kd-network. With the output of a convolutional layer of the trained deep model the output layer of the deep model could be applied to pre-train the full connection network. The TrAdaBoost algorithm was employed to transfer the pre-trained convolutional layer and full connection of the deep model. To classify and recognize the PCD of the cattle silhouette the average accuracy rate after training with transfer learning could reach up to 93.6%. On the basis of silhouette extraction the candidate region of the feature surface shape could be extracted with mean curvature and Gaussian curvature. After the computation of the FPFH fast point feature histogram of the surface shape the center of the feature surface could be recognized and the body dimensions of the cattle could finally be calculated. The experimental results showed that the comprehensive error of body dimensions was close to 2% which could provide a feasible approach to the non-contact observations of the bodies of large physique livestock without any human intervention.
