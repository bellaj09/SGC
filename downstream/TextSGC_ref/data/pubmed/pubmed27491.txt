"Motor imagery electroencephalography is widely used in the brain-computer interface systems. Due to inherent characteristics of electroencephalography signals accurate and real-time multiclass classification is always challenging. In order to solve this problem a multiclass posterior probability solution for twin SVM is proposed by the ranking continuous output and pairwise coupling in this paper. First two-class posterior probability model is constructed to approximate the posterior probability by the ranking continuous output techniques and Platts estimating method. Secondly a solution of multiclass probabilistic outputs for twin SVM is provided by combining every pair of class probabilities according to the method of pairwise coupling. Finally the proposed method is compared with multiclass SVM and twin SVM via voting and multiclass posterior probability SVM using different coupling approaches. The efficacy on the classification accuracy and time complexity of the proposed method has been demonstrated by both the UCI benchmark datasets and real world EEG data from BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a respectively."
