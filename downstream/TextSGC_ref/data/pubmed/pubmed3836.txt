"Neuroimaging plays a critical role in the setting in traumatic brain injury TBI. Diffusion tensor imaging DTI is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique that is capable of providing rich information on the brains neuroanatomic connectome. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the role of DTI and advanced diffusion techniques in the setting of TBI including diffusion kurtosis imaging DKI neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging diffusion spectrum imaging and q-ball imaging. We discuss clinical applications of DTI and review the DTI literature as it pertains to TBI. Despite the continued advancements in DTI and related diffusion techniques over the past 20 years DTI techniques are sensitive for TBI at the group level only and there is insufficient evidence that DTI plays a role at the individual level. We conclude by discussing future directions in DTI research in TBI including the role of machine learning in the pattern classification of TBI."
