Fatty acid FA profile appears to be critical to infertility and the effects of dietary FAs on sperm FA content are a current focus of studies in the field of nutrition and reproduction. Starting from a validated "OXISTRESS" model in which modification of FA content results to influence reactive oxygen species antioxidants isoprostanes cytokines sperm kinetic and acrosome reaction we developed a virtual reality game where the player in order to improve the health of some virtual spermatozoa is called to take dietary choices and then discover their consequences on the main biological aspects. In the LabVR of the University of Siena a team of VR environment designer and developer used Unity development engine to make the experience run on Oculus Quest and a wireless 6DOF six degrees of freedom of movement in 3D space VR Headset. In the game the player is immersed in the epididymis and observes closer how dietary n-3 may change the sperm plasma membrane and consequently modify sperm traits. A simulation game in the virtual reality may represent a tool to give greater visibility to scientific data in the relevance of appropriate dietary habits in the human health.
