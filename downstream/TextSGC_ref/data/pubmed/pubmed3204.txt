We here illustrate how a well-founded study of the brain may originate in assuming analogies with phase-transition phenomena. Analyzing to what extent a weak signal endures in noisy environments we identify the underlying mechanisms and it results a description of how the excitability associated to non-equilibrium phase changes and criticality optimizes the processing of the signal. Our setting is a network of integrate-and-fire nodes in which connections are heterogeneous with rapid time-varying intensities mimicking fatigue and potentiation. Emergence then becomes quite robust against wiring topology modification--in fact we considered from a fully connected network to the Homo sapiens connectome--showing the essential role of synaptic flickering on computations. We also suggest how to experimentally disclose significant changes during actual brain operation. Brain Performance versus Phase Transitions.
