The ability to use word category information WCI for syntactic structure building has been hypothesized to be the essence of human language faculty. The neural substrate of the ability of using the WCI for the complex syntactic hierarchical structure processing however is yet unknown. Therefore we directly conducted an fMRI experiment by using a pseudo-Chinese artificial language with syntactic structures containing a center-embedded relative clause. Thirty non-Chinese native Korean speakers were randomly divided into two groups: one acquired WCI and WCI-based syntactic rules the WCI group before the scanning session and the other did not the non-WCI group. Both groups were required to judge the grammaticality of the testing sentences with critical long-distance dependencies between two elements the main verb and the relativizer. Behaviorally the WCI group\s accuracy was significantly higher and its reaction time was shorter. The scanning results showed that the left superior temporal gyrus STG and Broca\s area were more strongly activated for the WCI group and the dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed a distinct effective connectivity pattern for this group. Therefore the present research for the first time reveals that the activation of and the functional connectivity between Broca\s area and the left STG play a critical role in the ability of the rule-based use of the WCI which is crucial for complex hierarchical structure building and might be substantially corresponding to the "labeling competence" within the linguistic framework. Neural substrates of word category information as the basis of syntactic processing.
