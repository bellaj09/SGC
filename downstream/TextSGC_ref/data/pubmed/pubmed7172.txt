Hyperspectral remote sensing images HSIs have great research and application value. At present deep learning has become an important method for studying image processing. The Generative Adversarial Network GAN model is a typical network of deep learning developed in recent years and the GAN model can also be used to classify HSIs. However there are still some problems in the classification of HSIs. On the one hand due to the existence of different objects with the same spectrum phenomenon if only according to the original GAN model to generate samples from spectral samples it will produce the wrong detailed characteristic information. On the other hand the gradient disappears in the original GAN model and the scoring ability of a single discriminator limits the quality of the generated samples. In order to solve the above problems we introduce the scoring mechanism of multi-discriminator collaboration and complete semi-supervised classification on three hyperspectral data sets. Compared with the original GAN model with a single discriminator the adjusted criterion is more rigorous and accurate and the generated samples can show more accurate characteristics. Aiming at the pattern collapse and diversity deficiency of the original GAN generated by single discriminator this paper proposes a multi-discriminator generative adversarial networks MDGANs and studies the influence of the number of discriminators on the classification results. The experimental results show that the introduction of multi-discriminator improves the judgment ability of the model ensures the effect of generating samples solves the problem of noise in generating spectral samples and can improve the classification effect of HSIs. At the same time the number of discriminators has different effects on different data sets. A Hyperspectral Image Classification Method Based on Multi-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks.
