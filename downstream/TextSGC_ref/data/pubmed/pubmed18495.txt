"In this paper we propose a novel method to construct an optical see-through light-field near-eye display OST LF-NED by using a discrete lenslet array DLA. The DLA is used as a spatial light modulator SLM to generate dense light field of three-dimensional 3-D scenes inside the users eyebox of the system and provide correct focus cues to the user. A corresponding light-field image rendering method is also proposed and demonstrated. The light emitted from the real objects passes through the transparent region of the display panel and the planar area of the DLA successively without redirection so the user can have a clear view of the real scene as well as the virtual information. The stray light that may degrade the image quality has been analyzed in detail. The experimental result shows that the proposed method is capable of obtaining a corrected depth perception of the virtual information in augmented reality AR applications."
