"Technological innovation has become an integral and inescapable aspect of our daily existence as almost everything of significance in our world now has a cyber i.e. relating to or involving computers computer networks information technology and virtual reality component associated with it. Every facet of our lives is now touched by technology. As such were experiencing a digital transformation. Unfortunately both as individuals and as a society were inadequately prepared to embrace the myriad of vulnerabilities presented by cybertechnologies. Unintended cyber vulnerabilities present significant risks to individuals organizations governments and economies. Here we identify current cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in the life science enterprise and discuss the many ways in which these vulnerabilities present risk to laboratory workers in these facilities the surrounding community and the environment. We also consider the cyberbiosecurity benefits associated with numerous innovations likely to be present in the laboratory of the future. The challenges associated with cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities are not insurmountable; they simply require thoughtful consideration by equipment designers software and control systems developers and by end users. Organizations and the individuals that comprise them must respect value and protect their data. End users must train themselves to look at every piece of laboratory equipment and every process from a cyberbiosecurity perspective. With this approach cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities can be minimized or eliminated to the benefit of workers life science organizations and national security."
