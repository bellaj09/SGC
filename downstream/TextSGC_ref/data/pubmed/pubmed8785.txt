ComplexContact http://raptorx2.uchicago.edu/ComplexContact/ is a web server for sequence-based interfacial residue-residue contact prediction of a putative protein complex. Interfacial residue-residue contacts are critical for understanding how proteins form complex and interact at residue level. When receiving a pair of protein sequences ComplexContact first searches for their sequence homologs and builds two paired multiple sequence alignments MSA then it applies co-evolution analysis and a CASP-winning deep learning DL method to predict interfacial contacts from paired MSAs and visualizes the prediction as an image. The DL method was originally developed for intra-protein contact prediction and performed the best in CASP12. Our large-scale experimental test further shows that ComplexContact greatly outperforms pure co-evolution methods for inter-protein contact prediction regardless of the species.
