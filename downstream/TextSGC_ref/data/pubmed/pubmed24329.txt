Successful navigation is crucial to everyday life. Individuals with Williams syndrome WS have impaired spatial abilities. This includes a deficit in spatial navigation abilities such as learning the route from A to B. To-date to determine whether participants attend to landmarks when learning a route landmark recall tasks have been employed after the route learning experience. Here we combined virtual reality and eye tracking technologies for the first time to measure landmark use in typically developing TD children and participants with WS during route-learning. Route-learning strategies in typical and atypical development; eye tracking reveals atypical landmark selection in Williams syndrome.
