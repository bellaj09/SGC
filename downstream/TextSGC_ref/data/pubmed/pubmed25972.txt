Developing technologies have made significant progress towards linking the brain with brain-machine interfaces BMIs which have the potential to aid damaged brains to perform their original motor and cognitive functions. We consider the viability of such devices for mitigating the deleterious effects of memory loss that is induced by neurodegenerative diseases and/or traumatic brain injury TBI. Our computational study considers the widely used Hopfield network an autoassociative memory model in which neurons converge to a stable state pattern after receiving an input resembling the given memory. In this study we connect an auxiliary network of neurons which models the BMI device to the original Hopfield network and train it to converge to its own auxiliary memory patterns. Injuries to the original Hopfield memory network induced through neurodegeneration for instance can then be analyzed with the goal of evaluating the ability of the BMI to aid in memory retrieval tasks. Dense connectivity between the auxiliary and Hopfield networks is shown to promote robustness of memory retrieval tasks for both optimal and nonoptimal memory sets. Our computations estimate damage levels and parameter ranges for which full or partial memory recovery is achievable providing a starting point for novel therapeutic strategies.
