"Remote manually operated tasks such as those found in teleoperation virtual reality or joystick-based computer access require the generation of an intermediate electrical signal which is transmitted to the controlled subsystem robot arm virtual environment or a cursor in a computer screen. When human movements are distorted for instance by tremor performance can be improved by digitally filtering the intermediate signal before it reaches the controlled device. This paper introduces a novel tremor filtering framework in which digital equalizers are optimally designed through pursuit tracking task experiments. Due to inherent properties of the man-machine system the design of tremor suppression equalizers presents two serious problems: 1 performance criteria leading to optimizations that minimize mean-squared error are not efficient for tremor elimination and 2 movement signals show ill-conditioned autocorrelation matrices which often result in useless or unstable solutions. To address these problems a new performance indicator in the context of tremor is introduced and the optimal equalizer according to this new criterion is developed. Ill-conditioning of the autocorrelation matrix is overcome using a novel method which we call pulled-optimization. Experiments performed with artificially induced vibrations and a subject with Parkinsons disease show significant improvement in performance. Additional results along with MATLAB source code of the algorithms and a customizable demo for PC joysticks are available on the Internet at http:tremor-suppression.com."
