"Freezing of gait FoG is one of the most common symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD a neurodegenerative disorder which impacts millions of people around the world. Accurate assessment of FoG is critical for the management of PD and to evaluate the efficacy of treatments. Currently the assessment of FoG requires well-trained experts to perform time-consuming annotations via vision-based observations. Thus automatic FoG detection algorithms are needed. In this study we formulate vision-based FoG detection as a fine-grained graph sequence modelling task by representing the anatomic joints in each temporal segment with a directed graph since FoG events can be observed through the motion patterns of joints. A novel deep learning method is proposed namely graph sequence recurrent neural network GS-RNN to characterize the FoG patterns by devising graph recurrent cells which take graph sequences of dynamic structures as inputs. For the cases of which prior edge annotations are not available a data-driven based adjacency estimation method is further proposed. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first studies on vision-based FoG detection using deep neural networks designed for graph sequences of dynamic structures. Experimental results on more than 150 videos collected from 45 patients demonstrated promising performance of the proposed GS-RNN for FoG detection with an AUC value of 0.90."
