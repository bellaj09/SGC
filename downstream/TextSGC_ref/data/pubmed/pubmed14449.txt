Growing concerns about increasing rates of antibiotic resistance call for expanded and comprehensive global monitoring. Advancing methods for monitoring of environmental media e.g. wastewater agricultural waste food and water is especially needed for identifying potential resources of novel antibiotic resistance genes ARGs hot spots for gene exchange and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequencing now enables direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool where ARGs are typically identified or predicted based on the "best hits" of sequence searches against existing databases. Unfortunately this approach produces a high rate of false negatives. To address such limitations we propose here a deep learning approach taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two deep learning models DeepARG-SS and DeepARG-LS were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences respectively. DeepARG: a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data.
