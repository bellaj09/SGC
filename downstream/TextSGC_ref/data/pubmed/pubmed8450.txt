The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether a deep convolutional neural network can be trained with limited image data to detect high-grade small bowel obstruction patterns on supine abdominal radiographs. Grayscale images from 3663 clinical supine abdominal radiographs were categorized into obstructive and non-obstructive categories independently by three abdominal radiologists and the majority classification was used as ground truth; 74 images were found to be consistent with small bowel obstruction. Images were rescaled and randomized with 2210 images constituting the training set 39 with small bowel obstruction and 1453 images constituting the test set 35 with small bowel obstruction. Weight parameters for the final classification layer of the Inception v3 convolutional neural network previously trained on the 2014 Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge dataset were retrained on the training set. After training the neural network achieved an AUC of 0.84 on the test set 95% CI 0.78-0.89. At the maximum Youden index sensitivity\xa0+\xa0specificity-1 the sensitivity of the system for small bowel obstruction is 83.8% with a specificity of 68.1%. The results demonstrate that transfer learning with convolutional neural networks even with limited training data may be used to train a detector for high-grade small bowel obstruction gas patterns on supine radiographs. Detection of high-grade small bowel obstruction on conventional radiography with convolutional neural networks.
