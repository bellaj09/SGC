Despite the limited number of articles dedicated to its use augmented reality AR is an emerging technology that has shown to have increasing applications in multiple different medical sectors. These include but are not limited to the Maxillo-facial and Dentistry disciplines of medicine. In these medical specialties the focus of AR technology is to achieve a more visible surgical field during an operation. Currently this goal is brought about by an accurate display of either static or dynamic diagnostic images via the use of a visor or specific glasses. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a virtual display for dynamic navigation via AR. The secondary outcome is to evaluate if the use of this technology could affect the accuracy of dynamic navigation. Augmented reality for dental implantology: a pilot clinical report of two cases.
