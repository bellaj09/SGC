The objective quantification of photoreceptor loss in inherited retinal degenerations IRD is essential for measuring disease progression and is now especially important with the growing number of clinical trials. Optical coherence tomography OCT is a non-invasive imaging technology widely used to recognize and quantify such anomalies. Here we implement a versatile method based on a convolutional neural network to segment the regions of preserved photoreceptors in two different IRDs choroideremia and retinitis pigmentosa from OCT images. An excellent segmentation accuracy ~90% was achieved for both IRDs. Due to the flexibility of this technique it has potential to be extended to additional IRDs in the future.
