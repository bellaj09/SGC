"The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based brain age as a biomarker of an individuals brain health. Increasingly research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age. Importantly recent evidence shows that having an older-appearing brain relates to advanced physiological and cognitive ageing and the risk of mortality. We discuss controversies surrounding brain age and highlight emerging trends such as the use of multimodality neuroimaging and the employment of deep learning methods."
