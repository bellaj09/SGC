"Although El Salvador suffered light losses from Hurricane Mitch in 1998 it benefited from the increased international aid and encouragement for advance planning especially mitigation and prevention interventions. Thus one would have supposed El Salvador would have been in a very advantageous position able more easily than its economically crippled neighbours Honduras and Nicaragua to implement the lessons of Mitch. A review of the recovery plan tabled by the El Salvador government following the earthquakes of early 2001 shows that despite the rhetoric in favour of learning the lessons of Mitch very little mitigation and prevention had actually been put in place between the hurricane 1998 and the earthquakes 2001. The recovery plan is analysed in terms of the degree to which it deals with root causes of disaster vulnerability namely the economic and political marginality of much of the population and environmental degradation. An explanation for the failure to implement mitigation and preventive actions is traced to the adherence by the government of El Salvador to an extreme form of neoliberal free market ideology and the deep fissures and mistrust in a country that follow a long and bloody civil war."
