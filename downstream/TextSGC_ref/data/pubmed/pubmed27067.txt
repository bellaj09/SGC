Real-time solutions for noise reduction and signal processing represent a central challenge for the development of Brain Computer Interfaces BCI. In this paper we introduce the Moving Average Convergence Divergence MACD filter a tunable digital passband filter for online noise reduction and onset detection without preliminary learning phase used in economic markets analysis. MACD performance was tested and benchmarked with other filters using data collected with functional Near Infrared Spectoscopy fNIRS during a digit sequence memorization task. This filter has a good performance on filtering and real-time peak activity onset detection compared to other techniques. Therefore MACD could be implemented for efficient BCI design using fNIRS. Moving Average Convergence Divergence filter preprocessing for real-time event-related peak activity onset detection : application to fNIRS signals.
