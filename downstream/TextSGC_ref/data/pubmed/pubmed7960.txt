Machine learning ML applications have received extensive attention in endocrinology research during the last decade. This review summarizes the basic concepts of ML and certain research topics in endocrinology and metabolism where ML principles have been actively deployed. Relevant studies are discussed to provide an overview of the methodology main findings and limitations of ML with the goal of stimulating insights into future research directions. Clear testable study hypotheses stem from unmet clinical needs and the management of data quality beyond a focus on quantity alone open collaboration between clinical experts and ML engineers the development of interpretable high-performance ML models beyond the black-box nature of some algorithms and a creative environment are the core prerequisites for the foreseeable changes expected to be brought about by ML and artificial intelligence in the field of endocrinology and metabolism with actual improvements in clinical practice beyond hype. Of note endocrinologists will continue to play a central role in these developments as domain experts who can properly generate refine analyze and interpret data with a combination of clinical expertise and scientific rigor.
