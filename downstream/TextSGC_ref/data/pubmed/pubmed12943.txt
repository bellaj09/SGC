Activation of GABAB receptors in the dentate gyrus DG enhances granule cell GC activity by reducing synaptic inhibition imposed by hilar interneurons. This disinhibitory action facilitates signal transfer from the perforant path to the hippocampus. However as the two main molecular subtypes GABAB1a2 and GABAB1b2 receptors prefer axonal terminal and dendritic compartments respectively they may modulate the hilar pathways at different synaptic localizations. We examined their relative expression and functions in the DG. GABAB receptor subtypes differentially modulate synaptic inhibition in the dentate gyrus to enhance granule cell output.
