Male volunteers entered an immersive virtual reality that depicted a party where they were approached by a lone virtual woman who initiated a conversation. The goal was to study how socially anxious and socially confident men would react to this event. Interest focused on whether the socially anxious participants would exhibit sustained anxiety during the conversation or whether this would diminish over time and differ from the responses of the more socially confident men. Socially anxious and confident men interact with a forward virtual woman: an experimental study.
