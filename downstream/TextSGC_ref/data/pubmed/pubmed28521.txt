Nowadays everybody knows what a hybrid car is. A hybrid car normally has two engines to enhance energy efficiency and reduce CO2 output. Similarly a hybrid brain-computer interface BCI is composed of two BCIs or at least one BCI and another system. A hybrid BCI like any BCI must fulfill the following four criteria: i the device must rely on signals recorded directly from the brain; ii there must be at least one recordable brain signal that the user can intentionally modulate to effect goal-directed behaviour; iii real time processing; and iv the user must obtain feedback. This paper introduces hybrid BCIs that have already been published or are in development. We also introduce concepts for future work. We describe BCIs that classify two EEG patterns: one is the event-related desynchronisation ERD ERS of sensorimotor rhythms and the other is the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP. Hybrid BCIs can either process their inputs simultaneously or operate two systems sequentially where the first system can act as a "brain switch". For example we describe a hybrid BCI that simultaneously combines ERD and SSVEP BCIs. We also describe a sequential hybrid BCI in which subjects could use a brain switch to control an SSVEP-based hand orthosis. Subjects who used this hybrid BCI exhibited about half the false positives encountered while using the SSVEP BCI alone. A brain switch can also rely on hemodynamic changes measured through near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS. Hybrid BCIs can also use one brain signal and a different type of input. This additional input can be an electrophysiological signal such as the heart rate or a signal from an external device such as an eye tracking system. The hybrid BCI.
