Lysine acetylation in protein is one of the most important post-translational modifications PTMs. It plays an important role in essential biological processes and is related to various diseases. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of regulatory mechanism of lysine acetylation the key is to identify lysine acetylation sites. Previously several shallow machine learning algorithms had been applied to predict lysine modification sites in proteins. However shallow machine learning has some disadvantages. For instance it is not as effective as deep learning for processing big data. A deep learning method to more accurately recall known lysine acetylation sites.
