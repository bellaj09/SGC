Postural perturbations motion tracking and sensory feedback are modern techniques used to challenge assess and train upright sitting respectively. The goal of the developed protocol is to construct and operate a sitting platform that can be passively destabilized while an inertial measurement unit quantifies its motion and vibrating elements deliver tactile feedback to the user. Interchangeable seat attachments alter the stability level of the device to safely challenge sitting balance. A built-in microcontroller allows fine-tuning of the feedback parameters to augment sensory function. Posturographic measures typical of balance assessment protocols summarize the motion signals acquired during timed balance trials. No dynamic sitting protocol to date provides variable challenge quantification and sensory feedback free of laboratory constraints. Our results demonstrate that non-disabled users of the device exhibit significant changes in posturographic measures when balance difficulty is altered or vibrational feedback provided. The portable versatile device has potential applications in rehabilitation following skeletal muscular or neurological injury training for sports or spatial awareness entertainment via virtual or augmented reality and research of sitting-related disorders.
