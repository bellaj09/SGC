The significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall makes preoperative imaging essential when raising a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator DIEP flap due to the potential for maximizing operative success reducing intraoperative error and minimizing operative complications. Computerized models and virtual reality applications are being used to facilitate teaching and preoperative evaluation in a number of other complex anatomical regions. The variability in perforator anatomy makes DIEP flap surgery a suitable candidate for application of such technology. In this context a study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of computed tomography angiography CTA-guided VirSSPA three-dimensional 3D software for virtual reality navigation in DIEP flap surgery and to compare findings with operative measurements. Use of a three-dimensional virtual reality model for preoperative imaging in DIEP flap breast reconstruction.
