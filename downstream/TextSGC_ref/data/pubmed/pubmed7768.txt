Skin lesion segmentation has a critical role in the early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer by computerized systems. However automatic segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopic images is a challenging task owing to difficulties including artifacts hairs gel bubbles ruler markers indistinct boundaries low contrast and varying sizes and shapes of the lesion images. This paper proposes a novel and effective pipeline for skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images combining a deep convolutional neural network named as You Only Look Once YOLO and the GrabCut algorithm. This method performs lesion segmentation using a dermoscopic image in four steps: 1. Removal of hairs on the lesion 2. Detection of the lesion location 3. Segmentation of the lesion area from the background 4. Post-processing with morphological operators. The method was evaluated on two publicly well-known datasets that is the PH2 and the ISBI 2017 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge Dataset. The proposed pipeline model has achieved a 90% sensitivity rate on the ISBI 2017 dataset outperforming other deep learning-based methods. The method also obtained close results according to the results obtained from other methods in the literature in terms of metrics of accuracy specificity Dice coefficient and Jaccard index.
