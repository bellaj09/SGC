Intradendritic recordings in Purkinje cells from a defined area in parasaggital slices of cerebellar lobule HVI obtained after rabbits were given either paired classical conditioning or explicitly unpaired control presentations of tone and periorbital electrical stimulation were used to assess the nature and duration of conditioning-specific changes in Purkinje cell dendritic membrane excitability. We found a strong relationship between the level of conditioning and Purkinje cell dendritic membrane excitability after initial acquisition of the conditioned response. Moreover conditioning-specific increases in Purkinje cell excitability were still present 1 month after classical conditioning. Although dendritically recorded membrane potential input resistance and amplitude of somatic and dendritic spikes were not different in cells from paired or control animals the size of a potassium channel-mediated transient hyperpolarization was significantly smaller in cells from animals that received classical conditioning. In slices of lobule HVI obtained from naive rabbits the conditioning-related increases in membrane excitability could be mimicked by application of potassium channel antagonist tetraethylammonium chloride iberiotoxin or 4-aminopyridine. However only 4-aminopyridine was able to reduce the transient hyperpolarization. The pharmacological data suggest a role for potassium channels and possibly channels mediating an IA-like current in learning-specific changes in membrane excitability. The conditioning-specific increase in Purkinje cell dendritic excitability produces an afterhyperpolarization which is hypothesized to release the cerebellar deep nuclei from inhibition allowing conditioned responses to be elicited via the red nucleus and accessory abducens motorneurons.
