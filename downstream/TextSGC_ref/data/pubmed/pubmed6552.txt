Intracellular tau protein aggregates are a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer disease AD progressive supranuclear palsy PSP corticobasal degeneration CBD and Pick disease. Emerging evidence supports a model of cell-to-cell transmission of proteinaceous pathological tau seeds which leads to recruitment and templated fibrillization of endogenous cellular tau followed by the spread of abnormal tau throughout the brain. These findings lead to the strain hypothesis which predicts that distinct conformational strains or polymorphs of tau may underlie the clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity and cell-type specificity of tauopathies. In this review we describe the evidence for propagation of distinct tau strains in cell culture and animal models of AD and mechanistic insights into cell-to-cell transmission of pathological tau.
