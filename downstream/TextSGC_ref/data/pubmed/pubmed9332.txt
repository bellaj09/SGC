"We propose a fully-automatic deep learning-based algorithm for segmentation of ocular structures and microbial keratitis MK biomarkers on slit-lamp photography SLP images. The dataset consisted of SLP images from 133 eyes with manual annotations by a physician P1. A modified region-based convolutional neural network SLIT-Net was developed and trained using P1s annotations to identify and segment four pathological regions of interest ROIs on diffuse white light images stromal infiltrate SI hypopyon white blood cell WBC border corneal edema border one pathological ROI on diffuse blue light images epithelial defect ED and two non-pathological ROIs on all images corneal limbus light reflexes. To assess inter-reader variability 75 eyes were manually annotated for pathological ROIs by a second physician P2. Performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient DSC and Hausdorff distance HD. Using seven-fold cross-validation the DSC of the algorithm as compared to P1 for all ROIs was good range: 0.62 - 0.95 on all 133 eyes. For the subset of 75 eyes with manual annotations by P2 the DSC for pathological ROIs ranged from 0.69 - 0.85 SLIT-Net vs. 0.37 - 0.92 P2. DSCs for SLIT-Net were not significantly different than P2 for segmenting hypopyons p > 0.05 and higher than P2 for WBCs p < 0.001 and edema p < 0.001. DSCs were higher for P2 for segmenting SIs p < 0.001 and EDs p < 0.001. HDs were lower for P2 for segmenting SIs p = 0.005 and EDs p < 0.001 and not significantly different for hypopyons p > 0.05 WBCs p > 0.05 and edema p > 0.05. This prototype fully-automatic algorithm to segment MK biomarkers on SLP images performed to expectations on an exploratory dataset and holds promise for quantification of corneal physiology and pathology."
