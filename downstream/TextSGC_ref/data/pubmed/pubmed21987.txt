This paper presents the design and implementation of a new neural-machine-interface NMI for control of artificial legs. The requirements of high accuracy real-time processing low power consumption and mobility of the NMI place great challenges on the computation engine of the system. By utilizing the architectural features of a mobile embedded CPU we are able to implement our decision-making algorithm based on neuromuscular phase-dependant support vector machines SVM with exceptional accuracy and processing speed. To demonstrate the superiority of our NMI real-time experiments were performed on an able bodied subject with a 20 ms window increment. The 20 ms testing yielded accuracies of 99.94% while executing our algorithm efficiently with less than 11% processor loads. Design and implementation of a low power mobile CPU based embedded system for artificial leg control.
