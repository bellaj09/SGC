Orbital decompression for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy TAO is an ophthalmic plastic surgery technique to prevent optic neuropathy and reduce exophthalmos. Because the postoperative appearance can significantly change sometimes it is difficult to make decisions regarding decompression surgery. Herein we present a deep learning technique to synthesize the realistic postoperative appearance for orbital decompression surgery. A generative adversarial network approach to predicting postoperative appearance after orbital decompression surgery for thyroid eye disease.
