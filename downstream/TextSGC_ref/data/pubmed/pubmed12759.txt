Deep learning DL is a new machine learning ML methodology that has found successful implementations in many application domains. However its usage in communications systems has not been well explored. This paper investigates the use of the DL in modulation classification which is a major task in many communications systems. The DL relies on a massive amount of data and for research and applications this can be easily available in communications systems. Furthermore unlike the ML the DL has the advantage of not requiring manual feature selections which significantly reduces the task complexity in modulation classification. In this paper we use two convolutional neural network CNN-based DL models AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Specifically we develop several methods to represent modulated signals in data formats with gridlike topologies for the CNN. The impacts of representation on classification performance are also analyzed. In addition comparisons with traditional cumulant and ML-based algorithms are presented. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance advantage and application feasibility of the DL-based approach for modulation classification.
