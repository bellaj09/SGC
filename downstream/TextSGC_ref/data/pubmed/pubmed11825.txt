Visual inspection of cardiotocography traces by obstetricians and midwives is the gold standard for monitoring the wellbeing of the foetus during antenatal care. However inter- and intra-observer variability is high with only a 30% positive predictive value for the classification of pathological outcomes. This has a significant negative impact on the perinatal foetus and often results in cardio-pulmonary arrest brain and vital organ damage cerebral palsy hearing visual and cognitive defects and in severe cases death. This paper shows that using machine learning and foetal heart rate signals provides direct information about the foetal state and helps to filter the subjective opinions of medical practitioners when used as a decision support tool. The primary aim is to provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to objectively determine when medical intervention such as caesarean section is required and help avoid preventable perinatal deaths. Classification of caesarean section and normal vaginal deliveries using foetal heart rate signals and advanced machine learning algorithms.
