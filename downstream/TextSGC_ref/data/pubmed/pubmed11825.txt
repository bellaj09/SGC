Data representing driving behavior as measured by various sensors installed in a vehicle are collected as multi-dimensional sensor time-series data. These data often include redundant information e.g. both the speed of wheels and the engine speed represent the velocity of the vehicle. Redundant information can be expected to complicate the data analysis e.g. more factors need to be analyzed; even varying the levels of redundancy can influence the results of the analysis. We assume that the measured multi-dimensional sensor time-series data of driving behavior are generated from low-dimensional data shared by the many types of one-dimensional data of which multi-dimensional time-series data are composed. Meanwhile sensor time-series data may be defective because of sensor failure. Therefore another important function is to reduce the negative effect of defective data when extracting low-dimensional time-series data. This study proposes a defect-repairable feature extraction method based on a deep sparse autoencoder DSAE to extract low-dimensional time-series data. In the experiments we show that DSAE provides high-performance latent feature extraction for driving behavior even for defective sensor time-series data. In addition we show that the negative effect of defects on the driving behavior segmentation task could be reduced using the latent features extracted by DSAE.
