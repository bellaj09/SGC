One important feature of the baroreflex loop is its strong preference for oscillations around 0.1 Hz. In this study we investigated heart rate intervals arterial blood pressure BP and prefrontal oxyhemoglobin changes during 5 min rest and during brisk finger movements in 19 healthy subjects. We analyzed the phase coupling around 0.1 Hz between cardiovascular and deoxyhemoglobin oscillations using the cross-spectral method. The analyses revealed phase shifts for slow oscillations in BP and heart rate intervals between -10 and -118 BP always leading. These phase shifts increased significantly p<0.01 in the movement session. The coupling between cardiovascular and oxyhemoglobin oscillations was less clear. Only 12 subjects demonstrated a phase coupling COH2  0.5 between oxyhemoglobin and BP oscillations. This may be explained by an overwhelming proportion of nonlinearity in cardiovascular and hemodynamic systems. The phase shifts between slow cardiovascular and hemodynamic oscillations are relatively stable subject-specific biometric features and could be of interest for person identification in addition to other biometric data. Slow BP-coupled oscillations in prefrontal oxyhemoglobin changes can seriously impair the detection of mentally induced hemodynamic changes in an optical brain-computer interface a novel nonmuscular communication system. About the stability of phase shifts between slow oscillations around 0.1 Hz in cardiovascular and cerebral systems.
