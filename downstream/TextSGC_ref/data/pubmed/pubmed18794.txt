Soft and integrated design can enable wearable haptic devices to augment natural human taction. This paper proposes a novel soft haptic finger-worn wearable device based on compliant and adhesive silicone skin and lightweight twisted and coiled polymer TCP actuators using ultra high molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE fibers to provide lateral skin stretch sensations. Recently silicone elastomers have been used in wearable sensors and in haptic applications for their high compliance or adhesion. TCP actuators have also demonstrated high power to weight ratios large stroke length simple mechanism and inherent softness. Lateral skin stretch is sensitive to small motions and has been used for intuitive proprioceptive feedback applications. We combined these characteristics to design and manufacture a wearable functional haptic prototype. Prototype performance was evaluated using an optical tracking system a force gauge test bench and compared to vibrotactile haptic feedback in a experiment with 14 healthy participants. Results showed that participant mean reaction times were comparable to those of a vibrotactile feedback system though task completion times were longer. This paper is the first to employ TCP actuators for haptic stimulation and could serve as a foundation for future applications involving soft wearable haptics in gaming health and virtual reality.
