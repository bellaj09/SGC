"The article reports on some ideas and experiences gained from a holistic approach to working with patients and introduces a viewpoint that includes opinions on how postmodernism the biopsychosocial model and a patient-centred interviewing style can change traditional biomedical-oriented medicine. During the past 10 years we have been instructing medical students in the use of this patient-centred interviewing model and have trained experienced general practitioners GPs in adopting it in 2-year family-oriented continuing medical education courses. We believe that doctors and other health care providers particularly in primary care settings need a comprehensive concept of human health and illness and that skill in patient-centred interviewing is the product of a deep learning process. In conclusion we have learned that a successful patient-centred interview helps the GP to better understand the patient and helps to explain the data that the patient presents. Patient-centred orientation and interviewing also change the communication between doctor and patient in a direction which supports the patients and his/her family members own resources in the healing process."
