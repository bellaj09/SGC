Deep learning has become the most widely used approach for cardiac image segmentation in recent years. In this paper we provide a review of over 100 cardiac image segmentation papers using deep learning which covers common imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and ultrasound and major anatomical structures of interest ventricles atria and vessels. In addition a summary of publicly available cardiac image datasets and code repositories are included to provide a base for encouraging reproducible research. Finally we discuss the challenges and limitations with current deep learning-based approaches scarcity of labels model generalizability across different domains interpretability and suggest potential directions for future research.
