Over the last few years the field of protein structure prediction has been transformed by increasingly accurate contact prediction software. These methods are based on the detection of coevolutionary relationships between residues from multiple sequence alignments MSAs. However despite speculation there is little evidence of a link between contact prediction and the physico-chemical interactions which drive amino-acid coevolution. Furthermore existing protocols predict only a fraction of all protein contacts and it is not clear why some contacts are favoured over others. Using a dataset of 863 protein domains we assessed the physico-chemical interactions of contacts predicted by CCMpred MetaPSICOV and DNCON2 as examples of direct coupling analysis meta-prediction and deep learning. The evolution of contact prediction: evidence that contact selection in statistical contact prediction is changing.
