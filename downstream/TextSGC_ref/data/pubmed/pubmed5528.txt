Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS is a powerful investigational tool for in vivo manipulation of regional or network activity with a growing number of potential clinical applications. Unfortunately the vast majority of targeting strategies remain limited by their reliance on non-realistic brain models and assumptions that anatomo-functional relationships are 1:1. Here we present an integrated framework that combines anatomically realistic finite element models of the human head with resting functional MRI to predict functional networks targeted via TMS at a given coil location and orientation. Using data from the Human Connectome Project we provide an example implementation focused on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC. Three distinct DLPFC stimulation zones were identified differing with respect to the network to be affected default frontoparietal and sensitivity to coil orientation. Network profiles generated for DLPFC targets previously published for treating depression revealed substantial variability across studies highlighting a potentially critical technical issue.
