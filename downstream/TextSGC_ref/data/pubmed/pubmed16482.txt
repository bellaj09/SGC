The virtual reality VR simulator is a useful tool to develop dental hand skill. However VR simulations with reactions of patients have limited computational time to reproduce a face model. Our aim was to develop a patient face model that enables real-time collision detection and cutting operation by using stereolithography STL and deterministic finite automaton DFA data files. We evaluated dependence of computational cost and constructed the patient face model using the optimum condition for combining STL and DFA data files and assessed the computational costs for operation in do-nothing collision cutting and combination of collision and cutting. The face model was successfully constructed with low computational costs of 11.3 18.3 30.3 and 33.5 ms for do-nothing collision cutting and collision and cutting respectively. The patient face model could be useful for developing dental hand skill with VR. Development of three-dimensional patient face model that enables real-time collision detection and cutting operation for a dental simulator.
