The Hounsfield unit HU obtained from high resolution computed tomography HRCT has been used to assess lung pathology. However lung mass density has not been quantified in vivo noninvasively. The objective of this study was to develop a method for analyzing lung mass density of superficial lung tissue of patients with interstitial lung disease ILD and healthy subjects using a deep neural network DNN and lung ultrasound surface wave elastography LUSWE. Surface wave speeds at three vibration frequencies 100 150 and 200\xa0Hz from LUSWE and a pulmonary function test PFT including predicted forced expiratory volume FEV1% pre and ratio of forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity FEV1%/FVC% were used. Predefined lung mass densities based on the HU for ILD patients and healthy subjects 77 in total were also used to train the DNN model. The DNN was composed of four hidden layers of 1024 neurons for each layer and trained for 80 epochs with a batch size of 20. The learning rate was 0.001. Performances of two types of activation functions in the DNN rectified linear activation unit ReLU and exponential linear unit ELU as well as machine learning models support vector regression random forest Adaboost were evaluated. The test dataset of wave speeds FEV1% pre and FEV%/FVC% was used to predict lung mass density. The results showed that predictions using a DNN with ELU obtained a comparatively better performance in the testing dataset accuracy\xa0=\xa00.89 than those of DNN with ReLU or machine learning models. This method may be useful to noninvasively analyze lung mass density by using the DNN model together with the measurements from LUSWE and PFT.
