Stretchable electronics can bridge the gap between hard planar electronic circuits and the curved soft and elastic objects of nature. This has led to applications like conformal displays electronic skin and soft neuroprosthetics. A remaining challenge however is to match the dimensions of the interfaced systems as all require feature sizes well below 100\u2009m. Intrinsically stretchable nanocomposites are attractive in this context as the mechanical deformations occur on the nanoscale although methods for patterning high performance materials have been lacking. Here we address these issues by reporting on a multilayer additive patterning approach for high resolution fabrication of stretchable electronic devices. The method yields highly conductive 30\u2009m tracks with similar performance to their macroscopic counterparts. Further we demonstrate a three layer micropatterned stretchable electroluminescent display with pixel sizes down to 70\u2009m. These presented findings pave the way towards future developments of high definition displays electronic skins and dense multielectrode arrays.
