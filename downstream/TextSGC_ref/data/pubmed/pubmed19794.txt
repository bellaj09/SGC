Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES is an emerging surgical paradigm where peritoneal access is achieved through one of the natural orifices of the body. It is being reported as a safe and feasible surgical technique with significantly reduced external scarring. Virtual Translumenal Endoscopic Surgical Trainer VTEST is the first virtual reality simulator for the NOTES. The VTEST simulator was developed to train surgeons in the hybrid transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy procedure. The initial version of the VTEST simulator underwent face validation at the 2013 Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research NOSCAR summit. Several areas of improvement were identified as a result and the corresponding modifications were implemented in the simulator. This manuscript outlines the results of the subsequent evaluation study performed in order to assess the face and content validity of the latest VTEST simulator.
