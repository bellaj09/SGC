The combination of BCI technology and stereoscopic three-dimensional 3D display has gradually become a trend while stereo-based BCI has been used in rehabilitation training and medical testing. However present stereo-based BCI research mainly stays in the static stereo environment and the main method of visual stimulation is flickering which does not effectively utilize the characteristic of the stereoscopic display technology. Therefore we proposed a novel stimulation method based on stereoscopic motion. It utilized the stereo reciprocating motion of the plane of intensive line to elicit steady-state visual motion evoked potential SSMVEP. The results shown that the correlation canonical analysis CCA coefficients of the EEG signal of stereoscopic motion 4.3 Hz-6.3 Hz was significant higher than the non-stereoscopic motion and more brain areas were activated. This stimulation method can induce significant visual response and has a great potential in the application of virtual reality stereo-based BCI system.
