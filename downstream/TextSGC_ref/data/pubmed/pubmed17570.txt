"Surgical errors occurring early in the learning curve of laparoscopic surgery providers delayed the uptake and progress of minimally invasive surgery MIS for years. This taught us a valuable lesson; innovations in surgical techniques should not be rapidly implemented until all aspects including applicability feasibility and safety have been fully tested. In 2005 the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research NOSCAR published a white paper highlighting the barriers to NOTES development and identifying key elements for its progress. One of these elements is the training of future providers. Proficiency-based virtual reality simulation will offer a feasible alternative to animal testing once the safety and efficacy parameters of NOTES are established. Recent advances in imaging including computed tomography CT scanning magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanning and ultrasound US scanning can offer improved image registration and real-time tracking. Combining these advanced imaging technologies with the newly designed virtual reality simulators will result in a fully comprehensive simulation curriculum which will offer a unique facility for future NOTES providers to train anytime anywhere and as much as they need to in order to achieve the pre-set proficiency levels for a variety of NOTES procedures. Furthermore they will incorporate patient-specific anatomical models obtained from patient imaging and uploaded onto the simulator to ensure face reliability and validity assurance. Training in a clean safe environment with proximate feedback and performance analysis will help accelerate the learning curve and therefore improve patients safety and outcomes in order to maximize the benefits of innovative access procedures such as NOTES."
