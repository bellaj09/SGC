A large number of incommensurable metrics are currently used to report the performance of brain-computer interfaces BCI used for augmentative and alterative communication AAC. The lack of standard metrics precludes the comparison of different BCI-based AAC systems hindering rapid growth and development of this technology. This paper presents a review of the metrics that have been used to report performance of BCIs used for AAC from January 2005 to January 2012. We distinguish between Level 1 metrics used to report performance at the output of the BCI Control Module which translates brain signals into logical control output and Level 2 metrics at the Selection Enhancement Module which translates logical control to semantic control. We recommend that: 1 the commensurate metrics Mutual Information or Information Transfer Rate ITR be used to report Level 1 BCI performance as these metrics represent information throughput which is of interest in BCIs for AAC; 2 the BCI-Utility metric be used to report Level 2 BCI performance as it is capable of handling all current methods of improving BCI performance; 3 these metrics should be supplemented by information specific to each unique BCI configuration; and 4 studies involving Selection Enhancement Modules should report performance at both Level 1 and Level 2 in the BCI system. Following these recommendations will enable efficient comparison between both BCI Control and Selection Enhancement Modules accelerating research and development of BCI-based AAC systems. Performance assessment in brain-computer interface-based augmentative and alternative communication.
