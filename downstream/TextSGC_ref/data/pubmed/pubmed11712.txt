Structural modeling of protein-protein interactions produces a large number of putative configurations of the protein complexes. Identification of the near-native models among them is a serious challenge. Publicly available results of biomedical research may provide constraints on the binding mode which can be essential for the docking. Our text-mining TM tool which extracts binding site residues from the PubMed abstracts was successfully applied to protein docking Badal et al. PLoS Comput Biol 2015; 11: e1004630. Still many extracted residues were not relevant to the docking. Natural language processing in text mining for structural modeling of protein complexes.
