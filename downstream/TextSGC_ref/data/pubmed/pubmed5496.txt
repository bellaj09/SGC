Understanding the neural correlates of the neurotic brain is important because neuroticism is a risk factor for the development of psychopathology. We examined the correlation between brain structural networks and neuroticism based on NEO Five-Factor Inventory NEO-FFI scores. Fifty-one healthy participants female n\u2009=\u200918; male n\u2009=\u200933; mean age 38.5\u2009\u200911.7 years underwent the NEO-FFI test and magnetic resonance imaging MRI including diffusion tensor imaging and 3D T1WI. Using MRI data for each participant we constructed whole-brain interregional connectivity matrices by deterministic tractography and calculated the graph theoretical network measures including the characteristic path length global clustering coefficient small-worldness and betweenness centrality BET in 83 brain regions from the Desikan-Killiany atlas with subcortical segmentation using FreeSurfer. In relation to the BET neuroticism score had a negative correlation in the left isthmus cingulate cortex left superior parietal left superior temporal right caudal middle frontal and right entorhinal cortices and a positive correlation in the bilateral frontal pole left caudal anterior cingulate cortex and left fusiform gyrus. No other measurements showed significant correlations. Our results imply that the brain regions related to neuroticism exist in various regions and that the neuroticism trait is likely formed as a result of interactions among these regions.
