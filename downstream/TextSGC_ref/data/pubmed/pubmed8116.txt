Evidence is accumulating that our brains process incoming information using top-down predictions. If lower level representations are correctly predicted by higher level representations this enhances processing. However if they are incorrectly predicted additional processing is required at higher levels to "explain away" prediction errors. Here we explored the potential nature of the models generating such predictions. More specifically we investigated whether a predictive processing model with a hierarchical structure and causal relations between its levels is able to account for the processing of agent-caused events. In Experiment 1 participants watched animated movies of "experienced" and "novice" bowlers. The results are in line with the idea that prediction errors at a lower level of the hierarchy i.e. the outcome of how many pins fell down slow down reporting of information at a higher level i.e. which agent was throwing the ball. Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that this effect is specific to situations in which the predictor is causally related to the outcome. Overall the study supports the idea that a hierarchical predictive processing model can account for the processing of observed action outcomes and that the predictions involved are specific to cases where action outcomes can be predicted based on causal knowledge.
