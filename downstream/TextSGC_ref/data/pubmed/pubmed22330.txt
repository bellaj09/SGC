Neuroprosthetic brain-computer interfaces are systems that decode neural activity into useful control signals for effectors such as a cursor on a computer screen. It has long been recognized that both the user and decoding system can adapt to increase the accuracy of the end effector. Co-adaptation is the process whereby a user learns to control the system in conjunction with the decoder adapting to learn the user\s neural patterns. We provide a mathematical framework for co-adaptation and relate co-adaptation to the joint optimization of the user\s control scheme "encoding model" and the decoding algorithm\s parameters. When the assumptions of that framework are respected co-adaptation cannot yield better performance than that obtainable by an optimal initial choice of fixed decoder coupled with optimal user learning. For a specific case we provide numerical methods to obtain such an optimized decoder. We demonstrate our approach in a model brain-computer interface system using an online prosthesis simulator a simple human-in-the-loop pyschophysics setup which provides a non-invasive simulation of the BCI setting. These experiments support two claims: that users can learn encoders matched to fixed optimal decoders and that once learned our approach yields expected performance advantages.
