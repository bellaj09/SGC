"Alzheimers disease AD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB are representative disorders of dementia of the elderly and the neuroimaging has contributed to early diagnosis by estimation of alterations of brain volume blood flow and metabolism. A brain network analysis by MR imaging MR connectome is a recently developed technique and can estimate the dysfunction of the brain network in AD and DLB. A graph theory which is a major technique of network analysis is useful for a group study to extract the feature of disorders but is not necessarily suitable for the disorder differentiation at the individual level. In this investigation we propose a deep learning technique as an alternative method of the graph analysis for recognition and classification of AD and DLB at the individual subject level."
