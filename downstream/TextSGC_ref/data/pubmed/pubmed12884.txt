Detection and characterization of abnormalities in clinical imaging are of utmost importance for patient diagnosis and treatment. We present a comparison of convolutional neural network CNN and human observer performance on a simulated lesion detection and characterization task. We apply both conventional performance metrics including accuracy and nonconventional metrics such as lift charts to perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons of each type of observer. It is determined that the CNN generally outperforms the human observers particularly at high noise levels. However high noise correlation reduces the relative performance of the CNN and human observer performance is comparable to CNN under these conditions. These findings extend into the field of diagnostic radiology where the adoption of deep learning is starting to become widespread. Consideration of the applications for which deep learning is most effective is of critical importance to this development.
