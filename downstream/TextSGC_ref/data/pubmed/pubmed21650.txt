Theory of Mind ToM plays a central role in regulating social interactions and its impairment is consistently reported in schizophrenia. Regarding schizophrenia ToM is usually discussed as a sub-domain of social cognition. Since social cognitive deficits have drawn the attention of researchers a variety of novel treatment techniques and approaches targeting social cognitive deficits have been developed. Encouraging results have repeatedly been reported on the modifiability of social cognitive impairment through these techniques. However emotional perception seems to be over-represented in these approaches at the expense of other areas such as ToM. This article presents a systematic review on the social cognitive interventions of the last 10 years which focused on the remediation of ToM or used techniques primarily focusing on one or more social cognitive domains other than ToM but with hypothetical effects on it. The aim of our systematic review was to compare these intervention techniques in order to see how effective they are in the remediation of ToM and to find the best techniques to ameliorate ToM deficits in schizophrenia. According to our findings targeted ToM intervention produced more improvement in ToM tasks while data regarding non-ToM interventions showed contradictory results with limited effects on ToM.
