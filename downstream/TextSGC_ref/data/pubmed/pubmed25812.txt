Technology brain-computer interface BCI based on the registration and interpretation of EEG has recently become one of the most popular developments in neuroscience and psychophysiology. This is due not only to the intended future use of these technologies in many areas of practical human activity but also to the fact that IMC--is a completely new paradigm in psychophysiology allowing test hypotheses about the possibilities of the human brain to the development of skills of interaction with the outside world without the mediation of the motor system i.e. only with the help of voluntary modulation of EEG generators. This paper examines the theoretical and experimental basis the current state and prospects of development of training communicational and assisting complexes based on BCI to control them without muscular effort on the basis of mental commands detected in the EEG of patients with severely impaired speech and motor system. Neurophysiological Foundations and Practical Realizations of the Brain-Machine Interfaces the Technology in Neurological Rehabilitation.
