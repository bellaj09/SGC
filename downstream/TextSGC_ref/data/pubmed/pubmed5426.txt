Novel approaches for studying the brain and relating its activities to mental phenomena have come into use during the past decade Bargmann 2015. These include both new laboratory methods - involving among others generation of isolated cells which retain neuronal characteristics in vivo; the selective stimulation of neurons by light in vivo; and direct electrical stimulation of specific brain regions to restore a system\s balance of excitation and inhibition - and a new organizing principle "connectomics" which recognizes that networks and not simply a key nucleus or region underlie most brain functions and malfunctions. Its application has already improved our comprehension of how the brain normally functions and our ability to help patients with such poorly treated neurologic and psychiatric diseases as Alzheimer\s disease. Connectomics and other novel methods for examining neural systems.
