Virtual reality VR is an emerging technology that alters the way individuals interact with computers: a 3D computer-generated environment in which a person can move about and interact as if he actually was inside it. Given to the high computational power required to create virtual environments these are usually developed on expensive high-end workstations. However the significant advances in PC hardware that have been made over the last three years are making PC-based VR a possible solution for clinical assessment and therapy. VREPAR - Virtual Reality Environments for Psychoneurophysiological Assessment and Rehabilitation - are two European Community funded projects Telematics for health - HC 1053/HC 1055 - http://www.psicologia.net that are trying to develop a modular PC-based virtual reality system for the medical market. The paper describes the rationale of the developed modules and the preliminary results obtained. The use of PC based VR in clinical medicine: the VREPAR projects.
