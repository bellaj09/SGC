Multimodal neuroimaging research has become increasingly popular and structure-function correspondence is tacitly assumed. Researchers have not yet adequately assessed whether the functional connectivity FC and structural connectivity SC of large-scale cortical networks are in agreement. Structural magnetic resonance imaging sMRI resting-state functional MRI rfMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging DWI data sets from 36 healthy subjects age 27.4 were selected from a Rockland sample Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into 62 regions according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas for FC and SC analyses. Thresholded correlations in rfMRI and tractography derived from DWI were used to construct FC and SC maps respectively. A community detection algorithm was applied to reveal the underlying organization and modular consistency was quantified to bridge cross-modal comparisons. The distributions of correlation coefficients in FC and SC maps were significantly different. Approximately one-fourth of the connections in the SC map were located at a correlation level below 0.2 df 253. The index of modular consistency in the within-modality interindividual condition either FC or SC was considerably greater than that in the between-modality intraindividual analog. In addition the SC-FC differential map SC connections with lower correlations revealed reliable modular structures. Based on these results the hypothesized FC-SC agreement is partially valid. Contingent on extant neuroimaging tools and analytical conventions the neural informatics of FC and SC should be regarded as complementary rather than concordant. Furthermore the results verify the physiological significance of moderately or mildly correlated brain signals in rfMRI which are often discarded by stringent thresholding.
