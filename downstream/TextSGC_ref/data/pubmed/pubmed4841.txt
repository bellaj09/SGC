"Brain areas functional repertoires are shaped by their incoming and outgoing structural connections. In empirically measured networks most connections are short reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless a small number of connections span long distances consistent with the notion that the functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise function of long-distance connections is unknown the leading hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain areas and increase the efficiency of interareal communication. However this hypothesis implies a nonspecificity of long-distance connections that we contend is unlikely. Instead we propose that long-distance connections serve to diversify brain areas inputs and outputs thereby promoting complex dynamics. Through analysis of five weighted interareal network datasets we show that long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal topological distance. In contrast areas long-distance and short-range neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles suggesting that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between areal inputs and outputs. Next we show that-in isolation-areas long-distance connectivity profiles exhibit nonrandom levels of similarity suggesting that the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that may serve to promote robustness. Finally we use a linearization of Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity and show that in the absence of long-distance connections a common measure of functional diversity decreases. Collectively our findings suggest that long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex brain dynamics."
