"Brain-computer interfaces BCI based on event-related potentials ERP allow for selection of characters from a visually presented character-matrix and thus provide a communication channel for users with neurodegenerative disease. Although they have been topic of research for more than 20\u2009years and were multiply proven to be a reliable communication method BCIs are almost exclusively used in experimental settings handled by qualified experts. This study investigates if ERP-BCIs can be handled independently by laymen without expert support which is inevitable for establishing BCIs in end-users daily life situations. Furthermore we compared the classic character-by-character text entry against a predictive text entry PTE that directly incorporates predictive text into the character-matrix. N\u2009=\u200919 BCI novices handled a user-centered ERP-BCI application on their own without expert support. The software individually adjusted classifier weights and control parameters in the background invisible to the user auto-calibration. All participants were able to operate the software on their own and to twice correctly spell a sentence with the auto-calibrated classifier once with PTE once without. Our PTE increased spelling speed and importantly did not reduce accuracy. In sum this study demonstrates feasibility of auto-calibrating ERP-BCI use independently by laymen and the strong benefit of integrating predictive text directly into the character-matrix."
