Toward weather condition recognition we emphasize the importance of regional cues in this paper and address a few important problems regarding appropriate representation its differentiation among regions and weather-condition feature construction. Our major contribution is first to construct a multi-class benchmark data set containing 65 000 images from six common categories for sunny cloudy rainy snowy haze and thunder weather. This data set also benefits weather classification and attribute recognition. Second we propose a deep learning framework named region selection and concurrency model RSCM to help discover regional properties and concurrency. We evaluate RSCM on our multi-class benchmark data and another public data set for weather recognition. RSCM: Region Selection and Concurrency Model for Multi-Class Weather Recognition.
