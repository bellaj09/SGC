Each brain hemisphere is dominant for certain functions such as speech. The determination of speech laterality prior to surgery is of paramount importance for accurate risk prediction. In this study we aimed to determine speech laterality via EEG signals by using noninvasive machine learning techniques. The retrospective study included 67 subjects aged 18-65\u202fyears who had no chronic diseases and were diagnosed as healthy based on EEG examination. The subjects comprised 35 right-hand dominant speech center located in the left hemisphere and 32 left-hand dominant individuals speech center located in the right hemisphere. A spectrogram was created for each of the 18 EEG channels by using various Convolutional Neural Networks CNN architectures including VGG16 VGG19 ResNet MobileNet NasNet and DenseNet. These architectures were used to extract features from the spectrograms. The extracted features were classified using Support Vector Machines SVM and the classification performances of the CNN models were evaluated using Area Under the Curve AUC. Of all the CNN models used in the study VGG16 had a higher AUC value 0.83\u202f\u202f0.05 in the determination of speech laterality compared to all other models. The present study is a pioneer investigation into the determination of speech laterality via EEG signals with machine learning techniques which to our knowledge has never been reported in the literature. Moreover the classification results obtained in the study are promising and lead the way for subsequent studies though not practically feasible. Is it possible to detect cerebral dominance via EEG signals by using deep learning?
