Virtual reality simulators are increasingly used in laparoscopy training. Such simulators allow objective assessment of performance. However both low-level variables and overall scores generated by the simulator can be hard to interpret. We present a method to generate intermediate performance variables and show how the resulting variables can be used to investigate the development of laparoscopic skills. Performance variables and professional experience in simulated laparoscopy: a two-group learning curve study.
