"We asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment for a neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical measures. Pre-treatment resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted structural connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder SAD to predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy CBT. We used a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT. Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of individuals treatment outcomes significantly better than a clinical measure of initial severity and combining the multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse responders logistic regression of connectomic predictors and initial severity combined with leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical prediction of clinical improvement with 81% accuracy 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Connectomics of the human brain measured by widely available imaging methods may provide brain-based biomarkers neuromarkers supporting precision medicine that better guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available treatments and thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice." Brain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder.
