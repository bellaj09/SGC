Virtual reality has been increasingly used in research on balance rehabilitation because it provides robust and novel sensory experiences in controlled environments. We studied 19 healthy young subjects performing a balance beam walking task in two virtual reality conditions and with unaltered view 15 minutes each to determine if virtual reality high heights exposure induced stress. We recorded number of steps off the beam heart rate electrodermal activity response time to an auditory cue and high-density electroencephalography EEG. We hypothesized that virtual high heights exposure would increase measures of physiological stress compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. We found that the virtual high height condition increased heart rate variability and heart rate frequency power relative to virtual low heights. Virtual reality use resulted in increased number of step-offs heart rate electrodermal activity and response time compared to the unaltered viewing at low heights condition. Our results indicated that virtual reality decreased dynamic balance performance and increased physical and cognitive loading compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. In virtual reality we found significant decreases in source-localized EEG peak amplitude relative to unaltered viewing in the anterior cingulate which is considered important in sensing loss of balance. Our findings indicate that virtual reality provides realistic experiences that can induce physiological stress in humans during dynamic balance tasks but virtual reality use impairs physical and cognitive performance during balance. Effects of virtual reality high heights exposure during beam-walking on physiological stress and cognitive loading.
