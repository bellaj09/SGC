The increasing use of robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery MIS provides an ideal environment for using Augmented Reality AR for performing image guided surgery. Seamless synthesis of AR depends on a number of factors relating to the way in which virtual objects appear and visually interact with a real environment. Traditional overlaid AR approaches generally suffer from a loss of depth perception. This paper presents a new AR method for robotic assisted MIS which uses a novel pq-space based non-photorealistic rendering technique for providing see-through vision of the embedded virtual object whilst maintaining salient anatomical details of the exposed anatomical surface. Experimental results with both phantom and in vivo lung lobectomy data demonstrate the visual realism achieved for the proposed method and its accuracy in providing high fidelity AR depth perception.
