This paper describes the potential role and limitations of current three-dimensional 3D virtual reality VR augmented reality AR and holography for image-guided surgery. We developed a new surgical spatial navigation system using VR AR and virtual holography. An interactive stereo display is used to view the interactions between the surgeon and stereo images of the patients anatomy depicted on the display by tracking the surgeons head and hand/arm positions. Sensing the surgeons head position creates motion parallax information an immersive depth cue that can be added to the binocular parallax already present in the display. The beneficial applications of VR/AR devices head-mounted devices 3D tablets and motion sensors are also discussed. They allow the user to manipulate the spatial attributes of VR which can enhance spatial reasoning and AR.
