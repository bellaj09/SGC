An increasing aging population poses a significant challenge to societies worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular cellular organ tissue physiological psychological and even sociological changes that occur with aging is needed in order to treat age-associated diseases. The field of aging research is rapidly expanding with multiple advances transpiring in many previously disconnected areas. Several major pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer companies made aging research a priority and are building internal expertise integrating aging research into traditional business models and exploring new go-to-market strategies. Many of these efforts are spearheaded by the latest advances in artificial intelligence namely deep learning including generative and reinforcement learning. To facilitate these trends the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and Insilico Medicine are building a community of Key Opinion Leaders KOLs in these areas and launched the annual conference series titled "Aging Research and Drug Discovery ARDD" held in the capital of the pharmaceutical industry Basel Switzerland www.agingpharma.org. This ARDD collection contains summaries from the 6th annual meeting that explored aging mechanisms and new interventions in age-associated diseases. The 7th annual ARDD exhibition will transpire 2nd-4th of September 2020 in Basel. Latest advances in aging research and drug discovery.
