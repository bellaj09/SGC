Individuals with spinal cord injury SCI can face decades with permanent disabilities. Advances in clinical management have decreased morbidity and improved outcomes but no randomized clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of a repair strategy for improving recovery from SCI. Here we summarize recent advances in biological and engineering strategies to augment neuroplasticity and/or functional recovery in animal models of SCI that are pushing toward clinical translation. Spinal cord repair: advances in biology and technology.
