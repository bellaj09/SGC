The mammalian prefrontal cortex known as the seat of high brain functions uses a six layer distribution of minicolumnar neurons to coordinate the integration of sensory information and the selection of relevant signals for goal driven behavior. To reveal the complex functionality of these columnar microcircuits we employed simultaneous recordings with several configurations of biomorphic microelectrode arrays MEAs within cortical layers in adjacent minicolumns in four nohuman primates NHPs performing a delayed match-to-sample DMS visual discrimination task. We examined: 1 the functionality of inter-laminar and inter-columnar interactions between pairs of cells in the same or different minicolumns by use of normalized cross-correlation histograms CCH 2 the modulation of glutamate concentration in layer 2/3 and 3 the potential interactions within these microcircuits. The results demonstrate that neurons in both infra-granular and supra-granular layers interact through inter-laminar loops as well as through intra-laminar to produce behavioral response signals. These results provide new insights into the manner in which prefrontal cortical microcircuitry integrates sensory stimuli used to provide behaviorally relevant signals that may be implemented in brain computer/machine interfaces BCI/BMIs during performance of the task. Prefrontal cortical recordings with biomorphic MEAs reveal complex columnar-laminar microcircuits for BCI/BMI implementation.
