Accurate delineation of cancer margins is critical for endoscopic curative resection. This study aimed to train and validate real-time fully convolutional networks for delineating the resection margin of early gastric cancer EGC under indigo carmine chromoendoscopy CE or white light endoscopy WLE and evaluated its performance and that of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging ME-NBI. A deep learning method for delineating early gastric cancer resection margin under chromoendoscopy and white light endoscopy.
