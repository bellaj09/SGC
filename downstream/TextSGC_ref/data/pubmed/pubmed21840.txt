"With the growing accessibility of computer-assisted technology rehabilitation programs for individuals with cerebral palsy CP increasingly use virtual reality environments to enhance motor practice. Thus it is important to examine whether performance improvements in the virtual environment generalize to the natural environment. To examine this issue we had 64 individuals 32 of which were individuals with CP and 32 typically developing individuals practice two coincidence-timing tasks. In the more tangible button-press task the individuals were required to intercept a falling virtual object at the moment it reached the interception point by pressing a key. In the more abstract less tangible task they were instructed to intercept the virtual object by making a hand movement in a virtual environment. The results showed that individuals with CP timed less accurate than typically developing individuals especially for the more abstract task in the virtual environment. The individuals with CP did-as did their typically developing peers-improve coincidence timing with practice on both tasks. Importantly however these improvements were specific to the practice environment; there was no transfer of learning. It is concluded that the implementation of virtual environments for motor rehabilitation in individuals with CP should not be taken for granted but needs to be considered carefully."
