"One of the greatest challenges that hinder the decoding and application of electroencephalography EEG is that EEG recordings almost always contain artifacts - non-brain signals. Among existing automatic artifact-removal methods artifact subspace reconstruction ASR is an online and realtime capable component-based method that can effectively remove transient or large-amplitude artifacts. However the effectiveness of ASR and the optimal choice of its parameter have not been evaluated and reported especially on real EEG data. This study systematically validates ASR on ten EEG recordings in a simulated driving experiment. Independent component analysis ICA is applied to separate artifacts from brain signals to allow a quantitative assessment of ASRs effectiveness in removing various types of artifacts and preserving brain activities. Empirical results show that the optimal ASR parameter is between 10 and 100 which is small enough to remove activities from artifacts and eye-related components and large enough to retain signals from brain-related components. With the appropriate choice of the parameter ASR can be a powerful and automatic artifact removal approach for offline data analysis or online real-time EEG applications such as clinical monitoring and brain-computer interfaces."
