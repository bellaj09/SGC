In a manikin study we recently assessed how effectively student operators were able to learn scaling with curettes GRA and power-driven instruments PP. Calculating the debrided root area effectiveness was low in both groups without systematic training or without a motivational program. After 10 weeks 20 h of training operators reached a high effectiveness of 84.7% GRA and 81.6% PP. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of nonsurgical treatment as performed by these student operators. Learning root debridement with curettes and power-driven instruments. Part II: Clinical results following mechanical nonsurgical therapy.
