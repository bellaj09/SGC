Classifying human actions from varied views is challenging due to huge data variations in different views. The key to this problem is to learn discriminative view-invariant features robust to view variations. In this paper we address this problem by learning view-specific and view-shared features using novel deep models. View-specific features capture unique dynamics of each view while view-shared features encode common patterns across views. A novel sample-affinity matrix is introduced in learning shared features which accurately balances information transfer within the samples from multiple views and limits the transfer across samples. This allows us to learn more discriminative shared features robust to view variations. In addition the incoherence between the two types of features is encouraged to reduce information redundancy and exploit discriminative information in them separately. The discriminative power of the learned features is further improved by encouraging features in the same categories to be geometrically closer. Robust view-invariant features are finally learned by stacking several layers of features. Experimental results on three multi-view data sets show that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. Deeply Learned View-Invariant Features for Cross-View Action Recognition.
