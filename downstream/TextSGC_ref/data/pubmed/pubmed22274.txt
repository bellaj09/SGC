Surgical checklists are in use as means to reduce errors. Checklists are infrequently applied during emergency situations in surgery. We aimed to study the effect of a simple self-administered performance-based checklist on the laparoscopic task when applied during an emergency-simulated scenario. The aviation checklist for unexpected situations is commonly used for simulated training of pilots to handle emergency during flights. This checklist was adopted for use as a standardised-performance-based checklist during emergency surgical tasks. Thirty consented laparoscopic novices were exposed unexpectedly to a bleeding vessel in a laparoscopic virtual reality simulator as an emergency scenario. The task consisted of using laparoscopic clips to achieve haemostasis. Subjects were randomly allocated into two equal groups; those using the checklist that was applied once every 20\xa0s checklist group and those without control group. The checklist group performed significantly better in 5 out of 7 technical factors when compared to the control group: right instrument path length m median IQR 1.44 1.22 versus 2.06 1.70 p\xa0=\xa00.029 right instrument angular path degree 312.10 269.44 versus 541.80 455.16 p\xa0=\xa00.014 left instrument path length m 1.20 0.60 versus 2.08 2.02 p\xa0=\xa00.004 and left instrument angular path degree 277.62 132.11 versus 385.88 428.42 p\xa0=\xa00.017. The checklist group committed significantly fewer number of errors in the application of haemostatic clips 3 versus 28 p\xa0=\xa00.006. Although statistically not significant total blood loss lit decreased in the checklist group from 0.83 1.23 to 0.78 0.28 p\xa0=\xa00.724 and total time sec from 186.51 145.69 to 125.14 101.46 p\xa0=\xa00.165. The performance-based intra-procedural checklist significantly enhanced the surgical task performance of novices in an emergency-simulated scenario.
