Brain functional connectome analysis is commonly based on population-wise inference. However in this way precious information provided at the individual subject level may be overlooked. Recently several studies have shown that individual differences contribute strongly to the functional connectivity patterns. In particular functional connectomes have been proven to offer a fingerprint measure which can reliably identify a given individual from a pool of participants. In this work we propose to refine the standard measure of individual functional connectomes using dictionary learning. More specifically we rely on the assumption that each functional connectivity is dominated by stable group and individual factors. By subtracting population-wise contributions from connectivity patterns facilitated by dictionary representation intersubject variability should be increased within the group. We validate our approach using several types of analyses. For example we observe that refined connectivity profiles significantly increase subject-specific identifiability across functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI session combinations. Besides refined connectomes can also improve the prediction power for cognitive behaviors. In accordance with results from the literature we find that individual distinctiveness is closely linked with differences in neurocognitive activity within the brain. In summary our results indicate that individual connectivity analysis benefits from the group-wise inferences and refined connectomes are indeed desirable for brain mapping. Refined measure of functional connectomes for improved identifiability and prediction.
