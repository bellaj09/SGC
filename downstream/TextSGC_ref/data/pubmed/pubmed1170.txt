"Whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from two patients a Chinese tourist visiting Rome and an Italian were compared with sequences from Europe and elsewhere. In a phylogenetic tree the Italian patients sequence clustered with sequences from Germany while the tourists sequence clustered with other European sequences. Some additional European sequences in the tree segregated outside the two clusters containing the patients sequences. This suggests multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions in Europe or virus evolution during circulation." Whole genome and phylogenetic analysis of two SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Italy in January and February 2020: additional clues on multiple introductions and further circulation in Europe.
