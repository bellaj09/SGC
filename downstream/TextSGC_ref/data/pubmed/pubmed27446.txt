Recent advances in mobile electroencephalogram EEG acquisition based on dry electrodes have started moving Brain-Computer Interface BCI applications from well-controlled laboratory settings to real-world environments. However the application mechanisms and high impedance of dry electrodes over the hair-covered areas remain challenging for everyday use of BCI. In addition whole-scalp recordings are not always necessary or applicable due to various practical constrains. Therefore alternative montages for EEG recordings to meet the everyday needs are in-demand. Inspired by our previous work on measuring non-hair-bearing steady state visual evoked potentials for BCI applications this study explores the feasibility and efficacy of detecting cognitive lapses of participants based on EEG signals collected from the non-hair-bearing areas. Study results suggest that informative EEG features associated with lapses could be assessed from non-hair-bearing areas with comparable accuracy obtained from the whole-scalp EEG. The design principles validation processes and promising findings reported in this study may enable and/or facilitate numerous BCI applications in real-world environments.
