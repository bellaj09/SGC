"Word reading in alphabetic language involves a cortical system with multiple components whose division of labor depends on the transparency of the writing system. To gain insight about the neural division of labor between phonology and semantics subserving word reading in Chinese a deep non-alphabetic writing system functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI was used to investigate the effects of phonological and semantic training on the cortical circuitry for oral naming of Chinese characters. In a training study we examined whether a training task that differentially focused readers attention on the phonological or semantic properties of a Chinese character changes the patterns of cortical activation that was evoked by that character in a subsequent naming task. Our imaging results corroborate that the cortical regions underlying reading in Chinese largely overlap the left-hemisphere reading system responsible for reading in alphabetic languages with some cortical regions in the left-hemisphere uniquely recruited for reading in Chinese. However in contrast to findings from studies of English word naming we observed considerable overlap in the neural activation patterns associated with phonological and semantic training on naming Chinese characters which we suggest may reflect a balanced neural division of labor between phonology and semantics in Chinese character reading. The equitable division of labor for Chinese reading might be driven by the special statistical structure of the writing system which includes equally systematic mappings in the correspondences between written forms and their pronunciations and meanings." Neural division of labor in reading is constrained by culture: a training study of reading Chinese characters.
