Although several data-driven soft sensors are available online reliable prediction of the Mooney viscosity in industrial rubber mixing processes is still a challenging task. A robust semi-supervised soft sensor called ensemble deep correntropy kernel regression EDCKR is proposed. It integrates the ensemble strategy deep brief network DBN and correntropy kernel regression CKR into a unified soft sensing framework. The multilevel DBN-based unsupervised learning stage extracts useful information from all secondary variables. Sequentially a supervised CKR model is built to explore the relationship between the extracted features and the Mooney viscosity values. Without cumbersome preprocessing steps the negative effects of outliers are reduced using the CKR-based robust nonlinear estimator. With the help of ensemble strategy more reliable prediction results are further obtained. An industrial case validates the practicality and reliability of EDCKR.
