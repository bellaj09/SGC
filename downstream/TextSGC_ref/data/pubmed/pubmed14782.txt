Effective interventions to promote upper-limb recovery poststroke are characterised by intensive and repetitive movements. However the repetitive nature of practice may adversely impact on adherence. Therefore the development of rehabilitation devices that can be used safely and easily at home and are motivating enjoyable and affordable is essential to the health and well-being of stroke survivors.The Neurofenix platform is a non-immersive virtual reality device for poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation. The platform uses a hand controller a NeuroBall or arm bands NeuroBands that facilitate upper-limb exercise via games displayed on a tablet. The Rehabilitation via HOMe Based gaming exercise for the Upper-limb post Stroke trial aims to determine the safety feasibility and acceptability of the Neurofenix platform for home-based rehabilitation of the upper-limb poststroke.
