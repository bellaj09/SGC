In silico modeling is a crucial milestone in modern drug design and development. Although computer-aided approaches in this field are well-studied the application of deep learning methods in this research area is at the beginning. In this work we present an original deep neural network DNN architecture named RANC Reinforced Adversarial Neural Computer for the de novo design of novel small-molecule organic structures based on the generative adversarial network GAN paradigm and reinforcement learning RL. As a generator RANC uses a differentiable neural computer DNC a category of neural networks with increased generation capabilities due to the addition of an explicit memory bank which can mitigate common problems found in adversarial settings. The comparative results have shown that RANC trained on the SMILES string representation of the molecules outperforms its first DNN-based counterpart ORGANIC by several metrics relevant to drug discovery: the number of unique structures passing medicinal chemistry filters MCFs Muegge criteria and high QED scores. RANC is able to generate structures that match the distributions of the key chemical features/descriptors e.g. MW logP TPSA and lengths of the SMILES strings in the training data set. Therefore RANC can be reasonably regarded as a promising starting point to develop novel molecules with activity against different biological targets or pathways. In addition this approach allows scientists to save time and covers a broad chemical space populated with novel and diverse compounds.
