The experience of childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for the development of depression. This risk is particularly heightened after exposure to additional more contemporaneous stress. While behavioral evidence exists for this relation little is known about biological correlates of these stress interactions. Identifying such correlates may provide biomarkers of risk for later depression. Heightened connectivity between the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex as a biomarker for stress-related psychopathology: understanding interactive effects of early and more recent stress.
