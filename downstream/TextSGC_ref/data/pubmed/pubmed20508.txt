"Study Design: Experimental study.Objectives: Research is lacking on the Unity suspension systems effect on gait performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Unity elevated vacuum system on level walking performance while the vacuum was active ON and inactive OFF.Methods: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees were fit with the Ossur elevated vacuum suspension system Unity and Pro-flex XC foot. After one month accommodation period 3D motion analysis was performed using the CAREN-Extended system. Temporal-spatial kinematics and kinetics were examined during level walking to understand the effect of the elevated vacuum separate trials were completed with the vacuum active ON or inactive OFF.Results: Significant differences were found between vacuum conditions ON and OFF for some temporal-spatial gait parameters but differences were very small and may not be clinically significant. Differences between vacuum conditions on most kinetic and kinematic gait parameters were also low. However step length symmetry between intact and prosthetic limbs improved with active elevated vacuum ON.Conclusions: Elevated vacuum suspensions effect on level walking gait is small if a well-fitting liner-based socket is provided.Implications for rehabilitationStep length symmetry between intact and prosthetic limbs improved with an active vacuum system.Differences between vacuum conditions on most gait parameters were small during level walking.Subjective feedback showed improved proprioception and comfort with an active vacuum system."
