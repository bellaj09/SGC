This study aimed to apply virtual body swapping through mental rehearsal for patients with complex regional pain syndrome CRPS and to investigate whether it is applicable to them. Ten patients who met the diagnostic criterion for CRPS type 1 were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. All participants were asked to watch the virtual body swapping training video clip with a head mounted display. The treatment group was additionally asked to assume a posture similar to the body on the screen and rehearse the movements mentally as if the body presented on the screen was their body. No difference between the groups was found for pain intensity however the treatment group showed significantly more improvement in body perception disturbance BPD after the treatment than the control group. Even if the presented study is a preliminary one the above results suggest that virtual body swapping through mental rehearsal is applicable for patients with CRPS and may be useful for improving BPD. The limitations of the study and the future investigations needed to provide clearer clinical suggestions are presented and discussed. Application of virtual body swapping to patients with complex regional pain syndrome: a pilot study.
