"Current mental state monitoring systems a.k.a. passive brain-computer interfaces pBCI allow one to perform a real-time assessment of an operators cognitive state. In EEG-based systems typical measurements for workload level assessment are band power estimates in several frequency bands. Mental fatigue arising from growing time-on-task TOT can significantly affect the distribution of these band power features. However the impact of mental fatigue on workload WKL assessment has not yet been evaluated. With this paper we intend to help fill in this lack of knowledge by analyzing the influence of WKL and TOT on EEG band power features as well as their interaction and its impact on classification performance. Twenty participants underwent an experiment that modulated both their WKL low/high and time spent on the task short/long. Statistical analyses were performed on the EEG signals behavioral and subjective data. They revealed opposite changes in alpha power distribution between WKL and TOT conditions as well as a decrease in WKL level discriminability with increasing TOT in both number of statistical differences in band power and classification performance. Implications for pBCI systems and experimental protocol design are discussed." Mental fatigue and working memory load estimation: interaction and implications for EEG-based passive BCI.
