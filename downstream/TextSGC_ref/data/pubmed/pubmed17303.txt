A living cell has a complex hierarchically organized signaling system that encodes and assimilates diverse environmental and intracellular signals and it further transmits signals that control cellular responses including a tightly controlled transcriptional program. An important and yet challenging task in systems biology is to reconstruct cellular signaling system in a data-driven manner. In this study we investigate the utility of deep hierarchical neural networks in learning and representing the hierarchical organization of yeast transcriptomic machinery. Learning a hierarchical representation of the yeast transcriptomic machinery using an autoencoder model.
