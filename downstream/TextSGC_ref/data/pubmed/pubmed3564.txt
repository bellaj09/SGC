Although multiple studies have reported structural deficits in multiple brain regions in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD we do not yet know if these deficits reflect a more systematic disruption to the anatomical organization of large-scale brain networks. Here we used a graph theoretical approach to quantify anatomical organization in children and adolescents with ADHD. We generated anatomical networks based on covariance of gray matter volumes from 92 regions across the brain in children and adolescents with ADHD n=34 and age- and sex-matched healthy controls n=28. Using graph theory we computed metrics that characterize both the global organization of anatomical networks interconnectivity clustering integration path length and balance of global integration and localized segregation small-worldness and their local nodal measures participation degree and interaction betweenness within a network. Relative to Controls ADHD participants exhibited altered global organization reflected in more clustering or network segregation. Locally nodal degree and betweenness were increased in the subcortical amygdalae in ADHD but reduced in cortical nodes in the anterior cingulate posterior cingulate mid temporal pole and rolandic operculum. In ADHD anatomical networks were disrupted and reflected an emphasis on subcortical local connections centered around the amygdala at the expense of cortical organization. Brains of children and adolescents with ADHD may be anatomically configured to respond impulsively to the automatic significance of stimulus input without having the neural organization to regulate and inhibit these responses. These findings provide a novel addition to our current understanding of the ADHD connectome.
