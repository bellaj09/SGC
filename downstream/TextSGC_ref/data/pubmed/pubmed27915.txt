Next generation neural interfaces aspire to achieve real-time multi-channel systems by integrating spike sorting on chip to overcome limitations in communication channel capacity. The feasibility of this approach relies on developing highly efficient algorithms for feature extraction and clustering with the potential of low-power hardware implementation. We are proposing a feature extraction method not requiring any calibration based on first and second derivative features of the spike waveform. The accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed method are quantified and compared against commonly used feature extraction methods through simulation across four datasets with different single units at multiple noise levels ranging from 5 to 20% of the signal amplitude. The average classification error is shown to be below 7% with a computational complexity of 2N-3 where N is the number of sample points of each spike. Overall this method presents a good trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity and is thus particularly well-suited for hardware-efficient implementation.
