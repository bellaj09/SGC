This review covers original articles using deep learning in the biophotonic field published in the last years. In these years deep learning which is a subset of machine learning mostly based on artificial neural network geometries was applied to a number of biophotonic tasks and has achieved state-of-the-art performances. Therefore deep learning in the biophotonic field is rapidly growing and it will be utilized in the next years to obtain real-time biophotonic decision-making systems and to analyze biophotonic data in general. In this contribution we discuss the possibilities of deep learning in the biophotonic field including image classification segmentation registration pseudostaining and resolution enhancement. Additionally we discuss the potential use of deep learning for spectroscopic data including spectral data preprocessing and spectral classification. We conclude this review by addressing the potential applications and challenges of using deep learning for biophotonic data. Deep learning a boon for biophotonics?
