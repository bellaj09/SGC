Purpose: We propose a convolutional neural network CNN based on wavelet for verifying the activation regions decided with statistical analysis. Because the functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data contains lots of noises it is difficult to get the data of blood-oxygen-level dependent BOLD signal directly for intervention testing like animal studies. So it is difficult to effectively verify these activation regions. Based on the rapid development of deep learning technology.Materials and methods: We select the task fMRI data of presenting food and nonfood pictures to volunteer subjects from open public data whose website is https://www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000157/. Firstly the brain activation regions are obtained by utilizing the method of statistical analysis. Then the spatial coordinates are acquired from the activation regions by checking the atlas table. The P-value of the activation regions are less 0.05. The activation regions are the most responsive to perceive the differences of BOLD in the brain between the two states presenting food and nonfood pictures. We select the part task fMRI data of from the activation regions for preparing the training and validation samples. Then we design a deep leaning network based on wavelet to classify the task fMRI data between food and nonfood.Results and conclusions: The classification accuracy is 80.23%. However when we select the spatial coordinates of other inactivation regions the classification accuracy is only 60%. The differences of classification accuracy between the activation regions and the inactivation regions prove that the activation regions selected with statistical analysis method are accurate and effective. The two methods of deep learning and statistical analysis can be cross-validated for the study of human being brain. Utilizing wavelet deep learning network to classify different states of task-fMRI for verifying activation regions.
