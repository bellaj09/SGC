"In the present era enormous factors contribute to causing cancer. So cancer classification cannot rely only on doctors thoughts. As a result intelligent algorithms concerning doctors help are inevitable. Therefore the authors are motivated to suggest a novel algorithm to classify three cancer datasets; colon ALL-AML and leukaemia cancers. Their proposed algorithm is based on the deep neural network and emotional learning process. First of all by applying the principal component analysis they had a feature reduction. Then they used deep neural as a feature extraction. Then they implemented different classifiers; multi-layer perceptron support vector machine SVM decision tree and Gaussian mixture model. In the end because in the real world especially when working on systems biology unpredictable events and uncertainties are undeniable the robustness of their model against uncertainties is important. So they added Gaussian noise to the input features of the first encoder in each dataset then they applied the stacked denoising method. Experimental results disclosed that generally using emotional learning increased the accuracy. In addition the highest accuracy was gained by SVM 91.66 92.27 and 96.56% for colon ALL-AML and leukaemia respectively. However GMM led to the lowest accuracy. The best accuracy gained by GMM was 60%." Cancers classification based on deep neural networks and emotional learning approach.
