Large-scale brain networks are often described using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. However the blood oxygenation level-dependent BOLD signal provides an indirect measure of neuronal firing and reflects slow-evolving hemodynamic activity that fails to capture the faster timescale of normal physiological function. Here we used fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS and simultaneous electroencephalography EEG to characterize individual brain dynamics within discrete brain networks at high temporal resolution. TMS was used to induce controlled perturbations to individually defined nodes of the default mode network DMN and the dorsal attention network DAN. Source-level EEG propagation patterns were network-specific and highly reproducible across sessions 1 month apart. Additionally individual differences in high-order cognitive abilities were significantly correlated with the specificity of TMS propagation patterns across DAN and DMN but not with resting-state EEG dynamics. Findings illustrate the potential of TMS-EEG perturbation-based biomarkers to characterize network-level individual brain dynamics at high temporal resolution and potentially provide further insight on their behavioral significance. Individualized perturbation of the human connectome reveals reproducible biomarkers of network dynamics relevant to cognition.
