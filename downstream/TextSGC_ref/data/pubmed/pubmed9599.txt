The availability of high-throughput omics datasets from large patient cohorts has allowed the development of methods that aim at predicting patient clinical outcomes such as survival and disease recurrence. Such methods are also important to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and development as well as treatment responses. Recently different predictive models relying on distinct algorithms including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests have been investigated. In this context deep learning strategies are of special interest due to their demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such strategies is the "small n large p" problem. Indeed omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of samples and large numbers of features relative to typical deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this problem through feature selection or by including additional constraints during the learning process.
