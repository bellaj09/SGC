"The personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion are strongly associated with emotional experience and affective disorders. Previous studies reported functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI activity correlates of these traits but no study has used brain-based measures to predict them. Here using a fully cross-validated approach we predict novel individuals neuroticism and extraversion from functional connectivity FC data observed as they simply rested during fMRI scanning. We applied a data-driven technique connectome-based predictive modeling CPM to resting-state FC data and neuroticism and extraversion scores self-reported NEO Five Factor Inventory from 114 participants of the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland sample. After dividing the whole brain into 268 nodes using a predefined functional atlas we defined each individuals FC matrix as the set of correlations between the activity timecourses of every pair of nodes. CPM identified networks consisting of functional connections correlated with neuroticism and extraversion scores and used strength in these networks to predict a left-out individuals scores. CPM predicted neuroticism and extraversion in novel individuals demonstrating that patterns in resting-state FC reveal trait-level measures of personality. CPM also revealed predictive networks that exhibit some anatomical patterns consistent with past studies and potential new brain areas of interest in personality." Resting-state functional connectivity predicts neuroticism and extraversion in novel individuals.
