Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes BECTS is associated with cognitive and language problems. According to recent studies disruptions in brain structure and function in children with BECTS are beyond a Rolandic focus suggesting atypical cortical development. However previous studies utilizing surface-based metrics e.g. cortical gyrification and their structural covariance networks at high resolution in children with BECTS are limited. Twenty-six children with BECTS 15 males/11 females; 10.35\u2009\u20092.91\u2009years and 26 demographically matched controls 15 males/11 females; 11.35\u2009\u20092.51\u2009years were included in this study and subjected to high-resolution structural brain MRI scans. The gyrification index was calculated and structural brain networks were reconstructed based on the covariance of the cortical folding. In the BECTS group significantly increased gyrification was observed in the bilateral Sylvain fissures and the left pars triangularis temporal rostral middle frontal lateral orbitofrontal and supramarginal areas cluster-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05. Global brain network measures were not significantly different between the groups; however the nodal alterations were most pronounced in the insular frontal temporal and occipital lobes FDR corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05. In children with BECTS brain hubs increased in number and tended to shift to sensorimotor and temporal areas. Furthermore we observed significantly positive relationships between the gyrification index and age vertex p\u2009<\u20090.001 cluster-level correction as well as duration of epilepsy vertex p\u2009<\u20090.001 cluster-level correction. Our results suggest that BECTS may be a condition that features abnormal over-folding of the Sylvian fissures and uncoordinated development of structural wiring disrupted nodal profiles of centrality and shifted hub distribution which potentially represents a neuroanatomical hallmark of BECTS in the developing brain.
