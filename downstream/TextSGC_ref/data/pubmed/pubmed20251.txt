"Visual feedback in general and from the body in particular is known to influence the performance of motor skills in humans. However it is unclear how the acquisition of motor skills depends on specific visual feedback parameters such as the size of performing effector. Here 21 healthy subjects physically trained to perform sequences of finger movements with their right hand. Through the use of 3D Virtual Reality devices visual feedback during training consisted of virtual hands presented on the screen tracking subjects hand movements in real time. Importantly the setup allowed us to manipulate the size of the displayed virtual hands across experimental conditions. We found that performance gains increase with the size of virtual hands. In contrast when subjects trained by mere observation i.e. in the absence of physical movement manipulating the size of the virtual hand did not significantly affect subsequent performance gains. These results demonstrate that when it comes to short-term motor skill learning the size of visual feedback matters. Furthermore these results suggest that highest performance gains in individual subjects are achieved when the size of the virtual hand matches their real hand size. These results may have implications for optimizing motor training schemes." Short Term Motor-Skill Acquisition Improves with Size of Self-Controlled Virtual Hands.
