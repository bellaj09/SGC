This paper introduces the "encoded local projections" ELP as a new dense-sampling image descriptor for search and classification problems. The gradient changes of multiple projections in local windows of gray-level images are encoded to build a histogram that captures spatial projection patterns. Using projections is a conventional technique in both medical imaging and computer vision. Furthermore powerful dense-sampling methods such as local binary patterns and the histogram of oriented gradients are widely used for image classification and recognition. Inspired by many achievements of such existing descriptors we explore the design of a new class of histogram-based descriptors with particular applications in medical imaging. We experiment with three public datasets IRMA Kimia Path24 and CT Emphysema to comparatively evaluate the performance of ELP histograms. In light of the tremendous success of deep architectures we also compare the results with deep features generated by pretrained networks. The results are quite encouraging as the ELP descriptor can surpass both conventional and deep descriptors in performance in several experimental settings.
