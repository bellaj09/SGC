In precision medicine deep phenotyping is defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities aiming to acquire a better understanding of the natural history of a disease and its genotype-phenotype associations. Detecting phenotypic relevance is an important task when translating precision medicine into clinical practice especially for patient stratification tasks based on deep phenotyping. In our previous work we developed node embeddings for the Human Phenotype Ontology HPO to assist in phenotypic relevance measurement incorporating distributed semantic representations. However the derived HPO embeddings hold only distributed representations for IS-A relationships among nodes hampering the ability to fully explore the graph.
