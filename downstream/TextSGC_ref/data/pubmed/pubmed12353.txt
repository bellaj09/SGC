With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology a large number of transcript sequences have been discovered and how to identify long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs from transcripts is a challenging task. The identification and inclusion of lncRNAs not only can more clearly help us to understand life activities themselves but can also help humans further explore and study the disease at the molecular level. At present the detection of lncRNAs mainly includes two forms of calculation and experiment. Due to the limitations of bio sequencing technology and ineluctable errors in sequencing processes the detection effect of these methods is &nbsp;not very satisfactory. In this paper we constructed a deep-learning model to effectively distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs. We used k-mer embedding vectors obtained through training the GloVe algorithm as input features and set up the deep learning framework to include a bidirectional long short-term memory model BLSTM layer and a convolutional neural network CNN layer with three additional hidden layers. By testing our model we have found that it obtained the best values of 97.9% 96.4% and 99.0% in F1score accuracy and auROC respectively which showed better classification performance than the traditional PLEK CNCI and CPC methods for identifying lncRNAs. We hope that our model will provide effective help in distinguishing mature mRNAs from lncRNAs and become a potential tool to help humans understand and detect the diseases associated with lncRNAs.
