Health care needs of those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV and subsequent transmission dynamics are altered by migration after infection. We interviewed 760 HIV-infected persons attending HIV-specialty clinics living in non-urban Alabama and Mississippi to ascertain the likely geographic origins of their infections determine their post-HIV diagnosis mobility and identify predictors of this mobility. Most subjects 81% were living in these two states when diagnosed and have not moved since learning of their HIV status 70%. Of those who moved their primary residence post-HIV diagnosis 25% of the entire study population the majority in-migrated to Alabama or Mississippi from elsewhere. Persons who had moved post-HIV diagnosis were more likely to be male an injection drug user an urban resident at HIV diagnosis have an AIDS-defining condition and have moved prior to HIV diagnosis. We conclude that most HIV transmission in non-urban Alabama and Mississippi is acquired locally. These results underline the need to expand HIV prevention programs in the Deep South. Migration patterns following HIV diagnosis among adults residing in the nonurban Deep South.
