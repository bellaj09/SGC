Deep learning DL a type of machine learning approach is a powerful tool for analyzing large sets of data that are derived from biomedical sciences. However it remains unknown whether DL is suitable for identifying contributing factors such as biomarkers in quantitative proteomics data. In this study we describe an optimized DL-based analytical approach using a data set that was generated by selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry SRM-MS comprising SRM-MS data from 1008 samples for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to test its classification power. Its performance was compared with that of 5 conventional multivariate and machine learning methods: random forest RF support vector machine SVM logistic regression LR k-nearest neighbors k-NN and nave Bayes NB. The DL method yielded the best classification AUC 0.9472 for the test data set of all approaches. We also optimized the parameters of DL individually to determine which factors were the most significant. In summary the DL method has advantages in classifying the quantitative proteomics data of pancreatic cancer patients and our results suggest that its implementation can improve the performance of diagnostic assays in clinical settings.
