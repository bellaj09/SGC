Alkaloids a class of organic compounds that contain nitrogen bases are mainly synthesized as secondary metabolites in plants and fungi and they have a wide range of bioactivities. Although there are thousands of compounds in this class few of their biosynthesis pathways are fully identified. In this study we constructed a model to predict their precursors based on a novel kind of neural network called the molecular graph convolutional neural network. Molecular similarity is a crucial metric in the analysis of qualitative structure-activity relationships. However it is sometimes difficult for current fingerprint representations to emphasize specific features for the target problems efficiently. It is advantageous to allow the model to select the appropriate features according to data-driven decisions for extracting more useful information which influences a classification or regression problem substantially. Classification of alkaloids according to the starting substances of their biosynthetic pathways using graph convolutional neural networks.
