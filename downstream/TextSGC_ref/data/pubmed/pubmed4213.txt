"The study of functional brain networks has grown rapidly over the past decade. While most functional connectivity FC analyses estimate one static network structure for the entire length of the functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI time series recently there has been increased interest in studying time-varying changes in FC. Hidden Markov models HMMs have proven to be a useful modeling approach for discovering repeating graphs of interacting brain regions brain states. However a limitation lies in HMMs assuming that the sojourn time the number of consecutive time points in a state is geometrically distributed. This may encourage inaccurate estimation of the time spent in a state before switching to another state. We propose a hidden semi-Markov model HSMM approach for inferring time-varying brain networks from fMRI data which explicitly models the sojourn distribution. Specifically we propose using HSMMs to find each subjects most probable series of network states and the graphs associated with each state while properly estimating and modeling the sojourn distribution for each state. We perform a simulation study as well as an analysis on both task-based fMRI data from an anxiety-inducing experiment and resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results demonstrate the importance of model choice when estimating sojourn times and reveal their potential for understanding healthy and diseased brain mechanisms."
