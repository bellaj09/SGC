"Electrical high frequency stimulation HFS has been used to treat various neurological and psychiatric diseases. The striatal area contributes to response learning and procedural memory. Therefore we investigated the effect of striatal HFS application on procedural/declarative-like memory in rats. All rats were trained in a flooded Double-H maze for three days 4 trials/day to swim to an escape platform hidden at a constant location. The starting place was the same for all trials. After each training session HFS of the left dorsal striatum was performed over 4h in alternating 20 min periods during rest time 10a.m. to 3p.m.. Nineteen hours after the last HFS and right after a probe trial assessing the rats strategy procedural vs. declarative-like memory-based choice animals were sacrificed and the dorsal striatum was quickly removed. Neurotransmitter levels were measured by HPLC. Stimulated rats did not differ from sham-operated and control rats in acquisition performance but exhibited altered behavior during the probe trial procedural memory responses being less frequent than in controls. In stimulated rats GABA levels were significantly increased in the dorsal striatum on both sides. We suggest that HFS of the dorsal striatum does not alter learning behavior in rats but influences the strategy by which the rats solve the task. Given that the HFS-induced increase of GABA levels was found 19 h after stimulation it can be assumed that HFS has consequences lasting for several hours and which are functionally significant at a behavioral level at least under our stimulation frequency timing location side and strength of stimulation and testing conditions."
