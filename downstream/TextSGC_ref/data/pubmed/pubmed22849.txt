Detecting event-related potential ERP is a challenging problem because of its low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spatial-temporal features. Conventional detection methods usually rely on the ensemble averaging technique which may eliminate subtle but important information in ERP signals and lead to poor detection performance. Inspired by the good performance of discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine DRBM in feature extraction and classification we propose a spatial-temporal DRBM ST-DRBM to extract spatial and temporal features for ERP detection. The experimental results and statistical analyses demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art ERP detection performance. The ST-DRBM is not only an effective ERP detector but also a practical tool for ERP analysis. Based on the proposed model similar scalp distribution and temporal variations were found in the ERP signals of different sessions which indicated the feasibility of cross-session ERP detection. Given its state-of-the-art performance and effective analytical technique ST-DRBM is promising for ERP-based brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience research.
