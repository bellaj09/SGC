"Parkinsons disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons as well as the presence of proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies. -synuclein -syn is a major constituent of Lewy bodies and the first disease-causing protein characterized in PD. Several -syn-based animal models of PD have been developed to investigate the pathophysiology of PD but none of them recapitulate the full picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for developing PD but its impact on -syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In this study we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral AAV vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated -syn to elucidate the influence of ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with -syn pathology in different mammalian species." Lack of additive role of ageing in nigrostriatal neurodegeneration triggered by -synuclein overexpression.
