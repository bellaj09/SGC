This study aimed to explore the development of mental rotation ability throughout life by comparing different kinds of stimuli. Thirty-six children 6-9 years-old 30 young 20-28 years-old and 30 elderly people 60-82 years-old performed mental rotation tasks with abstract i.e. two-dimensional lines and concrete stimuli i.e. hands human/animal faces. The results showed that overall young people outperformed children and elderly people while children were less accurate than the elderly. However the effect of age was shaped by the kinds of stimuli: a young people were more accurate than children and elderly people particularly with abstract stimuli; b elderly people improved their performance with images depicting faces; c children performed better with body-related stimuli than animal faces. Finally performance was more difficult when stimuli were rotated by 180 especially for younger and older females. We may conclude that the effects of age are modulated by the characteristics of the stimuli with a specific difficulty for abstract stimuli and a facilitation for concrete stimuli. As an innovative aspect during childhood there appeared a specific facilitation for body-related stimuli not just for concrete ones. These findings are interpreted according to embodied models of cognitive development and the effects of ageing on the brain.
