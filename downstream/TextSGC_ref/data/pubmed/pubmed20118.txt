"This work presents an immersive Virtual Reality VR system to evaluate and potentially treat the alterations in rhythmic hand movements seen in Parkinsons disease PD and the elderly EC by comparison with healthy young controls YC. The system integrates the subjects into a VR environment by means of a Head Mounted Display such that subjects perceive themselves in a virtual world consisting of a table within a room. In this experiment subjects are presented in 1st person perspective so that the avatar reproduces finger tapping movements performed by the subjects. The task known as the finger tapping test FT was performed by all three subject groups PD EC and YC. FT was carried out by each subject on two different days sessions one week apart. In each FT session all subjects performed FT in the real world FTREAL and in the VR FTVR; each mode was repeated three times in randomized order. During FT both the tapping frequency and the coefficient of variation of inter-tap interval were registered. FTVR was a valid test to detect differences in rhythm formation between the three groups. Intra-class correlation coefficients ICC and mean difference between days for FTVR for each group showed reliable results. Finally the analysis of ICC and mean difference between FTVR vs FTREAL for each variable and group also showed high reliability. This shows that FT evaluation in VR environments is valid as real world alternative as VR evaluation did not distort movement execution and detects alteration in rhythm formation. These results support the use of VR as a promising tool to study alterations and the control of movement in different subject groups in unusual environments such as during fMRI or other imaging studies."
