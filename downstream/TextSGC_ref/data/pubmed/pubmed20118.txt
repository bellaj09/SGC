Exercise programs designed for falls prevention have been proven effective in reducing falls by approximately 21%. Virtual reality may provide a viable alternative intervention for falls prevention. This study compared the effects of virtual reality training using the Balance Rehabilitation Unit BRU versus exercise using a modified Otago Exercise Programme EX on improving balance and physical performance in the short-term restorative care setting of the Gait and Balance Gym Gabagym. Balance training using virtual reality improves balance and physical performance in older adults at high risk of falls.
