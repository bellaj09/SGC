"Virtual Reality Environments for Psychoneurophysiological Assessment and Rehabilitation-is an European Community funded project Telematics for health-HC 1053 http://www.etho.be/ht_projects/vrepar/ whose aim is: to develop a PC based virtual reality system PC-VRS for the medical market that can be marketed at a price which is accessible to its possible end-users hospitals universities and research centres and which would have the modular connectability and interoperability characteristics that the existing systems lack; to develop three hardware/software modules for the application of the PC VRS in psychoneurophysiological assessment and rehabilitation. The chosen development areas are eating disorders bulimia anorexia and obesity movement disorders Parkinsons disease and torsion dystonia and stroke disorders unilateral neglect and hemiparesis. This paper presents the rationale of the different approaches and the methodology used." Virtual reality environments for psycho-neuro-physiological assessment and rehabilitation.
