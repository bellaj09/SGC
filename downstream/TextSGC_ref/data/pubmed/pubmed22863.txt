The goal of our project is to build a system which could utilize the Virtual Reality VR techniques for the pre-operative planning of craniosynostosis. The system includes different modules. We use the tetrahedral volume meshes for the basic structure for the models which surgery is planning on. This paper will describe the procedures of above stages from the processing of 2D image slices 3D modeling smoothing simplification and visibility ordering to volume meshes generation. We have demonstrated the initial results on a variety of stereo devices. The testing results show the processing time is acceptable and the rendering effect is pretty well. A VR planning system for craniosynostosis surgery.
