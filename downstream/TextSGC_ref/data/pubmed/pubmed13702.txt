Advances in big data analytics have created an opportunity for a step change in unraveling mechanisms underlying the development of complex diseases such as asthma providing valuable insights that drive better diagnostic decision-making in clinical practice and opening up paths to individualized treatment plans. However translating findings from data-driven analyses into meaningful insights and actionable solutions requires approaches and tools which move beyond mining and patterning longitudinal data. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in phenotyping of asthma to discuss key hurdles currently hampering the translation of phenotypic variation into mechanistic insights and clinical setting and to suggest potential solutions that may address these limitations and accelerate moving discoveries into practice. In order to advance the field of phenotypic discovery greater focus should be placed on investigating the extent of within-phenotype variation. We advocate a more cautious modeling approach by "supervising" the findings to delineate more precisely the characteristics of the individual trajectories assigned to each phenotype. Furthermore it is important to employ different methods within a study to compare the stability of derived phenotypes and to assess the immutability of individual assignments to phenotypes. If we are to make a step change toward precision stratified or personalized medicine and capitalize on the available big data assets we have to develop genuine cross-disciplinary collaborations wherein data scientists who turn data into information using algorithms and machine learning team up with medical professionals who provide deep insights on specific subjects from a clinical perspective.
