Wide-field interferometric microscopy is a highly sensitive label-free and low-cost biosensing imaging technique capable of visualizing individual biological nanoparticles such as viral pathogens and exosomes. However further resolution enhancement is necessary to increase detection and classification accuracy of subdiffraction-limited nanoparticles. In this study we propose a deep-learning approach based on coupled deep autoencoders to improve resolution of images of L-shaped nanostructures. During training our method utilizes microscope image patches and their corresponding manual truth image patches in order to learn the transformation between them. Following training the designed network reconstructs denoised and resolution-enhanced image patches for unseen input.
