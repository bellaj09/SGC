"Structure based ligand discovery is one of the most successful approaches for augmenting the drug discovery process. Currently there is a notable shift towards machine learning ML methodologies to aid such procedures. Deep learning has recently gained considerable attention as it allows the model to learn to extract features that are relevant for the task at hand." Development and evaluation of a deep learning model for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.
