This paper presents an improved and efficient virtual reality-based adaptive dose assessment method VRBAM applicable to the cutting and dismantling tasks in nuclear facility decommissioning. The method combines the modeling strength of virtual reality with the flexibility of adaptive technology. The initial geometry is designed using three-dimensional computer-aided design tools and a hybrid model composed of cuboids and a point-cloud is generated automatically according to the virtual model of the object. In order to improve the efficiency of dose calculation while retaining accuracy the hybrid model is converted to a weighted point-cloud model and the point kernels are generated by adaptively simplifying the weighted point-cloud model according to the detector position an approach that is suitable for arbitrary geometries. The dose rates are calculated using the point kernel method. To account for radiation scattering effects buildup factors are calculated using the geometric progression formula in the fitting function. The geometric modeling capability of VRBAM was verified by simulating basic geometries which included a convex surface a concave surface a flat surface and their combination. The simulation results show that the VRBAM is more flexible and superior to other approaches in modeling complex geometries. In this paper the computation time and dose rate results obtained from the proposed method were also compared with those obtained using the MCNP code and an earlier virtual reality-based method developed by the same authors.
