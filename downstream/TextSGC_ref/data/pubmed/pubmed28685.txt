Motor Imagery MI electroencephalography EEG is widely studied for its non-invasiveness easy availability portability and high temporal resolution. As for MI EEG signal processing the high dimensions of features represent a research challenge. It is necessary to eliminate redundant features which not only create an additional overhead of managing the space complexity but also might include outliers thereby reducing classification accuracy. The firefly algorithm FA can adaptively select the best subset of features and improve classification accuracy. However the FA is easily entrapped in a local optimum. To solve this problem this paper proposes a method of combining the firefly algorithm and learning automata LA to optimize feature selection for motor imagery EEG. We employed a method of combining common spatial pattern CSP and local characteristic-scale decomposition LCD algorithms to obtain a high dimensional feature set and classified it by using the spectral regression discriminant analysis SRDA classifier. Both the fourth brain-computer interface competition data and real-time data acquired in our designed experiments were used to verify the validation of the proposed method. Compared with genetic and adaptive weight particle swarm optimization algorithms the experimental results show that our proposed method effectively eliminates redundant features and improves the classification accuracy of MI EEG signals. In addition a real-time brain-computer interface system was implemented to verify the feasibility of our proposed methods being applied in practical brain-computer interface systems.
