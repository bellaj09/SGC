This paper proposes a hybrid convolutional network ConvNet-Restricted Boltzmann Machine RBM model for face verification. A key contribution of this work is to learn high-level relational visual features with rich identity similarity information. The deep ConvNets in our model start by extracting local relational visual features from two face images in comparison which are further processed through multiple layers to extract high-level and global relational features. To keep enough discriminative information we use the last hidden layer neuron activations of the ConvNet as features for face verification instead of those of the output layer. To characterize face similarities from different aspects we concatenate the features extracted from different face region pairs by different deep ConvNets. The resulting high-dimensional relational features are classified by an RBM for face verification. After pre-training each ConvNet and the RBM separately the entire hybrid network is jointly optimized to further improve the accuracy. Various aspects of the ConvNet structures relational features and face verification classifiers are investigated. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art face verification performance on the challenging LFW dataset under both the unrestricted protocol and the setting when outside data is allowed to be used for training.
