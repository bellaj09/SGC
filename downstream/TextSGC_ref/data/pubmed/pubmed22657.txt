"Telecommunications multimedia and computer technologies will introduce marked changes in the management of cancer. New modalities in the representation of patients medical records using computer technology products and services allow unlimited cross-sharing of information. Education taught through multimedia methods and through the Internet is available anywhere and any time just like surgical simulation robotics and virtual reality. Thanks to computer and IT technologies surgeons will be able to acquire assess and validate new surgical procedures or concepts from any geographical location. Live demonstrations shared via videoconferencing facilitate mental development through the acquisition of the cognitive aspects of surgical procedures. Virtual reality is a major improvement in the processing of medical imaging. As a result the interpretation and the simulation of therapeutic approaches to patients with cancer are facilitated through transparency navigation and manipulation. The Internet eventually offers uninterrupted communication links between healthcare providers teaching training or multidisciplinary telementoring included. Computer and IT technologies will undoubtedly contribute to standardized cancer treatment modalities and determined guidelines for good clinical practice worldwide."
