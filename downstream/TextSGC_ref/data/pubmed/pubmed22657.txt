"According to the World Health Organization one quarter of the worlds population suffers from various neurological disorders ranging from depression to Alzheimers disease. Thus understanding the operation mechanism of the brain enables us to help those who are suffering from these diseases. In addition recent clinical medicine employs electronic brain implants despite the fact of being invasive to treat disorders ranging from severe coronary conditions to traumatic injuries. As a result the deaf could hear the blind could see and the paralyzed could control robotic arms and legs. Due to the requirement of high data management capability with a power consumption as low as possible designing nanoscale transistors as essential I/O electronics is a complex task. Herein we review the essential design criteria for such nanoscale transistors progress and prospect for implantable brain-machine-interface electronics. This article also discusses their technological challenges for practical implementation." Nano-scale transistors for interfacing with brain: design criteria progress and prospect.
