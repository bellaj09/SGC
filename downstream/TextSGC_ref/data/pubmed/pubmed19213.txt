"In this paper we investigate various machine learning classifiers used in our Virtual Reality VR system for treating acrophobia. The system automatically estimates fear level based on multimodal sensory data and a self-reported emotion assessment. There are two modalities of expressing fear ratings: the 2-choice scale where 0 represents relaxation and 1 stands for fear; and the 4-choice scale with the following correspondence: 0-relaxation 1-low fear 2-medium fear and 3-high fear. A set of features was extracted from the sensory signals using various metrics that quantify brain electroencephalogram-EEG and physiological linear and non-linear dynamics Heart Rate-HR and Galvanic Skin Response-GSR. The novelty consists in the automatic adaptation of exposure scenario according to the subjects affective state. We acquired data from acrophobic subjects who had undergone an in vivo pre-therapy exposure session followed by a Virtual Reality therapy and an in vivo evaluation procedure. Various machine and deep learning classifiers were implemented and tested with and without feature selection in both a user-dependent and user-independent fashion. The results showed a very high cross-validation accuracy on the training set and good test accuracies ranging from 42.5% to 89.5%. The most important features of fear level classification were GSR HR and the values of the EEG in the beta frequency range. For determining the next exposure scenario a dominant role was played by the target fear level a parameter computed by taking into account the patients estimated fear level."
