Objective: The goal of this review was to evaluate the evidence regarding the use of virtual reality VR therapy for improvement of mobility in patients with spinal cord injury SCI. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed CINAHL EMBASE and PsycINFO databases in April 2018. The phrase "virtual reality" and a combination of "spinal cord injury" "tetraplegia" "quadriplegia" or "paraplegia" were used as search terms. References included selected articles were reviewed as well. Articles were filtered based on the following inclusion criteria: 1 written in English 2 peer-reviewed 3 VR used for patients with SCI and 4 changes in motor function evaluated. Main outcome measurements: Common outcomes of mobility assessment used in the studies included the Functional Reach Test FRT Functional Independence Measure FIM Limit of Stability LOS Berg Balance Scale BBS Timed Up and Go TUG test and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II WISCI II scale. Results: Seven of the nine reviewed articles were case series while two were randomized controlled trials. Reviewed literature demonstrated significant benefit in FRT BBS gait speed muscle strength SCIM and WISCI-II using VR therapy. Voluntary muscle control improvement was also observed. However no significant differences were found with regard to finehand motor movement. Conclusion: This literature review demonstrated mostly positive outcomes for the use of VR for SCI rehabilitation but were limited in quality and scope. Larger multicenter trials are still needed.
