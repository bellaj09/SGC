Virtual Reality--meaning the visualization of abstract computer processes--is gaining increasing significance in the everyday routine of the dental laboratory working with CAD/CAM technology. This is indispensable especially when processing the new high-strength materials such as ZrO2. The average maximum chewing forces previously permitted a bridge in the posterior region only when metal ceramics were used. With the aid of modern computer technology it is now possible to use the all-ceramic material of zirconium dioxide for these indications. The technical procedure in the dental laboratory corresponds largely to the production techniques that are known from use with aluminum oxide. VITA VM 9 Vita Zahnfabrik Bad Sckingen Germany is available as veneer material. Its coefficient of thermal expansion is perfectly matched to the ceramic. Virtual Reality by Cerec inLab Framework.
