"Subjective mood is a psychophysiological property that depends on complex interactions among the central and peripheral nervous systems. How network interactions in the brain drive temporal fluctuations in mood is unknown. Here we investigate how functional network configuration relates to mood profiles in a single individual over the course of 1\xa0year. Using data from the MyConnectome Project we construct a comprehensive mapping between resting-state functional connectivity FC patterns and subjective mood scales using an associative multivariate technique partial least squares. We report three principal findings. First FC patterns reliably tracked daily fluctuations in mood. Second positive mood was marked by an integrated architecture with prominent interactions between canonical resting-state networks. Finally one of the top-ranked nodes in mood-related network reconfiguration was the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex an area commonly associated with mood regulation and dysregulation. Altogether these results showcase the utility of highly sampled individual-focused data sets for affective neuroscience." Tracking mood fluctuations with functional network patterns.
