"In the present study we implemented a real-time feedback system based on multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS. Prior studies indicated that NIRS-based neurofeedback can enhance motor imagery related cortical activation. To specify these prior results and to confirm the efficacy of NIRS-based neurofeedback we examined changes in blood oxygenation level collected in eight training sessions. One group got real feedback about their own brain activity N=9 and one group saw a playback of another persons feedback recording N=8. All participants performed motor imagery of a right hand movement. Real neurofeedback induced specific and focused brain activation over left motor areas. This focal brain activation became even more specific over the eight training sessions. In contrast sham feedback led to diffuse brain activation patterns over the whole cortex. These findings can be useful when training patients with focal brain lesions to increase activity of specific brain areas for rehabilitation purpose." Near-infrared spectroscopy based neurofeedback training increases specific motor imagery related cortical activation compared to sham feedback.
