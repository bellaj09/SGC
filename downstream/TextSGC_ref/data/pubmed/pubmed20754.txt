Flying phobia is a problem that affects a significant portion of the population. There are a number of therapeutic approaches but no one is universally accepted as the gold standard. One therapy is hypnosis. A recent addition to the armamentarium is virtual reality exposure VRE therapy. Both therapies are short-term and compare favorably to in vivo desensitization. Heretofore a combination of both approaches has not been reported. This article presents a case of a 50-year phobia to flying that was refractory to traditional methods including pharmacotherapy systematic desensitization and cognitive behavioral therapy but was successfully treated using VRE therapy and hypnosis as the primary modalities. This treatment was supplemented by other approaches. The rationale for this multimodal therapy and possible mechanisms involved are discussed.
