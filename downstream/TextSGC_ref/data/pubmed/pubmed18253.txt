Learning in the medical domain is to a large extent workplace learning and involves mastery of complex skills that require performance up to professional standards in the work environment. Since training in this real-life context is not always possible for reasons of safety costs or didactics alternative ways are needed to achieve clinical excellence. Educational technology and more specifically augmented reality AR has the potential to offer a highly realistic situated learning experience supportive of complex medical learning and transfer. AR is a technology that adds virtual content to the physical real world thereby augmenting the perception of reality. Three examples of dedicated AR learning environments for the medical domain are described. Five types of research questions are identified that may guide empirical research into the effects of these learning environments. Up to now empirical research mainly appears to focus on the development usability and initial implementation of AR for learning. Limited review results reflect the motivational value of AR its potential for training psychomotor skills and the capacity to visualize the invisible possibly leading to enhanced conceptual understanding of complex causality.
