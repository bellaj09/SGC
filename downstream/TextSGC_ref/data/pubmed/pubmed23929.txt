Selective reduction of bone without collateral damage nerves teeth is essential in apicectomy. To test whether skills acquired on a virtual apicectomy simulator VOXEL-MAN system with integrated force-feedback are transferable from virtual to physical reality two groups of trainees were compared. Group 1 received computer-based virtual surgical training before performing an apicectomy in a pig cadaver model. The probability of preserving vital neighboring structures was improved significantly i.e. six-fold after virtual surgical training P<0.001. The average volume of the bony defects created by the trainees of Group 2 mean: 0.47 ml was significantly P<0.001 larger than by the trainees of Group 1 mean: 0.25 ml. Most importantly the ability to objectively self-assess performance was significantly improved after virtual training. Training with a virtual apicectomy simulator appears to be effective and the skills acquired are transferable to physical reality. Learning by doing virtually.
