"Throughout the last decade a whole new generation of powered transtibial prostheses and exoskeletons has been developed. However these technologies are limited by a gait phase detection which controls the wearable device as a function of the activities of the wearer. Consequently gait phase detection is considered to be of great importance as achieving high detection accuracy will produce a more precise stable and safe rehabilitation device. In this paper we propose a novel gait percent detection algorithm that can predict a full gait cycle discretised within a 1% interval. We called this algorithm an exponentially delayed fully connected neural network ED-FNN. A dataset was obtained from seven healthy subjects that performed daily walking activities on the flat ground and a 15-degree slope. The signals were taken from only one inertial measurement unit IMU attached to the lower shank. The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets for every subject and the mean square error MSE error between the model prediction and the real percentage of the gait was computed. An average MSE of 0.00522 was obtained for every subject in both training and validation sets and an average MSE of 0.006 for the training set and 0.0116 for the validation set was obtained when combining all subjects signals together. Although our experiments were conducted in an offline setting due to the forecasting capabilities of the ED-FNN our system provides an opportunity to eliminate detection delays for real-time applications."
