Esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD is the pivotal procedure in the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal lesions. However there are significant variations in EGD performance among endoscopists impairing the discovery rate of gastric cancers and precursor lesions. The aim of this study was to construct a real-time quality improving system WISENSE to monitor blind spots time the procedure and automatically generate photodocumentation during EGD and thus raise the quality of everyday endoscopy. Randomised controlled trial of WISENSE a real-time quality improving system for monitoring blind spots during esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
