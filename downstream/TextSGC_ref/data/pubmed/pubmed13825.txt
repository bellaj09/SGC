Artificial intelligence AI is currently regaining enormous interest due to the success of machine learning ML and in particular deep learning DL. Image analysis and thus radiomics strongly benefits from this research. However effectively and efficiently integrating diverse clinical imaging and molecular profile data is necessary to understand complex diseases and to achieve accurate diagnosis in order to provide the best possible treatment. In addition to the need for sufficient computing resources suitable algorithms models and data infrastructure three important aspects are often neglected: 1 the need for multiple independent sufficiently large and above all high-quality data sets; 2 the need for domain knowledge and ontologies; and 3 the requirement for multiple networks that provide relevant relationships among biological entities. While one will always get results out of high-dimensional data all three aspects are essential to provide robust training and validation of ML models to provide explainable hypotheses and results and to achieve the necessary trust in AI and confidence for clinical applications. Why imaging data alone is not enough: AI-based integration of imaging omics and clinical data.
