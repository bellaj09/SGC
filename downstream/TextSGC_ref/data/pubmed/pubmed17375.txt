Developers of medical simulators and instructors who use them often have questions about the level of fidelity needed in a simulation. In this article we address the nature of fidelity with respect to virtual reality training systems. We argue that high-fidelity simulators do not always lead to better performance and in some instances can interfere with performance. The primary reason for these seemingly counterintuitive findings lies with a fundamental understanding of how humans perceive and process sensory information. Consequently simulation-based training systems should be developed to maximize their effectiveness not their fidelity. High fidelity high performance?
