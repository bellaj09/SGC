Computed tomography CT is critical for various clinical applications e.g. radiation treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction in MRI/PET scanner. However CT exposes radiation during acquisition which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI is much safer and does not involve radiations. Therefore recently researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiation planning. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically we train a fully convolutional network FCN to generate CT given the MR image. To better model the nonlinear mapping from MRI to CT and produce more realistic images we propose to use the adversarial training strategy to train the FCN. Moreover we propose an image-gradient-difference based loss function to alleviate the blurriness of the generated CT. We further apply Auto-Context Model ACM to implement a context-aware generative adversarial network. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT images from MR images and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison.
