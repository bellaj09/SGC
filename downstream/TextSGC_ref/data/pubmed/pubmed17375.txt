"This article reports the impact of the degree of personalization and individualization of users avatars as well as the impact of the degree of immersion on typical psychophysical factors in embodied Virtual Environments. We investigated if and how virtual body ownership including agency presence and emotional response are influenced depending on the specific look of users avatars which varied between 1 a generic hand-modeled version 2 a generic scanned version and 3 an individualized scanned version. The latter two were created using a state-of-the-art photogrammetry method providing a fast 3D-scan and post-process workflow. Users encountered their avatars in a virtual mirror metaphor using two VR setups that provided a varying degree of immersion a a large screen surround projection L-shape part of a CAVE and b a head-mounted display HMD. We found several significant as well as a number of notable effects. First personalized avatars significantly increase body ownership presence and dominance compared to their generic counterparts even if the latter were generated by the same photogrammetry process and hence could be valued as equal in terms of the degree of realism and graphical quality. Second the degree of immersion significantly increases the body ownership agency as well as the feeling of presence. These results substantiate the value of personalized avatars resembling users real-world appearances as well as the value of the deployed scanning process to generate avatars for VR-setups where the effect strength might be substantial e.g. in social Virtual Reality VR or in medical VR-based therapies relying on embodied interfaces. Additionally our results also strengthen the value of fully immersive setups which today are accessible for a variety of applications due to the widely available consumer HMDs."
