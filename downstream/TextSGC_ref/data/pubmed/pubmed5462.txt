Considerable insight has been gained into the comorbid interactive effects of HIV and drug abuse in the brain using experimental models. This review which considers opiates methamphetamine and cocaine emphasizes the importance of host genetics and glial plasticity in driving the pathogenic neuron remodeling underlying neuro-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and drug abuse comorbidity. Clinical findings are less concordant than experimental work and the response of individuals to HIV and to drug abuse can vary tremendously. Host-genetic variability is important in determining viral tropism neuropathogenesis drug responses and addictive behavior. However genetic differences alone cannot account for individual variability in the brain "connectome." Environment and experience are critical determinants in the evolution of synaptic circuitry throughout life. Neurons and glia both exercise control over determinants of synaptic plasticity that are disrupted by HIV and drug abuse. Perivascular macrophages microglia and to a lesser extent astroglia can harbor the infection. Uninfected bystanders especially astroglia propagate and amplify inflammatory signals. Drug abuse by itself derails neuronal and glial function and the outcome of chronic exposure is maladaptive plasticity. The negative consequences of coexposure to HIV and drug abuse are determined by numerous factors including genetics sex age and multidrug exposure. Glia and some neurons are generated throughout life and their progenitors appear to be targets of HIV and opiates/psychostimulants. The chronic nature of HIV and drug abuse appears to result in sustained alterations in the maturation and fate of neural progenitors which may affect the balance of glial populations within multiple brain regions. Interactions of HIV and drugs of abuse: the importance of glia neural progenitors and host genetic factors.
