"The ability to interpret unspoken or imagined speech through electroencephalography EEG is of therapeutic interest for people suffering from speech disorders and `lockedin syndrome. It is also useful for brain-computer interface BCI techniques not involving articulatory actions. Previous work has involved using particular words in one chosen language and training classifiers to distinguish between them. Such studies have reported accuracies of 40-60% and are not ideal for practical implementation. Furthermore in todays multilingual society classifiers trained in one language alone might not always have the desired effect. To address this we present a novel approach to improve accuracy of the current model by combining bilingual interpretation and decision making. We collect data from 5 subjects with Hindi and English as primary and secondary languages respectively and ask them 20 `Yes/`No questions `Haan/`Na in Hindi in each language. We choose sensors present in regions important to both language processing and decision making. Data is preprocessed and Principal Component Analysis PCA is carried out to reduce dimensionality. This is input to Support Vector Machine SVM Random Forest RF AdaBoost AB and Artificial Neural Networks ANN classifiers for prediction. Experimental results reveal best accuracy of 85.20% and 92.18% for decision and language classification respectively using ANN. Overall accuracy of bilingual speech classification is 75.38%."
