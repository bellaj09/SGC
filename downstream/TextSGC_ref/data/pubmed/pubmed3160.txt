"While much is known about immediate brain activity changes induced by the confrontation with emotional stimuli the subsequent temporal unfolding of emotions has yet to be explored. To investigate whether exposure to emotionally aversive pictures affects subsequent resting-state networks differently from exposure to neutral pictures a resting-state fMRI study implementing a two-group repeated-measures design in healthy young adults N\xa0=\xa034 was conducted. We focused on investigating i patterns of amygdala whole-brain and hippocampus connectivity in both a seed-to-voxel and seed-to-seed approach ii whole-brain resting-state networks with an independent component analysis coupled with dual regression and iii the amygdalas fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations all while EEG recording potential fluctuations in vigilance. In spite of the successful emotion induction as demonstrated by stimuli rating and a memory-facilitating effect of negative emotionality none of the resting-state measures was differentially affected by picture valence. In conclusion resting-state networks connectivity as well as the amygdalas low frequency oscillations appear to be unaffected by preceding exposure to widely used emotionally aversive visual stimuli in healthy young adults." Resting-state functional connectivity remains unaffected by preceding exposure to aversive visual stimuli.
