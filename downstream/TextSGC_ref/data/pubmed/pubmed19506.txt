During everyday life the brain is continuously integrating multiple perceptual cues in order to allow us to make decisions and to guide our actions. In this study we have used a simulated virtual reality--VR visual environment to investigate how cues to speed judgments are integrated. There are two sources that could be used to provide signals for velocity constancy: temporal-frequency or distance cues. However evidence from most psychophysical studies favours temporal-frequency cues. Here we report that two depth cues that provide a relative object--object distance--disparity and motion parallax--can provide a significant input to velocity-constancy judgments particularly when combined. This result indicates that the second mechanism can also play a significant role in generating velocity constancy. Furthermore we show that cognitive factors such as familiar size can influence the perception of object speed. The results suggest that both low-level cues to spatiotemporal structure and depth and high-level cues such as object familiarity are integrated by the brain during velocity estimation in real-world viewing.
