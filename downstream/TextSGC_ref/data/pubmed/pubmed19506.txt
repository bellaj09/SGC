Current synteny visualization tools either focus on small regions of sequence and do not illustrate genome-wide trends or are complicated to use and create visualizations that are difficult to interpret. To address this challenge The Comparative Genomics Platform CoGe has developed two web-based tools to visualize synteny across whole genomes. SynMap2 and SynMap3D allow researchers to explore whole genome synteny patterns across two or three genomes respectively in responsive web-based visualization and virtual reality environments. Both tools have access to the extensive CoGe genome database containing over 30 000 genomes as well as the option for users to upload their own data. By leveraging modern web technologies there is no installation required making the tools widely accessible and easy to use. SynMap2 and SynMap3D: web-based whole-genome synteny browsers.
