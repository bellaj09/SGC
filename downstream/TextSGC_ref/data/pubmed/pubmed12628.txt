Traditional manual scoring of the entire sleep for diagnosis of sleep disorders is highly time-consuming and dependent to experts experience. Thus automatic methods based on electrooculography EOG analysis have been increasingly attracted attentions to lower the cost of scoring. Such computeraided diagnosis of sleep disorders are usually based on the 6 scores wake W sleep status S1-S4 and REM by labelling every 30-second long EOG records. This paper presents an automatic scoring method of sleep stages by using the recent advancements in deep learning. We also suggest an interactive scoring scheme to enable the doctors of practitioners to give feedback by correcting errors and improve the accuracy of scoring as well as diagnosis of sleep disorders.
