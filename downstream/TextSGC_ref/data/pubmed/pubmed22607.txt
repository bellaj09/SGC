"The aim of this study was to compare a reconfigurable mobile electroencephalography EEG system M-EMOTIV based on the Emotiv Epoc which has the ability to record up to 14 electrode sites in the 10/20 International System and a commercial clinical-grade EEG system Neuronic MEDICID-05 and then validate the rationale and accuracy of recordings obtained with the prototype proposed. In this approach an Emotiv Epoc was modified to enable it to record in the parieto-central area. All subjects 15 healthy individuals performed a visual oddball task while connected to both devices to obtain electrophysiological data and behavioral responses for comparative analysis. A Pearsons correlation analysis revealed a good between-devices correlation with respect to electrophysiological measures. The present study not only corroborates previous reports on the ability of the Emotiv Epoc to suitably record EEG data but presents an alternative device that allows the study of a wide range of psychophysiological experiments with simultaneous behavioral and mobile EEG recordings." A step forward in the quest for a mobile EEG-designed epoch for psychophysiological studies.
