To improve the risk stratification of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 an experimental chest X-ray CXR scoring system for quantifying lung abnormalities was introduced in our Diagnostic Imaging Department. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate correlations between the CXR score and the age or sex of Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Radiographic severity index in COVID-19 pneumonia: relationship to age and sex in 783 Italian patients.
