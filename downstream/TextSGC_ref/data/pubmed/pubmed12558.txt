The constitutive androstane receptor CAR plays pivotal roles in drug-induced liver injury through the transcriptional regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Thus identifying regulatory factors for CAR activation is important for understanding its mechanisms. Numerous studies conducted previously on CAR activation and its toxicity focused on in vivo or in vitro analyses which are expensive time consuming and require many animals. We developed a computational model that predicts agonists for the CAR using the Toxicology in the 21st Century 10k library. Additionally we evaluate the prediction performance of novel deep learning DL-based quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis called the DeepSnap-DL approach which is a procedure of generating an omnidirectional snapshot portraying three-dimensional 3D structures of chemical compounds. The CAR prediction model which applies a 3D structure generator tool called CORINA-generated and -optimized chemical structures in the DeepSnap-DL demonstrated better performance than the existing methods using molecular descriptors. These results indicate that high performance in the prediction model using the DeepSnap-DL approach may be important to prepare suitable 3D chemical structures as input data and to enable the identification of modulators of the CAR.
