"While being very promising for a wide range of applications mental-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces MI-BCIs remain barely used outside laboratories notably due to the difficulties users encounter when attempting to control them. Indeed 10-30% of users are unable to control MI-BCIs so-called BCI illiteracy while only a small proportion reach acceptable control abilities. This huge interuser variability has led the community to investigate potential predictors of performance related to users personality and cognitive profile. Based on a literature review we propose a classification of these MI-BCI performance predictors into three categories representing high-level cognitive concepts: 1 users relationship with the technology including the notions of computer anxiety and sense of agency 2 attention and 3 spatial abilities. We detail these concepts and their neural correlates in order to better understand their relationship with MI-BCI user-training. Consequently we propose by way of future prospects some guidelines to improve MI-BCI user-training."
