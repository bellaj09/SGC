"Background and Purpose- Hematoma volume measurements influence prognosis and treatment decisions in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ICH. The aims of this study are to derive and validate a fully automated segmentation algorithm for ICH volumetric analysis using deep learning methods. Methods- In-patient computed tomography scans of 300 consecutive adults age 18 years with spontaneous supratentorial ICH who were enrolled in the ICHOP Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project; 2009-2018 were separated into training n=260 and test n=40 datasets. A fully automated segmentation algorithm was derived using convolutional neural networks and it was trained on manual segmentations from the training dataset. The algorithms performance was assessed against manual and semiautomated segmentation methods in the test dataset. Results- The mean volumetric Dice similarity coefficients for the fully automated segmentation algorithm when tested against manual and semiautomated segmentation methods were 0.8940.264 and 0.9050.254 respectively. ICH volumes derived from fully automated versus manual R2=0.981; P<0.0001 fully automated versus semiautomated R2=0.978; P<0.0001 and semiautomated versus manual R2=0.990; P<0001 segmentation methods had strong between-group correlations. The fully automated segmentation algorithm mean 12.02.7 s/scan was significantly faster than both of the manual mean 201.592.2 s/scan; P<0.001 and semiautomated mean 288.58160.3 s/scan; P<0.001 segmentation methods. Conclusions- The fully automated segmentation algorithm quantified hematoma volumes from computed tomography scans of supratentorial ICH patients with similar accuracy and substantially greater efficiency compared with manual and semiautomated segmentation methods. External validation of the fully automated segmentation algorithm is warranted." Fully Automated Segmentation Algorithm for Hematoma Volumetric Analysis in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
