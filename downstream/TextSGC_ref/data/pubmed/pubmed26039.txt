Brain-computer interfaces BCIs translate deliberate intentions and associated changes in brain activity into action thereby offering patients with severe paralysis an alternative means of communication with and control over their environment. Such systems are not available yet partly due to the high performance standard that is required. A major challenge in the development of implantable BCIs is to identify cortical regions and related functions that an individual can reliably and consciously manipulate. Research predominantly focuses on the sensorimotor cortex which can be activated by imagining motor actions. However because this region may not provide an optimal solution to all patients other neuronal networks need to be examined. Therefore we investigated whether the cognitive control network can be used for BCI purposes. We also determined the feasibility of using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI for noninvasive localization of the cognitive control network.
