It has been suggested that monogenic frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD due to Granulin GRN mutations might present a specific pattern of atrophy as compared with FTLD GRN-negative disease. Recent literature has suggested that the study of functional neural networks rather than regional structural damage might better elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms showing complex relationships among structural alterations observed with conventional neuroimaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate effective brain connectivity in FTLD patients carrying GRN mutations GRN+ compared with FTLD patients without pathogenetic GRN mutations GRN- and healthy controls HCs. The neuroimaging signature of frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with Granulin mutations: an effective connectivity study.
