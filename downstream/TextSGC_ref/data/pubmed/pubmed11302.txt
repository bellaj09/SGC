Here a deep learning DL algorithm based on deep neural networks is proposed and employed to predict the chiroptical response of two-dimensional 2D chiral metamaterials. Specifically these 2D metamaterials contain nine types of left-handed nanostructure arrays including U-like T-like and I-like shapes. Both the traditional rigorous coupled wave analysis RCWA method and DL approach are utilized to study the circular dichroism CD in higher-order diffraction beams. One common feature of these chiral metamaterials is that they all exhibit the weakest intensity but the strongest CD response in the third-order diffracted beams. Our work suggests that the DL model can predict CD performance of a 2D chiral nanostructure with a computational speed that is four orders of magnitude faster than RCWA but preserves high accuracy. The DL model\xa0introduced in this work shows great potentials in exploring various chiroptical interactions in metamaterials and accelerating the design of hypersensitive photonic devices.
