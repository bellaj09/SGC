Virtual driving performance was examined and compared to on-road cognitive visual-perceptual and driving video test results. The DriVR appeared to be a useful adjunctive screening tool for assessing driving performance. However as with any new assessment tool will need to undergo further empirical validation. The use of virtual reality in the assessment of driving performance in persons with brain injury.
