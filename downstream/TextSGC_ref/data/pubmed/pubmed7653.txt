Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related death in the world. The identification and characteristics of malignant cells are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of primary or metastatic cancers. Deep learning is a new field of artificial intelligence which can be used for computer aided diagnosis and scientific research of lung cancer pathology by analyzing and learning through establishment and simulation of human brain. In this review we will introduce the application progress and problems of deep learning in pathology of lung cancer and make prospects for its future development. Deep Learning Model as a New Trend in Computer-aided Diagnosis of Tumor Pathology for Lung Cancer.
