"Interventional endoscopy e.g. bronchoscopy colonoscopy laparoscopy cystoscopy is a widely performed procedure that involves either diagnosis of suspicious lesions or guidance for minimally invasive surgery in a variety of organs within the body cavity. Endoscopy may also be used to guide the introduction of certain items e.g. stents into the body. Endoscopic navigation systems seek to integrate big data with multimodal information e.g. computed tomography magnetic resonance images endoscopic video sequences ultrasound images external trackers relative to the patients anatomy control the movement of medical endoscopes and surgical tools and guide the surgeons actions during endoscopic interventions. Nevertheless it remains challenging to realize the next generation of context-aware navigated endoscopy. This review presents a broad survey of various aspects of endoscopic navigation particularly with respect to the development of endoscopic navigation techniques. First we investigate big data with multimodal information involved in endoscopic navigation. Next we focus on numerous methodologies used for endoscopic navigation. We then review different endoscopic procedures in clinical applications. Finally we discuss novel techniques and promising directions for the development of endoscopic navigation."
