"Decreases in trainees working hours coupled with evidence of worse outcomes when hip arthroscopies are performed by inexperienced surgeons mandate an additional means of training. Though virtual reality simulation has been adopted by other surgical specialities its slow uptake in arthroscopic training is due to a lack of evidence as to its benefits. These benefits can be demonstrated through learning curves associated with simulator training-with practice reflecting increases in validated performance metrics." The learning curves of a validated virtual reality hip arthroscopy simulator.
