"Age-related impairments during spatial navigation have been widely reported in egocentric and allocentric paradigms. However the effect of age on more specific navigational components such as the ability to drive or update directional information has not received enough attention. In this study we investigated the effect of age on spatial updating of a visual target after a series of whole-body rotations and transitions using a novel landmark-less virtual reality VR environment. Moreover a significant number of previous studies focused on measures susceptible to a general decline in motor skills such as the spent time navigating the distance traversed. The current paper proposes a new compound spatial measure to assess navigational performance examines its reliability and compares its power with those of the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting participants age and cognitive groups assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA scores. Using data from 319 adults 20-83 years our results confirm the reliability the age sensitivity and the cognitive validity of the designed spatial measure as well as its superiority to the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting age and MoCA score. In addition the results show the significant effect of age cognitive status on spatial updating." Introducing a new age-and-cognition-sensitive measurement for assessing spatial orientation using a landmark-less virtual reality navigational task.
