Recently the integration of different electrophysiological signals into an electroencephalogram EEG has become an effective approach to improve the practicality of brain-computer interface BCI systems referred to as hybrid BCIs. In this paper a hybrid BCI was designed by combining an EEG with electrocardiograph EOG signals and tested using a target selection experiment. Gaze direction from the EOG and the event-related desynchronization ERD/ERS induced by motor imagery from the EEG were simultaneously detected as the output of the BCI system. The target selection mechanism was based on the synthesis of the gaze direction and ERD activity. When an ERD activity was detected the target corresponding to the gaze direction was selected; without ERD activity no target was selected even when a subjects gaze was directed at the target. With this mechanism the operation of the BCI system is more flexible and voluntary. The accuracy and completion time of the target selection tasks during the online testing were 89.3% and 2.4 seconds respectively. These results show the feasibility and practicality of this hybrid BCI system which can potentially be used in the rehabilitation of disabled individuals.
