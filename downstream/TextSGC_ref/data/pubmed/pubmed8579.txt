Evidence-based medicine has considerably advanced the treatment of highly prevalent cardiovascular diseases. Its implementation was driven by multicenter interventional trials in treatment and placebo cohorts propelling numerous biomedical innovations toward standard of care. While a\xa0uniform treatment can be effective in such disease cohorts "one size fits all" it neglects the genetic and phenotypic individuality of a\xa0single patient and his or her disease. Accordingly a\xa0recent observation was made that several newer "mega" trials demanding considerable resources for their execution showed statistically significant differences in outcome however with small overall efficacies that render implementation in the clinics unlikely. To overcome this concerning development new methods for individualized treatment of cardiovascular disease are required. Rarer conditions such as distinct cardiomyopathies may deliver the blueprint for a\xa0paradigm shift: deep and precise phenotyping of individual patients by a\xa0multimodal approach and development of targeted treatments for smaller groups "one treatment for many" or even for single patients "one treatment of some".
