"The development of neuroprosthetics has given rise to significant theoretical and practical challenges concerning personal identity. The Extended Mind Theory EMT attempts to provide an answer to these challenges by arguing that the mind and the external world are co-extensive to the point that both can make a seamless unified entity. The EMT also proposes that physical states determine the nature of mental states. Here we propose a non-deterministic and less locationist view of mental states that we will call iEMT. The iEMT articulates firstly that the co-extensivity of the mind and the world does not justify the dissolution of the mind in the objects of the external world with which the mind interacts. Consequently the agents mind is still part of his unique personal identity. Secondly neural implants cannot be regarded as mere replacement parts in the context of a weak concept of personal identity. Thirdly there are no compelling reasons to believe or to fear that neuroprosthetics can alter personal identity at the profound level." Identity and conflicts in the ethics of neural implants.
