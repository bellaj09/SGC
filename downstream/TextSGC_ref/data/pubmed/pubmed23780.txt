We present a study with 10 subjects being exposed to three sessions of simulated heights in a virtual reality VR system. Among the participants we highlight a 66-year-old man blind in his left eye. The participants show significant progress in anxiety avoidance and behavior measurements when confronted with real height circumstances. The results obtained 1 year later at follow-up are statistically significant in the Behavioral Avoidance Test BAT and the Attitudes Toward Heights Questionnaire ATHQ but not the Acrophobia Questionnaire AQ. Virtual reality and acrophobia: one-year follow-up and case study.
