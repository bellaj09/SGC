Embedded systems control and monitor a great deal of our reality. While some "classic" features are intrinsically necessary such as low power consumption rugged operating ranges fast response and low cost these systems have evolved in the last few years to emphasize connectivity functions thus contributing to the Internet of Things paradigm. A myriad of sensing/computing devices are being attached to everyday objects each able to send and receive data and to act as a unique node in the Internet. Apart from the obvious necessity to process at least some data at the edge to increase security and reduce power consumption and latency a major breakthrough will arguably come when such devices are endowed with some level of autonomous "intelligence". Intelligent computing aims to solve problems for which no efficient exact algorithm can exist or for which we cannot conceive an exact algorithm. Central to such intelligence is Computer Vision CV i.e. extracting meaning from images and video. While not everything needs CV visual information is the richest source of information about the real world: people places and things. The possibilities of embedded CV are endless if we consider new applications and technologies such as deep learning drones home robotics intelligent surveillance intelligent toys wearable cameras etc. This paper describes the Eyes of Things EoT platform a versatile computer vision platform tackling those challenges and opportunities.
