Cellular Electron CryoTomography CECT enables 3D visualization of cellular organization at near-native state and in sub-molecular resolution making it a powerful tool for analyzing structures of macromolecular complexes and their spatial organizations inside single cells. However high degree of structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations makes the systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging. It would likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes. Although it is no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms due to advances in data acquisition automation existing computational approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability making them incapable of processing such amount of data. Deep learning-based subdivision approach for large scale macromolecules structure recovery from electron cryo tomograms.
