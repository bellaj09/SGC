Weed infestations reduce turfgrass aesthetics and uniformity. Postemergence POST herbicides are applied uniformly on turfgrass hence areas without weeds are also sprayed. Deep learning particularly the architecture of convolutional neural network CNN is a state-of-art approach to recognition of images and objects. In this paper we report deep learning CNN DL-CNN models that are remarkably accurate at detection of broadleaf weeds in turfgrasses. Detection of broadleaf weeds growing in turfgrass with convolutional neural networks.
