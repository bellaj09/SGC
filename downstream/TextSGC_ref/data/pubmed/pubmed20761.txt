"Recent advances in computer science and electronics have greatly expanded the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles UAV in both defense and civil applications such as moving ground object tracking. Due to the uncertainties of the application environments and objects motion it is difficult to maintain the tracked object always within the sensor coverage area by using a single UAV. Hence it is necessary to deploy a group of UAVs to improve the robustness of the tracking. This paper investigates the problem of tracking ground moving objects with a group of UAVs using gimbaled sensors under flight dynamic and collision-free constraints. The optimal cooperative tracking path planning problem is solved using an evolutionary optimization technique based on the framework of chemical reaction optimization CRO. The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated through a series of comparative simulations. The results show that the cooperative tracking paths determined by the newly developed method allows for longer sensor coverage time under flight dynamic restrictions and safety conditions."
