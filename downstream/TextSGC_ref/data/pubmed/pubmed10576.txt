"DMNG-33-Methyl-2-4-nitrophenoxyethyl-aminocon-5-enine is a new and the potentially most potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor recently obtained from conessine by N-demethylation and nucleophilic substitution reaction. In the present study a step-down passive avoidance test was used to investigate whether DMNG-3 could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine and a high performance liquid chromatographyHPLC method for the determination of DMNG-3 in biological samples was applied to study its pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution. Separation was achieved on C18 column using a mobile phase consisting methanol-water 70:30 v/v at a flow rate of 1.0ml/min. The intra- and inter-day precisions were good and the RSD was all lower than 1.30%. The mean absolute recovery of DMNG-3 in plasma ranged from 88.55 to 96.45 %. Our results showed oral administration of DMNG-3102550 mg/kg/day can significantly improve the latency and number of errors and had a positive effect of improvement of learning and memory in mice in passive avoidance tests. The elimination half-life T1/2 was 14.071.29 15.871.03h and the total clearance CL values were 0.700.11 0.780.13 L/h/kg respectively. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that DMNG-3 has a slowly clearance and large distribution volume in experimental animals and its disposition is linear over the range of doses tested. The liver small intestine stomach and large intestine were the major distribution tissues of DMNG-3 in mice. It was found that DMNG-3 could be detected in brain suggesting that DMNG-3 can cross the blood-brain barrier. The present study shows that DMNG-3 can be possible developed as a new drug for the treatment of Alzheimers disease in the future."
