The ability to reconstruct neuronal networks local microcircuits or the entire connectome is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Recently advancements in sample preparation e.g. sample expansion and Brainbow labeling and optical e.g. confocal and light sheet techniques have enabled the imaging of increasingly large neural systems with high contrast. Tracing neuronal structures from these images proves challenging however necessitating tools that integrate multiple neuronal traces potentially derived by various methods into one combined montaged result.
