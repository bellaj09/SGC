"Motion perception in immersive virtual environments significantly differs from the real world. For example previous work has shown that users tend to underestimate travel distances in virtual environments VEs. As a solution to this problem researchers proposed to scale the mapped virtual camera motion relative to the tracked real-world movement of a user until real and virtual motion are perceived as equal i.e. real-world movements could be mapped with a larger gain to the VE in order to compensate for the underestimation. However introducing discrepancies between real and virtual motion can become a problem in particular due to misalignments of both worlds and distorted space cognition. In this paper we describe a different approach that introduces apparent self-motion illusions by manipulating optic flow fields during movements in VEs. These manipulations can affect self-motion perception in VEs but omit a quantitative discrepancy between real and virtual motions. In particular we consider to which regions of the virtual view these apparent self-motion illusions can be applied i.e. the ground plane or peripheral vision. Therefore we introduce four illusions and show in experiments that optic flow manipulation can significantly affect users self-motion judgments. Furthermore we show that with such manipulations of optic flow fields the underestimation of travel distances can be compensated."
