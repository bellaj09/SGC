The Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern FBCSP algorithm performs autonomous selection of key temporal-spatial discriminative EEG characteristics in motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interfaces MI-BCI. However FBCSP is sensitive to outliers because it involves multiple estimations of covariance matrices from EEG measurements. This paper proposes a Robust FBCSP RFBCSP algorithm whereby the estimates of the covariance matrices are replaced with the robust Minimum Covariance Determinant MCD estimator. The performance of RFBCSP is investigated on a publicly available dataset and compared against FBCSP using 10x10-fold cross-validation accuracies on training data and session-to-session transfer kappa values on independent test data. The results showed that RFBCSP yielded improvements in certain subjects and slight improvement in overall performance across subjects. Analysis on one subject who improved suggested that outliers were excluded from the robust covariance matrices estimation. These results revealed a promising direction of RFBCSP for robust classifications of EEG measurements in MI-BCI.
