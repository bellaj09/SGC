With many thyroid nodules being incidentally detected it is important to identify as many malignant nodules as possible while excluding those that are highly likely to be benign from fine needle aspiration FNA biopsies or surgeries. This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis CAD system for classifying thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. We use deep learning approach to extract features from thyroid ultrasound images. Ultrasound images are pre-processed to calibrate their scale and remove the artifacts. A pre-trained GoogLeNet model is then fine-tuned using the pre-processed image samples which leads to superior feature extraction. The extracted features of the thyroid ultrasound images are sent to a Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into "malignant" and "benign" cases. The experimental results show the proposed fine-tuned GoogLeNet model achieves excellent classification performance attaining 98.29% classification accuracy 99.10% sensitivity and 93.90% specificity for the images in an open access database Pedraza et al. 16 while 96.34% classification accuracy 86% sensitivity and 99% specificity for the images in our local health region database.
