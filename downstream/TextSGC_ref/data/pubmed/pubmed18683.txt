Most studies demonstrated that training on a virtual reality based arthroscopy simulator leads to an improvement of technical skills in orthopaedic surgery. However how long and what kind of training is optimal for young residents is unknown. In this study we tested the efficacy of a standardized competency based training protocol on a validated virtual reality based knee- and shoulder arthroscopy simulator. Efficacy of standardized training on a virtual reality simulator to advance knee and shoulder arthroscopic motor skills.
