"The exponential growth of fMRI big data offers researchers an unprecedented opportunity to explore functional brain networks. However this opportunity has not been fully explored yet due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling such fMRI big data. One major challenge is that computing capabilities still lag behind the growth of large-scale fMRI databases e.g. it takes many days to perform dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole-brain fMRI data for an fMRI database of average size. Therefore how to reduce the data size but without losing important information becomes a more and more pressing issue. To address this problem we propose a signal sampling approach for significant fMRI data reduction before performing structurally-guided dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole brains fMRI data. We compared the proposed structurally guided sampling method with no sampling random sampling and uniform sampling schemes and experiments on the Human Connectome Project HCP task fMRI data demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve more than 15 times speed-up without sacrificing the accuracy in identifying task-evoked functional brain networks."
