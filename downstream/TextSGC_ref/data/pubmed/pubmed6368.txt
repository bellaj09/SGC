We introduce deep learning technique to predict the beam propagation factor M2 of the laser beams emitting from few-mode fiber for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The deep convolutional neural network CNN is trained with paired data of simulated near-field beam patterns and their calculated M2 value aiming at learning a fast and accurate mapping from the former to the latter. The trained deep CNN can then be utilized to evaluate M2 of the fiber beams from single beam patterns. The results of simulated testing samples have shown that our scheme can achieve an averaged prediction error smaller than 2% even when up to 10 eigenmodes are involved in the fiber. The error becomes slightly larger when heavy noises are added into the input beam patterns but still smaller than 2.5% which further proves the accuracy and robustness of our method. Furthermore the M2 estimation takes only about 5 ms for a prepared beam pattern with one forward pass which can be adopted for real-time M2 determination with only one supporting Charge-Coupled Device CCD. The experimental results further prove the feasibility of our scheme. Moreover the method we proposed can be confidently extended to other kinds of beams provided that adequate training samples are accessible. Deep learning paves the way to superfast and accurate M2 evaluation with very low experimental efforts. Deep learning enabled superfast and accurate M2 evaluation for fiber beams.
