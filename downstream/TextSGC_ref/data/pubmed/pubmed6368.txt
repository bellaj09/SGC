"This study investigated the functional brain connectome architecture in patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy PCA. Eighteen PCA patients and 29 age- and sex- matched healthy controls were consecutively recruited in a specialized referral center. Participants underwent neurologic examination cerebrospinal fluid CSF examination for Alzheimers disease AD biomarkers cognitive assessment and brain MRI. For a smaller subset of participants FDG-PET examination was available. We assessed\xa0topological brain network properties and regional functional connectivity as well as intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity using graph analysis and connectomics. Supplementary analyses were performed to explore the association between the CSF AD profile and the connectome status and taking into account hypometabolic atrophic and spared regions nodes. PCA patients showed diffuse functional connectome alterations at both global and regional level as well as a connectivity breakdown between the posterior brain nodes. They had a\xa0widespread loss of both intra- and inter-hemispheric connections exceeding the structural damage and including the frontal connections. In PCA connectome alterations were identified in all the brain nodes irrespectively of their structural and metabolic classification\xa0and were associated\xa0with a connectivity breakdown between damaged and spared areas.\xa0Taken together\xa0these findings suggest the potentially high sensitivity of graph-analysis and connectomic in capturing the progression and maybe early signs of neurodegeneration in PCA patients."
