This paper proposes a spectral-spatial feature learning SSFL method to obtain robust features of hyperspectral images HSIs. It combines the spectral feature learning and spatial feature learning in a hierarchical fashion. Stacking a set of SSFL units a deep hierarchical model called the spectral-spatial networks SSN is further proposed for HSI classification. SSN can exploit both discriminative spectral and spatial information simultaneously. Specifically SSN learns useful high-level features by alternating between spectral and spatial feature learning operations. Then kernel-based extreme learning machine KELM a shallow neural network is embedded in SSN to classify image pixels. Extensive experiments are performed on two benchmark HSI datasets to verify the effectiveness of SSN. Compared with state-of-the-art methods SSN with a deep hierarchical architecture obtains higher classification accuracy in terms of the overall accuracy average accuracy and kappa    coefficient of agreement especially when the number of the training samples is small.
