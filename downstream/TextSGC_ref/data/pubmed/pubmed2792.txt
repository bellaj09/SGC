"Freezing of gait FOG is a common symptom in advanced Parkinsons disease PD. Despite current advances the neural mechanisms underpinning this disturbance remain poorly understood. To this end we investigated the structural organisation of the white matter connectome in PD freezers and PD\xa0non-freezers. We hypothesized that freezers would show an altered network architecture which could hinder the effective information processing that characterizes the disorder. Twenty-six freezers and twenty-four well-matched non-freezers were included in this study. Using diffusion tensor imaging we investigated the modularity and integration of the regional connectome by calculating the module degree z score and the participation coefficient respectively. Compared to non-freezers freezers demonstrated lower participation coefficients in the right caudate thalamus and hippocampus as well as within superior frontal and parietal cortical regions. Importantly several of these nodes were found within the brains rich club. Furthermore group differences in module degree z scores within cortical frontal and sensory processing areas were found. Together our results suggest that changes in the structural network topology contribute to the manifestation of FOG in PD specifically due to a lack of structural integration between key information processing hubs of the brain."
