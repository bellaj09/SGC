A number of recent studies have demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is a promisingneuroimaging modality for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. So far most NIRS-based BCI studies have focusedon enhancing the accuracy of the classification of different mental tasks. In the present study we evaluated theperformances of a variety of mental task combinations in order to determine the mental task pairs that are bestsuited for customized NIRS-based BCIs. To this end we recorded event-related hemodynamic responses whileseven participants performed eight different mental tasks. Classification accuracies were then estimated for allpossible pairs of the eight mental tasks 8C2 = 28. Based on this analysis mental task combinations with relatively high classification accuracies frequently included the following three mental tasks: mental multiplication mental rotation and right-hand motor imagery. Specifically mental task combinations consisting of two of these three mental tasks showed the highest mean classification accuracies. It is expected that our results will be a useful reference to reduce the time needed for preliminary tests when discovering individual-specific mental task combinations.
