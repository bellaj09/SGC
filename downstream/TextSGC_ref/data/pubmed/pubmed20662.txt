This paper covers work in virtual reality-based patient-specific surgical planning over the past decade. It aims to comprehensively examine the user interface paradigms and system designs during that period of time and to objectively analyze their effectiveness for the task. The goal is to provide useful feedback on these interface and implementation paradigms to aid other researchers in this field. First specialized systems for specific clinical use were produced with a limited set of visualization tools. Later through collaboration with NASA an immersive virtual environment was created to produce high-fidelity images for surgical simulation but it underestimated the importance of collaboration. The next system a networked distributed virtual environment provided immersion and collaboration but the immersive paradigm was found to be of a disadvantage and the uniqueness of the framework unwieldy. A virtual model workbench-style display was then created using a commercial package but limitations of each were soon apparent. Finally a specialized display with an integrated visualization and simulation system is described and evaluated. Lessons learned include: surgical planning is an abstract process unlike surgical simulation; collaboration is important as is stereo visualization; and that high-resolution preoperative images from standard viewpoints are desirable but interaction is truly the key to planning. User interface paradigms for patient-specific surgical planning: lessons learned over a decade of research.
