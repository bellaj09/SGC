"In recent years the study of the intrinsic brain dynamics in a relaxed awake state in the absence of any specific task has gained increasing attention as spontaneous neural activity has been found to be highly structured at a large scale. This so called resting-state activity has been found to be comprised by nonrandom spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations and several Resting-State Networks RSN have been found in BOLD-fMRI as well as in MEG signal power envelope correlations. The underlying anatomical connectivity structure between areas of the brain has been identified as being a key to the observed functional network connectivity but the mechanisms behind this are still underdetermined. Theoretical large-scale brain models for fMRI data have corroborated the importance of the connectome in shaping network dynamics while the importance of delays and noise differ between studies and depend on the models specific dynamics. In the current study we present a spiking neuron network model that is able to produce noisy distributed alpha-oscillations matching the power peak in the spectrum of group resting-state MEG recordings. We studied how well the model captured the inter-node correlation structure of the alpha-band power envelopes for different delays between brain areas and found that the model performs best for propagation delays inside the physiological range 5-10 m/s. Delays also shift the transition from noisy to bursting oscillations to higher global coupling values in the model. Thus in contrast to the asynchronous fMRI state delays are important to consider in the presence of oscillation."
