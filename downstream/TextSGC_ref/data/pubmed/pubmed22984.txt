Virtual and Augmented Reality has experienced a steady growth in medicine in recent years. At the same time the radiological images play a central role in the diagnosis and planification of surgical approaches. The aim of this study is to present the first attempt to enhanced radiological image visualization using virtual and augmented reality for better planification and monitorization of surgeries. This application allows to move beyond traditional two-dimensional images towards three-dimensional models that can be visualized and manipulated with both Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. We propose possible approaches to automate the segmentation of radiological images using computer vision techniques and Artificial Intelligence.
