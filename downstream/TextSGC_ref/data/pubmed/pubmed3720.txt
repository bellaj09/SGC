Establishing dependencies and connectivity among different structures in the human brain is an extremely complex issue. Methods that are often used for connectivity analysis are based on correlation mechanisms. Correlation methods can analyze changes in signal shape or instantaneous power level. Although recent studies imply that observation of results from both groups of methods together can disclose some of the basic functions and behavior of the human brain during mental activity and decision-making there is no technique covering changes in the shape of signals along with changes in their power levels. We present a method using a time evaluation of the correlation along with a comparison of power levels in every available contact pair from intracranial electrodes placed in deep brain structures. Observing shape changes in signals after stimulation together with their power levels provides us with new information about signal character between different structures in the brain during task-related events - visual stimulation with motor response. The results for a subject with 95 intracerebral contacts used in this paper demonstrate a clear methodology capable of spatially analyzing connectivity among deep brain structures. Analysis of evoked deep brain connectivity.
