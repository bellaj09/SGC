Dietary intake and physical activity are key diabetes self-management DSM behaviors that require tailored education and support. Electronic health eHealth technologies have a demonstrated potential for assisting individuals with DSM behaviors. This review provides examples of technologies used to support nutrition and physical activity behaviors in the context of DSM. Technologies covered include those widely used for DSM such as web-based programs and mobile phone and smartphone applications. In addition examples of novel tools such as virtual and augmented reality video games computer vision for dietary carbohydrate monitoring and wearable devices are provided. The challenges to and facilitators for the use of eHealth technologies in DSM are discussed. Strategies to support the implementation of eHealth technologies within practice and suggestions for future research to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a part of broader DSM are provided. eHealth technologies to support nutrition and physical activity behaviors in diabetes self-management.
