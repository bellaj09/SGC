This paper presents a control approach for a myoelectric transhumeral prostheses that supplements a typical two-site electromyograms EMG input with the inertial measurement of arm motion. The inertial measurement is employed to: 1 provide synergistic movement between the prosthetic elbow joint and intact upper arm and 2 to switch control between the myoelectric elbow and hand. In order to assess the prospective efficacy of the control method experiments were conducted on six healthy subjects who performed a series of pick-and-place tasks within a virtual environment. The assessments compared the time required to complete the pick-and-place tasks using the proposed coordinated control approach with the time required using a sequential control approach i.e. the conventional approach used in commercial devices. Subjects on average completed the pick-and-place tasks 34% faster with the coordinated control approach relative to the conventional sequential EMG method with no difference in compensatory torso motion.
