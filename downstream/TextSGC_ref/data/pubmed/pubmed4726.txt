Previous studies of imaging predictors on acute treatment response in late-life depression LLD demonstrated that poor response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs is associated with pre-treatment low functional connectivity FC within executive control network and high FC within default-mode network including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmPFC. However there is less research in regional resting-state functional activity that explains FC changes related to SSRI response. Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity and connectivity predict poor sertraline treatment outcome in late-life depression.
