Closed-loop neural prostheses enable bidirectional communication between the biological and artificial components of a hybrid system. However a major challenge in this field is the limited understanding of how these components the two separate neural networks interact with each other. In this paper we propose an in vitro model of a closed-loop system that allows for easy experimental testing and modification of both biological and artificial network parameters. The interface closes the system loop in real time by stimulating each network based on recorded activity of the other network within preset parameters. As a proof of concept we demonstrate that the bidirectional interface is able to establish and control network properties such as synchrony in a hybrid system of two neural networks more significantly more effectively than the same system without the interface or with unidirectional alternatives. This success holds promise for the application of closed-loop systems in neural prostheses brain-machine interfaces and drug testing.
