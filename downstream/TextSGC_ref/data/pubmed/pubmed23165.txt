"The aim of the study was to describe the technique of an electroencephalographic EEG assessment using the Emotiv EPOC during the performance of a virtual reality motor task and compare theta alpha beta and gamma power frequencies between left and right hemispheres. This is technical note in which 9 healthy young subjects were submitted to an evaluation with Emotiv EPOC during the Nintendo Wii Basic Step virtual game using the Wii Balance Board WBB on a support 13 centimeters high. The Wilcoxon statistical test was applied and pairing between the cerebral hemispheres was performed. Participants had a mean age of 22.55\xa0\xa02.78\xa0years 77.8% were right-handed and 22.8% had no experience with the selected virtual game. According to dominancy right handed n\xa0=\xa07; and left handed n\xa0=\xa02 it was observed that the right-handed individuals showed significantly greater difference in the right hemisphere in the EEG in front region gamma power in channels AF4 p\xa0=\xa00.028 and F4 p\xa0=\xa00.043 and parietal region theta and beta power in P8 channel p\xa0=\xa00.043 while alpha power showed a greater activity in the left hemisphere P7 channel p\xa0=\xa00.043. Considering the inter-hemispheric analysis it was observed that the right hemisphere presented a higher activation potential in the frontal lobe for gamma waves p\xa0=\xa00.038 for AF3-AF4 channels and in the temporal lobe for beta and alpha waves p\xa0=\xa00.021. This study showed that the virtual environment can provide distinct cortical activation patterns considering an inter-hemispheric analysis highlighting greater activation potential in the right hemisphere."
