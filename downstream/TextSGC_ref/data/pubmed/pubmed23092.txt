"This study evaluated the validity of a role-play procedure that uses virtual reality technology to assess womens responses to sexual threat. Forty-eight female undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a standard face-to-face role-play RP or a virtual role-play VRP of a sexually coercive situation. A multimethod assessment strategy was used to evaluate the efficacy of the role-play procedure in creating a realistic and immersive situation. Consistent with our hypotheses women in the VRP condition exhibited greater negative affect and immersion than women in the RP condition. In addition the level of assertive refusal in the VRP but not the RP condition differentiated between women with and without a prior history of sexual victimization. These findings provide evidence of the validity of a virtual role-play procedure for assessing womens responses in sexually threatening situations."
