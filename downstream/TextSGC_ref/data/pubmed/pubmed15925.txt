Angle position sensors APSs usually require initial calibration to improve their accuracy. This article introduces a novel offline self-calibration scheme in which a signal flow network is employed to reduce the amplitude errors direct-current DC offsets and phase shift without requiring extra calibration instruments. In this approach a signal flow network is firstly constructed to overcome the parametric coupling caused by the linearization model and to ensure the independence of the parameters. The model parameters are stored in the nodes of the network and the intermediate variables are input into the optimization pipeline to overcome the local optimization problem. A deep learning algorithm is also used to improve the accuracy and speed of convergence to a global optimal solution. The results of simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a high identification accuracy with a relative parameter identification error less than 0.001. The practical effects were also verified by implementing the developed technique in a capacitive APS and the experimental results demonstrate that the sensor error after signal calibration could be reduced to only 6.98%.
