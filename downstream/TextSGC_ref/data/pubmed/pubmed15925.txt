Over the last few years endoscopic submucosal dissection ESD has shown to be effective in the management of early colorectal neoplasms particularly in Asian countries where the technique was born. In the Western world its implementation has been slow and laborious. In this paper the indications for ESD its learning model the available methods to predict the presence of deep submucosal invasion before the procedure and the published outcomes from Asia and Europe will be reviewed. Since ESD has several limitations in terms of learning achievement in the West and completion of the procedure for the first cases is difficult in our part of the world a short review on colorectal assisted ESD has been included. Finally other endoscopic and surgical treatment modalities that are in competition with colorectal ESD will be summarized.
