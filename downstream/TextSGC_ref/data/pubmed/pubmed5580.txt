"Using FIB-SEM we report the entire synaptic connectome of glomerulus VA1v of the right antennal lobe in Drosophila melanogaster. Within the glomerulus we densely reconstructed all neurons including hitherto elusive local interneurons. The fruitless-positive sexually dimorphic VA1v included >11140 presynaptic sites with ~38050 postsynaptic dendrites. These connected input olfactory receptor neurons ORNs 51 ipsilateral 56 contralateral output projection neurons 18 PNs and local interneurons 56 of >150 previously reported LNs. ORNs are predominantly presynaptic and PNs predominantly postsynaptic; newly reported LN circuits are largely an equal mixture and confer extensive synaptic reciprocity except the newly reported LN2V with input from ORNs and outputs mostly to monoglomerular PNs however. PNs were more numerous than previously reported from genetic screens suggesting that the latter failed to reach saturation. We report a matrix of 192 bodies each having >50 connections; these form 88% of the glomerulus pre/postsynaptic sites."
