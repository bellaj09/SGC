The purposes of this study are to explore functional alterations in salience network SN and its functional coupling with default mode DMN and central executive CEN networks in minimal hepatic encephalopathy MHE. Twenty cirrhotic patients with MHE 23 cirrhotic patients without MHE NHE and 18 controls underwent resting-state fMRI and psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score PHES test. Independent component analysis was performed to obtain DMN including three subsystems: anterior inferior-posterior and superior-posterior DMN a/ip/spDMN SN and CEN including three subsystems: left-ventral right-ventral and dorsal CEN lv/rv/dCEN. The intrinsic functional connectivity iFC within intra-iFC and between inter-iFC and time-lagged inter-iFC networks was measured. MHE patients showed decreased intra-iFC within aDMN SN lvCEN and rvCEN; and decreased inter-iFC and time-lagged inter-iFC between SN and ipDMN/spDMN/lvCEN and increased inter-iFC and time-lagged inter-iFC between SN and aDMN compared with controls. A progressive trend in connectivity alterations was found as the disease developed from NHE to MHE. The inter-iFC between ipDMN/spDMN and SN was significantly correlated with PHES score. In conclusion an aberrant SN and its functional interaction with the DMN/CEN are core features of MHE that are associated with disease progression and may play an important role in neurocognitive dysfunction in MHE.
