"Parkinsons disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that is best managed by a combination of medication and regular physiotherapy. In this context virtual reality VR technology is proposed as a new rehabilitation tool with a possible added value over traditional physiotherapy approaches. It potentially optimises motor learning in a safe environment and by replicating real-life scenarios could help improve functional activities of daily living."
