This paper introduces a novel assessment tool to provide clinicians with quantitative and more objective measures of upper limb coordination in patients suffering from Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay ARSACS. The Virtual Peg Insertion Test VPIT involves manipulating an instrumented handle in order to move nine pegs into nine holes displayed in a virtual environment. The main outcome measures were the number of zero-crossings of the hand acceleration vector as a measure of movement coordination and the total time required to complete the insertion of the nine pegs as a measure of overall upper limb performance. The Virtual Peg Insertion Test as an assessment of upper limb coordination in ARSACS patients: a pilot study.
