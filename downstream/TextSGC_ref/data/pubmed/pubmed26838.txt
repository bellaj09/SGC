"Rapid serial visual presentation RSVP based brain-computer interfaces BCIs can detect target images among a continuous stream of rapidly presented images by classifying a viewers event related potentials ERPs associated with the target and non-targets images. Whilst the majority of RSVP-BCI studies to date have concentrated on the identification of a single type of image namely pictures here we study the capability of RSVP-BCI to detect three different target image types: pictures numbers and words. The impact of presentation duration speed i.e. 100-200ms 5-10Hz 200-300ms 3.3-5Hz or 300-400ms 2.5-3.3Hz is also investigated. 2-way repeated measure ANOVA on accuracies of detecting targets from non-target stimuli ratio 1:9 measured via area under the receiver operator characteristics curve AUC for N=15 subjects revealed a significant effect of factor Stimulus-Type pictures numbers words F 228 = 7.243 p = 0.003  and for Stimulus-Duration F 228 = 5.591 p = 0.011. Furthermore there is an interaction between stimulus type and duration: F 456 = 4.419 p = 0.004 . The results indicate that when designing RSVP-BCI paradigms the content of the images and the rate at which images are presented impact on the accuracy of detection and hence these parameters are key experimental variables in protocol design and applications which apply RSVP for multimodal image datasets."
