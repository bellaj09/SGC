Multi-shell and diffusion spectrum imaging DSI are becoming increasingly popular methods of acquiring diffusion MRI data in a research context. However single-shell acquisitions such as diffusion tensor imaging DTI and high angular resolution diffusion imaging HARDI still remain the most common acquisition schemes in practice. Here we tested whether multi-shell and DSI data have conversion flexibility to be interpolated into corresponding HARDI data. We acquired multi-shell and DSI data on both a phantom and in vivo human tissue and converted them to HARDI. The correlation and difference between their diffusion signals anisotropy values diffusivity measurements fiber orientations connectivity matrices and network measures were examined. Our analysis result showed that the diffusion signals anisotropy diffusivity and connectivity matrix of the HARDI converted from multi-shell and DSI were highly correlated with those of the HARDI acquired on the MR scanner with correlation coefficients around 0.8~0.9. The average angular error between converted and original HARDI was 20.7 at voxels with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 5. The network topology measures had less than 2% difference whereas the average nodal measures had a percentage difference around 4~7%. In general multi-shell and DSI acquisitions can be converted to their corresponding single-shell HARDI with high fidelity. This supports multi-shell and DSI acquisitions over HARDI acquisition as the scheme of choice for diffusion acquisitions.
