This study examined whether the association between age and amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex mPFC connectivity in typically developing 6- to 10-year-old children is correlated with parental care. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 124 children of the Generation R Study who at 4 years old had been observed interacting with their parents to assess maternal and paternal sensitivity. Amygdala functional connectivity was assessed using a general linear model with the amygdalae time series as explanatory variables. Higher level analyses assessing Sensitivity  Age as well as exploratory Sensitivity  Age  Gender interaction effects were performed restricted to voxels in the mPFC. We found significant Sensitivity  Age interaction effects on amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Age was related to stronger amygdala-mPFC connectivity in children with a lower combined parental sensitivity score b = 0.11 p = .004 b = 0.06 p = .06 right and left amygdala respectively but not in children with a higher parental sensitivity score b = -0.07 p = .12 b = -0.06 p = .12 right and left amygdala respectively. A similar effect was found for maternal sensitivity with stronger amygdala-mPFC connectivity in children with less sensitive mothers. Exploratory parental maternal paternal Sensitivity  Age  Gender interaction analyses suggested that this effect was especially pronounced in girls. Amygdala-mPFC resting-state functional connectivity has been shown to increase from age 10.5 years onward implying that the positive association between age and amygdala-mPFC connectivity in 6- to 10-year-old children of less sensitive parents represents accelerated development of the amygdala-mPFC circuit. Insensitive parenting may accelerate the development of the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuit.
