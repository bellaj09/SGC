In the subsets of amyotrohic lateral sclerosis ALS totally-locked in state TLS is shown as the result of marked progression of motor neuron degeneration. In TLS patients are impossible to move any voluntary muscles. As the result patients with TLS cannot communicate with any augmentative and alternative communication devicesAACD at present. To find the AACD that enables for TLS to communicate we examined the clinical character brain MRI SPECT and evoked potentials in TLS. Brain MRI showed marked brain atrophy including the brainstem but the occipital lobe was spared. SPECT and visual evoked potentials VEP showed preserved physiological function of the occipital lobe in TLS. The results suggest that neuronal degeneration in TLS is not restricted to motor system but that the visual pathways are spared. Patients with TLS may be possible to use AACD that utilize the visual pathway. Clinical feature of ALS with communication disturbance; the possibility to communicate in TLS.
