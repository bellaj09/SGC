"With the continuous increase in radiotherapy patient-specific data from multimodality imaging and biotechnology molecular sources knowledge-based response-adapted radiotherapy KBR-ART is emerging as a vital area for radiation oncology personalized treatment. In KBR-ART planned dose distributions can be modified based on observed cues in patients clinical geometric and physiological parameters. In this paper we present current developments in the field of adaptive radiotherapy ART the progression toward KBR-ART and examine several applications of static and dynamic machine learning approaches for realizing the KBR-ART framework potentials in maximizing tumor control and minimizing side effects with respect to individual radiotherapy patients. Specifically three questions required for the realization of KBR-ART are addressed: 1 what knowledge is needed; 2 how to estimate RT outcomes accurately; and 3 how to adapt optimally. Different machine learning algorithms for KBR-ART application shall be discussed and contrasted. Representative examples of different KBR-ART stages are also visited."
