Simulation for perfusion education has been used for at least the past 25 years. The earlier models were either electronic computer games or fluid dynamic models and provided invaluable adjuncts to perfusion training and education. In 2009 the *North Shore-LIJ Health System at Great Neck New York opened an innovative "Bioskill Center" dedicated to simulated virtual reality advanced hands-on surgical training as well as perfusion simulation. Professional cardiac surgical organizations now show great interest in using simulation for training and recertification. Simulation will continue to be the direction for future perfusion training and education. This manuscript introduces a cost-effective system developed from discarded perfusion products and it is not intended to detail the actual lengthy process of its construction. Construction of the real patient simulator system.
