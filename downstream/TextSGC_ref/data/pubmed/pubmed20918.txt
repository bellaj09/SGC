"Telerehabilitation can offer prolonged rehabilitation for patients with stroke after being discharged from the hospital whilst remote diagnostics may reduce the frequency of the outpatient services required. Here we compared a novel telerehabilitation system for virtual reality-supported balance training with balance training with only a standing frame and with conventional therapy in the hospital. The proposed low-cost experimental system for balance training enabling multiple home systems real-time tracking of tasks performance and different views of captured data with balance training consists of a standing frame equipped with a tilt sensor a low-cost computer display and internet connection. Goal-based tasks for balance training in the virtual environment proved motivating for the participating individuals. The physiotherapist located in the remote healthcare center could remotely adjust the level of complexity and difficulty or preview the outcomes and instructions with the application on the mobile smartphone. Patients using the virtual reality-supported balance training showed an improvement in the task performance time of 45% and number of collisions of 68% showing significant improvements in the Berg Balance Scale Timed Up and Go and 10 m Walk Test. The clinical outcomes were not significantly different from balance training with only the standing frame or conventional therapy. The proposed telerehabilitation can facilitate the physiotherapists work and thus enable rehabilitation to a larger number of patients after release from the hospital because it requires less time and infrequent presence of the clinical staff. However a comprehensive clinical evaluation is required to confirm the applicability of the concept." "Telerehabilitation: remote multimedia-supported assistance and mobile monitoring of balance training outcomes can facilitate the clinical staffs effort."
