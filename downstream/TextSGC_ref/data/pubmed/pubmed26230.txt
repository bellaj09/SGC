"Multi-modal integration which combines multiple neurophysiological signals is gaining more attention for its potential to supplement single modalitys drawbacks and yield reliable results by extracting complementary features. In particular integration of electroencephalography EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is cost-effective and portable and therefore is a fascinating approach to brain-computer interface BCI. However outcomes from the integration of these two modalities have yielded only modest improvement in BCI performance because of the lack of approaches to integrate the two different features. In addition mismatch of recording locations may hinder further improvement. In this literature review we surveyed studies of the integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI thoroughly and discussed its current limitations. We also suggested future directions for efficient and successful multi-modal integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI systems."
