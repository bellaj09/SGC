Over 90 years after its first recording scalp electroencephalography EEG remains one of the most widely used techniques in human neuroscience research in particular for the study of event-related potentials ERPs. However because of its low signal-to-noise ratio extracting useful information from these signals continues to be a hard-technical challenge. Many studies focus on simple properties of the ERPs such as peaks latencies and slopes of signal deflections. Extracting information from the shape and spatial distribution of evoked potentials.
