The brain undergoes enormous changes during childhood. Little is known about how the brain develops to serve word processing. The objective of the present study was to investigate the maturational changes of word processing in children and adolescents using magnetoencephalography MEG. Responses to a word processing task were investigated in sixty healthy participants. Each participant was presented with simultaneous visual and auditory word pairs in "match" and "mismatch" conditions. The patterns of neuromagnetic activation from MEG recordings were analyzed at both sensor and source levels. Topography and source imaging revealed that word processing transitioned from bilateral connections to unilateral connections as age increased from 6 to 17\u202fyears old. Correlation analyses of language networks revealed that the path length of word processing networks negatively correlated with age r\u202f=\u202f-0.833 p\u202f<\u202f0.0001 while the connection strength r\u202f=\u202f0.541 p\u202f<\u202f0.01 and the clustering coefficient r\u202f=\u202f0.705 p\u202f<\u202f0.001 of word processing networks were positively correlated with age. In addition males had more visual connections whereas females had more auditory connections. The correlations between gender and path length gender and connection strength and gender and clustering coefficient demonstrated a developmental trend without reaching statistical significance. The results indicate that the developmental trajectory of word processing is gender specific. Since the neuromagnetic signatures of these gender-specific paths to adult word processing were determined using non-invasive objective and quantitative methods the results may play a key role in understanding language impairments in pediatric patients in the future.
