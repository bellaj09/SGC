The influence of weak perturbations up to 300 microT in the natural magnetic field MF induced by the introduction of three constant magnets on the problem task solving in complex maze was studied in two groups of Wistar rats. Under the action of inhomogeneous magnetic field there were no spontaneous change of the orienting for the explorative activity independently of the individual in the presence of the organization of goal-directed behaviour. Instead of the expected explorative activity the stable and deep locomotor depression developed after orienting in a new environment. Such a phenomenon was manifested only against the background of informational loading. Nevertheless under these conditions a short external stimulations resulted in even faster rat learning than in the control animals. It is suggested that the MF characteristics play a crucial role in the transformation of the orienting unconditioned activity into the explorative cognitive activity. The characteristics of exploratory behavior in Wistar rats in a permanent inhomogeneous magnetic field.
