"Objective: A large number of children report fear and distress when undergoing blood work and intravenous placement. In pediatric departments Child Life interventions are considered to be the gold standard in nonmedical pain management techniques. Virtual reality VR has also been identified as an effective tool for pain distraction in children undergoing painful medical procedures. The aim of this study was to document the efficacy of VR as a mode of distraction during a medical procedure compared with two comparison conditions: watching television TV minimal control condition and distraction provided by the Child Life CL gold standard control condition program. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 children aged 8-17 years 35% female were recruited through the emergency department ED of the Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario and randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The key outcome measures were visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity and fear of pain administrated before and right after the procedure. Patient satisfaction was also measured after the intervention. Results: A significant reduction in fear of pain and pain intensity was reported in all three conditions. A larger and statistically significant reduction in fear of pain was observed among children who used VR distraction compared with the CL and TV conditions but this effect was not observed for pain intensity. The childrens satisfaction with the VR procedure was significantly higher than for TV and comparable to CL. Discussion: The advantages of using VR in the ED to manage pain in children are discussed."
