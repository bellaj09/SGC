Limited-angle computed tomography CT image reconstruction is a challenging problem in the field of CT imaging. In some special applications limited by the geometric space and mechanical structure of the imaging system projections can only be collected with a scanning range of less than 90. We call this kind of serious limited-angle problem the ultra-limited-angle problem which is difficult to effectively alleviate by traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms. With the development of deep learning the generative adversarial network GAN performs well in image inpainting tasks and can add effective image information to restore missing parts of an image. In this study given the characteristic of GAN to generate missing information the sinogram-inpainting-GAN SI-GAN is proposed to restore missing sinogram data to suppress the singularity of the truncated sinogram for ultra-limited-angle reconstruction. We propose the U-Net generator and patch-design discriminator in SI-GAN to make the network suitable for standard medical CT images. Furthermore we propose a joint projection domain and image domain loss function in which the weighted image domain loss can be added by the back-projection operation. Then by inputting a paired limited-angle/180 sinogram into the network for training we can obtain the trained model which has extracted the continuity feature of sinogram data. Finally the classic CT reconstruction method is used to reconstruct the images after obtaining the estimated sinograms. The simulation studies and actual data experiments indicate that the proposed method performed well to reduce the serious artifacts caused by ultra-limited-angle scanning.
