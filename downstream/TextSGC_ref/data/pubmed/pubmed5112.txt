Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD has been associated with widespread brain abnormalities in white and grey matter affecting not only local but global functional networks as well. In this study we explored these functional networks using source-reconstructed electroencephalography in ADHD and typically developing TD children. We expected evidence for maturational delay with underlying abnormalities in the default mode network. Neural network topology in ADHD; evidence for maturational delay and default-mode network alterations.
