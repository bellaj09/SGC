Developmental dyscalculia is a heterogeneous disorder with largely dissociable performance profiles. Though our current understanding of the neurofunctional foundations of adult numerical cognition has increased considerably during the past two decades there are still many unanswered questions regarding the developmental pathways of numerical cognition. Most studies on developmental dyscalculia are based upon adult calculation models which may not provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding and investigating developing calculation systems. Furthermore the applicability of neuroscience research to pedagogy has so far been limited. Dyscalculia: neuroscience and education.
