"There is a need to enhance patient and practitioner pain communications. A pain communication plus virtual pain coach intervention was tested in the primary care setting for the effect on communication of osteoarthritis pain information by older adults aged 60 years on practitioners pain management changes and on older adults reduced pain and depressive symptoms 1 month later. A randomized controlled pilot study design was used. Twenty-three older adults with osteoarthritis pain were randomly assigned to the pain communication plus virtual pain coach group or the pain communication-only group. Pain communication consisted of a video of important osteoarthritis pain information. The coach consisted of practicing out loud with a virtual pain coach via laptop computer. Pain and depressive symptoms were measured with respectively the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form and the Beck Depression Inventory II before intervention and 1 month later. Immediately after the intervention older adults had their primary care visits which were audiotaped transcribed and content analyzed for older adults communicated pain information and practitioners pain management changes. Older adults in the pain communication plus virtual pain coach group described significantly more pain source information and were prescribed significantly more\xa0osteoarthritis pain treatments than older adults in the pain communication-only group. A nonsignificant trend in pain intensity and depressive symptoms reduction resulted for older adults in the pain communication plus virtual pain coach group 1 month later. The virtual pain coach presents a possible strategy for increasing pain management discussions between practitioners and older adults with persistent pain."
