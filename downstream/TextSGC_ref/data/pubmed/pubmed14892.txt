A key role of Occupational Therapists OTs is to carry out pre-discharge home visits PHV and propose appropriate adaptations to the home environment in order to enable patients to function independently after hospital discharge. However research shows that more than 50% of specialist equipment installed as part of home adaptations is not used by patients. A key reason for this is that decisions about home adaptations are often made without adequate collaboration and consultation with the patient. Consequently there is an urgent need to seek out new and innovative uses of technology to facilitate patient/practitioner collaboration engagement and shared decision making in the PHV process. Virtual reality interior design applications VRIDAs primarily allow users to simulate the home environment and visualize changes prior to implementing them. Customized VRIDAs which also model specialist occupational therapy equipment could become a valuable tool to facilitate improved patient/practitioner collaboration if developed effectively and integrated into the PHV process.
