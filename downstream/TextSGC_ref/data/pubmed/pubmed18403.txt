"Intraoperative imaging has been advanced substantially over the last decades. It supports localization of the region of interest verification of the preoperatively classified fracture pattern identification of correct insertion point of the implant placement of instruments and fixation material and verification of correct fracture reduction and implant positioning. While conventional fluoroscopic 2D imaging remains the gold standard in intraoperative imaging critical anatomical regions are predestined for intraoperative 3D imaging. Additional options such as perioperative virtual planning simulation and surgical training 3D printing techniques and 3D augmented reality visualization may potentially open new windows to improve surgical results in fracture care. This manuscript presents an update on current and upcoming imaging techniques in orthopaedic and trauma surgery focusing on technical advances for decreasing malreduction malalignment and malposition as well as tips and tricks for daily surgical practice in order to improve clinical outcomes and patients and surgeons safety."
