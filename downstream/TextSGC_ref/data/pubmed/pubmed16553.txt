The important problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping SLAM in dynamic environments is less studied than the counterpart problem in static settings. In this paper we present a solution for the feature-based SLAM problem in dynamic environments. We propose an algorithm that integrates SLAM with multi-target tracking SLAMMTT using a robust feature-tracking algorithm for dynamic environments. A novel implementation of RANdomSAmple Consensus RANSAC method referred to as multilevel-RANSAC ML-RANSAC within the Extended Kalman Filter EKF framework is applied for multi-target tracking MTT. We also apply machine learning to detect features from the input data and to distinguish moving from stationary objects. The data stream from LIDAR and vision sensors are fused in real-time to detect objects and depth information. A practical experiment is designed to verify the performance of the algorithm in a dynamic environment. The unique feature of this algorithm is its ability to maintain tracking of features even when the observations are intermittent whereby many reported algorithms fail in such situations. Experimental validation indicates that the algorithm is able to perform consistent estimates in a fast and robust manner suggesting its feasibility for real-time applications.
