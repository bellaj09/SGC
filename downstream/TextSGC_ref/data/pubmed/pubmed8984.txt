Recently deep learning based cross-view gait recognition becomes popular owing to the strong capacity of convolutional neural networks CNNs. Current deep learning methods often rely on loss functions used widely in the task of face recognition e.g. contrastive loss and triplet loss. These loss functions have the problem of hard negative mining. In this paper a robust effective and gait-related loss function called angle center loss ACL is proposed to learn discriminative gait features. The proposed loss function is robust to different local parts and temporal window sizes. Different from center loss which learns a center for each identity the proposed loss function learns multiple sub-centers for each angle of the same identity. Only the largest distance between the anchor feature and the corresponding crossview sub-centers is penalized which achieves better intra-subject compactness. We also propose to extract discriminative spatialtemporal features by local feature extractors and a temporal attention model. A simplified spatial transformer network is proposed to localize the suitable horizontal parts of the human body. Local gait features for each horizontal part are extracted and then concatenated as the descriptor. We introduce long-short term memory LSTM units as the temporal attention model to learn the attention score for each frame e.g. focusing more on discriminative frames and less on frames with bad quality. The temporal attention model shows better performance than the temporal average pooling or gait energy images GEI. By combing the three aspects we achieve the state-of-the-art results on several cross-view gait recognition benchmarks. Cross-view Gait Recognition by Discriminative Feature Learning.
