Cardiac indices estimation is of great importance during identification and diagnosis of cardiac disease in clinical routine. However estimation of multitype cardiac indices with consistently reliable and high accuracy is still a great challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structures and the complexity of temporal dynamics in cardiac MR sequences. While efforts have been devoted into cardiac volumes estimation through feature engineering followed by a independent regression model these methods suffer from the vulnerable feature representation and incompatible regression model. In this paper we propose a semi-automated method for multitype cardiac indices estimation. After the manual labeling of two landmarks for ROI cropping an integrated deep neural network Indices-Net is designed to jointly learn the representation and regression models. It comprises two tightly-coupled networks such as a deep convolution autoencoder for cardiac image representation and a multiple output convolution neural network for indices regression. Joint learning of the two networks effectively enhances the expressiveness of image representation with respect to cardiac indices and the compatibility between image representation and indices regression thus leading to accurate and reliable estimations for all the cardiac indices. When applied with five-fold cross validation on MR images of 145 subjects Indices-Net achieves consistently low estimation error for LV wall thicknesses 1.44  0.71 mm and areas of cavity and myocardium 204  133 mm2. It outperforms with significant error reductions segmentation method 55.1% and 17.4% and two-phase direct volume-only methods 12.7% and 14.6% for wall thicknesses and areas respectively. These advantages endow the proposed method a great potential in clinical cardiac function assessment. Direct Multitype Cardiac Indices Estimation via Joint Representation and Regression Learning.
