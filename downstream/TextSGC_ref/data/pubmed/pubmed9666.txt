A 71-year-old woman with severe right lower leg pain edema and erythema was presented to the Emergency Department and was found to have an extensive deep vein thrombosis DVT confirmed by ultrasound. She underwent an extensive evaluation due to her prior history of malignancy and new hypercoagulable state but no evidence of recurrent disease was detected. Further investigation revealed pernicious anemia PA confirmed by the presence of a macrocytic anemia MCV=115.8fL/red cell Hgb=9.0g/dL decreased serum B12 levels 56pg/mL with resultant increased methylmalonic acid 5303nmol/L and hyperhomocysteinemia 131mol/L the presumed etiology of the DVT. The patient also suffered from autoimmune thyroid disease AITD and both antithyroglobulin and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were detected. She responded briskly to anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin and treatment of PA with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Our case suggests that a DVT secondary to hyperhomocystenemia may represent the first sign of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome III-B PAS III-B defined as the coexistent autoimmune conditions AITD and PA. It is important to recognize this clinical entity as patients may not only require acute treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation and prolonged anticoagulation as in this patient but may also harbor other autoimmune diseases. Deep vein thrombosis an unreported first manifestation of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type III.
