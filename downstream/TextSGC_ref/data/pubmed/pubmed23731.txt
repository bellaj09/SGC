The evolution to bipedalism forced humans to develop suitable strategies for dynamically controlling their balance ensuring stability and preventing falling. The natural aging process and traumatic events such as lower-limb loss can alter the human ability to control stability significantly increasing the risk of fall and reducing the overall autonomy. Accordingly there is an urgent need from both end-users and society for novel solutions that can counteract the lack of balance thus preventing falls among older and fragile citizens. In this study we show a novel ecological approach relying on a wearable robotic device the Active Pelvis Orthosis APO aimed at facilitating balance recovery after unexpected slippages. Specifically if the APO detects signs of balance loss then it supplies counteracting torques at the hips to assist balance recovery. Experimental tests conducted on eight elderly persons and two transfemoral amputees revealed that stability against falls improved due to the "assisting when needed" behavior of the APO. Interestingly our approach required a very limited personalization for each subject and this makes it promising for real-life applications. Our findings demonstrate the potential of closed-loop controlled wearable robots to assist elderly and disabled subjects and to improve their quality of life. An ecologically-controlled exoskeleton can improve balance recovery after slippage.
