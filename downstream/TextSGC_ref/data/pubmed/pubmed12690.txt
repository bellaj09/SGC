Radiographic assessment with magnetic resonance imaging MRI is widely used to characterize gliomas which represent 80% of all primary malignant brain tumors. Unfortunately glioma biology is marked by heterogeneous angiogenesis cellular proliferation cellular invasion and apoptosis. This translates into varying degrees of enhancement edema and necrosis making reliable imaging assessment challenging. Deep learning a subset of machine learning artificial intelligence has gained traction as a method which has seen effective employment in solving image-based problems including those in medical imaging. This review seeks to summarize current deep learning applications used in the field of glioma detection and outcome prediction and will focus on 1 pre- and post-operative tumor segmentation 2 genetic characterization of tissue and 3 prognostication. We demonstrate that deep learning methods of segmenting characterizing grading and predicting survival in gliomas are promising opportunities that may enhance both research and clinical activities.
