To evaluate the application of virtual reality technology in neurosurgical anatomy we compared the virtual three-dimensional 3D microanatomy of the temporal bridging veins as part of the resection of tumors across the petrosal crest in 25 patients against the actual microanatomy of the temporal bridging veins on 20 cadaveric head sets. Anatomical studies on the temporal bridging veins with Dextroscope and its application in tumor surgery across the middle and posterior fossa.
