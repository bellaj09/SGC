The superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate white matter complex SLF/AC is the largest and most complex white matter tract of the human cerebrum with multiple inter-linked connections encompassing multiple cognitive functions such as language attention memory emotion and visuospatial function. However little is known regarding the overall connectivity of this complex. Recently the Human Connectome Project parcellated the human cortex into 180 distinct regions. Utilizing diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging tractography coupled with the human cortex parcellation data presented earlier in this supplement we aim to describe the macro-connectome of the SLF/AC in relation to the linked parcellations present within the human cortex. The purpose of this study is to present this information in an indexed illustrated and tractographically aided series of figures and tables for anatomic and clinical reference.
