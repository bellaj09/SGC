Steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP is a very popular approach to establishing a communication pathway in brain-computer interfaces BCIs without any training requirements for the user. Brain activity recorded over occipital regions in association with stimuli flickering at distinct frequencies is used to predict the gaze direction. High performance is achieved when the analysis of multichannel signal is guided by the driving signals. This study introduces an efficient way of identifying the attended stimulus without the need to register the driving signals.
