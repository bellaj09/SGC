"Accuracy evaluation in machine learning is based on the split of data into a training set and a test set. This critical step is applied to develop machine learning models including models based on sensor data. For sensor-based problems comparing the accuracy of machine learning models using the train/test split provides only a baseline comparison in ideal situations. Such comparisons wont consider practical production problems that can impact the inference accuracy such as the sensors thermal noise performance with lower inference quantization and tolerance to sensor failure. Therefore this paper proposes a set of practical tests that can be applied when comparing the accuracy of machine learning models for sensor-based problems. First the impact of the sensors thermal noise on the models inference accuracy was simulated. Machine learning algorithms have different levels of error resilience to thermal noise as will be presented. Second the models accuracy using lower inference quantization was compared. Lowering inference quantization leads to lowering the analog-to-digital converter ADC resolution which is cost-effective in embedded designs. Moreover in custom designs analog-to-digital converters ADCs effective number of bits ENOB is usually lower than the ideal number of bits due to various design factors. Therefore it is practical to compare models accuracy using lower inference quantization. Third the models accuracy tolerance to sensor failure was evaluated and compared. For this study University of California Irvine UCI Daily and Sports Activities dataset was used to present these practical tests and their impact on model selection."
