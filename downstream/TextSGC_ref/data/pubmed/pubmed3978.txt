Diffusion-weighted imaging DWI while giving rich information about brain circuitry is often limited by insufficient spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio SNR. This paper describes an algorithm that will increase the resolution of DW images beyond the scan resolution allowing for a closer investigation of fiber structures and more accurate assessment of brain connectivity. The algorithm is capable of generating a dense vector-valued field consisting of diffusion data associated with the full set of diffusion-sensitizing gradients. The fundamental premise is that to best preserve information interpolation should always be performed along fiber streamlines. To achieve this at each spatial location we probe neighboring voxels in various directions to gather diffusion information for data reconstruction. Based on the fiber orientation distribution FOD directions that are more likely to be traversed by fibers will be given greater weights during interpolation and vice versa. This ensures that data reconstruction is only contributed by diffusion data coming from fibers that are aligned with a specific direction. This approach respects local fiber structures and prevents blurring resulting from averaging of data from significantly misaligned fibers. Evaluations suggest that this algorithm yields results with significantly less blocking artifacts greater smoothness in anatomical structures and markedly improved structural visibility.
