The origin of the "resting-state" brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI is still uncertain. Here we provide evidence for the neurovascular origins of the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations ALFF and the local functional connectivity density lFCD by comparing them with task-induced blood-oxygen level dependent BOLD responses which are considered a proxy for neuronal activation. Using fMRI data for 2 different tasks Relational and Social collected by the Human Connectome Project in 426 healthy adults we show that ALFF and lFCD have linear associations with the BOLD response. This association was significantly attenuated by a novel task signal regression TSR procedure indicating that task performance enhances lFCD and ALFF in activated regions. We also show that lFCD predicts BOLD activation patterns as was recently shown for other functional connectivity metrics which corroborates that resting functional connectivity architecture impacts brain activation responses. Thus our findings indicate a common source for BOLD responses ALFF and lFCD which is consistent with the neurovascular origin of local hemodynamic synchrony presumably reflecting coordinated fluctuations in neuronal activity. This study also supports the development of task-evoked functional connectivity density mapping. Association Between Brain Activation and Functional Connectivity.
