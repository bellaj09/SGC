Artificial Neural Networks ANNs including Deep Neural Networks DNNs have become the state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and achieved amazing success in speech recognition visual object recognition and many other domains. There are several hardware platforms for developing accelerated implementation of ANN models. Since Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA architectures are flexible and can provide high performance per watt of power consumption they have drawn a number of applications from scientists. In this paper we propose a FPGA-based granularity-variable neuromorphic processor FBGVNP. The traits of FBGVNP can be summarized as granularity variability scalability integrated computing and addressing ability: first the number of neurons is variable rather than constant in one core; second the multi-core network scale can be extended in various forms; third the neuron addressing and computing processes are executed simultaneously. These make the processor more flexible and better suited for different applications. Moreover a neural network-based controller is mapped to FBGVNP and applied in a multi-input multi-output MIMO real-time temperature-sensing and control system. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the neuromorphic processor. The FBGVNP provides a new scheme for building ANNs which is flexible highly energy-efficient and can be applied in many areas.
