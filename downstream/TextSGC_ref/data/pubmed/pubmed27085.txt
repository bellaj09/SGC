Motor-activity-related mental tasks are widely adopted for brain-computer interfaces BCIs as they are a natural extension of movement intention requiring no training to evoke brain activity. The ideal BCI aims to eliminate neuromuscular movement making motor imagery tasks or imagined actions with no muscle movement good candidates. This study explores cortical activation differences between motor imagery and motor execution for both upper and lower limbs using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. Four simple finger- or toe-tapping tasks left hand right hand left foot and right foot were performed with both motor imagery and motor execution and compared to resting state. Significant activation was found during all four motor imagery tasks indicating that they can be detected via fNIRS. Motor execution produced higher activation levels a faster response and a different spatial distribution compared to motor imagery which should be taken into account when designing an imagery-based BCI. When comparing left versus right upper limb tasks are the most clearly distinguishable particularly during motor execution. Left and right lower limb activation patterns were found to be highly similar during both imagery and execution indicating that higher resolution imaging advanced signal processing or improved subject training may be required to reliably distinguish them.
