Virtual reality VR simulations provide increased feelings of presence and agency that could allow increased skill improvement during VR training. Direct relationships between active agency in VR and skill improvement have previously not been investigated. This study examined the relationship between a presence and agency and b presence and skills improvement via active and passive VR simulations and through measuring real-world golf-putting skill. Participants n = 23 completed baseline putting skill assessment before using an Oculus Rift VR head-mounted display to complete active putting with a virtual golf club and passive watching a game of golf VR simulations. Measures of presence and agency were administered after each simulation followed by a final putting skill assessment. The active simulation induced higher feelings of general presence and agency. However no relationship was identified between presence and either agency or skill improvement. No skill improvement was evident in either the active or passive simulations potentially due to the short training period applied as well as a lack of realism in the VR simulations inhibiting a transfer of skills to a real environment. These findings reinforce previous literature that shows active VR to increase feelings of presence and agency. This study generates a number of fruitful research questions about the relationship between presence and skills training. Virtual skills training: the role of presence and agency.
