Endoscopic sinus surgery ESS is the surgical standard treatment for chronic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. There is a reported complication rate of 5-10% associated with this type of surgery. Simulation has been advocated as a means to improve surgical training and minimize the rates of complication and medical error. This study aimed to show how a virtual reality ESS simulator was developed with particular emphasis on achieving satisfactory photorealism and surgical verisimilitude. Toward photorealism in endoscopic sinus surgery simulation.
