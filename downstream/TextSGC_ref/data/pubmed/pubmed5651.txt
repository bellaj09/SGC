One recent technical innovation in neuroscience is microcircuit analysis using three-dimensional reconstructions of neural elements with a large volume Electron microscopy EM data set. Large-scale data sets are acquired with newly-developed electron microscope systems such as automated tape-collecting ultramicrotomy ATUM with scanning EM SEM serial block-face EM SBEM and focused ion beam-SEM FIB-SEM. Currently projects are also underway to develop computer applications for the registration and segmentation of the serially-captured electron micrographs that are suitable for analyzing large volume EM data sets thoroughly and efficiently. The analysis of large volume data sets can bring innovative research results. These recently available techniques promote our understanding of the functional architecture of the brain.
