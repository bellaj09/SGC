"Our paper discusses two experimental studies suggesting that Visual Hallucinations VH in Parkinsons Disease PD may have separate origins. The first is a prospective 8years study evaluating the appearance of VH visual abnormalities assessed by Visual Evoked Potentials VEPs and REM sleep Behaviour Disorder RBD in 80 PD patients treated with l-Dopa and Dopaminoagonists DA. In chronically treated cognitively unimpaired PD patients VH were statistically related p=0.001 to RBD occurrence and high DA doses. Visual abnormalities were significantly reduced by l-Dopa or DA intake and were statistically unrelated to VH. The second study involved PD patients placed in a Virtual Reality Environment to decontextualize visual input. When motor symptoms worsened and VEP abnormalities developed patients consistently described hallucinatory dysperceptions of the virtual environment. The two studies therefore show that VH can occur in two seemingly distinct conditions one is related to chronic treatment and to a sleep disorder frequently observed in PD the other is probably related to a hypodopaminergic state. Our studies support a recently proposed integrative model of VH and show that the neural circuits purported to explain VH must include the retinal dopaminergic system and the REM sleep regulatory system."
