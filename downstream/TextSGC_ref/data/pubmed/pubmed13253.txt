The identification of medical concepts their attributes and the relations between concepts in a large corpus of Electroencephalography EEG reports is a crucial step in the development of an EEG-specific patient cohort retrieval system. However the recognition of multiple types of medical concepts along with the many attributes characterizing them is challenging and so is the recognition of the possible relations between them especially when desiring to make use of active learning. To address these challenges in this paper we present the Self-Attention Concept Attribute and Relation SACAR identifier which relies on a powerful encoding mechanism based on the recently introduced Transformer neural architecture Dehghani et al. 2018. The SACAR identifier enabled us to consider a recently introduced framework for active learning which uses deep imitation learning for its selection policy. Our experimental results show that SACAR was able to identify medical concepts more precisely and exhibited enhanced recall compared with previous methods. Moreover SACAR achieves superior performance in attribute classification for attribute categories of interest while identifying the relations between concepts with performance competitive with our previous techniques. As a multi-task network SACAR achieves this performance on the three prediction tasks simultaneously with a single complex neural network. The learning curves obtained in the active learning process when using the novel Active Learning Policy Neural Network ALPNN show a significant increase in performance as the active learning progresses. These promising results enable the extraction of clinical knowledge available in a large collection of EEG reports. Active deep learning for the identification of concepts and relations in electroencephalography reports.
