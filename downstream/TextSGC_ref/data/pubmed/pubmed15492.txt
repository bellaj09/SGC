Social and behavioral research needs to get started now if scientists are to direct genomic discoveries to address pressing public health problems. Advancing social and behavioral science will require innovative and rigorous communication methodologies that move researchers beyond reliance on traditional tools and their inherent limitations. One such emerging research tool is immersive virtual environment technology virtual reality a methodology that gives researchers the ability to maintain high experimental control and mundane realism of scenarios; portray and manipulate complex abstract objects and concepts; and implement innovative implicit behavioral measurement. This report suggests the role that immersive virtual environment technology can play in furthering future research in genomics-related education decision making test intentions behavior change and health-care provider behaviors. Practical implementation and challenges are also discussed. Immersive virtual environment technology: a promising tool for future social and behavioral genomics research and practice.
