We previously found that electrical stimulation in the anterior limb of the internal capsule/bed nucleus of the stria terminalis IC/BST alleviates depressive symptoms in severe treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD patients. Here we tested the hypothesis that electrical stimulation in either IC/BST or in the inferior thalamic peduncle ITP effectively reduces depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder TRD. In a double-blind crossover design the effects of electrical stimulation at both targets were compared in TRD patients. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale HAM-D was the primary outcome measure. During the first crossover patients received IC/BST stimulation versus no stimulation in random order 2  1 weeks. During the second crossover 3  2 months patients received IC/BST versus ITP versus no stimulation. Patients and evaluators were blinded for stimulation conditions. All patients n=7 were followed up for at least 3 years 3-8 years after implantation. Six patients completed the first crossover and five patients completed the second. During the first crossover mean s.d. HAM-D scores were 21.5 2.7 for no stimulation and 11.5 8.8 for IC/BST stimulation. During the second crossover HAM-D scores were 15.4 7.5 for no stimulation 7.6 3.8 for IC/BST stimulation and 11.2 7.5 for ITP stimulation. The final sample size was too small to statistically analyze this second crossover. At last follow-up only one patient preferred ITP over IC/BST stimulation. Two patients with a history of suicide attempts before implantation committed suicide during the follow-up phases of this study. Our data indicate that in the long term both ITP and IC/BST stimulation may alleviate depressive symptoms in patients suffering from TRD.
