"Challenge-based learning CBL is a learner-centred experimental learning strategy that aims to prepare students to manage unforeseeable and complex global issues in the 21st century. It cultivates an active and authentic learning environment that requires students creative input collaboration and community involvement. Studies in the past decade have shown that CBL strengthens soft skills essential for future society such as critical thinking and creativity. However its effect on students metacognitive abilities is scarcely mentioned. This study - a quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent groups conducted in a self-financing tertiary institution in Hong Kong - aims to evaluate the effect of CBL on approaches to learning among nursing students. First-year students in the nursing programme who attended a nursing course using CBL were recruited for the intervention group and senior year-one students were included in the control group. Their approach to learning was measured by the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire administered at the beginning and at the end of the semester. Analysis of Covariance ANCOVA was used to compare the mean difference in scores of deep and surface approaches between the groups. A total of 209 participants were recruited with 130 in the intervention group and 79 in the control group. The response rates were 65.3% 130/199 and 78.2% 79/101 for the intervention and control groups respectively. In the intervention group the mean post-test deep approach score was significantly higher than the pre-test score F\xa0=\xa05.2 p\xa0=\xa00.023 even though it had only a small effect. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline post-test mean surface scores F\xa0=\xa02.4 p\xa0=\xa00.125. The results of this study indicate that CBL may facilitate deep learning in nursing students."
