Macroscopic fluorescence lifetime imaging MFLI via compressed sensed CS measurements enables efficient and accurate quantification of molecular interactions in vivo over a large field of view FOV. However the current data-processing workflow is slow complex and performs poorly under photon-starved conditions. In this paper we propose Net-FLICS a novel image reconstruction method based on a convolutional neural network CNN to directly reconstruct the intensity and lifetime images from raw time-resolved CS data. By carefully designing a large simulated dataset Net-FLICS is successfully trained and achieves outstanding reconstruction performance on\xa0both in vitro and in vivo experimental data and even superior results at low photon count levels for lifetime quantification. Net-FLICS: fast quantitative wide-field fluorescence lifetime imaging with compressed sensing - a deep learning approach.
