Clinical named entity recognition CNER which intends to automatically detect clinical entities in electronic health record EHR is a committed step for further clinical text mining. Recently more and more deep learning models are used to Chinese CNER. However these models do not make full use of the information in EHR for these models are either word-based or character-based. In addition neural models tend to be locally unstable and even tiny perturbation may mislead them. In this paper we firstly propose a novel adversarial training based lattice LSTM with a conditional random field layer AT-lattice LSTM-CRF for Chinese CNER. Lattice LSTM is used to capture richer information in EHR. As a powerful regularization method AT can be used to improve the robustness of neural models by adding perturbations to the training data. Then we conduct experiments on the proposed neural model with dataset of CCKS-2017 Task 2. The results show that the proposed model achieves a highly competitive performance with an F1 score of 89.64% compared to other prevalent neural models which can be a reinforced baseline for further research in this field.
