"Limitations of many Brain Machine Interface BMI systems using invasive electrodes include reliance on single neurons and decoding limited to kinematics only. This study investigates whether force-related information is present in the local field potential LFP recorded with deep brain electrodes using data from 14 patients with Parkinsons disease. A classifier based on logistic regression LR is developed to classify various force stages using 10-fold cross validation. Least Absolute and Shrinkage Operator Lasso is then employed in order to identify the features with the most predictivity. The results show that force-related information is present in the LFP and it is possible to distinguish between various force stages using certain frequency-domain delta beta gamma and time-domain mobility features in real-time."
