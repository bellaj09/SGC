Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is an optical imaging method that can be used for a brain-computer interface BCI. In the present study we concurrently measure and discriminate fNIRS signals evoked by three different mental activities that is mental arithmetic MA right-hand motor imagery RI and left-hand motor imagery LI. Ten healthy subjects were asked to perform the MA RI and LI during a 10s task period. Using a continuous-wave NIRS system signals were acquired concurrently from the prefrontal and the primary motor cortices. Multiclass linear discriminant analysis was utilized to classify MA vs. RI vs. LI with an average classification accuracy of 75.6% across the ten subjects for a 2-7s time window during the a 10s task period. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a three-class fNIRS-BCI using three different intentionally-generated cognitive tasks as inputs.
