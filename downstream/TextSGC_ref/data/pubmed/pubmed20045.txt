This study shows preliminary data on the validity of a new virtual reality-based application for cue-exposure treatment of binge eating in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Thirty-eight undergraduate students without eating disorders were exposed to several virtual environments with different foods in four different contexts kitchen dining-room bedroom and bakery/caf. Participants were asked to indicate the level of food craving experienced in each situation. They also completed the Spanish version of the State and Trait Food Cravings Questionnaires. The results suggest that virtual reality is an effective technology for eliciting food craving especially in the case of participants with high reactivity to food cues and those who were hungry or experienced strong desire to eat during the experiment.
