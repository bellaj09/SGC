In this paper we present an alternative approach to perform spike sorting of complex brain signals based on spiking neural networks SNN. The proposed architecture is suitable for hardware implementation by using resistive random access memory RRAM technology for the implementation of synapses whose low latency <1s enables real-time spike sorting. This offers promising advantages to conventional spike sorting techniques for brain-computer interfaces BCI and neural prosthesis applications. Moreover the ultra-low power consumption of the RRAM synapses of the spiking neural network nW range may enable the design of autonomous implantable devices for rehabilitation purposes. We demonstrate an original methodology to use Oxide based RRAM OxRAM as easy to program and low energy <75 pJ synapses. Synaptic weights are modulated through the application of an online learning strategy inspired by biological Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity. Real spiking data have been recorded both intra- and extracellularly from an in-vitro preparation of the Crayfish sensory-motor system and used for validation of the proposed OxRAM based SNN. This artificial SNN is able to identify learn recognize and distinguish between different spike shapes in the input signal with a recognition rate about 90% without any supervision.
