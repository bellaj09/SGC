Although most gamblers set a monetary limit on their play many exceed this limit--an antecedent of problematic gambling. Responsible gambling tools may assist players to gamble within their means. Historically however the impact of such tools has been assessed in isolation. In the current research two responsible gambling tools that target adherence to a monetary limit were assessed among 72 electronic gaming machine EGM players. Participants watched an educational animation explaining how EGMs work or a neutral video and then played an EGM in a virtual reality environment. All participants were asked to set a monetary limit on their play but only half were reminded when that limit was reached. Results showed that both the animation and pop-up limit reminder helped gamblers stay within their preset monetary limit; however an interaction qualified these main effects. Among participants who did not experience the pop-up reminder those who watched the animation stayed within their preset monetary limits more than those who did not watch the animation. For those who were reminded of their limit however there was no difference in limit adherence between those who watched the animation and those who did not watch the animation. From a responsible gambling perspective the current study suggests that there is no additive effect of exposure to both responsible gambling tools. Therefore for minimal disruption in play a pop-up message reminding gamblers of their preset monetary limit might be preferred over the lengthier educational animation. Facilitating responsible gambling: the relative effectiveness of education-based animation and monetary limit setting pop-up messages among electronic gaming machine players.
