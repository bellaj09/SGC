Methods from brain-computer interfacing BCI open a direct access to the mental processes of computer users which offers particular benefits in comparison to standard methods for inferring user-related information. The signals can be recorded unobtrusively in the background which circumvents the time-consuming and distracting need for the users to give explicit feedback to questions concerning the individual interest. The obtained implicit information makes it possible to create dynamic user interest profiles in real-time that can be taken into account by novel types of adaptive personalised software. In the present study the potential of implicit relevance feedback from electroencephalography EEG and eye tracking was explored with a demonstrator application that simulated an image search engine.
