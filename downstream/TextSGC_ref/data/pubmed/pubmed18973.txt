Recent research that tests interactive devices for prolonged therapy practice has revealed new prospects for robotics combined with graphical and other forms of biofeedback. Previous human-robot interactive systems have required different software commands to be implemented for each robot leading to unnecessary developmental overhead time each time a new system becomes available. For example when a haptic/graphic virtual reality environment has been coded for one specific robot to provide haptic feedback that specific robot would not be able to be traded for another robot without recoding the program. However recent efforts in the open source community have proposed a wrapper class approach that can elicit nearly identical responses regardless of the robot used. The result can lead researchers across the globe to perform similar experiments using shared code. Therefore modular "switching out"of one robot for another would not affect development time. In this paper we outline the successful creation and implementation of a wrapper class for one robot into the open-source H3DAPI which integrates the software commands most commonly used by all robots.
