Currently the problem of incorporating priori information into an independent component analysis ICA model is often solved under the framework of constrained ICA which utilizes the priori information as a reference signal to form a constraint condition and then introduce it into classical ICA. However it is difficult to pre-determine a suitable threshold parameter to constrain the closeness between the output signal and the reference signal in the constraint condition. A new method for independent component analysis with priori information based on multi-objective optimization.
