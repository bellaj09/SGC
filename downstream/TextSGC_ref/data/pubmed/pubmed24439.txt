"This paper proposes an evaluation of a novel calibration method for an optically tracked oblique laparoscope. We present the necessary tools to track an oblique scope and a camera model which includes changes to the intrinsic camera parameters thereby extending previously proposed methods. Because oblique scopes offer a wide virtual view on the surgical field the method is of great interest for augmented reality guidance of laparoscopic interventions using an oblique scope. The model and an approximated version are evaluated in an extensive validation study. Using 5 sets of 40 calibration images we compare both camera models i.e. model and approximation and 2 interpolation schemes. The selected model and interpolation scheme reaches an average accuracy of 2.60 pixel and an equivalent 3D error of 0.60 mm. Finally we present initial experience of the presented approach with an oblique scope and optical tracking in a clinical setup. During a laparoscopic rectum resection surgery the setup was used to augment the scene with a model of the pelvis. The method worked properly and the attached probes did not interfere with normal procedure." Evaluation of a novel calibration technique for optically tracked oblique laparoscopes.
