Optical coherence tomography OCT is a high-resolution and noninvasive imaging modality that has become one of the most prevalent techniques for ophthalmic diagnosis. Retinal layer segmentation is very crucial for doctors to diagnose and study retinal diseases. However manual segmentation is often a time-consuming and subjective process. In this work we propose a new method for automatically segmenting retinal OCT images which integrates deep features and hand-designed features to train a structured random forests classifier. The deep convolutional features are learned from deep residual network. With the trained classifier we can get the contour probability graph of each layer; finally the shortest path is employed to achieve the final layer segmentation. The experimental results show that our method achieves good results with the mean layer contour error of 1.215 pixels whereas that of the state of the art was 1.464 pixels and achieves an F1-score of 0.885 which is also better than 0.863 that is obtained by the state of the art method.
