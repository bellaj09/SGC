"Traditional visual brain-computer interfaces BCIs preferred to use large-size stimuli to attract the users attention and elicit distinct electroencephalography EEG features. However the visual stimuli are of no interest to the users as they just serve as the hidden codes behind the characters. Furthermore using stronger visual stimuli could cause visual fatigue and other adverse symptoms to users. Therefore its imperative for visual BCIs to use small and inconspicuous visual stimuli to code characters."
