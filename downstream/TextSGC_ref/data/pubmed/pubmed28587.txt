Brain activities could be measured by devices like EEG MEG MRI etc. in terms of electric or magnetic signal which could provide information from three domains i.e. time frequency and space. Combinatory analysis of these features could definitely help to improve the classification performance on brain activities. NMF nonnegative matrix factorization has been widely applied in pattern extraction tasks e.g. face recognition gene data analysis which could provide physically meaningful explanation of the data. However brain signals also take negative values so only spectral feature has been employed in existing NMF studies for brain computer interface. In addition sparsity is an intrinsic characteristic of electric signals. Motor imagery classification via combinatory decomposition of ERP and ERSP using sparse nonnegative matrix factorization.
