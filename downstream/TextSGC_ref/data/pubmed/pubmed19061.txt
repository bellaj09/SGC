Evolving new technologies in vascular access mandate increased attention to patient safety; an often overlooked yet valuable training tool is simulation. For the end-stage renal disease patient simulation tools are effective for all aspects of creating access for peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Based on aviation principles known as crew resource management we place equal emphasis on team training as individual training to improve interactions between team members and systems cumulating in improved safety. Simulation allows for environmental control and standardized procedures letting the trainee practice and correct mistakes without harm to patients compared with traditional patient-based training. Vascular access simulators range from suture devices to pressurized tunneled conduits for needle cannulation to computer-based interventional simulators. Simulation training includes simulated case learning root cause analysis of adverse outcomes and continual update and refinement of concepts. Implementation of effective human to complex systems interaction in end-stage renal disease patients involves a change in institutional culture. Three concepts discussed in this article are as follows: 1 the need for user-friendly systems and technology to enhance performance 2 the necessity for members to both train and work together as a team and 3 the team assigned to use the system must test and practice it to a proficient level before safely using the system on patients.
