In conclusion in order for virtual reality simulations to move from the R & D laboratory to the teaching classroom on a large scale basis there are four conditions which must be met: faculty involvement student cooperation affordable equipment and administrative support. 1. Faculty must understand the advantages of using VR simulations and be committed to developing the procedures and teaching modules and evaluating their effectiveness. They must understand that the simulations are another teaching tool and not a substitute for the teacher. 2. Students must be guided in the use of VR simulations to develop the level of skill required. Students must be willing to accept new ways of learning and must be able to see their individual learning progress in skill development. 3. Equipment-Must be realistic affordable available and clearly demonstrate advantages over traditional methods of teaching. 4. Administrative Support-Initially the cost of instituting VR simulations may be more than using other traditional teaching tools thus ongoing financial support is very important. I believe that the faculty of the Nursing Department at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh is showing the way in incorporating VR simulations into a traditional undergraduate nursing program and as a result they are changing forever the way we will prepare health professionals for the future. Virtual reality: from the development laboratory to the classroom.
