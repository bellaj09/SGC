Maintenance time is a critical quantitative index in maintainability prediction. An efficient maintenance time measurement methodology plays an important role in early stage of the maintainability design. While traditional way to measure the maintenance time ignores the differences between line production and maintenance action. This paper proposes a corrective MOD method considering several important ergonomics factors to predict the maintenance time. With the help of the DELMIA analysis tools the influence coefficient of several factors are discussed to correct the MOD value and the designers can measure maintenance time by calculating the sum of the corrective MOD time of each maintenance therbligs. Finally a case study is introduced by maintaining the virtual prototype of APU motor starter in DELMIA designer obtains the actual maintenance time by the proposed method and the result verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. A maintenance time prediction method considering ergonomics through virtual reality simulation.
