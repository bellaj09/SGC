"Deep inspiration breath hold DIBH with surface supervising is a common technique for cardiac dose reduction in left breast cancer radiotherapy. Surface supervision accuracy relies on the characteristics of surface region. In this study a convolutional neural network CNN based automatic region-of-interest ROI selection method was proposed to select an optimal surface ROI for DIBH surface monitoring. The curvature entropy and the normal of each vertex on the breast cancer patient surface were calculated and formed as representative maps for ROI selection learning. 900 ROIs were randomly extracted from each patients surface representative map and the corresponding rigid ROI registration errors REs were calculated. The VGG-16 a 16-layer network structure developed by Visual Geometry GroupVGG from University of Oxford pre-trained on a large natural image database ImageNet were fine-tuned using 27 thousand extracted ROIs and the corresponding REs from thirty patients. The RE prediction accuracy of the trained model was validated on additional ten patients. Satisfactory RE predictive accuracies were achieved with the root mean square error RMSE/mean absolute error MAE smaller than 1\u2009mm/0.7\u2009mm in translations and 0.45/0.35 in rotations respectively. The REs of the model selected ROIs on ten testing cases is close to the minimal predicted RE with mean RE differences\u2009\u2009<1\u2009mm and\u2009\u2009<0.5 for translation and rotation respectively. The proposed RE predictive model can be utilized for selecting a quasi-optimal ROI in left breast cancer DIBH radiotherapy DIBH-RT."
