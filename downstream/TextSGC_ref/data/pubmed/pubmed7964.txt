Untargeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is affected by nonlinear batch effects which cover up biological effects result in nonreproducibility and are difficult to be calibrate. In this study we propose a novel deep learning model called Normalization Autoencoder NormAE which is based on nonlinear autoencoders AEs and adversarial learning. An additional classifier and ranker are trained to provide adversarial regularization during the training of the AE model latent representations are extracted by the encoder and then the decoder reconstructs the data without batch effects. The NormAE method was tested on two real metabolomics data sets. After calibration by NormAE the quality control samples QCs for both data sets gathered most closely in a PCA score plot average distances decreased from 56.550 and 52.476 to 7.383 and 14.075 respectively and obtained the highest average correlation coefficients from 0.873 and 0.907 to 0.997 for both. Additionally NormAE significantly improved biomarker discovery median number of differential peaks increased from 322 and 466 to 1140 and 1622 respectively. NormAE was compared with four commonly used batch effect removal methods. The results demonstrated that using NormAE produces the best calibration results.
