"Continuing medical information courses have been criticized for not promoting behavior change among their participants. For behavior change to occur participants often need to consciously reject previous ideas and transform their way of thinking. Transformational learning is a process that cultivates deep emotional responses and can lead to cognitive and behavioral change in learners potentially facilitating rich learning experiences and expediting knowledge translation. We explored participants experiences at a 2-day conference designed to support transformative learning as they encounter new concepts within Information Mastery which challenge their previous frameworks around the topic of medical decision making. Using the lens of transformative learning theory we asked: how does Information Mastery qualitatively promote perspective transformation and hence behavior change?"
