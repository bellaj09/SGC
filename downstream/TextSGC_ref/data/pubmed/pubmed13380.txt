The amino acid sequence of a protein encodes the blueprint of its native structure. To predict the corresponding structural fold from the protein\s sequence is one of most challenging problems in computational biology. In this work we introduce DESTINI deep structural inference for proteins a novel computational approach that combines a deep-learning algorithm for protein residue/residue contact prediction with template-based structural modelling. For the first time the significantly improved predictive ability is demonstrated in the large-scale tertiary structure prediction of over 1200 single-domain proteins. DESTINI successfully predicts the tertiary structure of four times the number of "hard" targets those with poor quality templates that were previously intractable viz a "glass-ceiling" for previous template-based approaches and also improves model quality for "easy" targets those with good quality templates. The significantly better performance by DESTINI is largely due to the incorporation of better contact prediction into template modelling. To understand why deep-learning accomplishes more accurate contact prediction systematic clustering reveals that deep-learning predicts coherent native-like contact patterns compared to co-evolutionary analysis. Taken together this work presents a promising strategy towards solving the protein structure prediction problem. DESTINI: A deep-learning approach to contact-driven protein structure prediction.
