The Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS box trainer is the gold standard for development of laparoscopic technical skills however the scoring metrics require a trained proctor and do not allow for immediate feedback. The Lap Mentor virtual-reality LMVR FLS tasks with automated scoring metrics and haptic feedback may be a suitable alternative. We determined the construct and concurrent validity of LMVR-FLS. Participants with a range of laparoscopic experience performed 3 FLS tasks on both simulators. The LMVR-FLS demonstrated moderate concurrent validity and evidence for construct validity. Further research is required to determine if skill acquisition on these modules is transferable to the operating room. Validation of three virtual reality Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS modules.
