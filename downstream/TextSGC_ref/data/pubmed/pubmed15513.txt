Preparing for Part II of the Diagnostic Medical Physics American Board of Radiology exam requires a different approach than studying for Part I of the exam. As Part II is the first exam that splits apart the different medical physics disciplines it is unsurprising that the best preparation for the exam is clinical experience. A well-rounded clinical physics training program and a review of texts covering the fundamentals of the various imaging modalities should leave examinees confident in their ability to successfully complete Part II. Completion of a CAMPEP accredited residency program is excellent preparation for Part II and individuals sitting for the exam who have not completed a residency would do well to gain as much clinical experience in the different imaging modalities as possible. This presentation will focus on important clinical experiences and topics to focus on and useful resources to review diagnostic medical physics fundamentals in advance of taking Part II.
