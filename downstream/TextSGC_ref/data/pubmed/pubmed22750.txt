"We often estimate or perceive the quality of materials surfaces and objects what the Japanese refer to as shitsukan by means of several of our senses. The majority of the literature on shitsukan perception has though tended to focus on the unimodal visual evaluation of stimulus properties. In part this presumably reflects the widespread hegemony of the visual in the modern era and in part is a result of the growing interest not to mention the impressive advances in digital rendering amongst the computer graphics community. Nevertheless regardless of such an oculocentric bias in so much of the empirical literature it is important to note that several other senses often do contribute to the impression of the material quality of surfaces materials and objects as experienced in the real world rather than just in virtual reality. Understanding the multisensory contributions to the perception of material quality especially when combined with computational and neural data is likely to have implications for a number of fields of basic research as well as being applicable to emerging domains such as for example multisensory augmented retail not to mention multisensory packaging design."
