"motor imagery MI is a mental representation of motor behavior. The MI-based brain computer interfaces BCIs can provide communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI-based BCI mainly depends on the subjects ability to self-modulate electroencephalogram signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However training subjects typically involve abstract motor tasks and are time-consuming."
