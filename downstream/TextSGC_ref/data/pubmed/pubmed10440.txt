"Drug component interactions are most likely to trigger unexpected pharmacological effects with unknown causal mechanisms hence demanding the discovery of patterns to establish suitable and effective regimens. This paper proposes a novel framework that embeds machine learning ML and multidimensional scaling MDS techniques for efficient prediction of patient response to antiretroviral therapy ART. To achieve this experiment databases were created from two independent sources: a publicly available HIV domain datasets of patients with failed treatment - hosted by the Stanford University hereinafter referred to as the Stanford HIV database and locally sourced datasets gathered from 13 prominent healthcare facilities treating HIV patients in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria hereinafter referred to as the Akwa-Ibom HIV database: with 5780 and 3168 individual treatment change episodes TCEs of HIV treatment indicators baseline CD4 count BCD4 followup CD4 count FCD4 baseline viral load BRNA followup viral load FRNA and drug type combination DType observed from 1521 and 1301 unique patient records respectively. A hybridised two-stage classification system consuming the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic IT2FL and Deep Neural Network DNN was employed to model and optimise patients response to ART with appreciable error pruning achieved through MDS. Visualisation of the experiment databases showed remarkable immunological changes in the Akwa-Ibom HIV database as the FCD4 of TCEs clustered far above the BCD4 compared to the Stanford HIV database where over 40% of FCD4 clustered below the BCD4. Similar changes were noticed for the RNA as more FRNA copies clustered below the BRNA for the Akwa-Ibom datasets compared to the Stamford datasets. DNN classification results for both databases showed best performance metrics for the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm when compared with the resilient backpropagation algorithm with improved drug pattern predictions for experiment with MDS. This paper is most likely to evolve an avenue that triggers interesting combinations for optimum patient response while ensuring minimal side effects as further findings revealed the superiority of the proposed approach over existing approaches."
