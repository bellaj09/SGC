Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques namely recurrent neural networks to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities such as genes chemicals phenotypes and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data particularly in domains with limited labeled data.
