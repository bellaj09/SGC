Segmentation of left ventricular myocardium LVM in coronary computed tomography angiography CCTA is important for diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Due to poor image contrast and large variation in intensity and shapes LVM segmentation for CCTA is a challenging task. The purpose of this work is to develop a region-based deep learning method to automatically detect and segment the LVM solely based on CCTA images. Automated left ventricular myocardium segmentation using 3D deeply supervised attention U-net for coronary computed tomography angiography; CT myocardium segmentation.
