Although we have come a long way the rapidly expanding field of virtual reality simulation for arthroscopic surgical skills acquisition is supported by only a limited amount of evidence. That said the good news is that the evidence suggests that simulator experience translates into improved performance in the operating room. If proving this relation is our ultimate goal more work is certainly needed. In this commentary a "Task List" is proposed for surgeons and educators interested in using simulators and better defining their role in resident education.
