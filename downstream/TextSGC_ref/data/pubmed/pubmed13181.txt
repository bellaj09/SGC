Radiomics aims to quantify phenotypic characteristics on medical imaging through the use of automated algorithms. Radiomic artificial intelligence AI technology either based on engineered hard-coded algorithms or deep learning methods can be used to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers. However lack of standardized algorithm definitions and image processing severely hampers reproducibility and comparability of results. To address this issue we developed PyRadiomics a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D Slicer. Here we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and demonstrate its application in characterizing lung lesions. Source code documentation and examples are publicly available at www.radiomics.io With this platform we aim to establish a reference standard for radiomic analyses provide a tested and maintained resource and to grow the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.
