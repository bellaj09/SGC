The demonstration of surgical specimens whether using 35-mm slides or digital images tends to consist of the sequential presentation of images. Current digital technology permits a more flexible and effective way of communication with the opportunity to more easily "navigate" between different aspects of specimens. We demonstrate a "virtual reality" method based on QuickTime VR technology that permits the interactive review of a complete profile of surgical specimens in the horizontal plane. Specimens were placed individually on a circular rotating platform. Thirty-six images of each specimen were captured using a digital camera with rotation of the platform at 10 degrees intervals. The images were transferred to a computer and processed using specialized software VRWorx. Histologic images were separately captured from tissue sections on glass slides using a digital camera mounted on a microscope. The final product is viewed using the QuickTime Viewer software application. A 360 degrees horizontal view of the specimens is achieved with the capacity to actively rotate the specimen and to zoom in for closer review. Additionally the user/presenter can click in predetermined "hot spots" which will open histologic images linked to those spots. This methodology which uses readily available computer technology helps provide a better three-dimensional understanding of surgical specimens and also a better correlation between gross and microscopic features.
