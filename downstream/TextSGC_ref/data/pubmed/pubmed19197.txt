"Extending traditional research methods for studying the effects of odor on behavior this study applied virtual reality VR to create a real-world immersive context that was compared with a traditional sterile non-immersive lab setting. Using precise odor administration with olfactometry participants were exposed to three odors cleaning-related pleasant smell cleaning-unrelated pleasant smell: vanillin and odorless air. Our aim was to tease apart whether participants motivation to clean was driven by cleaning associations and/or odor pleasantness and how context would accentuate these effects. The results indeed showed that in VR only the cleaning-related smell elicited faster and more energetic cleaning behavior on a custom-designed cleaning task and faster and more voluminous olfactory sampling compared with controls vanillin air. These effects were not driven by odor valence given the general absence of significant differences between the pleasant control odor vanillin and odorless air. In sum combining rigorous experimental control with high ecological validity this research shows the context dependency of congruent odors affecting motivated behavior in an immersive context only." From sterile labs to rich VR: Immersive multisensory context critical for odors to induce motivated cleaning behavior.
