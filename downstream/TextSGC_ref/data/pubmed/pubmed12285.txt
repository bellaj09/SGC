Mechanistic studies of the Functional Re-adaptive Exercise Device FRED have shown it automatically recruits Lumbar Multifidus LM and Transversus Abdominis TrA - two deep-spinal muscles that are atrophied and show altered motor control in low back pain LBP. No studies have investigated the time required to familiarise to FRED exercise which is required to inform future FRED based clinical trial protocols. This study therefore determined the effect of time during FRED exercise on biomechanical outcome measures to establish the familiarisation period and assess for loss of technique throughout a ten minute trial. A cohort comparison study of 148 participants 70 experiencing low back pain had lumbopelvic kinematics exercise frequency and movement variability measured during a 10 minute trial. Magnitude-based inference was used to assess for familiarisation using plots of variation over time with familiarised reference ranges. The no pain group took 170\xa0seconds and the back pain group took 150\xa0seconds to familiarise. A familiarisation period of at least 170\xa0seconds 2.8\xa0minutes is recommended. This justifies and provides a familiarisation time for use of the FRED as a motor control intervention. Effect of time on biomechanics during exercise on the functional re-adaptive exercise device.
