This paper investigates the automatic exploration problem under the unknown environment which is the key point of applying the robotic system to some social tasks. The solution to this problem via stacking decision rules is impossible to cover various environments and sensor properties. Learning-based control methods are adaptive for these scenarios. However these methods are damaged by low learning efficiency and awkward transferability from simulation to reality. In this paper we construct a general exploration framework via decomposing the exploration process into the decision planning and mapping modules which increases the modularity of the robotic system. Based on this framework we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based decision algorithm that uses a deep neural network to learning exploration strategy from the partial map. The results show that this proposed algorithm has better learning efficiency and adaptability for unknown environments. In addition we conduct the experiments on the physical robot and the results suggest that the learned policy can be well transferred from simulation to the real robot.
