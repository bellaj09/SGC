Deep Convolutional Neural Networks DCNN has shown excellent performance in a variety of machine learning tasks. This paper presents Deep Convolutional Neural Fields DeepCNF an integration of DCNN with Conditional Random Field CRF for sequence labeling with an imbalanced label distribution. The widely-used training methods such as maximum-likelihood and maximum labelwise accuracy do not work well on imbalanced data. To handle this we present a new training algorithm called maximum-AUC for DeepCNF. That is we train DeepCNF by directly maximizing the empirical Area Under the ROC Curve AUC which is an unbiased measurement for imbalanced data. To fulfill this we formulate AUC in a pairwise ranking framework approximate it by a polynomial function and then apply a gradient-based procedure to optimize it. Our experimental results confirm that maximum-AUC greatly outperforms the other two training methods on 8-state secondary structure prediction and disorder prediction since their label distributions are highly imbalanced and also has similar performance as the other two training methods on solvent accessibility prediction which has three equally-distributed labels. Furthermore our experimental results show that our AUC-trained DeepCNF models greatly outperform existing popular predictors of these three tasks.
