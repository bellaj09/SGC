Coronary artery disease CAD is the most common type of heart disease which is the leading cause of death all over the world. X-ray angiography is currently the gold standard imaging technique for CAD diagnosis. These images usually suffer from low quality and presence of noise. Therefore vessel enhancement and vessel segmentation play important roles in CAD diagnosis. In this paper a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks CNN is proposed for detecting vessel regions in angiography images. Initially an input angiogram is preprocessed to enhance its contrast. Afterward the image is evaluated using patches of pixels and the network determines the vessel and background regions. A set of 1040000 patches is used in order to train the deep CNN. Experimental results on angiography images of a dataset show that our proposed method has a superior performance in extraction of vessel regions.
