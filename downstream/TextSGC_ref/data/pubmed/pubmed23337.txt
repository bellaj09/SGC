"Much is known about how different spatial reference frames continually interact to support spatial navigation but less explored is whether it is more crucial to process object-to-object information or egocentric heading information for effective orientation in a cluttered environment. To address this question we evaluated the possible influence on spatial performance of an interactive aerial view of different scale small vs. large comprising an arrow indicating participants egocentric heading. Results revealed that the presence of a small interactive aerial view including a visualized larger arrow facilitated the retrieval of stored spatial layout. These data are consistent with recent studies revealing the role of retrosplenial cortex in translating between different spatial reference frames and may contribute to elucidate the continuous synchronization between the inter-object direction information in the environment with respect to egocentric current heading."
