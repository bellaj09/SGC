Recently the application of restorative brain-computer interfaces BCIs has received significant interest in many BCI labs. However there are a number of challenges that need to be tackled to achieve efficient performance of such systems. For instance any restorative BCI needs an optimum trade-off between time window length classification accuracy and classifier update rate. In this study we have investigated possible solutions to these problems by using a dataset provided by the University of Graz Austria. We have used a continuous wavelet transform and the Student t-test for feature extraction and a support vector machine SVM for classification. We find that improved results for restorative BCIs for rehabilitation may be achieved by using a 750 milliseconds time window with an average classification accuracy of 67% that updates every 32 milliseconds. Investigation of the trade-off between time window length classifier update rate and classification accuracy for restorative brain-computer interfaces.
