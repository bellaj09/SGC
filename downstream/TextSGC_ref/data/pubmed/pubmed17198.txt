Episodic memory was assessed using Virtual Reality VR. Forty-four 44 subjects visualized a target virtual apartment containing specific objects in each room. Then they visualized a second virtual apartment comprised of specific objects and objects shared by the two apartments. Subjects navigated in the virtual apartments in one of the following two conditions: active and passive. Four main episodic memory components were scored from the VR exposures: 1 learning effect; 2 active forgetting effect; 3 strategies at encoding and at retrieval; and 4 false recognitions FRs. The effect of navigation mode active vs. passive on each memory component was examined. Active subjects had better learning and retrieval recognition hits performances compared to passive subjects. A beneficial effect of active navigation was also observed on the source-based FR rates. Active subjects made fewer source-based FRs compared to passive subjects. These overall results for the effect of active navigation are discussed in terms of the distinction between item-specific and relational processing. The use of virtual reality for episodic memory assessment: effects of active navigation.
