"Variability of neural signaling is an important index of healthy brain functioning as is signal complexity which relates to information processing capacity. Alterations in variability and complexity may underlie certain brain dysfunctions. Here resting-state fMRI was used to examine variability and complexity in children and adolescents with and without autism spectrum disorder ASD. Variability was measured using the mean square successive difference MSSD of the time series and complexity was assessed using sample entropy. A categorical approach was implemented to determine if the brain measures differed between diagnostic groups ASD and controls. A dimensional approach was used to examine the continuum of relationships between each brain measure and behavioral severity age IQ and the global efficiency GE of each participants structural connectome which reflects the structural capacity for information processing. Using the categorical approach no significant group differences were found for neither MSSD nor entropy. The dimensional approach revealed significant positive correlations between each brain measure GE and age. Negative correlations were observed between each brain measure and the severity of ASD behaviors across all participants. These results reveal the nature of variability and complexity of BOLD signals in children and adolescents with and without ASD."
