Our previous study indicated that treatment in multiple contexts MC improved the outcome of exposure treatment by reducing return of fear.

In the present study we conducted a treatment analogue study where we investigated whether an exposure to multiple stimuli MS and a combination of both MS and MC would further improve treatment efficacy in the short and long terms.
