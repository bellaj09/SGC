Turbo-Satori is a neurofeedback and brain-computer interface BCI toolbox for real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. It incorporates multiple pipelines from real-time preprocessing and analysis to neurofeedback and BCI applications. The toolbox is designed with a focus in usability enabling a fast setup and execution of real-time experiments. Turbo-Satori uses an incremental recursive least-squares procedure for real-time general linear model calculation and support vector machine classifiers for advanced BCI applications. It communicates directly with common NIRx fNIRS hardware and was tested extensively ensuring that the calculations can be performed in real time without a significant change in calculation times for all sampling intervals during ongoing experiments of up to 6\xa0h of recording. Enabling immediate access to advanced processing features also allows the use of this toolbox for students and nonexperts in the field of fNIRS data acquisition and processing. Flexible network interfaces allow third party stimulus applications to access the processed data and calculated statistics in real time so that this information can be easily incorporated in neurofeedback or BCI presentations.
