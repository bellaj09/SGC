Immersive virtual reality systems employing head-mounted displays offer great promise for the investigation of perception and action but there are well-documented limitations to most virtual reality systems. In the present article we suggest strategies for studying perception/action interactions that try to depend on both scale-invariant metrics such as power function exponents and careful consideration of the requirements of the interactions under investigation. New data concerning the effect of pincushion distortion on the perception of surface orientation are presented as well as data documenting the perception of dynamic distortions associated with head movements with uncorrected optics. A review of several successful uses of virtual reality to study the interaction of perception and action emphasizes scale-free analysis strategies that can achieve theoretical goals while minimizing assumptions about the accuracy of virtual simulations.
