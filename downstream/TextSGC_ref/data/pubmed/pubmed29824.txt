Interferences from spatially adjacent non-target stimuli are known to evoke event-related potentials ERPs during non-target flashes and therefore lead to false positives. This phenomenon was commonly seen in visual attention-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs using conspicuous stimuli and is known to adversely affect the performance of BCI systems. Although users try to focus on the target stimulus they cannot help but be affected by conspicuous changes of the stimuli such as flashes or presenting images which were adjacent to the target stimulus. Furthermore subjects have reported that conspicuous stimuli made them tired and annoyed. In view of this the aim of this study was to reduce adjacent interference annoyance and fatigue using a new stimulus presentation pattern based upon facial expression changes. Our goal was not to design a new pattern which could evoke larger ERPs than the face pattern but to design a new pattern which could reduce adjacent interference annoyance and fatigue and evoke ERPs as good as those observed during the face pattern. An optimized ERP brain-computer interface based on facial expression changes.
