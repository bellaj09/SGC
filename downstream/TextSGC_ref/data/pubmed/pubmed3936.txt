Communication between cortical and subcortical regions is integral to a wide range of psychological processes and has been implicated in a number of psychiatric conditions. Studies in animals have provided insight into the biochemical and connectivity processes underlying such communication. However to date no experiments that link these factors in humans in vivo have been carried out. To investigate the role of glutamate in individual differences in communication between the cortex--specifically the medial prefrontal cortex mPFC--and subcortical regions in humans a combination of resting-state fMRI DTI and MRS was performed. The subcortical target regions were the nucleus accumbens NAc dorsomedial thalamus DMT and periaqueductal grey PAG. It was found that functional connectivity between the mPFC and each of the NAc and DMT was positively correlated with mPFC glutamate concentrations whilst functional connectivity between the mPFC and PAG was negatively correlated with glutamate concentration. The correlations involving mPFC glutamate and FC between the mPFC and each of the DMT and PAG were mirrored by correlations with structural connectivity providing evidence that the glutamatergic relationship may in part be due to direct connectivity. These results are in agreement with existing results from animal studies and may have relevance for MDD and schizophrenia. Glutamate concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex predicts resting-state cortical-subcortical functional connectivity in humans.
