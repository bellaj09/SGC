Serial sectioning and subsequent high-resolution imaging of biological tissue using electron microscopy EM allow for the segmentation and reconstruction of high-resolution imaged stacks to reveal ultrastructural patterns that could not be resolved using 2D images. Indeed the latter might lead to a misinterpretation of morphologies like in the case of mitochondria; the use of 3D models is therefore more and more common and applied to the formulation of morphology-based functional hypotheses. To date the use of 3D models generated from light or electron image stacks makes qualitative visual assessments as well as quantification more convenient to be performed directly in 3D. As these models are often extremely complex a virtual reality environment is also important to be set up to overcome occlusion and to take full advantage of the 3D structure. Here a step-by-step guide from image segmentation to reconstruction and analysis is described in detail. A Method for 3D Reconstruction and Virtual Reality Analysis of Glial and Neuronal Cells.
