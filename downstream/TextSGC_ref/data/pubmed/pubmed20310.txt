This paper surveys the state of the art in telemedicine applications of virtual environments VEs and related technologies for health care. The possible use of VEs as telemedicine tool has attracted much interest in medicine. Actually this technology is commonly used in remote or augmented surgery and surgical training which are critically dependent upon eye-hand coordination. Recently however different researchers have tried to use VEs in anatomic learning and for the assessment and rehabilitation in neuro-psychology. To date such applications have improved the quality of health care and later they will lead to substantial cost savings. Tools that respond to the needs of present VE systems are being refined or developed. However the possible use of VEs in telemedicine is not linked to the solution of technical problems only. In fact telemedicine is not simply a technology but a complex process whose successful exploitation needs significant attention to ergonomics human factors and organizational changes in the structure of the relevant health service. Virtual reality as telemedicine tool: technology ergonomics and actual applications.
