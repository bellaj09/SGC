We aimed to assess the ability of deep learning DL and support vector machine SVM to detect a nonperfusion area NPA caused by retinal vein occlusion RVO with optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA images. The study included 322 OCTA images normal: 148; NPA owing to RVO: 174 128 branch RVO images and 46 central RVO images. Training to construct the DL model using deep convolutional neural network DNN algorithms was provided using OCTA images. The SVM used a scikit-learn library with a radial basis function kernel. The area under the curve AUC sensitivity and specificity for detecting an NPA were examined. We compared the diagnostic ability sensitivity specificity and average required time between the DNN SVM and seven ophthalmologists. Heat maps were generated. With regard to the DNN the mean AUC sensitivity specificity and average required time for distinguishing RVO OCTA images with an NPA from normal OCTA images were 0.986 93.7% 97.3% and 176.9 s respectively. With regard to SVM the mean AUC sensitivity and specificity were 0.880 79.3% and 81.1% respectively. With regard to the seven ophthalmologists the mean AUC sensitivity specificity and average required time were 0.962 90.8% 89.2% and 700.6 s respectively. The DNN focused on the foveal avascular zone and NPA in heat maps. The performance of the DNN was significantly better than that of SVM in all parameters p < 0.01 all and that of the ophthalmologists in AUC and specificity p < 0.01 all. The combination of DL and OCTA images had high accuracy for the detection of an NPA and it might be useful in clinical practice and retinal screening.
