"Polyadenylation is a critical stage of RNA processing during the formation of mature mRNA and is present in most of the known eukaryote protein-coding transcripts and many long non-coding RNAs. The correct identification of polyA signals PAS not only helps to elucidate the 3-end genomic boundaries of a transcribed DNA region and gene regulatory mechanisms but also gives insight into the multiple transcript isoforms resulting from alternative PAS. Although progress has been made in the in-silico prediction of genomic signals the recognition of PAS in DNA genomic sequences remains a challenge."
