"MEDLINE is the primary bibliographic database maintained by National Library of Medicine NLM. MEDLINE citations are indexed with Medical Subject Headings MeSH which is a controlled vocabulary curated by the NLM experts. This greatly facilitates the applications of biomedical research and knowledge discovery. Currently MeSH indexing is manually performed by human experts. To reduce the time and monetary cost associated with manual annotation many automatic MeSH indexing systems have been proposed to assist manual annotation including DeepMeSH and NLMs official model Medical Text Indexer MTI. However the existing models usually rely on the intermediate results of other models and suffer from efficiency issues. We propose an end-to-end framework MeSHProbeNet formerly named as xgx which utilizes deep learning and self-attentive MeSH probes to index MeSH terms. Each MeSH probe enables the model to extract one specific aspect of biomedical knowledge from an input article thus comprehensive biomedical information can be extracted with different MeSH probes and interpretability can be achieved at word level. MeSH terms are finally recommended with a unified classifier making MeSHProbeNet both time efficient and space efficient." MeSHProbeNet: a self-attentive probe net for MeSH indexing.
