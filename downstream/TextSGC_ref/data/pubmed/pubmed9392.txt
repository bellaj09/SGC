Brain region-of-interesting ROI segmentation is an important prerequisite step for many computer-aid brain disease analyses. However the human brain has the complicated anatomical structure. Meanwhile the brain MR images often suffer from the low intensity contrast around the boundary of ROIs large inter-subject variance and large inner-subject variance. To address these issues many multi-atlas based segmentation methods are proposed for brain ROI segmentation in the last decade. In this paper multi-atlas based methods for brain MR image segmentation were reviewed regarding several registration toolboxes which are widely used in the multi-atlas methods conventional methods for label fusion datasets that have been used for evaluating the multi-atlas methods as well as the applications of multi-atlas based segmentation in clinical researches. We propose that incorporating the anatomical prior into the end-to-end deep learning architectures for brain ROI segmentation is an important direction in the future.
