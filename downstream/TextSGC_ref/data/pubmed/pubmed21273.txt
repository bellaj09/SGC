"The above described clinical series show that after a careful and thorough training program and stepwise introduction of surgical telemanipulation systems application of telemanipulations is safe and shows acceptable results. Still OR times are longer than for conventional procedures and the operation is demanding and expensive. The main shortcoming is that the procedure is only suitable for a highly selected patient population. However despite all the clinical experience gathered in various centers this technique is still evolving and in its beginning. There are some very promising developments that will improve the benefit of telemanipulators. For the first time the separation of the surgeon from the surgical field facilitates training of surgeons on simulators. This might lead to a higher standard of surgical performance. Progress in sensor technology will make tactile-force feedback available and new 3 D-visualization systems are designed to provide a better depth perception and higher resolution of the endoscopic image. Virtual stabilizing systems will enable robotic systems to operate on a virtual arrested heart without the need for CPB or mechanical stabilizers. These and other research topics summarized under the term augmented reality will enhance the natural senses and abilities of the surgeon. More and more automatization will find its way into the OR. Preoperatively collected data about the patients anatomy will be used to create safety margins the robotic system will allow for the surgeons movements and instruments will be able to find their way to the surgical site without remote control. Because a stepwise approach has led to the clinical results that we and others have now achieved it is the basis for further step-by-step development of the application of telemanipulation systems in coronary artery bypass grafting and possibly other endoscopic procedures in cardiac surgery."
