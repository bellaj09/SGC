"The goal of the CLINATEC Brain Computer Interface BCI Project is to improve tetraplegic subjects quality of life by allowing them to interact with their environment through the control of effectors such as an exoskeleton. The BCI platform is based on a wireless 64-channel ElectroCorticoGram ECoG recording implant WIMAGINE designed for long-term clinical application and a BCI software environment associated to a 4-limb exoskeleton EMY Enhancing MobilitY. Innovative ECoG signal decoding algorithms will allow the control of the exoskeleton by the subjects brain activity. Currently the whole BCI platform was tested in real-time in preclinical experiments carried out in nonhuman primates. In these experiments the exoskeleton arm was controlled by means of the decoded neuronal activity."
