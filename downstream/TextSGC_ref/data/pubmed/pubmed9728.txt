While MR-only treatment planning using synthetic CTs synCTs offers potential for streamlining clinical workflow a need exists for an efficient and automated synCT generation in the brain to facilitate near real-time MR-only planning. This work describes a novel method for generating brain synCTs based on generative adversarial networks GANs a deep learning model that trains two competing networks simultaneously and compares it to a deep convolutional neural network CNN. Generating synthetic CTs from magnetic resonance images using generative adversarial networks.
