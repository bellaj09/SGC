As one of the most popular approaches in artificial intelligence deep learning DL has attracted a lot of attention in the medical physics field over the past few years. The goals of this topical review article are twofold. First we will provide an overview of the method to medical physics researchers interested in DL to help them start the endeavor. Second we will give in-depth discussions on the DL technology to make researchers aware of its potential challenges and possible solutions. As such we divide the article into two major parts. The first part introduces general concepts and principles of DL and summarizes major research resources such as computational tools and databases. The second part discusses challenges faced by DL present available methods to mitigate some of these challenges as well as our recommendations. An introduction to deep learning in medical physics: advantages potential and challenges.
