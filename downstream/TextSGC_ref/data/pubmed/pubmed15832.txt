Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy pCLE is a subcellular in vivo imaging technique capable of producing images that enable diagnosis of malign structural modifications in epithelial tissue. Images acquired with pCLE are however often tainted by significant artifacts that impair diagnosis. This is especially detrimental for automated image analysis which is why said images are often excluded from recognition pipelines. Deep learning-based detection of motion artifacts in probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy images.
