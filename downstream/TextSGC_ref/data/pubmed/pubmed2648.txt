There is a growing conviction that the understanding of the brain function can come through a deeper knowledge of the network connectivity between different brain areas. Resting state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging rs-fMRI is becoming one of the most important imaging modality widely used to understand network functionality. However due to the variability at subject scale mapping common networks across individuals is by now a real challenge. In this work we present a novel approach to group-wise community detection i.e. identification of functional coherent sub-graphs across multiple subjects. This approach is based on a joint diagonalization of two or more graph Laplacians aiming at finding a common eigenspace across individuals over which clustering in fewer dimension can then be applied. This allows to identify common sub-networks across different graphs. We applied our method to rs-fMRI dataset of mouse brain finding most important sub-networks recently described in literature.
