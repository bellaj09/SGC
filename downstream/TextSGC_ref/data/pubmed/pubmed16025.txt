Clinical practice guidelines define Clostridium difficile infections CDI as diarrhea 3 unformed stools in 24\xa0h with either a positive C difficile stool test or detection of pseudomembranous colitis. Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic colonization of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins toxin A and B TcdA and TcdB is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy RS is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies enzymes primers or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.
