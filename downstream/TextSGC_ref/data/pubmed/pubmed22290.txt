"Aging injury or ailments can contribute to impaired balance control and increase the risk of falling. Provision of light touch augments the sense of balance and can thus reduce the amount of body sway. In this study a wearable reaction wheel-based system is used to deliver light touch-based balance biofeedback on the subjects back. The system can sense torso tilt and using reaction wheels generates light touch. A group of 7 healthy young individuals performed balance tasks under 12 trial combinations based on two conditions each of standing stance and surface types and three of biofeedback device status. Torso tilt data collected from a waist-mounted smartphone during all the trials were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the system. Provision of biofeedback by the device significantly reduced RMS of mediolateral ML trunk tilt p < 0.05 and ML trunk acceleration p < 0.05. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant interaction between stance and surface on reduction in RMS of ML trunk tilt AP trunk tilt ML trunk acceleration and AP trunk acceleration. The device shows promise for further applications such as virtual reality interaction and gait rehabilitation."
