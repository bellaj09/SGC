We evaluated brain white matter pathways associated with language processing in 37 children with specific language impairment aged 6-12 years and 34 controls matched for age sex and handedness. Arcuate fascicle AF inferior fronto-occipital fascicle IFOF inferior longitudinal fascicle ILF and uncinate fascicle UF were identified using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging DTI. Diffusivity parameters and volume of the tracts were compared between the SLI and control group. Children with SLI showed decreased fractional anisotropy in all investigated tracts increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity component in arcuate fascicle bilaterally left IFOF and left ILF. Further bilaterally increased volume of the ILF in children with SLI was found. We confirmed previous findings indicating deficient connectivity of the arcuate fascicle and as a novel finding demonstrate abnormal development of the ventral language stream in patients with SLI. Structural alterations of the language connectome in children with specific language impairment.
