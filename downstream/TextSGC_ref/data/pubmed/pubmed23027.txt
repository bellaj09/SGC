In forensic investigations crime scene reconstructions are created based on a variety of three-dimensional image modalities. Although the data gathered are three-dimensional their presentation on computer screens and paper is two-dimensional which incurs a loss of information. By applying immersive virtual reality VR techniques we propose a system that allows a crime scene to be viewed as if the investigator were present at the scene. The forensic holodeck: an immersive display for forensic crime scene reconstructions.
