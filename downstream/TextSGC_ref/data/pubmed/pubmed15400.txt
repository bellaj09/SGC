We propose a new deep learning network capable of successfully segmenting intervertebral discs and their complex boundaries from magnetic resonance MR spine images. The existing U-network U-net is known to perform well in various segmentation tasks in medical images; however its performance with respect to details of segmentation such as boundaries is limited by the structural limitations of a max-pooling layer that plays a key role in feature extraction process in the U-net. We designed a modified convolutional and pooling layer scheme and applied a cascaded learning method to overcome these structural limitations of the max-pooling layer of a conventional U-net. The proposed network achieved 3% higher Dice similarity coefficient DSC than conventional U-net for intervertebral disc segmentation 89.44% vs. 86.44% respectively; p < 0.001. For intervertebral disc boundary segmentation the proposed network achieved 10.46% higher DSC than conventional U-net 54.62% vs. 44.16% respectively; p < 0.001.
