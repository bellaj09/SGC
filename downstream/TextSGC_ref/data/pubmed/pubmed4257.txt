The human brain atlases that allow correlating brain anatomy with psychological and cognitive functions are in transition from ex vivo histology-based printed atlases to digital brain maps providing multimodal in vivo information. Many current human brain atlases cover only specific structures lack fine-grained parcellations and fail to provide functionally important connectivity information. Using noninvasive multimodal neuroimaging techniques we designed a connectivity-based parcellation framework that identifies the subdivisions of the entire human brain revealing the in vivo connectivity architecture. The resulting human Brainnetome Atlas with 210 cortical and 36 subcortical subregions provides a fine-grained cross-validated atlas and contains information on both anatomical and functional connections. Additionally we further mapped the delineated structures to mental processes by reference to the BrainMap database. It thus provides an objective and stable starting point from which to explore the complex relationships between structure connectivity and function and eventually improves understanding of how the human brain works. The human Brainnetome Atlas will be made freely available for download at http://atlas.brainnetome.org so that whole brain parcellations connections and functional data will be readily available for researchers to use in their investigations into healthy and pathological states.
