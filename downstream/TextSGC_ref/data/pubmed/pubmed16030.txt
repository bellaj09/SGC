"Simulator sickness of users and intuitiveness of controllers contribute to a users acceptance or rejection of a virtual reality VR experiment. However few studies investigated the effects of different VR locomotive controllers and potential gender effects. Hence we investigated the effects of different motion stimuli combinations and a users range of neck motion via two experiments in a gender balanced group. Thus through separate sessions young adult participants utilized four common VR locomotive controllers TiltChair omni-directional treadmill VRNChair and joystick with a head-mounted display to execute the same VR navigation task as we measured simulator sickness by the simulator sickness questionnaire and postural sway. Also we measured intuitiveness through total traversed distance and execution times. As expected simulator sickness severity increased with VR exposure time. However participants had significantly shorter traversed distances and execution times when they utilized the TiltChair and joystick respectively; while participants had significantly longer execution times when they utilized the omni-directional treadmill. Additionally female participants easily utilized the TiltChair and omni-directional treadmill because they traversed shorter distances than male participants. Therefore a VR locomotive controller selection should be based on a target populations characteristics to reduce user simulator sickness and to increase controller intuitiveness. Graphical Abstract The current study investigates the use different virtual reality locomotive controllers to minimize user simulator sickness and maximize controller intuitiveness." Effects of virtual reality technology locomotive multi-sensory motion stimuli on a user simulator sickness and controller intuitiveness during a navigation task.
