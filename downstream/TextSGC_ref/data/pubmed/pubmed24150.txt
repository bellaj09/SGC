In oral and maxillofacial surgery conventional radiographic cephalometry is one of the standard auxiliary tools for diagnosis and surgical planning. While contemporary computer-assisted cephalometric systems and methodologies support cephalometric analysis they tend neither to be practical nor intuitive for practitioners. This is particularly the case for 3D methods since the associated landmarking process is difficult and time consuming. In addition to this there are no 3D cephalometry norms or standards defined; therefore new landmark selection methods are required which will help facilitate their establishment. This paper presents and evaluates a novel haptic-enabled landmarking approach to overcome some of the difficulties and disadvantages of the current landmarking processes used in 2D and 3D cephalometry. The evaluation of a novel haptic-enabled virtual reality approach for computer-aided cephalometry.
