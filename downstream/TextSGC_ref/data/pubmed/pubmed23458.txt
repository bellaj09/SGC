Parietal cortex and adjacent parts of the temporal cortex have recently been associated with bodily self-consciousness BSC. Similarly growing evidence suggests that the lateral parietal cortex is crucial for the subjective aspects of episodic autobiographical memory EAM which is based on the conscious experience of reliving past events. However the neuroanatomical relationship between both fundamental aspects remains currently unexplored. Moreover despite the wealth of neuroimaging data on EAM only few neuroimaging studies have examined BSC and even fewer examined those aspects of BSC that are most closely related to EAM. Here we investigated whether regions in the inferior parietal lobule IPL that have been involved in spatial aspects of BSC self-location and first-person perspective as described by Ionta et al. 2011 are also active in studies investigating autobiographical memory. To examine this relation we thus compared the regions indicated in the study by Ionta et al. 2011 based on data in healthy participants and neurological patients with the results from a meta-analytical study we performed based on functional neuroimaging studies on EAM and semantic autobiographical memory SAM. We report an anatomical overlap bilaterally in the angular gyrus AG but not in other parietal or temporal lobe structures between BSC and EAM. Moreover there was no overlap between BSC and SAM. These preliminary data suggest that the bilateral AG may be a key structure for the conscious re-experiencing of past life episodes EAM and the conscious on-line experience of being located and experiencing the world in first-person BSC.
