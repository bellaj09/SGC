Recent advances in neuroscience and technology have made it possible to record from large assemblies of neurons and to decode their activity to extract information. At the same time available methods to stimulate the brain and influence ongoing processing are also rapidly expanding. These developments pave the way for advanced neurotechnological applications that directly read from and write to the human brain. While such technologies are still primarily used in restricted therapeutic contexts this may change in the future once their performance has improved and they become more widely applicable. Here we provide an overview of methods to interface with the brain speculate about potential applications and discuss important issues associated with a neurotechnologically assisted future.
