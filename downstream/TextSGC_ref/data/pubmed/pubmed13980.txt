Volumetric lung tumor segmentation and accurate longitudinal tracking of tumor volume changes from computed tomography images are essential for monitoring tumor response to therapy. Hence we developed two multiple resolution residually connected network MRRN formulations called incremental-MRRN and dense-MRRN. Our networks simultaneously combine features across multiple image resolution and feature levels through residual connections to detect and segment the lung tumors. We evaluated our method on a total of 1210 non-small cell NSCLC lung tumors and nodules from three data sets consisting of 377 tumors from the open-source Cancer Imaging Archive TCIA 304 advanced stage NSCLC treated with anti- PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy from internal institution MSKCC data set and 529 lung nodules from the Lung Image Database Consortium LIDC. The algorithm was trained using 377 tumors from the TCIA data set and validated on the MSKCC and tested on LIDC data sets. The segmentation accuracy compared to expert delineations was evaluated by computing the dice similarity coefficient Hausdorff distances sensitivity and precision metrics. Our best performing incremental-MRRN method produced the highest DSC of 0.74  0.13 for TCIA 0.750.12 for MSKCC and 0.680.23 for the LIDC data sets. There was no significant difference in the estimations of volumetric tumor changes computed using the incremental-MRRN method compared with the expert segmentation. In summary we have developed a multi-scale CNN approach for volumetrically segmenting lung tumors which enables accurate automated identification of and serial measurement of tumor volumes in the lung.
