The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is a serious incident causing subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with high fatality and morbidity rates. Because the demand for radiologic examinations is steadily growing physician fatigue due to an increased workload is a real concern and may lead to mistaken diagnoses of potentially relevant findings. Our aim was to develop a sufficient system for automated detection of intracranial aneurysms. Deep Learning-Based Detection of Intracranial Aneurysms in 3D TOF-MRA.
