Restoration of upper limb movements in subjects recovering from stroke is an essential keystone in rehabilitative practices. Rehabilitation of arm movements in fact is usually a far more difficult one as compared to that of lower extremities. For these reasons researchers are developing new methods and technologies so that the rehabilitative process could be more accurate rapid and easily accepted by the patient. This paper introduces the proof of concept for a new non-invasive FES-assisted rehabilitation system for the upper limb called smartFES sFES where the electrical stimulation is controlled by a biologically inspired neural inverse dynamics model fed by the kinematic information associated with the execution of a planar goal-oriented movement. More specifically this work details two steps of the proposed system: an ad hoc markerless motion analysis algorithm for the estimation of kinematics and a neural controller that drives a synthetic arm. The vision of the entire system is to acquire kinematics from the analysis of video sequences during planar arm movements and to use it together with a neural inverse dynamics model able to provide the patient with the electrical stimulation patterns needed to perform the movement with the assisted limb. A neural tracking and motor control approach to improve rehabilitation of upper limb movements.
