Adequate medical images are often indispensable in contemporary deep learning-based medical imaging studies although the acquisition of certain image modalities may be limited due to several issues including high costs and patients issues. However thanks to recent advances in deep learning techniques the above tough problem can be substantially alleviated by medical images synthesis by which various modalities including T1/T2/DTI MRI images PET images cardiac ultrasound images retinal images and so on have already been synthesized. Unfortunately the arterial spin labeling ASL image which is an important fMRI indicator in dementia diseases diagnosis nowadays has never been comprehensively investigated for the synthesis purpose yet. In this paper ASL images have been successfully synthesized from structural magnetic resonance images for the first time. Technically a novel unbalanced deep discriminant learning-based model equipped with new ResNet sub-structures is proposed to realize the synthesis of ASL images from structural magnetic resonance images. The extensive experiments have been conducted. Comprehensive statistical analyses reveal that: 1 this newly introduced model is capable to synthesize ASL images that are similar towards real ones acquired by actual scanning; 2 synthesized ASL images obtained by the new model have demonstrated outstanding performance when undergoing rigorous tests of region-based and voxel-based corrections of partial volume effects which are essential in ASL images processing; and 3 it is also promising that the diagnosis performance of dementia diseases can be significantly improved with the help of synthesized ASL images obtained by the new model based on a multi-modal MRI dataset containing 355 demented patients in this paper.
