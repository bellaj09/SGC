Automatic diagnosis of cardiac events is a current problem of interest in which deep learning has shown promising success. We have earlier reported the use of Long Short Term Memory LSTM networks-trained on normal ECG patterns-to the detection of anomalies from the prediction errors for real-time diagnostic applications. In this work we extend our anomaly detection algorithm by introducing a second stage predictor that can identify the actual anomaly class from the error outputs of the first stage model. Results from seven types of anomalies have been presented including Atrial Premature Contraction APC Paced Beat PB Premature Ventricular Contraction PVC Right Bundle Branch Block RBBB Ventricular Bigeminy VB Ventricular Couplets VCs and Ventricular Tachycardia VT. To optimize anomaly class prediction performance multiple choices of second stage models such as multilayer perceptron MLP support vector machine SVM and logistic regression have been employed. A featurization scheme for LSTM prediction errors in the form of overall summaries has been proposed and a successful predictor for the same was developed with good performance. Our results indicate that the error vectors represented by their summary features carry useful predictive information about actual ECG anomaly type. We discuss how the accuracy scores without attention to inherent class imbalances and paucity of data instances may produce misleading performance estimates and hence accurate background models are needed to estimate true predictive performance of multi-class predictors such as those presented in this work.
