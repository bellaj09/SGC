"Recent advances in smart glasses wearable computers in the form of glasses bring new therapeutic and monitoring possibilities for people with Parkinsons disease PD. For example it can provide visual and auditory cues during activities of daily living that have long been used to improve gait disturbances. Furthermore smart glasses can personalize therapies based on the state of the user and/or the user environment in real-time using object recognition and motion tracking. To provide guidelines for developers in creating new PD applications for smart glasses a self-reported questionnaire was designed to survey the requirements constraints and attitudes of people with PD with respect to this new technology. The survey was advertised online over an 11 month period on the website of the Parkinson Vereninging. The results were derived from 62 participants 54.8% men and 45.2% women average age of 65.7  9.1 representing a response rate of 79.5% . The participants were overall very enthusiastic about smart glasses as an assistive technology to facilitate daily living activities especially its potential to self-manage motor problems and provide navigational guidance thereby restoring their confidence and independence. The reported level of usage of mobile technologies like tablets and smartphones suggests that smart glasses could be adopted relatively easily especially by younger people with PD. However the respondents were concerned about the cost appearance efficacy and potential side effects of smart glasses. To accommodate a wide range of symptoms personal preferences and comfort level with technology smart glasses should be designed to allow simple operation and personalization."
