The expansion of laparoscopy and endoscopic surgery has promoted a change in surgical skills acquisition. This review aims to identify problems that modulate surgical skills acquisition and the role of simulation in the current training programs. Social medical and working time constraints together with patient safety issues lead to a decreased availability of operating room OR training opportunities. Systematic reviews show that there is a positive "model to model" transfer of skills more evident for virtual reality VR simulation although transfer from video tower exists for nave trainees both of which supplement standard laparoscopic training. VR to OR positive transfer is proven for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy although not for all parameters analyzed. A mixed model integrating both types of trainers into surgical curricula may strengthen their respective possibilities. To what extent simulation will be included in the surgical training programs depends on development of objective and finer assessment tools and proficiency-based criteria. How far will simulators be involved into training?
