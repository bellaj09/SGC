22q11.2 Deletion syndrome 22q11DS is a genetic disorder associated with numerous phenotypic consequences and is one of the greatest known risk factors for psychosis. We investigated intrinsic-connectivity-networks ICNs as potential biomarkers for patient and psychosis-risk status in 2 independent cohorts UCLA 33 22q11DS-participants 33 demographically matched controls and Syracuse 28 22q11DS 28 controls. After assessing group connectivity differences ICNs from the UCLA cohort were used to train classifiers to distinguish cases from controls and to predict psychosis risk status within 22q11DS; classifiers were subsequently tested on the Syracuse cohort. In both cohorts we observed significant hypoconnectivity in 22q11DS relative to controls within anterior cingulate ACC/precuneus executive default mode DMN posterior DMN and salience networks. Of 12 ICN-derived classifiers tested in the Syracuse replication-cohort the ACC/precuneus DMN and posterior DMN classifiers accurately distinguished between 22q11DS and controls. Within 22q11DS subjects connectivity alterations within 4 networks predicted psychosis risk status for a given individual in both cohorts: the ACC/precuneus DMN left executive and salience networks. Widespread within-network-hypoconnectivity in large-scale networks implicated in higher-order cognition may be a defining characteristic of 22q11DS during adolescence and early adulthood; furthermore loss of coherence within these networks may be a valuable biomarker for individual prediction of psychosis-risk in 22q11DS.
