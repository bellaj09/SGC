Deficit schizophrenia DS characterized by primary and enduring negative symptoms has been considered as a pathophysiologically distinct schizophrenic subgroup. Neuroimaging characteristics of DS especially functional brain network architecture remain largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory approaches were employed to investigate the topological organization of whole-brain functional networks of 114 male participants including 33 DS 41 non-deficit schizophrenia NDS and 40 healthy controls HCs. At the whole-brain level both the NDS and DS group exhibited lower local efficiency Eloc than the HC group implying the reduction of local specialization of brain information processing reduced functional segregation. The DS but not NDS group exhibited enhanced parallel information transfer enhanced functional integration as determined by smaller characteristic path length Lp and higher global efficiency Eglob. The Lp and Eglob presented significant correlations with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale BPRS total score in the DS group. At the nodal level both the NDS and DS groups showed higher functional connectivity in the inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus and lower connectivity in the visual areas and striatum than the controls. The DS group exhibited higher nodal connectivity in the right inferior temporal gyrus than the NDS and HC group. The diminished expression of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms SANS subfactors negatively correlated with nodal connectivity of right putamen while asociality/amotivation positively correlated with right hippocampus across whole patients. We highlighted the convergence and divergence of brain functional network dysfunctions in patients with DS and NDS which provides crucial insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of the 2 schizophrenic subtypes.
