"Gamma oscillations 25-100\u2009Hz are believed to play a role in cognition. Accordingly aberrant gamma oscillations have been observed in several cognitive disorders including Alzheimers disease and Fragile X syndrome. Here we review how recent results showing abnormal gamma rhythms in Alzheimers disease and Fragile X syndrome help reveal links between cellular disturbances and cognitive impairments. We also discuss how gamma results from rodent models of Alzheimers disease and Fragile X syndrome may provide insights about unique functions of distinct slow 25-50\u2009Hz and fast gamma 55-100\u2009Hz subtypes. Finally we consider studies employing brain stimulation paradigms in Alzheimers disease and discuss how such studies may reveal causal relationships between gamma impairments and memory disturbances."
