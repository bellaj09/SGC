The aim of this study is to validate the feasibility and accuracy of a new automatic tooth preparation technique in dental healthcare. An automatic tooth preparation robotic device with three-dimensional motion planning software was developed which controlled an ultra-short pulse laser USPL beam wavelength 1064\u2009nm pulse width 15\u2009ps output power 30\u2009W and repeat frequency rate 100\u2009kHz to complete the tooth preparation process. A total of 15 freshly extracted human intact first molars were collected and fixed into a phantom head and the target preparation shapes of these molars were designed using customised computer-aided design CAD software. The accuracy of tooth preparation was evaluated using the Geomagic Studio and Imageware software and the preparing time of each tooth was recorded. Compared with the target preparation shape the average shape error of the 15 prepared molars was 0.05-0.17\u2009mm the preparation depth error of the occlusal surface was approximately 0.097\u2009mm and the error of the convergence angle was approximately 1.0. The average preparation time was 17\u2009minutes. These results validated the accuracy and feasibility of the automatic tooth preparation technique.
