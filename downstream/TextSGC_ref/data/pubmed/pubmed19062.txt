INTRODUCTION AND STUDY AIM: Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES is an emerging surgical technique that requires a cautious adoption approach to ensure patient safety. High-fidelity virtual-reality-based simulators allow development of new surgical procedures and tools and train medical personnel without risk to human patients. As part of a project funded by the National Institutes of Health we are developing the virtual transluminal endoscopic surgery trainer VTEST for this purpose. The objective of this study is to conduct a structured needs analysis to identify the design parameters for such a virtual-reality-based simulator for NOTES. Needs analysis for developing a virtual-reality NOTES simulator.
