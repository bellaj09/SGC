Purpose This study investigates whether cognition balance and dual task performance in institutionalized older adults improves by a virtual reality dual task training. Subjects and Methods Randomized controlled trial; Twenty institutionalized older adults with mild cognitive impairment 13 female 7 male; average age 87.2  5.96\u2005years were randomized to the intervention i.e. Virtual reality dual-task training using the BioRescue or control group no additional training. The intervention group took part in a 6-week training program while the elderly in the control group maintained their daily activities. Balance was measured with the Instrumented Timed Up-and-Go Test with and without a cognitive task. The Observed Emotion Rating Scale and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory were administered to evaluate the emotions and motivation regarding the exergaming program. Results The intervention group improved significantly on the total Timed Up-and-Go duration and the turn-to-sit duration during single-task walking in comparison to the control group who received no additional training. Participants found the virtual reality dual task training pleasant and useful for their concentration memory and balance. Pleasure and alertness were the two emotions which were mostly seen during the intervention. Conclusion The BioRescue is a pleasant and interesting treatment method well suited for institutionalized older adults in need of lifelong physical therapy. The effect of cognitive-motor dual task training with the biorescue force platform on cognition balance and dual task performance in institutionalized older adults: a randomized controlled trial.
