The Virtual Electrosurgical Skill Trainer is a tool for training surgeons the safe operation of electrosurgery tools in both open and minimally invasive surgery. This training includes a dedicated team-training module that focuses on operating room OR fire prevention and response. The module was developed to allow trainees practicing surgeons anesthesiologist and nurses to interact with a virtual OR environment which includes anesthesia apparatus electrosurgical equipment a virtual patient and a fire extinguisher. Wearing a head-mounted display participants must correctly identify the "fire triangle" elements and then successfully contain an OR fire. Within these virtual reality scenarios trainees learn to react appropriately to the simulated emergency. A study targeted at establishing the face validity of the virtual OR fire simulator was undertaken at the 2015 Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference.
