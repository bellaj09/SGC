"This paper describes the development of an encountered-type haptic interface that can generate the physical characteristics such as shape and rigidity of three-dimensional 3D virtual objects using an array of newly developed non-expandable balloons. To alter the rigidity of each non-expandable balloon the volume of air in it is controlled through a linear actuator and a pressure sensor based on Hookes law. Furthermore to change the volume of each balloon its exposed surface area is controlled by using another linear actuator with a trumpet-shaped tube. A position control mechanism is constructed to display virtual objects using the balloons. The 3D position of each balloon is controlled using a flexible tube and a string. The performance of the system is tested and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed principle and interface."
