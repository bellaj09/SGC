Adaptor proteins are carrier proteins that play a crucial role in signal transduction. They commonly consist of several modular domains each having its own binding activity and operating by forming complexes with other intracellular-signaling molecules. Many studies determined that the adaptor proteins had been implicated in a variety of human diseases. Therefore creating a precise model to predict the function of adaptor proteins is one of the vital tasks in bioinformatics and computational biology. Few computational biology studies have been conducted to predict the protein functions and in most of those studies position specific scoring matrix PSSM profiles had been used as the features to be fed into the neural networks. However the neural networks could not reach the optimal result because the sequential information in PSSMs has been lost. This study proposes an innovative approach by incorporating recurrent neural networks RNNs and PSSM profiles to resolve this problem.
