Three years ago consultants Laurence Prusak and Thomas H. Davenport asked prominent management thinkers to name their gurus and reported the results in HBR. James G. March appeared on more lists than any other person except Peter Drucker. A professor emeritus in management sociology political science and education at Stanford University March has taught courses in subjects as diverse as organizational psychology behavioral economics leadership rules for killing people friendship computer simulation and statistics. He is perhaps best known for his pioneering contributions to organization and management theory. March\s accomplishments in that field and in many others have conferred on him an almost unprecedented reputation as a rigorous scholar and a deep source of wisdom. As University of Chicago professor John Padgett wrote in the journal Contemporary Sociology "March\s influence unlike that of any of his peers is not limited to any possible subset of the social science disciplines; it is pervasive." March approaches thought aesthetically; he cares that ideas have "some form of elegance or grace or surprise." His poetic sensibility can be felt in the metaphors he has created over the years--the "garbage can theory" of organizational choice for instance and the "hot-stove effect" in learning. In this edited interview with HBR senior editor Diane Coutu March shares his thinking on aesthetics leadership the role of folly and the irrelevance of relevance when it comes to the pursuit of ideas. He also comments on the fundamental differences between academic and experiential knowledge underscoring the need for both. Ideas as art. Interview by Dane Cutu.
