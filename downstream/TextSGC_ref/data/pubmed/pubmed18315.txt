"People relying much on vision in the control of posture are known to have an elevated risk of falling. Dependence on visual control is an important parameter in the diagnosis of balance disorders. We have previously shown that virtual reality VR methods can be used to produce visual stimuli that affect balance but suitable stimuli need to be found. In this study the effect of six different VR stimuli on the balance of 22 healthy test subjects was evaluated using force platform posturography. We report in more detail and expand the results published earlier. According to the tests two of the stimuli have a significant destabilizing effect on balance. In addition a significant displacement effect on the subjects center of pressure COP was found. Thus it is shown that the design of VR stimuli to cause different effects on the control of balance is possible." Development of virtual reality stimuli for force platform posturography.
