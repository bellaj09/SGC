Awe is a little-studied emotion with a great transformative potential. Therefore the interest toward the study of awe\s underlying mechanisms has been increased. Specifically researchers have been interested in how to reproduce intense feelings of awe within laboratory conditions. It has been proposed that the use of virtual reality VR could be an effective way to induce awe in controlled experimental settings thanks to its ability of providing participants with a sense of "presence" that is the subjective feeling of being displaced in another physical or imaginary place. However the potential of VR as awe-inducing medium has not been fully tested yet. In the present study we provided an evidence-based design and a validation of four immersive virtual environments VEs involving 36 participants in a within-subject design. Of these three VEs were designed to induce awe whereas the fourth VE was targeted as an emotionally neutral stimulus. Participants self-reported the extent to which they felt awe general affect and sense of presence related to each environment. As expected results showed that awe-VEs could induce significantly higher levels of awe and presence as compared to the neutral VE. Furthermore these VEs induced significantly more positive than negative affect. These findings supported the potential of immersive VR for inducing awe and provide useful indications for the design of awe-inspiring virtual environments.
