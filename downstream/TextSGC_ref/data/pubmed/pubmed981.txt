Antiviral drugs are administered in patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 including those treated with direct oral anticoagulants DOACs. Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in-hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. Direct oral anticoagulant plasma levels striking increase in severe COVID-19 respiratory syndrome patients treated with antiviral agents. The Cremona experience.
