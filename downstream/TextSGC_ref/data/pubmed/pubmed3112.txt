This multi-study analysis 6 fMRI studies; 142 participants explores the functional activation and connectivity of the cerebellum with the cerebrum during repeated behavioral information uptake informing about personality traits of different persons. The results suggest that trait repetition recruits activity in areas belonging to the mentalizing and executive control networks in the cerebrum and the executive control areas in the cerebellum. Cerebral activation was observed in the executive control network including the posterior medial frontal cortex pmFC the bilateral prefrontal cortex PFC and bilateral inferior parietal cortex IPC in the mentalizing network including the bilateral middle temporal cortex MTC extending to the right superior temporal cortex STC as well as in the visual network including the left cuneus Cun and the left inferior occipital cortex. Moreover cerebellar activation was found bilaterally in lobules VI and VII belonging to the executive control network. Importantly significant patterns of functional connectivity were found linking these cerebellar executive areas with cerebral executive areas in the medial pmFC the left PFC and the left IPC and mentalizing areas in the left MTC. In addition connectivity was found between the cerebral areas in the left hemisphere involved in the executive and mentalizing networks as well as with their homolog areas in the right hemisphere. The discussion centers on the role of these cerebello-cerebral connections in matching internal predictions generated by the cerebellum with external information from the cerebrum presumably involving the sequencing of behaviors.
