We propose a novel deep learning approach for predicting drug-target interaction using a graph neural network. We introduce a distance-aware graph attention algorithm to differentiate various types of intermolecular interactions. Furthermore we extract the graph feature of intermolecular interactions directly from the 3D structural information on the protein-ligand binding pose. Thus the model can learn key features for accurate predictions of drug-target interaction rather than just memorize certain patterns of ligand molecules. As a result our model shows better performance than docking and other deep learning methods for both virtual screening AUROC of 0.968 for the DUD-E test set and pose prediction AUROC of 0.935 for the PDBbind test set. In addition it can reproduce the natural population distribution of active molecules and inactive molecules.
