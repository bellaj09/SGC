In this paper we discuss the multiple dimensions of water security and define a set of thematic challenges for science policy and governance based around cross-scale dynamics complexity and uncertainty. A case study of the Saskatchewan River basin SRB in western Canada is presented which encompasses many of the water-security challenges faced worldwide. A science agenda is defined based on the development of the SRB as a large-scale observatory to develop the underpinning science and social science needed to improve our understanding of water futures under societal and environmental change. We argue that non-stationarity poses profound challenges for existing science and that new integration of the natural sciences engineering and social sciences is needed to address decision making under deep uncertainty. We suggest that vulnerability analysis can be combined with scenario-based modelling to address issues of water security and that knowledge translation should be coupled with place-based modelling adaptive governance and social learning to address the complexity uncertainty and scale dynamics of contemporary water problems.
