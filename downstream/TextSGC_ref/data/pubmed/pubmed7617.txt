Here we present the Mendeleev-Meyer Force Project which aims at tabulating all materials and substances in a fashion similar to the periodic table. The goal is to group and tabulate substances using nanoscale force footprints rather than atomic number or electronic configuration as in the periodic table. The process is divided into: 1 acquiring nanoscale force data from materials 2 parameterizing the raw data into standardized input features to generate a library 3 feeding the standardized library into an algorithm to generate enhance or exploit a model to identify a material or property. We propose producing databases mimicking the Materials Genome Initiative the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online MEDLARS or the PRoteomics IDEntifications database PRIDE and making these searchable online via search engines mimicking Pubmed or the PRIDE web interface. A prototype exploiting deep learning algorithms i.e. multilayer neural networks is presented. The Mendeleev-Meyer force project.
