Modern data analysis pipelines are becoming increasingly complex due to the presence of multiview information sources. While graphs are effective in modeling complex relationships in many scenarios a single graph is rarely sufficient to succinctly represent all interactions and hence multilayered graphs have become popular. Though this leads to richer representations extending solutions from the single-graph case is not straightforward. Consequently there is a strong need for novel solutions to solve classical problems such as node classification in the multilayered case. In this article we consider the problem of semisupervised learning with multilayered graphs. Though deep network embeddings e.g. DeepWalk are widely adopted for community discovery we argue that feature learning with random node attributes using graph neural networks can be more effective. To this end we propose to use attention models for effective feature learning and develop two novel architectures GrAMME-SG and GrAMME-Fusion that exploit the interlayer dependences for building multilayered graph embeddings. Using empirical studies on several benchmark data sets we evaluate the proposed approaches and demonstrate significant performance improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-art network embedding strategies. The results also show that using simple random features is an effective choice even in cases where explicit node attributes are not available.
