Learning is a process of constructing neural connections between what is being learned and what has already been learned. Superficial thought processes associated with memorization produce shallow short-term learning. Higher-order thought processing critical thinking produces deep long-term learning. Pharmacy students should study in ways that enable them to retain and apply what they learn. An evidence-based analysis of learning practices: the need for pharmacy students to employ more effective study strategies.
