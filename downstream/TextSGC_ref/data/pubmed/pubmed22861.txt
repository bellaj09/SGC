The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the impact of virtual reality exposure therapy VRET on brain metabolism and connectivity. Eighteen patients with acrophobia were assessed by an 18F-FDG PET scan sensitized by virtual exposure before treatment and nine of them were assessed again after eight sessions of VRET. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to study the correlations between metabolism and pretherapeutic clinical scores and to compare metabolism before and after VRET p voxel <\u20090.005 corrected for cluster volume. Metabolic connectivity was evaluated through interregional correlation analysis. Brain metabolism and related connectivity in patients with acrophobia treated by virtual reality therapy: an 18F-FDG PET pilot study sensitized by virtual exposure.
