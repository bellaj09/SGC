"The diversion of a drivers attention from driving can be catastrophic. Given that conventional button- and touch-based interfaces may distract the driver developing novel distraction-free interfaces for the various devices present in cars has becomes necessary. Hand gesture recognition may provide an alternative interface inside cars. Given that cars are the targeted application area we determined the optimal location for the radar sensor so that the signal reflected from the drivers hand during gesturing is unaffected by interference from the motion of the drivers body or other motions within the car. We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network-based technique to recognize the finger-counting-based hand gestures using an Impulse Radio IR radar sensor. The accuracy of the proposed method was sufficiently high for real-world applications." Finger-Counting-Based Gesture Recognition within Cars Using Impulse Radar with Convolutional Neural Network.
