"In recent years machine learning ML took bio- and cheminformatics fields by storm providing new solutions for a vast repertoire of problems related to protein sequence structure and interactions analysis. ML techniques deep neural networks especially were proven more effective than classical models for tasks like predicting binding affinity for molecular complex. In this work we investigated the earlier stage of drug discovery process - finding druggable pockets on protein surface that can be later used to design active molecules. For this purpose we developed a 3D fully convolutional neural network capable of binding site segmentation. Our solution has high prediction accuracy and provides intuitive representations of the results which makes it easy to incorporate into drug discovery projects. The models source code together with scripts for most common use-cases is freely available at http://gitlab.com/cheminfIBB/kalasanty."
