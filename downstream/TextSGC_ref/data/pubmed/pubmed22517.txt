Services are available to help support existing employment for individuals with psychiatric disabilities; however there is a gap in services targeting job interview skills that can help obtain employment. We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of Virtual Reality Job Interview Training VR-JIT in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to VR-JIT n = 25 or treatment-as-usual TAU n = 12 groups. VR-JIT consisted of 10 hours of simulated job interviews with a virtual character and didactic online training. The participants attended 95% of laboratory-based training sessions and found VR-JIT easy to use and felt prepared for future interviews. The VR-JIT group improved their job interview role-play performance p  0.05 and self-confidence p  0.05 between baseline and follow-up as compared with the TAU group. VR-JIT performance scores increased over time R = 0.65. VR-JIT demonstrated initial feasibility and efficacy at improving job interview skills and self-confidence. Future research may help clarify whether this intervention is efficacious in community-based settings. Virtual reality job interview training for individuals with psychiatric disabilities.
