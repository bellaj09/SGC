This paper provides an analysis of perspectives from different stakeholders on the state-of-the-art of BCI. Three barriers for technology transfer of BCIs as access technologies are identified. First BCIs are developed with a narrow focus on creating a reliable technology while a broader focus on creating a usable technology is needed. Second the potential target group which could benefit from BCIs as access technologies is expected to be very small. Development costs are therefore high while reimbursements are expected to be low which challenges the commercial viability. Third potential target users should be much more included in the design process of BCIs to ensure that the end-products meet technical ethical legal and social requirements. These three issues need to be urgently addressed so that target users may benefit from this promising technology. Technology transfer of brain-computer interfaces as assistive technology: barriers and opportunities.
