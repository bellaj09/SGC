Disturbances in functional connectivity have been suggested to contribute to cognitive and emotion processing deficits observed in bipolar disorder BD. Functional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex mPFC and other brain regions may be particularly abnormal. The goal of the present study was to characterize the temporal dynamics of the default mode network DMN connectivity in BD and examine its association with cognition. Dynamic functional connectivity in bipolar disorder is associated with executive function and processing speed: A preliminary study.
