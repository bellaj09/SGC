"The processing of brain information relies on the organization of neuronal networks and circuits that in the end must provide the substrate for human cognition. However the presence of highly complex and multirelay neuronal interactions has limited our ability to disentangle the assemblies of brain systems. The present review article focuses on the latest developments to understand the architecture of functional streams of the human brain at the large-scale level. Particularly this article presents a comprehensive framework and recent findings about how the highly modular sensory cortex such as the visual somatosensory auditory as well as motor cortex areas connects to more parallel-organized cortical hubs in the brains functional connectome." Functional streams and cortical integration in the human brain.
