Patients with paralysis will one day rely on clinically-available brain-machine interfaces BMI to facilitate activities of daily living. As such the ability to generate dexterous reaching movements remains a prime target of BMI algorithms research. The Bayesian approach to BMI algorithms requires a statistical model to describe reaching movements. To date available models have either required fixed targets or fixed arrival times neither of which can be assumed under natural operating conditions. Recently we described a generative reach model GPFD-RSE that simultaneously breaks both restrictions. This method combines the reach state equation RSE with General Purpose Filter Design GPFD. In the following paper we further compare GPFD-RSE against standard methods in simulated open-loop decoding using empirically-derived movements as an adjunct to the idealized movements tested previously. Our results indicate that GPFD-RSE continues to outperform standard methods when reconstructing more realistic arm movements in simulation. Variable-arrival-time reaching with the brain-machine interface: performance comparison on empirically-derived movements.
