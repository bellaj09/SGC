Confusion is a complex cognitive state that is prevalent during learning and problem-solving. The aim of this study is to explore the brain activity reflected by electroencephalography EEG during a confusing state induced by two kinds of information insufficiencies during mathematical problem-solving namely an explicit situation that clearly lacked information and an implicit situation in which the missing information was hidden in the problem itself and whether there is an EEG difference between these two situations. Two experimental tasks and three control tasks were created. Short time Fourier transformation STFT was used for time-frequency analysis; then the alpha task-related-power TRP changes and distributions which are closely related to cognitive processing were calculated and repeated measures ANOVA were performed to find the significant difference between task conditions. The results showed that the alpha power decreased significantly in the regions related to calculation when the participants encountered both explicit and implicit information insufficiency tasks compared to the control tasks suggesting that confusion can cause more brain activity in the cortical regions related to the tasks that induce confusion. In addition the implicit information insufficiency task elicited more activity in the parietal and right temporal regions whereas the explicit information insufficiency task elicited additional activity in the frontal lobe which revealed that the frontal region is related to the processing of novel or unfamiliar information and the parietal-temporal regions are involved in sustained attention or reorientation during confusing states induced by information insufficiency. In conclusion this study has preliminarily investigated the EEG characteristics of confusion states suggests that EEG is a promising methodology to detect confusion and provides a basis for future studies aiming to achieve automatic recognition of confusing states.
