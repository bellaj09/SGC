A novel support system for implant surgery was tried out which involves manipulating a three-dimensional 3-D computed tomography CT image of a jawbone with a virtual reality force feedback haptic device. Through this virtual system the haptic experience of bone drilling with vibration and the sound of the contra-angle handpiece could be realized. It is expected to be useful for training inexperienced dentists and educating dental students. The simulation of oral implant insertion was also focused on. A simple cylindrical implant model was inserted into a 3-D image of the jawbone by operating the haptic device with consideration of bone condition. A rectangular solid object that served as a bone-supported surgical template was adopted and the shapes of the bone and the implant were subtracted from the object. In this manner the CAD of the surgical template with impressions of the bone and the implant guide holes for insertion was realized. The surgical template was milled with a computer-controlled milling machine CAM. Surgical template accuracy was examined with an edentulous gypsum bone model having six holes for implant insertion. Simulation of the oral implant insertion and CAD/CAM of the surgical template were conducted. The milled surgical template was fitted on the gypsum bone model and CT images were taken. Cross-sections of the guide holes in the surgical template were imaged and misalignment between the guide holes of the surgical template and the drilled holes on the jawbone was measured. The average misalignment is less than 0.2 mm and it indicates that the present system is potentially applicable to oral implant surgery.
