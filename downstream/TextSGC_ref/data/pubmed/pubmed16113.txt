Ear and mastoid disease can easily be treated by early detection and appropriate medical care. However short of specialists and relatively low diagnostic accuracy calls for a new way of diagnostic strategy in which deep learning may play a significant role. The current study presents a machine learning model to automatically diagnose ear disease using a large database of otoendoscopic images acquired in the clinical environment. Automated diagnosis of ear disease using ensemble deep learning with a big otoendoscopy image database.
