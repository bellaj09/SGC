"As nontechnical losses in power systems have recently become a global concern electricity fraud detection models attracted increasing academic interest. The wide application of smart meters has offered more possibility to detecting fraud from users consumption patterns. However the performances of existing consumption-based electricity fraud detection models are still not satisfactory enough for practice partly due to their limited ability to handle high-dimensional data. In this paper a deep-learning-based model is developed for detecting electricity fraud in the advanced metering infrastructure namely the multitask feature extracting fraud detector MFEFD. The deep architecture has brought MFEFD a powerful ability to handle high-dimensional input through which consumption patterns inside load profiles can be effectively extracted. Another challenge is that the insufficiency of labeled data has restricted the generalization of existing models since they are mostly based on supervised learning and labeled data. MFEFD is trained in a semisupervised manner in which multitask training was implemented to combine the supervised and unsupervised training so that both the knowledge from unlabeled and labeled data can be made use of. Real-world-data-based case studies have demonstrated MFEFDs high detection performance robustness privacy preservation and practicability."
