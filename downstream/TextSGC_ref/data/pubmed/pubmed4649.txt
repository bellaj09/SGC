Post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that occurs in individuals who have experienced life-threatening mental traumas. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that the pathology of PTSD may be associated with the abnormal functional integration among brain regions. In the current study we used functional connectivity density FCD mapping a novel voxel-wise data-driven approach based on graph theory to explore aberrant FC through the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of the PTSD. We calculated both short- and long-range FCD in PTSD patients and healthy controls HCs. Compared with HCs PTSD patients showed significantly increased long-range FCD in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC but no abnormal short-range FCD was found in PTSD. Furthermore seed-based FC analysis of the left DLPFC showed increased connectivity in the left superior parietal lobe and visual cortex of PTSD patients. The results suggested that PTSD patients experienced a disruption of intrinsic long-range functional connections in the fronto-parietal network and visual cortex which are associated with attention control and visual information processing.
