Imaging of the secondary electron bremsstrahlung SEB X-rays emitted during particle-ion irradiation is a promising method for beam range estimation. However the SEB X-ray images are not directly correlated to the dose images. In addition limited spatial resolution of the X-ray camera and low-count situation may impede correctly estimating the beam range and width in SEB X-ray images. To overcome these limitations of the SEB X-ray images measured by the X-ray camera a deep learning DL approach was proposed in this work to predict the dose images for estimating the range and width of the carbon-ion beam on the measured SEB X-ray images. Dose image prediction for range and width verifications from carbon-ion induced secondary electron bremsstrahlung X-rays using deep learning workflow.
