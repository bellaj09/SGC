"Interventional Radiology IR is a minimally invasive procedure where thin tubular instruments guide wires and catheters are steered through the patients vascular system under X-ray imaging. In order to perform these procedures a radiologist has to be trained to master hand-eye coordination instrument manipulation and procedure protocols. The existing simulation systems all have major drawbacks: the use of modified instruments unrealistic insertion lengths high inertia of the haptic device that creates a noticeably degraded dynamic behavior or excessive friction that is not properly compensated for. In this paper we propose a quality training environment dedicated to IR. The system is composed of a virtual reality VR simulation of the patients anatomy linked to a robotic interface providing haptic force feedback. This paper focuses on the requirements design and prototyping of a specific haptic interface for guide wires." A haptic device for guide wire in interventional radiology procedures.
