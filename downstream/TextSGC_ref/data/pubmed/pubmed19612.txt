A virtual reality-based simulator for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES procedures may be used for training and discovery of new tools and procedures. Our previous study Sankaranarayanan et al. in Surg Endosc 27:1607-1616 2013 shows that developing such a simulator for the transvaginal cholecystectomy procedure using a rigid endoscope will have the most impact on the field. However prior to developing such a simulator a thorough task analysis is necessary to determine the most important phases tasks and subtasks of this procedure. A comparison of NOTES transvaginal and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures based upon task analysis.
