COVID-19 emerged as the first example of "Disease X" a hypothetical disease of humans caused by an unknown infectious agent that was named as novel coronavirus and subsequently designated as SARS-CoV-2. The origin of the outbreak at the animal market in Wuhan China implies it as a case of zoonotic spillover. The study was designed to understand evolution of Betacoronaviruses and in particular diversification of SARS-CoV-2 using RdRp gene a stable genetic marker. Understanding evolution of SARS-CoV-2: a perspective from analysis of genetic diversity of RdRp gene.
