Equinus varus cavus and adduction are typical signs of congenital talipes equinovarus CTEV. Forefoot adduction remains a difficulty from using previous corrective methods. This study aims to develop a corrective method to reduce the severity of forefoot adduction of CTEV children with moderate deformities during their walking age. The devised method was compared with 2 other common corrective methods to evaluate its effectiveness. A Dennis Brown DB splint DB splint with orthopedic shoes OS and forefoot abduct shoes FAS with OS were respectively applied to 15 20 and 18 CTEV children with moderate deformities who were scored at their first visit according to the Dimglio classification. The mean follow-up was 44 months and the orthoses were changed as the children grew. A 3D scanner and a high-resolution pedobarograph were used to record morphological characteristics and plantar pressure distribution. One-way MAVONA analysis was used to compare the bimalleolar angle bean-shape ratio and pressure ratios in each study group. There were significant differences in the FAS+OS group compared to the DB and DB+OS groups P\u200a<\u200a0.05 for most measurements. The most salient differences were as follows: the FAS+OS group had a significantly greater bimalleolar angle P\u200a<\u200a0.05 and lower bean-shape ratio P\u200a<\u200a0.01 than the other groups; the DB+OS and FAS+OS groups had higher heel/forefoot and heel/LMF ratios P\u200a<\u200a0.01 and P\u200a<\u200a0.001 than the DB group. FAS are critical for correcting improper forefoot adduction and OS are important for the correction of equinus and varus in moderately afflicted CTEV children. This study suggests that the use of FAS+OS may improve treatment outcomes for moderate CTEV children who do not show signs of serious torsional deformity.
