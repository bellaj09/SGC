Advancement in wireless and microsystems technology have ushered in new devices that can directly interface with the central nervous system for stimulating and/or monitoring neural circuitry. In this paper we present an ultra low-power sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter ADC intended for utilization into large-scale multi-channel neural recording implants. This proposed design which provides a resolution of 9 bits using a one-bit oversampled ADC presents several desirable features that allow for an in-channel ADC scheme where one sigma-delta converter is provided for each channel enabling development of scalable systems that can interface with different types of high-density neural microprobes. The proposed circuit which have been fabricated in a TSMC 180-nm CMOS process employs a first order noise shaping topology with a passive integrator and a low-supply voltage of 0.6 V to achieve ultra low-power consumption and small size. The proposed ADC clearly outperforms other designs with a power consumption as low as 110 nW for a precision of 9 bits 11-fJ per conversion a silicon area of only 82 m  84 m and one of the best reported figure of merit among recently published data converters utilized in similar applications.
