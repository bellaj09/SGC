The limited space immediately surrounding our body known as peripersonal space PPS has been investigated by focusing on changes in the multisensory processing of audio-tactile stimuli occurring within or outside the PPS. Some studies have reported that the PPS representation is extended by body actions such as walking. However it is unclear whether the PPS changes when a walking-like sensation is induced but the body neither moves nor is forced to move. Here we show that a rhythmic pattern consisting of walking-sound vibrations applied to the soles of the feet but not the forearms boosted tactile processing when looming sounds were located near the body. The findings suggest that an extension of the PPS representation can be triggered by stimulating the soles in the absence of body action which may automatically drive a motor program for walking leading to a change in spatial cognition around the body.
