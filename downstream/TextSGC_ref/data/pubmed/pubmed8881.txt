"Pulmonary embolism PE is the most serious and life-threatening clinical presentation of venous thromboembolism and difficult to diagnose. Triple point-of-care-ultrasonography POCUS of the lung heart and leg veins is a multiorgan approach that may help to evaluate patients suspected of having PE in combination with existing protocols and computed tomographic pulmonary angiography CTPA. We present the case of a 26-year-old man with sudden onset of dyspnoea and swelling of the leg with a Wells score of 9. With CTPA unavailable at the time of presentation triple POCUS showed subpleural consolidations and a venous thrombus in a popliteal vein. A diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis with PE was made and the appropriate treatment was started immediately. Although triple POCUS has less sensitivity and specificity than CTPA it could be very useful in some clinical settings." Triple POCUS: A New Approach to an Old Problem.
