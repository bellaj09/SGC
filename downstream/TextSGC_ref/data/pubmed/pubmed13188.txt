In existing closed-loop soilless cultures nutrient solutions are controlled by the electrical conductivity EC of the solution. However the EC of nutrient solutions is affected by both growth environments and crop growth so it is hard to predict the EC of nutrient solution. The objective of this study was to predict the EC of root-zone nutrient solutions in closed-loop soilless cultures using recurrent neural network RNN. In a test greenhouse with sweet peppers Capsicum annuum L. data were measured every 10 s from October 15 to December 31 2014. Mean values for every hour were analyzed. Validation accuracy R2 of a single-layer long short-term memory LSTM was 0.92 and root-mean-square error RMSE was 0.07 which were the best results among the different RNNs. The trained LSTM predicted the substrate EC accurately at all ranges. Test accuracy R2 was 0.72 and RMSE was 0.08 which were lower than values for the validation. Deep learning algorithms were more accurate when more data were added for training. The addition of other environmental factors or plant growth data would improve model robustness. A trained LSTM can control the nutrient solutions in closed-loop soilless cultures based on predicted future EC. Therefore the algorithm can make a planned management of nutrient solutions possible reducing resource waste.
