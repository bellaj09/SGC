Attentional distraction from pain has been shown to be largely ineffective for obtaining a hypoalgesic effect in patients with chronic pain when compared to a control condition. It has been hypothesized that this may be due to the non-engaging types of distraction that have been used so far. Moreover it is suggested that the hypoalgesic effects of distraction may be attenuated by pain-related cognitions and emotions as they may increase the attention to pain. Virtual reality distraction induces hypoalgesia in patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial.
