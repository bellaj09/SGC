Functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is particularly suited for the young population and ecological measurement. However thus far not enough effort has been given to the clinical diagnosis of young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD by using fNIRS. The current study provided some insights into the quantitative analysis of functional networks in young children ages 4.8-8.0years old with and without ASD and in particular investigated the network efficiency and lobe-level connectivity of their functional networks while watching a cartoon. The main results included that: i Weak network efficiency was observed in young children with ASD even for a wide range of threshold for the binarization of functional networks; ii A maximum classification accuracy rate of 83.3% was obtained for all participants by using the k-means clustering method with network efficiencies as the feature parameters; and iii Weak lobe-level inter-region connections were uncovered in the right prefrontal cortex including its linkages with the left prefrontal cortex and the bilateral temporal cortex. Such results indicate that the right prefrontal cortex might make a major contribution to the psychopathology of young children with ASD at the functional network architecture level and at the functional lobe-connectivity level respectively.
