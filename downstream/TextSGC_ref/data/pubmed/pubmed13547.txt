Early research in the field of intuitive physics provided extensive evidence that humans succumb to common misconceptions and biases when predicting judging and explaining activity in the physical world. Recent work has demonstrated that across a diverse range of situations some biases can be explained by the application of normative physical principles to noisy perceptual inputs. However it remains unclear how knowledge of physical principles is learned represented and applied to novel situations. In this review we discuss theoretical advances from heuristic models to knowledge-based probabilistic simulation models as well as recent deep-learning models. We also consider how recent work may be reconciled with earlier findings that favored heuristic models. Intuitive Physics: Current Research and Controversies.
