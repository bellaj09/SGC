Over the past several decades electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have attracted attention from researchers in the field of neuroscience neural engineering and clinical rehabilitation. While the performance of BCI systems has improved they do not yet support widespread usage. Recently visual and auditory BCI systems have become popular because of their high communication speeds little user training and low user variation. However building robust and practical BCI systems from physiological and technical knowledge of neural modulation of visual and auditory brain responses remains a challenging problem. In this paper we review the current state and future challenges of visual and auditory BCI systems. First we describe a new taxonomy based on the multiple access methods used in telecommunication systems. Then we discuss the challenges of translating current technology into real-life practices and outline potential avenues to address them. Specifically this review aims to provide useful guidelines for exploring new paradigms and methodologies to improve the current visual and auditory BCI technology.
