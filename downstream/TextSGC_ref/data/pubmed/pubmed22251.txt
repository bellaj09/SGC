Myoelectric signals MES have been used in various applications in particular for identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices for amputees orthotic devices and exoskeleton in order to augment capability of the user. MES are also used to estimate force and hence torque to actuate the assistive device. The application of MES is not limited to assistive devices and they also find potential applications in teleoperation of robots haptic devices virtual reality and so on. The myoelectric control-based prosthetic hand aids to restore activities of daily living of amputees in order to improve the self-esteem of the user. All myoelectric control-based prosthetic hands may not have similar operations and exhibit variation in sensing input deciphering the signals and actuating prosthetic hand. Researchers are focusing on improving the functionality of prosthetic hand in order to suit the user requirement with the different operating features. The myoelectric control differs in operation to accommodate various external factors. This article reviews the state of the art of myoelectric prosthetic hand giving description of each control strategy. Myoelectric control of prosthetic hands: state-of-the-art review.
