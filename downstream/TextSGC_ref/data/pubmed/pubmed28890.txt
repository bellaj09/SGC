In this paper a short-impulse ultra-wide band UWB transmitter is introduced to enable large-scale neural recordings within miniature brain implants including thousands of channels. The proposed impulse radio UWB transmitter uses a BPSK modulation scheme the carrier signal of which uses only two delayed impulses to encode the transmitted signal. The proposed UWB transmitter has been implemented into a CMOS 180 nm technology. It occupies 300 m  230 m and consumes only 6.7 pJ/bit from a 1.8-V supply. Experimental results show that the transmitter has a bandwidth of 2.6 GHz to 5.6 GHz and achieves a maximum data rate of 800 Mbps which outperforms existing low-power UWB transmitters for similar applications.
