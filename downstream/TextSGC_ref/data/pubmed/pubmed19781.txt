Colonoscopy has substantially evolved during the last 20 years and many different training techniques have been developed in order to improve the performance of endoscopists. The most known are mechanical simulators virtual reality simulators computer-simulating endoscopy magnetic endoscopic imaging and composite and explanted animal organ simulators. Current literature generally indicates that the use of simulators improves performance of endoscopists and enhances safety of patients especially during the initial phase of training. Moreover newer endoscopes and imaging techniques such as high-definition colonoscopes chromocolonoscopy with dyes spraying and third-eye retroscope have been incorporated in everyday practice offering better visualization of the colon and detection of polyps. Despite the abundance of these different technological features training devices are not widely used and no official guideline or specified training algorithm or technique for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy has been evolved. In this review we present the most important training methods currently available and evaluate these using existing literature. We also try to propose a training algorithm for novice endoscopists. Effective colonoscopy training techniques: strategies to improve patient outcomes.
