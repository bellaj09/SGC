Although elective surgical procedures in the United States have been suspended because of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic orthopaedic surgeons are being recruited to serve patients with COVID-19 in addition to providing orthopaedic acute care. Older individuals are deemed to be at higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. Although previous studies have shown a high proportion of older providers nationwide across medical specialties we are not aware of any previous study that has analyzed the age distribution among the orthopaedic workforce. Therefore the purposes of the present study were 1 to determine the geographic distribution of U.S. orthopaedic surgeons by age 2 to compare the distribution with other surgical specialties and 3 to compare this distribution with the spread of COVID-19.
