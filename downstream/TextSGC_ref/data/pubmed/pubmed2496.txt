Cortical folding is a hallmark of brain topography whose variability across individuals remains a puzzle. In this paper we call for an effort to improve our understanding of the pli de passage phenomenon namely annectant gyri buried in the depth of the main sulci. We suggest that plis de passage could become an interesting benchmark for models of the cortical folding process. As an illustration we speculate on the link between modern biological models of cortical folding and the development of the Pli de Passage Frontal Moyen\xa0PPFM in the middle of the central sulcus. For this purpose we have detected nine interrupted central sulci in the Human Connectome Project dataset which are used to explore the organization of the hand sensorimotor areas in this rare configuration of the PPFM.
