Brain-machine Interfaces BMI hold great potential for treating neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Technological progress is allowing for a shift from open-loop pacemaker-class intervention towards fully closed-loop neural control systems. Low power programmable processing systems are therefore required which can operate within the thermal window of 2 C for medical implants and maintain long battery life. In this work we developed a low power neural engine with an optimized set of algorithms which can operate under a power cycling domain. By integrating with custom designed brain implant chip we have demonstrated the operational applicability to the closed-loop modulating neural activities in in-vitro brain tissues: the local field potentials can be modulated at required central frequency ranges. Also both a freely-moving non-human primate 24-hour and a rodent 1-hour in-vivo experiments were performed to show system long-term recording performance. The overall system consumes only 2.93mA during operation with a biological recording frequency 50Hz sampling rate the lifespan is approximately 56 hours. A library of algorithms has been implemented in terms of detection suppression and optical intervention to allow for exploratory applications in different neurological disorders. Thermal experiments demonstrated that operation creates minimal heating as well as battery performance exceeding 24 hours on a freely moving rodent. Therefore this technology shows great capabilities for both neuroscience in-vitro/in-vivo applications and medical implantable processing units.
