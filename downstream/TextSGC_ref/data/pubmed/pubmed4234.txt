The human cerebral cortex is highly convoluted as convex gyri and concave sulci. In the past decades extensive studies have consistently revealed substantial differences between gyri and sulci in terms of genetics anatomy morphology axonal fiber connections and function. Although interesting findings have been reported to date to elucidate the functional difference between gyri and sulci the temporal variability of functional activity which could explain individual differences in learning and higher-order cognitive functions and as well as differences in gyri and sulci remains to be explored. The present study explored the temporal variability of cortical gyral-sulcal resting state functional activity and its association with fluid intelligence measures on the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that the temporal variance of resting state fMRI BOLD signal was significantly larger in gyri than in sulci. We also found that the temporal variability of certain regions including middle frontal cortex inferior parietal lobe and visual cortex was positively associated with fluid intelligence. Moreover those regions were predominately located in gyri rather than in sulci. This study reports initial evidence for temporal variability difference of functional activity between gyri and sulci and its association with fluid intelligence measures and thus provides novel insights to understand the mechanism and functional relevance of gyri and sulci. Temporal Variability of Cortical Gyral-Sulcal Resting State Functional Activity Correlates With Fluid Intelligence.
