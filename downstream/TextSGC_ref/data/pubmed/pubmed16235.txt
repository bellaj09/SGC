Three- to 6-month-old lurcher mutant mice +/lc which exhibit a massive loss of neurons in the cerebellar cortex and in the inferior olivary nucleus but whose deep cerebellar nuclei are essentially intact were trained daily for 9 days to maintain their equilibrium upon a rota rod rotating at 20 or 30 revolutions per minute rpm. Their scores were measured and their behavior upon the rotating rod quantified in comparison to those of matched control +/+ mice. Lurcher mice were able to learn to maintain their equilibrium efficiently when rotated at 20 rpm but were not when rotated at 30 rpm. After cerebellectomy the equilibrium capabilities of the animals were much altered especially in +/lc. These results show that the deep cerebellar nuclei are sufficient for motor learning provided the task is not too difficult 20 rpm but that the cerebellar cortex is required when the task is more difficult 30 rpm. Therefore it can be concluded that the adaptive motor capabilities of lurcher mice are less developed than those of control animals.
