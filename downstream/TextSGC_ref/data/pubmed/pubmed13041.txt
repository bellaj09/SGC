"Many tasks involve the fine manipulation of objects despite limited visual feedback. In such scenarios tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable transparent and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robots pinch grasp. A Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit C-MAB reinforcement learning algorithm was implemented to maximize cumulative rewards by balancing exploration versus exploitation of the state-action space. The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours wire rope. Importantly this work contributes to the development of reinforcement learning approaches that account for limited resources such as hardware life and researcher time. As robots are used to perform complex physically interactive tasks in unstructured or unmodeled environments it becomes important to develop methods that enable efficient and effective learning with physical testbeds."
