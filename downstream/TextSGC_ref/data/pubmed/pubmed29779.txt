Canonical correlation analysis CCA has been successfully applied to steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP recognition for brain-computer interface BCI application. Although the CCA method outperforms the traditional power spectral density analysis through multi-channel detection it requires additionally pre-constructed reference signals of sine-cosine waves. It is likely to encounter overfitting in using a short time window since the reference signals include no features from training data.
