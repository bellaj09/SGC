Accurate detection and segmentation of organs at risks OARs in CT image is the key step for efficient planning of radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC treatment. We develop a fully automated deep-learning-based method termed organs-at-risk detection and segmentation network ODS net on CT images and investigate ODS net performance in automated detection and segmentation of OARs. Deep-learning-based detection and segmentation of organs at risk in nasopharyngeal carcinoma computed tomographic images for radiotherapy planning.
