Aneurysm size correlates with rupture risk and is important for treatment planning. User annotation of aneurysm size is slow and tedious particularly for large data sets. Geometric shortcuts to compute size have been shown to be inaccurate particularly for nonstandard aneurysm geometries. To develop and train a convolutional neural network CNN to detect and measure cerebral aneurysms from magnetic resonance angiography MRA automatically and without geometric shortcuts. In step 1 a CNN based on the U-net architecture was trained on 250 MRA maximum intensity projection MIP images then applied to a testing set. In step 2 the trained CNN was applied to a separate set of 14 basilar tip aneurysms for size prediction. Step 1-the CNN successfully identified aneurysms in 85/86 98.8% of testing set cases with a receiver operating characteristic ROC area-under-the-curve of 0.87. Step 2-automated basilar tip aneurysm linear size differed from radiologist-traced aneurysm size on average by 2.01\xa0mm or 30%. The CNN aneurysm area differed from radiologist-derived area on average by 8.1\xa0mm2 or 27%. CNN correctly predicted the area trend for the set of aneurysms. This approach is to our knowledge the first using CNNs to derive aneurysm size. In particular we demonstrate the clinically pertinent application of computing maximal aneurysm one-dimensional size and two-dimensional area. We propose that future work can apply this to facilitate pre-treatment planning and possibly identify previously missed aneurysms in retrospective assessment.
