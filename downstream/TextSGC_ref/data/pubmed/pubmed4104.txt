"Advances in neuroimaging have provided a tremendous amount of in-vivo information on the brains organisation. Its anatomy and cortical organisation can be investigated from the point of view of several imaging modalities many of which have been studied for mapping functionally specialised cortical areas. There is strong evidence that a single modality is not sufficient to fully identify the brains cortical organisation. Combining multiple modalities in the same parcellation task has the potential to provide more accurate and robust subdivisions of the cortex. Nonetheless existing brain parcellation methods are typically developed and tested on single modalities using a specific type of information. In this paper we propose Graph-based Multi-modal Parcellation GraMPa an iterative framework designed to handle the large variety of available input modalities to tackle the multi-modal parcellation task. At each iteration we compute a set of parcellations from different modalities and fuse them based on their local reliabilities. The fused parcellation is used to initialise the next iteration forcing the parcellations to converge towards a set of mutually informed modality specific parcellations where correspondences are established. We explore two different multi-modal configurations for group-wise parcellation using resting-state fMRI diffusion MRI tractography myelin maps and task fMRI. Quantitative and qualitative results on the Human Connectome Project database show that integrating multi-modal information yields a stronger agreement with well established atlases and more robust connectivity networks that provide a better representation of the population."
