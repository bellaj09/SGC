This paper presents the recognition for WHO classification of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ALL subtypes. The two ALL subtypes considered are T-lymphoblastic leukaemia pre-T and B-lymphoblastic leukaemia pre-B. They exhibit various characteristics which make it difficult to distinguish between subtypes from their mature cells lymphocytes. In a common approach handcrafted features must be well designed for this complex domain-specific problem. With deep learning approach handcrafted feature engineering can be eliminated because a deep learning method can automate this task through the multilayer architecture of a convolutional neural network CNN. In this work we implement a CNN classifier to explore the feasibility of deep learning approach to identify lymphocytes and ALL subtypes and this approach is benchmarked against a dominant approach of support vector machines SVMs applying handcrafted feature engineering. Additionally two traditional machine learning classifiers multilayer perceptron MLP and random forest are also applied for the comparison. The experiments show that our CNN classifier delivers better performance to identify normal lymphocytes and pre-B cells. This shows a great potential for image classification with no requirement of multiple preprocessing steps from feature engineering.
