"For severely paralyzed people a brain-computer interface BCI provides a way of re-establishing communication. Although subjects with muscular dystrophy MD appear to be potential BCI users the actual long-term effects of BCI use on brain activities in MD subjects have yet to be clarified. To investigate these effects we followed BCI use by a chronic tetraplegic subject with MD over 5 months. The topographic changes in an electroencephalogram EEG after long-term use of the virtual reality VR-based BCI were also assessed. Our originally developed BCI system was used to classify an EEG recorded over the sensorimotor cortex in real time and estimate the users motor intention MI in 3 different limb movements: feet left hand and right hand. An avatar in the internet-based VR was controlled in accordance with the results of the EEG classification by the BCI. The subject was trained to control his avatar via the BCI by strolling in the VR for 1 hour a day and then continued the same training twice a month at his home."
