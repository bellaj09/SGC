Over the last few decades the Internet has experienced tremendous growth in data traffic. This continuous growth due to the increase in the number of connected devices and platforms has dramatically boosted content consumption. However retrieving content from the servers of Content Providers CPs can increase network traffic and incur high network delay and congestion. To address these challenges we propose a joint deep learning and auction-based approach for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking NDN which aims to prevent congestion and minimize the content downloading delays. First using recorded network traffic data on the Internet Service Provider ISP network we propose a deep learning model to predict future traffic over transit links. Second to prevent congestion and avoid high latency on transit links which may experience congestion in the future; we propose a caching model that helps the ISP to cache content that has a high predicted future demand. Paid-content requires payment to be downloaded and cached. Therefore we propose an auction mechanism to obtain paid-content at an optimal price. The simulation results show that our proposal prevents congestion and increases the profits of both ISPs and CPs.
