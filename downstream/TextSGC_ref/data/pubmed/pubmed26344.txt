Motor imagery is a common control strategy in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. However voluntary control of sensorimotor SMR rhythms by imagining a movement can be skilful and unintuitive and usually requires a varying amount of user training. To boost the training process a whole class of BCI systems have been proposed providing feedback as early as possible while continuously adapting the underlying classifier model. The present work describes a cue-paced EEG-based BCI system using motor imagery that falls within the category of the previously mentioned ones. Specifically our adaptive strategy includes a simple scheme based on a common spatial pattern CSP method and support vector machine SVM classification. The system\s efficacy was proved by online testing on 10 healthy participants. In addition we suggest some features we implemented to improve a system\s "flexibility" and "customizability" namely i a flexible training session ii an unbalancing in the training conditions and iii the use of adaptive thresholds when giving feedback.
