Depression affects large number of people across the world today and it is considered as the global problem. It is a mood disorder which can be detected using electroencephalogram EEG signals. The manual detection of depression by analyzing the EEG signals requires lot of experience tedious and time consuming. Hence a fully automated depression diagnosis system developed using EEG signals will help the clinicians. Therefore we propose a deep hybrid model developed using convolutional neural network CNN and long-short term memory LSTM architectures to detect depression using\xa0EEG signals. In the deep model temporal properties of the signals are learned with CNN layers and the sequence learning process is provided through the LSTM layers. In this work we have used EEG signals obtained from left and right hemispheres of the brain. Our work has provided 99.12% and 97.66% classification accuracies for the right and left hemisphere EEG signals respectively. Hence we can conclude that the developed CNN-LSTM model is accurate and fast in detecting the depression using EEG signals. It can be employed in psychiatry wards of the hospitals to detect the depression using EEG signals accurately and thus\xa0aid the psychiatrists.
