Little is currently known about dynamic brain networks involved in high-level cognition and their ontological basis. Here we develop a novel Variational Bayesian Hidden Markov Model VB-HMM to investigate dynamic temporal properties of interactions between salience SN default mode DMN and central executive CEN networks-three brain systems that play a critical role in human cognition. In contrast to conventional models VB-HMM revealed multiple short-lived states characterized by rapid switching and transient connectivity between SN CEN and DMN. Furthermore the three "static" networks occurred in a segregated state only intermittently. Findings were replicated in two adult cohorts from the Human Connectome Project. VB-HMM further revealed immature dynamic interactions between SN CEN and DMN in children characterized by higher mean lifetimes in individual states reduced switching probability between states and less differentiated connectivity across states. Our computational techniques provide new insights into human brain network dynamics and its maturation with development.
