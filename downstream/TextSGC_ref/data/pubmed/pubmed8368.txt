High Efficiency Video Coding HEVC significantly reduces bit-rates over the preceding H.264 standard but at the expense of extremely high encoding complexity. In HEVC the quad-tree partition of coding unit CU consumes a large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity due to the brute-force search for rate-distortion optimization RDO. Therefore this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra-and inter-modes which is based on convolutional neural network CNN and long-and short-term memory LSTM network. First we establish a large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for HEVC intra-and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second we represent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit CTU in the form of a hierarchical CU partition map HCPM. Then we propose an early-terminated hierarchical CNN ETH-CNN for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently the encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing the brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third an early-terminated hierarchical LSTM ETH-LSTM is proposed to learn the temporal correlation of the CU partition. Then we combine ETH-LSTM and ETH-CNN to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at inter-mode. Finally experimental results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra-and inter-modes.
