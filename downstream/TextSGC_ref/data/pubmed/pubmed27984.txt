"This paper describes an open access electroencephalography EEG data set for multitasking mental workload activity induced by a single-session simultaneous capacity SIMKAP experiment with 48 subjects. To validate the database EEG spectral activity was evaluated with EEGLAB and the significant channels and activities for the experiment are highlighted. Classification performance was evaluated by training a support vector regression model on selected features from neighborhood component analysis based on a nine-point workload rating scale. With a reduced feature dimension 69% classification accuracy was obtained for 3 identified workload levels from the rating scale with Cohens kappa of 0.46. Accurate discrimination of mental workload is a desirable outcome in the field of operator performance analysis and BCI development; thus we hope that our provided database and analyses can contribute to future investigations in this research field."
