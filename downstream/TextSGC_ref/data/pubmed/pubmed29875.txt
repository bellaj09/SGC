"Spatial covariance matrices are extensively employed as brain activity descriptors in brain computer interface BCI research that typically involve the whole array of sensors. Here we introduce a methodological framework for delineating the subset of sensors the covariance structure of which offers a reduced but more powerful representation of brains coordination patterns that ultimately leads to reliable mind reading."
