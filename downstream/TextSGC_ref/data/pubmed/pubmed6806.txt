"The neurophysiological processes underlying non-invasive brain activity measurements are incompletely understood. Here we developed a connectome-based brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and as a novelty driven by electroencephalography EEG source activity. Simulations not only predicted subjects individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of activity but more importantly they also revealed precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different scales and modalities: 1 resting-state fMRI oscillations 2 functional connectivity networks 3 excitation-inhibition balance 4 5 inverse relationships between -rhythms spike-firing and fMRI on short and long time scales and 6 fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies."
