Widespread use of neurosurgical endoscopy has been hampered by the necessity of looking up from the surgical field to view the endoscopic image on a video monitor. Here is demonstrated a simple lightweight headpiece with a small built-in video monitor that reflects the video image to the dominant eye thus allowing the operator to continuously observe the surgical field either via peripheral vision or via the non-dominant eye. Successful use of the device is documented here in a minimally invasive fenestration of an arachnoid cyst into the lateral ventricle via a flexible endoscopic procedure.
