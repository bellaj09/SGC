Anxiety is common in autistic adults and significantly limits everyday opportunities and quality of life. Evidence-based psychological therapies offered by mental health services often fail to meet the needs of autistic adults. The development of appropriate treatments for mental health conditions and in particular anxiety has been identified as a key priority by the autism community. The Personalised Anxiety Treatment-Autism PAT-A trial aims to address this need by investigating the feasibility and acceptability of delivering an individualised psychological treatment for anxiety experienced by autistic adults.
