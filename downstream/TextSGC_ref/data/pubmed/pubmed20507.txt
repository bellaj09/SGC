"Event-related potential ERP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs employ differences in brain responses to attended and ignored stimuli. Typically visual stimuli are used. Tactile stimuli have recently been suggested as a gaze-independent alternative. Bimodal stimuli could evoke additional brain activity due to multisensory integration which may be of use in BCIs. We investigated the effect of visual-tactile stimulus presentation on the chain of ERP components BCI performance classification accuracies and bitrates and participants task performance counting of targets. Ten participants were instructed to navigate a visual display by attending spatially to targets in sequences of either visual tactile or visual-tactile stimuli. We observe that attending to visual-tactile compared to either visual or tactile stimuli results in an enhanced early ERP component N1. This bimodal N1 may enhance BCI performance as suggested by a nonsignificant positive trend in offline classification accuracies. A late ERP component P300 is reduced when attending to visual-tactile compared to visual stimuli which is consistent with the nonsignificant negative trend of participants task performance. We discuss these findings in the light of affected spatial attention at high-level compared to low-level stimulus processing. Furthermore we evaluate bimodal BCIs from a practical perspective and for future applications." Does bimodal stimulus presentation increase ERP components usable in BCIs?
