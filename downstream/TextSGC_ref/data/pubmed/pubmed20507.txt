"Ultrasonography is a first-line imaging in the investigation of womens irregular bleeding and other gynaecological pathologies e.g. ovarian cysts and early pregnancy problems. However teaching ultrasound especially transvaginal scanning remains a challenge for health professionals. New technology such as simulation may potentially facilitate and expedite the process of learning ultrasound. Simulation may prove to be realistic very close to real patient scanning experience for the sonographer and objectively able to assist the development of basic skills such as image manipulation hand-eye coordination and examination technique."
