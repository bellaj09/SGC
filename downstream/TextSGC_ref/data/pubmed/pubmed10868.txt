Digital holographic microscopy enables the 3D reconstruction of volumetric samples from a single-snapshot hologram. However unlike a conventional bright-field microscopy image the quality of holographic reconstructions is compromised by interference fringes as a result of twin images and out-of-plane objects. Here we demonstrate that cross-modality deep learning using a generative adversarial network GAN can endow holographic images of a sample volume with bright-field microscopy contrast combining the volumetric imaging capability of holography with the speckle- and artifact-free image contrast of incoherent bright-field microscopy. We illustrate the performance of this "bright-field holography" method through the snapshot imaging of bioaerosols distributed in 3D matching the artifact-free image contrast and axial sectioning performance of a high-NA bright-field microscope. This data-driven deep-learning-based imaging method bridges the contrast gap between coherent and incoherent imaging and enables the snapshot 3D imaging of objects with bright-field contrast from a single hologram benefiting from the wave-propagation framework of holography. Bright-field holography: cross-modality deep learning enables snapshot 3D imaging with bright-field contrast using a single hologram.
