A novel coronavirus tentatively designated as 2019 Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 and which continues to expand. On February 11 2020 the World Health Organization WHO named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19. On February 28 WHO increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level. The COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.Computed tomography CT has been an important imaging modality in assisting in the diagnosis and management of patients withCOVID-19. Some retrospective imaging studies have reported chest CT findings of COVID-19 in the past 2 months suggesting that several CT findings may be characteristic. To our knowledge there has been no prospective multicentre imaging study of COVID-19 to date.We proposed a hypothesis: There are some specific CT features on Chest CT of COVID-19 patients. And the mechanism of these CT features is explicable based on pathological findings.
