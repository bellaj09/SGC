"Brain connectomics has expanded from histological assessment of axonal projection connectivity APC to encompass resting state functional connectivity RS-FC. RS-FC analyses are efficient for whole-brain mapping but attempts to explain aspects of RS-FC e.g. interhemispheric RS-FC based on APC have been only partially successful. Neuroimaging with hemoglobin alone lacks specificity for determining how activity in a population of cells contributes to RS-FC. Wide-field mapping of optogenetically defined connectivity could provide insights into the brains structure-function relationship. We combined optogenetics with optical intrinsic signal imaging to create an efficient optogenetic effective connectivity Opto-EC mapping assay. We examined EC patterns of excitatory neurons in awake Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice. These Thy1-based EC Thy1-EC patterns were evaluated against RS-FC over the cortex. Compared to RS-FC Thy1-EC exhibited increased spatial specificity reduced interhemispheric connectivity in regions with strong RS-FC and appreciable connection strength asymmetry. Comparing the topography of Thy1-EC and RS-FC patterns to maps of APC revealed that Thy1-EC more closely resembled APC than did RS-FC. The more general method of Opto-EC mapping with hemoglobin can be determined for 100 sites in single animals in under an hour and is amenable to other neuroimaging modalities. Opto-EC mapping represents a powerful strategy for examining evolving connectivity-related circuit plasticity." Effective Connectivity Measured Using Optogenetically Evoked Hemodynamic Signals Exhibits Topography Distinct from Resting State Functional Connectivity in the Mouse.
