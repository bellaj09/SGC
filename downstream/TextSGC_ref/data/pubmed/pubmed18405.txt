Computerized continuous performance tests CPTs are commonly used to characterize attention in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ADHD. Virtual classroom CPTs designed to enhance ecological validity are increasingly being utilized. Lacking is a quantitative meta-analysis of clinical comparisons of attention performance in children with ADHD using virtual classroom CPTs. The objective of the present systematic PRISMA review was to address this empirical void and compare three-dimensional 3D virtual classroom CPTs to traditional two-dimensional 2D CPTs. The peer-reviewed literature on comparisons of virtual classroom performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children was explored in six databases e.g. Medline. Published studies using a virtual classroom to compare attentional performance between children with ADHD and typically developing children were included. Given the high heterogeneity with modality comparisons i.e. computerized CPTs vs. virtual classroom CPTs for ADHD both main comparisons included only population comparisons i.e. control vs. ADHD using each CPT modality. Meta-analytic findings were generally consistent with previous meta-analyses of computerized CPTs regarding the commonly used omission commission and hit reaction time variables. Results suggest that the virtual classroom CPTs reliably differentiate attention performance in persons with ADHD. Ecological validity implications are discussed pertaining to subtle meta-analytic outcome differences compared to computerized 2D CPTs. Further due to an inability to conduct moderator analyses it remains unclear if modality differences are due to other factors. Suggestions for future research using the virtual classroom CPTs are provided.
