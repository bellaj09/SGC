This pilot study evaluated the acceptability and efficacy of an Internet-based virtual reality "world" for teen smoking cessation. Rural teens at six school sites interacted in real-time in the virtual world with a trained cessation counselor and other teen smokers over a 2-month period in seven 1-hour chat sessions. The cessation counselor used motivational interviewing a "client-centered" nonconfrontational approach to behavior change that has shown promise with behaviors resistant to change. Smoking behavior and attitudes were assessed at baseline after intervention and at 1-month follow-up. Significant changes were found in quitting amount smoked and intentions to quit. Positive trends were seen in past-week abstinence rates quit attempts and attitudes toward quitting. Pilot test of an Internet virtual world chat room for rural teen smokers.
