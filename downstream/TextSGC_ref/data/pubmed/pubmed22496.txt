This study reports on the effect of fatigue on Urology residents using the daVinci surgical skills simulator dVSS. Seven Urology residents performed a series of selected exercises on the dVSS while pre-call and post-call. Prior to dVSS performance a survey of subjective fatigue was taken and residents were tested with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS. Using the metrics available in the dVSS software the performance of each resident was evaluated. The Urology residents slept an average of 4.07\xa0h range 2.5-6\xa0h while on call compared to an average of 5.43\xa0h while not on call range 3-7\xa0h p\xa0=\xa00.08. Post-call residents were significantly more likely to be identified as fatigued by the Epworth Sleepiness Score than pre-call residents p\xa0=\xa00.01. Significant differences were observed in fatigued residents performing the exercises Tubes and Match Board 2 p\xa0=\xa00.05 0.02. Additionally there were significant differences in the total number of critical errors during the training session 9.29 vs. 3.14 p\xa0=\xa00.04. Fatigue in post-call Urology residents leads to poorer performance on the dVSS simulator. The dVSS may become a useful instrument in the education of fatigued residents and a tool to identify fatigue in trainees. The effects of fatigue on robotic surgical skill training in Urology residents.
