Artificial neural networks were recently shown to be an efficient representation of highly entangled many-body quantum states. In practical applications neural-network states inherit numerical schemes used in variational Monte\xa0Carlo method most notably the use of Markov-chain Monte\xa0Carlo MCMC sampling to estimate quantum expectations. The local stochastic sampling in MCMC caps the potential advantages of neural networks in two ways: i\xa0Its intrinsic computational cost sets stringent practical limits on the width and depth of the networks and therefore limits their expressive capacity; ii\xa0its difficulty in generating precise and uncorrelated samples can result in estimations of observables that are very far from their true value. Inspired by the state-of-the-art generative models used in machine learning we propose a specialized neural-network architecture that supports efficient and exact sampling completely circumventing the need for Markov-chain sampling. We demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional interacting spin models showcasing the ability to obtain accurate results on larger system sizes than those currently accessible to neural-network quantum states.
