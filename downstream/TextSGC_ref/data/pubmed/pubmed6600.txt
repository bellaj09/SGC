Prostate cancer PCa is a major health concern in aging males and proper management of the disease depends on accurately interpreting pathology specimens. However reading prostatectomy histopathology slides which is basically for staging is usually time consuming and differs from reading small biopsy specimens which is mainly used for diagnosis. Generally each prostatectomy specimen generates tens of large tissue sections and for each section the malignant region needs to be delineated to assess the amount of tumor and its burden. With the aim of reducing the workload of pathologists in this study we focus on developing a computer-aided diagnosis CAD system based on a densely connected convolutional neural network DenseNet for whole-slide histopathology images to outline the malignant regions. A computer-aided diagnosis system for differentiation and delineation of malignant regions on whole-slide prostate histopathology image using spatial statistics and multidimensional DenseNet.
