The human cerebral cortex is estimated to comprise 200-300 distinct functional regions per hemisphere. Identification of the precise anatomical location of an individual\s unique set of functional regions is a challenge for neuroscience that has broad scientific and clinical utility. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of four interleaved regions in lateral frontal cortex LFC that are part of broader visual attention and auditory attention networks Michalka et\xa0al. 2015; Noyce et\xa0al. 2017; Tobyne et\xa0al. 2017. Due to a large degree of inter-subject anatomical variability identification of these regions depends critically on within-subject analyses. Here we demonstrate that for both sexes an individual\s unique pattern of resting-state functional connectivity can accurately identify their specific pattern of visual- and auditory-selective working memory and attention task activation in lateral frontal cortex LFC using "connectome fingerprinting." Building on prior techniques Saygin et\xa0al. 2011; Osher et\xa0al. 2016; Tavor et\xa0al. 2016; Smittenaar et\xa0al. 2017; Wang et\xa0al. 2017; Parker Jones et\xa0al. 2017 we demonstrate here that connectome fingerprint predictions are far more accurate than group-average predictions and match the accuracy of within-subject task-based functional localization while requiring less data. These findings are robust across brain parcellations and are improved with penalized regression methods. Because resting-state data can be easily and rapidly collected these results have broad implications for both clinical and research investigations of frontal lobe function. Our findings also provide a set of recommendations for future research. "Prediction of individualized task activation in sensory modality-selective frontal cortex with connectome fingerprinting."
