"Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy R-fNIRS is an active area of interest and is currently attracting considerable attention as a new imaging tool for the study of resting-state brain function. Using variations in hemodynamic concentration signals R-fNIRS measures the brains low-frequency spontaneous neural activity combining the advantages of portability low-cost high temporal sampling rate and less physical burden to participants. The temporal synchronization of spontaneous neuronal activity in anatomically separated regions is referred to as resting-state functional connectivity RSFC. In the past several years an increasing body of R-fNIRS RSFC studies has led to many important findings about functional integration among local or whole-brain regions by measuring inter-regional temporal synchronization. Here we summarize recent advances made in the R-fNIRS RSFC methodologies from the detection of RSFC e.g. seed-based correlation analysis independent component analysis whole-brain correlation analysis and graph-theoretical topological analysis to the assessment of RSFC performance e.g. reliability repeatability and validity to the application of RSFC in studying normal development and brain disorders. The literature reviewed here suggests that RSFC analyses based on R-fNIRS data are valid and reliable for the study of brain function in healthy and diseased populations thus providing a promising imaging tool for cognitive science and clinics."
