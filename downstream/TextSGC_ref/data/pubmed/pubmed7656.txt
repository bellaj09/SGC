Three-dimensional culture systems that allow generation of monolayered epithelial cell spheroids are widely used to study epithelial function in vitro. Epithelial spheroid formation is applied to address cellular consequences of mono-genetic disorders that is ciliopathies in toxicity testing or to develop treatment options aimed to restore proper epithelial cell characteristics and function. With the potential of a high-throughput method the main obstacle to efficient application of the spheroid formation assay so far is the laborious time-consuming and bias-prone analysis of spheroid images by individuals. Hundredths of multidimensional fluorescence images are blinded rated by three persons and subsequently differences in ratings are compared and discussed. Here we apply supervised learning and compare strategies based on machine learning versus deep learning. While deep learning approaches can directly process raw image data machine learning requires transformed data of features extracted from fluorescence images. We verify the accuracy of both strategies on a validation data set analyse an experimental data set and observe that different strategies can be very accurate. Deep learning however is less sensitive to overfitting and experimental batch-to-batch variations thus providing a rather powerful and easily adjustable classification tool.
