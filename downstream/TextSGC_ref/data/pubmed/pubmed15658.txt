"We investigated the temporal dynamics of students cognitive-affective states confusion frustration boredom engagement/flow delight and surprise during deep learning activities. After a learning session with an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue the cognitive-affective states of the learner were classified by the learner a peer and two trained judges at approximately 100 points in the tutorial session. Decay rates for the cognitive-affective states were estimated by fitting exponential curves to time series of affect responses. The results partially confirmed predictions of goal-appraisal theories of emotion by supporting a tripartite classification of the states along a temporal dimension: persistent states boredom engagement/flow and confusion transitory states delight and surprise and an intermediate state frustration. Patterns of decay rates were generally consistent across affect judges except that a reversed actor-observer effect was discovered for engagement/flow and frustration. Correlations between decay rates of the cognitive-affective states and several learning measures confirmed the major predictions and uncovered some novel findings that have implications for theories of pedagogy that integrate cognition and affect during deep learning."
