Heart failure HF is a type of cardiovascular disease caused by abnormal cardiac structure and function. Early screening of HF has important implication for treatment in a timely manner. Heart sound HS conveys relevant information related to HF; this study is therefore based on the analysis of HS signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of normal HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction automatically. Gated recurrent unit-based heart sound analysis for heart failure screening.
