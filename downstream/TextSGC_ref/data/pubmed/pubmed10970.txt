Copy number variations CNVs play an important role in many types of cancer. With the rapid development of next generation sequencing NGS techniques many methods for detecting CNVs of a single sample have emerged: i require genome-wide data of both case and control samples ii depend on sequencing depth and GC content correction algorithm iii rely on statistical models built on CNV positive and negative sample datasets. These make them costly in the data analysis and ineffective in the targeted sequencing data. In this study we developed a novel alignment-free method called DL-CNV to call CNV from the target sequencing data of a single sample. Specifically we collected two sets of samples. The first set consists of 1301 samples in which 272 have CNVs in ERBB2 and the second set is composed of 1148 samples with 63 samples containing CNVs in MET. Finally we found that a testing AUC of 0.9454 for ERBB2 and 0.9220 for MET. Furthermore we hope to make the CNV detection could be more accurate with clinical "gold standard" e.g. FISH information and provide a new research direction which can be used as the supplement to the existing NGS methods.
