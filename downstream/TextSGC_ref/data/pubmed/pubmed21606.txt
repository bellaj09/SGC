P300-speller is one of the most popular EEG-based spelling systems proposed by Farwell and Donchin. P300-speller has a 6  6 character matrix and requires at least 12 flashes to input one character. This restricts increasing of the information transfer rate ITR by decreasing the number of flashes. In this paper a novel spelling system is proposed to reduce the number of flashes by sequential stimulation of images. In order to determine the command the proposed system utilizes two kinds of the event-related brain potentials ERP N100 and P300 whereas P300-speller utilizes only P300. Thanks to using both N100 and P300 the proposed system achieves higher accuracy and faster spelling speed than P300-speller. Our experiment by ten subjects showed that ITR of the proposed system is an average of 0.25 bit/sec improved compared to P300-speller. A novel EEG-based spelling system using N100 and P300.
