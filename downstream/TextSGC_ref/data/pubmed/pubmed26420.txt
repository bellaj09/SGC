In this paper we present the design fabrication and evaluation of a soft wearable robotic glove which can be used with functional Magnetic Resonance imaging fMRI during the hand rehabilitation and task specific training. The soft wearable robotic glove called MR-Glove consists of two major components: a a set of soft pneumatic actuators and b a glove. The soft pneumatic actuators which are made of silicone elastomers generate bending motion and actuate finger joints upon pressurization. The device is MR-compatible as it contains no ferromagnetic materials and operates pneumatically. Our results show that the device did not cause artifacts to fMRI images during hand rehabilitation and task-specific exercises. This study demonstrated the possibility of using fMRI and MR-compatible soft wearable robotic device to study brain activities and motor performances during hand rehabilitation and to unravel the functional effects of rehabilitation robotics on brain stimulation.
