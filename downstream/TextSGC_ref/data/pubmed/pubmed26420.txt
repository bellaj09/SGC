Closed-loop neuroprosthetics aim to compensate for lost function e.g. by controlling external devices such as prostheses or wheelchairs. Such assistive approaches seek to maximize speed and classification accuracy for high-dimensional control. More recent approaches use similar technology but aim to restore lost motor function in the long term. To achieve this goal restorative neuroprosthetics attempt to facilitate motor re-learning and to strengthen damaged and/or alternative neural connections on the basis of neurofeedback training within rehabilitative environments. Such a restorative approach requires reinforcement learning of self-modulated brain activity which is considered to be beneficial for functional rehabilitation e.g. improvement of -power modulation over sensorimotor areas for post-stroke movement restoration. Patients with motor impairments however may also have a compromised ability for motor task-related regulation of the targeted brain activity. This would affect the estimation of feature weights and hence the classification accuracy of the feedback device. This in turn can frustrate the patients and compromise their motor learning. Furthermore the feedback training may even become erroneous when unconstrained classifier adaptation-which is often used in assistive approaches-is also applied in this rehabilitation context. In conclusion the conceptual switch from assistance toward restoration necessitates a methodological paradigm shift from classification accuracy toward instructional efficiency. Furthermore a constrained feature space a priori regularized feature weights and difficulty adaptation present key elements of restorative brain interfaces. These factors need therefore to be addressed within a therapeutic framework to facilitate reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation for restorative purposes.
