Blockade of the human ether--go-go-related gene hERG channel by small molecules induces the prolongation of the QT interval which leads to fatal cardiotoxicity and accounts for the withdrawal or severe restrictions on the use of many approved drugs. In this study we develop a deep learning approach termed deephERG for prediction of hERG blockers of small molecules in drug discovery and postmarketing surveillance. In total we assemble 7889 compounds with well-defined experimental data on the hERG and with diverse chemical structures. We find that deephERG models built by a multitask deep neural network DNN algorithm outperform those built by single-task DNN nave Bayes NB support vector machine SVM random forest RF and graph convolutional neural network GCNN. Specifically the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC value for the best model of deephERG is 0.967 on the validation set. Furthermore based on 1824 U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved drugs 29.6% drugs are computationally identified to have potential hERG inhibitory activities by deephERG highlighting the importance of hERG risk assessment in early drug discovery. Finally we showcase several novel predicted hERG blockers on approved antineoplastic agents which are validated by clinical case reports experimental evidence and the literature. In summary this study presents a powerful deep learning-based tool for risk assessment of hERG-mediated cardiotoxicities in drug discovery and postmarketing surveillance.
