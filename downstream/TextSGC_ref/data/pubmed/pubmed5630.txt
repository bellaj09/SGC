"Stroke causes focal brain lesions that disrupt functional connectivity FC a measure of activity synchronization throughout distributed brain networks. It is often assumed that FC disruptions reflect damage to specific cortical regions. However an alternative explanation is that they reflect the structural disconnection SDC of white matter pathways. Here we compare these explanations using data from 114 stroke patients. Across multiple analyses we find that SDC measures outperform focal damage measures including damage to putative critical cortical regions for explaining FC disruptions associated with stroke. We also identify a core mode of structure-function covariation that links the severity of interhemispheric SDCs to widespread FC disruptions across patients and that correlates with deficits in multiple behavioral domains. We conclude that a lesions impact on the structural connectome is what determines its impact on FC and that interhemispheric SDCs may play a particularly important role in mediating FC disruptions after stroke."
