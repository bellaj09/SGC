As a hot research topic in the field of psychology and psychiatry trait optimism reflects the tendency to expect positive outcomes in the future. Consistent evidence has demonstrated the role of trait optimism in reducing anxiety among different populations. However less is known about the neural bases of trait optimism and the underlying mechanisms for how trait optimism protects against anxiety in the healthy brain. In this investigation we examined these issues in 231 healthy adolescent students by assessing resting-state brain activity i.e. fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations fALFF and connectivity i.e. resting-state functional connectivity RSFC. Whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of trait optimism were linked with decreased fALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex OFC and increased RSFC between the right OFC and left supplementary motor cortex SMC. Mediation analyses further showed that trait optimism mediated the influence of the right OFC activity and the OFC-SMC connectivity on anxiety. Our results remained significant even after excluding the impact of head motion positive and negative affect and depression. Taken together this study reveals that fALFF and RSFC are functional neural markers of trait optimism and provides a brain-personality-symptom pathway for protection against anxiety in which fALFF and RSFC affect anxiety through trait optimism.
