Preliminaries convolutional neural network CNN applications have recently emerged in structural health monitoring SHM systems focusing mostly on vibration analysis. However the SHM literature shows clearly that there is a lack of application regarding the combination of PZT-lead zirconate titanate based method and CNN. Likewise applications using CNN along with the electromechanical impedance EMI technique applied to SHM systems are rare. To encourage this combination an innovative SHM solution through the combination of the EMI-PZT and CNN is presented here. To accomplish this the EMI signature is split into several parts followed by computing the Euclidean distances among them to form a RGB red green and blue frame. As a result we introduce a dataset formed from the EMI-PZT signals of 720 frames encompassing a total of four types of structural conditions for each PZT. In a case study the CNN-based method was experimentally evaluated using three PZTs glued onto an aluminum plate. The results reveal an effective pattern classification; yielding a 100% hit rate which outperforms other SHM approaches. Furthermore the method needs only a small dataset for training the CNN providing several advantages for industrial applications.
