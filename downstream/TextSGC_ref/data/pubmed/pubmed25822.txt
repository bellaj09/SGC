"We have been examining the potential value of a VR system for the palliative care of cancer. We recently developed palliative care system which consists of a 100-inch-wide screen HMD Head-mounted display and 8-mm video or a PC. Our goal is to use VR techniques to help alleviate a patients stress and concern regarding their cancer during hospitalization. We can use this system to present 1 personal video movies 2 video letters from friends and family 3 personal video instruction about medical examinations and 4 interactive information about their cancer using a PC-based VR system. Our preliminary results indicate that interesting VR presentations are useful for reducing stress." Virtual reality support system in palliative medicine.
