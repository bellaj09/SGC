The neural interface is a key component in wireless brain-computer prostheses. In this study we demonstrate that a unique three-dimensional 3D microneedle electrode on a flexible mesh substrate which can be fabricated without complicated micromachining techniques is conformal to the tissues with minimal invasiveness. Furthermore we demonstrate that it can be applied to different functional layers in the nervous system without length limitation. The microneedle electrode is fabricated using drawing lithography technology from biocompatible materials. In this approach the profile of a 3D microneedle electrode array is determined by the design of a two-dimensional 2D pattern on the mask which can be used to access different functional layers in different locations of the brain. Due to the sufficient stiffness of the electrode and the excellent flexibility of the mesh substrate the electrode can penetrate into the tissue with its bottom layer fully conformal to the curved brain surface. Then the exposed contact at the end of the microneedle electrode can successfully acquire neural signals from the brain.
