Sequencing and timing of body movements are essential to perform motoric tasks. In this study we investigate the temporal relation between cortical oscillations and human motor behavior i.e. rhythmic finger movements. High-density EEG recordings were used for source imaging based on individual anatomy. We separated sustained and movement phase-related EEG source amplitudes based on the actual finger movements recorded by a data glove. Sustained amplitude modulations in the contralateral hand area show decrease for  10-12 Hz and  18-24 Hz but increase for high  60-80 Hz frequencies during the entire movement period. Additionally we found movement phase-related amplitudes which resembled the flexion and extension sequence of the fingers. Especially for faster movement cadences movement phase-related amplitudes included high  24-30 Hz frequencies in prefrontal areas. Interestingly the spectral profiles and source patterns of movement phase-related amplitudes differed from sustained activities suggesting that they represent different frequency-specific large-scale networks. First networks were signified by the sustained element which statically modulate their synchrony levels during continuous movements. These networks may upregulate neuronal excitability in brain regions specific to the limb in this study the right hand area. Second movement phase-related networks which modulate their synchrony in relation to the movement sequence. We suggest that these frequency-specific networks are associated with distinct functions including top-down control sensorimotor prediction and integration. The separation of different large-scale networks we applied in this work improves the interpretation of EEG sources in relation to human motor behavior.
