In the study of the scalp electroencephalogramEEG-based brain-computer interfaceBCIindividual differences and complex background noise are two main factors which affect the stability of BCI system.For different subjectsthereforeoptimization of BCI system parameters is necessaryincluding the optimal designing of temporal and spatial filters parameters as well as the classifier parameters.In order to improve the accuracy of BCI systemthis paper proposes a new BCI information processing methodwhich combines the optimization design of independent component analysis spatial filterICA-SFwith the multiple sub-band features of EEG signals.The four subjects three-class motor imagery EEGMI-EEGdata collected in different periods were analyzed with the proposed method.Experimental results revealed thatduring the inner and outer cross-validation of single subject as well as the subject-to-subject validationthe proposed multiple sub-band method always had higher average classification accuracy compared to those with single-band methodand the maximum difference could achieve 6.08% and5.15%respectively.
