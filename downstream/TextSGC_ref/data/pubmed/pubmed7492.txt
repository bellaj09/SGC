Magnetic resonance imaging MRI offers the most detailed brain structure image available today; it can identify tiny lesions or cerebral cortical abnormalities. The primary purpose of the procedure is to confirm whether there is structural variation that causes epilepsy such as hippocampal sclerotherapy local cerebral cortical dysplasia and cavernous hemangioma. Cerebrovascular disease the second most common factor of death in the world is also the fourth leading cause of death in Taiwan with cerebrovascular disease having the highest rate of stroke. Among the most common are large vascular atherosclerotic lesions small vascular lesions and cardiac emboli. The purpose of this thesis is to establish a computer-aided diagnosis system based on small blood vessel lesions in MRI images using the method of Convolutional Neural Network and deep learning to analyze brain vascular occlusion by analyzing brain MRI images. Blocks can help clinicians more quickly determine the probability and severity of stroke in patients. We analyzed MRI data from 50 patients including 30 patients with stroke 17 patients with occlusion but no stroke and 3 patients with dementia. This system mainly helps doctors find out whether there are cerebral small vessel lesions in the brain MRI images and to output the found results into labeled images. The marked contents include the position coordinates of the small blood vessel blockage the block range the area size and if it may cause a stroke. Finally all the MRI images of the patient are synthesized showing a 3D display of the small blood vessels in the brain to assist the doctor in making a diagnosis or to provide accurate lesion location for the patient.
