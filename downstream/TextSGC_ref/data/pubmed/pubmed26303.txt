Using brain-computer interfaces BCI humans can select letters or other targets on a computer screen without any muscular involvement. An intensively investigated kind of BCI is based on the recording of visual event-related brain potentials ERP. However some severely paralyzed patients who need a BCI for communication have impaired vision or lack control of gaze movement thus making a BCI depending on visual input no longer feasible. In an effort to render the ERP-BCI usable for this group of patients the ERP-BCI was adapted to auditory stimulation. Letters of the alphabet were assigned to cells in a 5 x 5 matrix. Rows of the matrix were coded with numbers 1 to 5 and columns with numbers 6 to 10 and the numbers were presented auditorily. To select a letter users had to first select the row and then the column containing the desired letter. Four severely paralyzed patients in the end-stage of a neurodegenerative disease were examined. All patients performed above chance level. Spelling accuracy was significantly lower with the auditory system as compared with a similar visual system. Patients reported difficulties in concentrating on the task when presented with the auditory system. In future studies the auditory ERP-BCI should be adjusted by taking into consideration specific features of severely paralyzed patients such as reduced attention span. This adjustment in combination with more intensive training will show whether an auditory ERP-BCI can become an option for visually impaired patients.
