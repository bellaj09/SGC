The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of interactive video games on functional balance and mobility in poststroke individuals. The Health Science databases accessed included Medline via PubMed LILACS SciELO and PEDro. The inclusion criteria were as follows: clinical studies evaluating the use of interactive video games as a treatment to improve functional balance and mobility in individuals poststroke and studies published in the Brazilian Portuguese English or Spanish language between 2005 and April 2016. PEDro Scale was used to analyze the methodological quality of the studies. The Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test TUGT data were evaluated using a meta-analysis the publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and the heterogeneity of the studies by I 2 statistic. Eleven studies were included in the final analysis. Functional balance improved in individuals treated using interactive video games mean difference = 2.24 95% confidence interval 0.45 4.04 p = .01 but no improvement was observed in mobility as measured by TUGT. The studies presented low heterogeneity 24%. The mean score on the PEDro Scale was 6.2  1.9. Interactive video games were effective in improving functional balance but did not influence the mobility of individuals poststroke.
