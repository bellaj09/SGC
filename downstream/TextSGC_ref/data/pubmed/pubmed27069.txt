This paper aims to solve automated feature selection problem in brain computer interface BCI. In order to automate feature selection process we proposed a novel EEG feature selection method based on decision tree DT. During the electroencephalogram EEG signal processing a feature extraction method based on principle component analysis PCA was used and the selection process based on decision tree was performed by searching the feature space and automatically selecting optimal features. Considering that EEG signals are a series of non-linear signals a generalized linear classifier named support vector machine SVM was chosen. In order to test the validity of the proposed method we applied the EEG feature selection method based on decision tree to BCI Competition II datasets Ia and the experiment showed encouraging results.
