Virtual reality VR head-mounted displays are an attractive technology for viewing intrasurgical optical coherence tomography OCT volumes because they liberate surgeons from microscope oculars. We demonstrate real-time interactive viewing of OCT volumes in a commercial HTC Vive immersive VR system using previously reported ray casting techniques. Furthermore we show interactive manipulation and sectioning of volumes using handheld controllers and guidance of mock surgical procedures in porcine eyes exclusively within VR. To the best of our knowledge we report the first immersive VR-OCT viewer with stereo ray casting volumetric renders arbitrary sectioning planes and live acquisition support. We believe VR-OCT volume displays will advance ophthalmic surgery towards VR-integrated surgery. Real-time visualization and interaction with static and live optical coherence tomography volumes in immersive virtual reality.
