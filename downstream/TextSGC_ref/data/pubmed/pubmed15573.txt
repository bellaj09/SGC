"Excessive self-concern increases perceptions of threat and defensiveness. In contrast fostering a more inclusive and expanded sense of self can reduce stress and improve well-being. We developed and tested a novel brief intervention designed to strengthen a students compassionate self-identity an identity that values balance and growth by reminding them of four quiet ego characteristics: detached awareness inclusive identity perspective taking and growth. Students N = 32 in their first semester of college who reported greater self-protective e.g. defensive goals in the first 2 weeks of the semester were invited to participate in the study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: quiet ego contemplation QEC QEC with virtual reality VR headset QEC-VR and control. Participants came to the lab three times to engage in a 15-min exercise in a 30-days period. The 15-min QEC briefly described each quiet ego characteristic followed by a few minutes time to reflect on what that characteristic meant to them. Those in the QEC condition reported improved quiet ego characteristics and pluralistic thinking decreases in a urinary marker of oxidative stress and reduced mind-wandering on a cognitive task. Contrary to expectation participants who wore the VR headsets while listening to the QEC demonstrated the least improvement. Results suggest that a brief intervention that reduces self-focus and strengthens a more compassionate self-view may offer an additional resource that individuals can use in their everyday lives." Brief quiet ego contemplation reduces oxidative stress and mind-wandering.
