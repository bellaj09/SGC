Coleoid cephalopods show remarkable evolutionary convergence with vertebrates in their neural organization including 1 eyes and visual system with optic lobes 2 specialized parts of the brain controlling learning and memory such as vertical lobes and 3 unique vasculature supporting such complexity of the central nervous system. We performed deep sequencing of eye transcriptomes of pygmy squids Idiosepius paradoxus and chambered nautiluses Nautilus pompilius to decipher the molecular basis of convergent evolution in cephalopods. RNA-seq was complemented by in situ hybridization to localize the expression of selected genes. We found three types of genomic innovations in the evolution of complex brains: 1 recruitment of novel genes into morphogenetic pathways 2 recombination of various coding and regulatory regions of different genes often called "evolutionary tinkering" or "co-option" and 3 duplication and divergence of genes. Massive recruitment of novel genes occurred in the evolution of the "camera" eye from nautilus\ "pinhole" eye. We also showed that the type-2 co-option of transcription factors played important roles in the evolution of the lens and visual neurons. In summary the cephalopod convergent morphological evolution of the camera eyes was driven by a mosaic of all types of gene recruitments. In addition our analysis revealed unexpected variations of squids\ opsins retinochromes and arrestins providing more detailed information valuable for further research on intra-ocular and extra-ocular photoreception of the cephalopods.
