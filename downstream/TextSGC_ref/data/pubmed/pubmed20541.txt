Percutaneous renal access is an integral step in percutaneous renal drainage and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Urologists are increasingly obtaining access themselves as this eliminates reliance on a second "surgeon" and increases flexibility with respect to procedure timing and the location of the access tract. Surprisingly few models have been developed to train urologists in percutaneous renal access. Harvested porcine kidney/ureter units mounted so they can be viewed radiographically and accessed by needle puncture through material simulating the human flank have been incorporated into two models. The PERC Mentor Simbionix; Lod Israel is a virtual-reality simulator developed specifically for training in percutaneous renal puncture. Hands-on intraoperative training continues to be the primary method for learning percutaneous renal access. However bench model and simulator-based education offer a useful adjunct.
