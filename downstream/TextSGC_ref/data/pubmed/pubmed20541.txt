"We report a new type of brain-machine interface enabling a human operator to control nanometer-size robots inside a living animal by brain activity. Recorded EEG patterns are recognized online by an algorithm which in turn controls the state of an electromagnetic field. The field induces the local heating of billions of mechanically-actuating DNA origami robots tethered to metal nanoparticles leading to their reversible activation and subsequent exposure of a bioactive payload. As a proof of principle we demonstrate activation of DNA robots to cause a cellular effect inside the insect Blaberus discoidalis by a cognitively straining task. This technology enables the online switching of a bioactive molecule on and off in response to a subjects cognitive state with potential implications to therapeutic control in disorders such as schizophrenia depression and attention deficits which are among the most challenging conditions to diagnose and treat."
