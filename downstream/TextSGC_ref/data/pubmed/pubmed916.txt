Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 the worst pandemic in more than a century has claimed >125000 lives worldwide to date. Emerging predictors for poor outcome include advanced age male gender pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors including hypertension diabetes and more recently obesity. Herein we posit new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID-19 outcome over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. We outline a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in subjects with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread with increased shedding immune activation and cytokine amplification. We propose studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in subjects with obesity and COVID-19. Finally we underscore emerging therapeutic strategies that might benefit subsets of patients in which cytokine amplification is excessive and potentially fatal. Is Adipose Tissue a Reservoir for Viral Spread Immune Activation and Cytokine Amplification in COVID-19.
