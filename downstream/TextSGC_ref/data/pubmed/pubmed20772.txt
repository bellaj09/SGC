We investigated whether the covert orienting of visuospatial attention can be effectively used in a brain-computer interface guided by event-related potentials. Three visual interfaces were tested: one interface that activated voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and two interfaces that elicited automatic orienting of visuospatial attention. We used two epoch classification procedures. The online epoch classification was performed via Independent Component Analysis and then it was followed by fixed features extraction and support vector machines classification. The offline epoch classification was performed by means of a genetic algorithm that permitted us to retrieve the relevant features of the signal and then to categorise the features with a logistic classifier. The offline classification but not the online one allowed us to differentiate between the performances of the interface that required voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and those that required automatic orienting of visuospatial attention. The offline classification revealed an advantage of the participants in using the "voluntary" interface. This advantage was further supported for the first time by neurophysiological data. Moreover epoch analysis was performed better with the "genetic algorithm classifier" than with the "independent component analysis classifier". We suggest that the combined use of voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and of a classifier that permits feature extraction ad personam i.e. genetic algorithm classifier can lead to a more efficient control of visual BCIs. Improving the efficacy of ERP-based BCIs using different modalities of covert visuospatial attention and a genetic algorithm-based classifier.
