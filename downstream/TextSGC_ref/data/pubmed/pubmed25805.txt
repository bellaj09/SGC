Passive movement action observation and motor imagery as well as motor execution have been suggested to facilitate the motor function of human brain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cortical activation patterns of these four modes using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS system. Seven healthy volunteers underwent optical brain imaging by fNIRS. Passive movements were provided by a functional electrical stimulation FES. Results demonstrated that while all movement modes commonly activated premotor cortex there were considerable differences between modes. The pattern of neural activation in motor execution was best resembled by passive movement followed by motor imagery and lastly by action observation. This result indicates that action observation may be the least preferred way to activate the sensorimotor cortices. Thus in order to show the feasibility of motor facilitation by a brain computer interface BCI for an extreme case we paradoxically adopted the observation as a control input of the BCI. An observation-FES integrated BCI activated sensorimotor system stronger than observation but slightly weaker than FES. This limitation should be overcome to utilize the observation-FES integrated BCI as an active motor training method.
