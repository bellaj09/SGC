We propose a deep learning-based multi-task learning MTL architecture focusing on patient mortality predictions from clinical notes. The MTL framework enables the model to learn a patient representation that generalizes to a variety of clinical prediction tasks. Moreover we demonstrate how MTL enables small but consistent gains on a single classification task e.g. in-hospital mortality prediction simply by incorporating related tasks e.g. 30-day and 1-year mortality prediction into the MTL framework. To accomplish this we utilize a multi-level Convolutional Neural Network CNN associated with a MTL loss component. The model is evaluated with 3 5 and 20 tasks and is consistently able to produce a higher-performing model than a single-task learning STL classifier. We further discuss the effect of the multi-task model on other clinical outcomes of interest including being able to produce high-quality representations that can be utilized to great effect by simpler models. Overall this study demonstrates the efficiency and generalizability of MTL across tasks that STL fails to leverage.
