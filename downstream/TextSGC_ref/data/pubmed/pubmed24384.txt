This study compared the effects of inpatient-based rehabilitation program of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD using non-immersive virtual reality VR training with a traditional pulmonary rehabilitation program. The aims of this study were to determine 1 whether rehabilitation featuring both VR as well as exercise training provides benefits over exercise training ET alone and 2 whether rehabilitation featuring VR training instead of exercise training provides equivalent benefits.
