In this review treatments for motor rehabilitation after stroke will be presented. In particular randomised controlled trials meta-analyses and systematic reviews mainly from the years 2009 - 2011 were taken into consideration. In summary evidence is best for constraint-induced movement therapy and Botulinum toxin type A in patients with focal spasticity. Superiority has been demonstrated for the administration of drugs serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and L-dopa mirror therapy the use of virtual reality electromechanical devices to restore independent walking and fitness and circuit training. Other therapies bilateral arm training treadmill therapy robot-assisted arm therapy did not show superiority. For sensory training and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation large clinical studies still need to be done. Evidence-based methods in motor rehabilitation after stroke.
