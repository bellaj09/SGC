Osteoporosis is a common age-related disease characterized by reduced bone density and increased fracture-risk. Microstructural quality of trabecular bone Tb commonly found at axial skeletal sites and at the end of long bones is an important determinant of bone-strength and fracture-risk. High-resolution emerging CT scanners enable in vivo measurement of Tb microstructures at peripheral sites. However resolution-dependence of microstructural measures and wide resolution-discrepancies among various CT scanners together with rapid upgrades in technology warrant data harmonization in CT-based cross-sectional and longitudinal bone studies. This paper presents a deep learning-based method for high-resolution reconstruction of Tb microstructures from low-resolution CT scans using GAN-CIRCLE. A network was developed and evaluated using post-registered ankle CT scans of nineteen volunteers on both low- and high-resolution CT scanners. 9000 matching pairs of low- and high-resolution patches of size 6464 were randomly harvested from ten volunteers for training and validation. Another 5000 matching pairs of patches from nine other volunteers were used for evaluation. Quantitative comparison shows that predicted high-resolution scans have significantly improved structural similarity index p < 0.01 with true high-resolution scans as compared to the same metric for low-resolution data. Different Tb microstructural measures such as thickness spacing and network area density are also computed from low- and predicted high-resolution images and compared with the values derived from true high-resolution scans. Thickness and network area measures from predicted images showed higher agreement with true high-resolution CT CCC = 0.95 0.91 derived values than the same measures from low-resolution images CCC = 0.72 0.88.
