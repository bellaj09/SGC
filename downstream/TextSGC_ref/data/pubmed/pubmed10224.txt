Domain adaptation studies learning algorithms that generalize across source domains and target domains that exhibit different distributions. Recent studies reveal that deep neural networks can learn transferable features that generalize well to similar novel tasks. However as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network feature transferability drops significantly in higher task-specific layers with increasing domain discrepancy. To formally reduce the effects of this discrepancy and enhance feature transferability in task-specific layers we develop a novel framework for deep adaptation networks that extends deep convolutional neural networks to domain adaptation problems. The framework embeds the deep features of all task-specific layers into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces RKHSs and optimally matches different domain distributions. The deep features are made more transferable by exploiting low-density separation of target-unlabeled data in very deep architectures while the domain discrepancy is further reduced via the use of multiple kernel learning that enhances the statistical power of kernel embedding matching. The overall framework is cast in a minimax game setting. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed networks yield state-of-the-art results on standard visual domain-adaptation benchmarks.
