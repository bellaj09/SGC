"Neuroendoscopic surgery using an ultrasonic aspirator represents a valid tool with which to perform the safe resection of deep-seated ventricular lesions but the handling of neuroendoscopic instruments is technically challenging requiring extensive training to achieve a steep learning curve. Simulation-based methods are increasingly used to improve surgical skills allowing neurosurgical trainees to practice in a risk-free reproducible environment. The authors introduce a synthetic patient-specific simulator that enables trainees to develop skills for endoscopic ventricular tumor removal and they evaluate the models validity as a training instrument with regard to realism mechanical proprieties procedural content and handling." Development and validation of a synthetic 3D-printed simulator for training in neuroendoscopic ventricular lesion removal.
