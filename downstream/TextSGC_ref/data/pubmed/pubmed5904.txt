Although the cerebral cortex is thought to be composed of functionally distinct areas the actual parcellation of area and assignment of function are still highly controversial. An example is the much-studied lateral intraparietal cortex LIP. Despite the general agreement that LIP plays an important role in visual-oculomotor transformation it remains unclear whether the area is primary sensory- or motor-related the attention-intention debate. Although LIP has been considered as a functionally unitary area its dorsal LIPd and ventral LIPv parts differ in local morphology and long-distance connectivity. In particular LIPv has much stronger connections with two oculomotor centers the frontal eye field and the deep layers of the superior colliculus than does LIPd. Such anatomical distinctions imply that compared with LIPd LIPv might be more involved in oculomotor processing. We tested this hypothesis physiologically with a memory saccade task and a gap saccade task. We found that LIP neurons with persistent memory activities in memory saccade are primarily provoked either by visual stimulation vision-related or by both visual and saccadic events vision-saccade-related in gap saccade. The distribution changes from predominantly vision-related to predominantly vision-saccade-related as the recording depth increases along the dorsal-ventral dimension. Consistently the simultaneously recorded local field potential also changes from visual evoked to saccade evoked. Finally local injection of muscimol GABA agonist in LIPv but not in LIPd dramatically decreases the proportion of express saccades. With these results we conclude that LIPd and LIPv are more involved in visual and visual-saccadic processing respectively. Two subdivisions of macaque LIP process visual-oculomotor information differently.
