Spatial signals are prevalent within the hippocampus and its neighboring regions. It is generally accepted that these signals are defined with respect to the external world i.e. a world-centered or allocentric frame of reference. Recently evidence of egocentric processing i.e. self-centered defined relative to the subject in the extended hippocampal system has accumulated. These results support the idea that egocentric sensory information derived from primary sensory cortical areas may be transformed to allocentric representations that interact with the allocentric hippocampal system. We propose a framework to explain the implications of the egocentric-allocentric transformations to the functions of the medial temporal lobe memory system.
