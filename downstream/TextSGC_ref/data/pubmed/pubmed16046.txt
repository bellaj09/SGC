Background: Virtual Reality VR as a computer technology that simulating real environments and situations exploited in numerous healthcare areas such as chronic diseases. The significance of timely treatment and rehabilitation of patients with chronic conditions is high due to the long lasting nature of these conditions. This paper sought to perform a review of published works in the field of VR application in chronic conditions for treatment and rehabilitation purposes. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE database through PubMed in April 2016 for retrieving published papers from January 2001 to December 2015. From 117 retrieved papers 52had the inclusion criteria and their full texts were accessible. Data were extracted from papers based on following items: the name of the first author year of the study applied VR methods type of condition and disease number of subjects that participated in the study and finally the status of success and failure of VR application. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results: Results of the reviewed investigations have been considered in two main categories including treatment oriented papers n=38 73% while twenty of these papers have been conducted on phobias 53%; also there are rehabilitation-oriented experiments n=14 27% while thirteen of these papers have been performed on stroke. In 40 papers 77% the VR technology application reported proper and in 11 papers 21% the application of VR resulted in relatively proper outcomes and only there is a work 2% with poor results for VR intervention. Conclusion: VR technology has been increasingly used in recent years for treatment and rehabilitation purposes among patients affected by chronic conditions in order to motivate them for more successful management.
