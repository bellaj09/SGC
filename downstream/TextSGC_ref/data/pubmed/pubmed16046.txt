Application of kinetic modeling KM on a voxel level in dynamic PET images frequently suffers from high levels of noise drastically reducing the precision of parametric image analysis. In this paper we investigate the use of machine learning and artificial neural networks to denoise dynamic PET images. We train a deep denoising autoencoder DAE using noisy and noise-free spatiotemporal image patches extracted from the simulated images of 11Craclopride a dopamine D2 receptor agonist. The DAE-processed dynamic and corresponding parametric images simulated and acquired are compared with those obtained with conventional denoising techniques including temporal and spatial Gaussian smoothing iterative spatiotemporal smoothing/deconvolution and the highly constrained backprojection processing HYPR. The simulated acquired parametric image non-uniformity was 7.75% 19.49% with temporal and 5.90% 14.50% with spatial smoothing 5.82% 16.21% with smoothing/deconvolution 5.49% 13.38% with HYPR and 3.52% 11.41% with DAE. The DAE also produced the best results in terms of the coefficient of variation of voxel values and structural similarity index. Denoising-induced bias in the regional mean binding potential was 7.8% with temporal and 26.31% with spatial smoothing 28.61% with smoothing/deconvolution 27.63% with HYPR and 14.8% with DAE. When the test data did not match the training data erroneous outcomes were obtained. Our results demonstrate that a deep DAE can provide a substantial reduction in the voxel-level noise compared with the conventional spatiotemporal denoising methods while introducing a similar or lower amount of bias. The better DAE performance comes at the cost of lower generality and requiring appropriate training data. Use of a Tracer-Specific Deep Artificial Neural Net to Denoise Dynamic PET Images.
