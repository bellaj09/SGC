This article presents an energy-efficient electrocorticography ECoG array architecture for fully-implantable brain machine interface systems. A novel dual-mode analog signal processing method is introduced that extracts neural features from high-  band 80-160\xa0Hz at the early stages of signal acquisition. Initially brain activity across the full-spectrum is momentarily observed to compute the feature weights in the digital back-end during full-band mode operation. Subsequently these weights are fed back to the front-end and the system reverts to base-band mode to perform feature extraction. This approach utilizes a distinct optimized signal pathway based on power envelope extraction resulting in 1.72 power reduction in the analog blocks and up to 50 potential power savings for digitization and processing implemented off-chip in this article. A prototype incorporating a 32-channel ultra-low power signal acquisition front-end is fabricated in 180\xa0nm CMOS process with 0.8\xa0V supply. This chip consumes 1.05\xa0 W 0.205\xa0 W for feature extraction only power and occupies 0.245\xa0Formula: see text die area per channel. The chip measurement shows better than 76.5-dB common-mode rejection ratio CMRR 4.09 noise efficiency factor NEF and 10.04 power efficiency factor PEF. In-vivo human tests have been carried out with electroencephalography and ECoG signals to validate the performance and dual-mode operation in comparison to commercial acquisition systems.
