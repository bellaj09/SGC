Cancer subtype identification is an unmet need in precision diagnosis. Recently evolutionary conservation has been indicated to contain informative signatures for functional significance in cancers. However the importance of evolutionary conservation in distinguishing cancer subtypes remains largely unclear. Here we identified the evolutionarily conserved genes i.e. core genes and observed that they are primarily involved in cellular pathways relevant to cell growth and metabolisms. By using these core genes we developed two novel strategies namely a feature-based strategy FES and an image-based strategy IMS by integrating their evolutionary and genomic profiles with the deep learning algorithm. In comparison with the FES using the random set and the strategy using the PAM50 classifier the core gene set-based FES achieved a higher accuracy for identifying breast cancer subtypes. The IMS and FES using the core gene set yielded better performances than the other strategies in terms of classifying both breast cancer subtypes and multiple cancer types. Moreover the IMS is reproducible even using different gene expression data i.e. RNA-seq and microarray. Comprehensive analysis of eight cancer types demonstrates that our evolutionary conservation-based models represent a valid and helpful approach for identifying cancer subtypes and the core gene set offers distinguishable clues of cancer subtypes.
