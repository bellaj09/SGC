The movement of ions across the cell membrane is an essential for many biological processes. This study is focused on ion channels and ion transporters pumps as types of border guards control the incessant traffic of ions across cell membranes. Ion channels and ion transporters function to regulate membrane potential and electrical signaling and play important roles in cell proliferation migration apoptosis and differentiation. In their behaviors it is found that ion channels differ significantly from ion transporters. Therefore a method for automatically classifying ion transporters and ion channels from membrane proteins is proposed by training deep neural networks and using the position-specific scoring matrix profile as an input. The key of novelty is the three-stage approach in which five techniques for data normalization are used; next three imbalanced data techniques are applied to the minority classes and then six classifiers are compared with the proposed method.
