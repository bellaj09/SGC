"Objective assessments of Parkinsons disease PD patients motor state using motion capture techniques are still rarely used in clinical practice even though they may improve clinical management. One major obstacle relates to the large dimensionality of motor abnormalities in PD. We aimed to extract global motor performance measures covering different everyday motor tasks as a function of a clinical intervention i.e. deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus."
