Neuroimaging studies typically consider white matter as unchanging in different neural and metabolic states. However a recent study demonstrated that white matter signal regression WMSR produced a similar loss of neurometabolic information to global whole-brain signal regression GSR in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI data. This was unexpected as the loss of information would normally be attributed to neural activity within gray matter correlating with the global R-fMRI signal. Indeed WMSR has been suggested as an alternative to avoid such pitfalls in GSR. To address these concerns about tissue-specific regression in R-fMRI data analysis we performed GSR WMSR and gray matter signal regression GMSR on R-fMRI data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. We describe several regional and motion-related differences between different types of regressions. However the overall effects of concern particularly network-specific alteration of correlation coefficients are present for all regressions. This suggests that tissue-specific regression is not an adequate strategy to counter pitfalls of GSR. Conversely if GSR is desired but the studied disease state excludes either gray matter or white matter from analysis e.g. due to tissue atrophy our results indicate that WMSR or GMSR may reproduce the gross effects of GSR.
