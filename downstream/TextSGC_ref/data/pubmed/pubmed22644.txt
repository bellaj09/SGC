Studies investigating how people represent themselves and their own body often use variants of "ownership illusions" such as the traditional rubber-hand illusion or the more recently discovered enfacement illusion. However these examples require rather artificial experimental setups in which the artificial effector needs to be stroked in synchrony with the participants\ real hand or face-a situation in which participants have no control over the stroking or the movements of their real or artificial effector. Here we describe a technique to establish ownership illusions in a setup that is more realistic more intuitive and of presumably higher ecological validity. It allows creating the virtual-hand illusion by having participants control the movements of a virtual hand presented on a screen or in virtual space in front of them. If the virtual hand moves in synchrony with the participants\ own real hand they tend to perceive the virtual hand as part of their own body. The technique also creates the virtual-face illusion by having participants control the movements of a virtual face in front of them again with the effect that they tend to perceive the face as their own if it moves in synchrony with their real face. Studying the circumstances that illusions of this sort can be created increased or reduced provides important information about how people create and maintain representations of themselves.
