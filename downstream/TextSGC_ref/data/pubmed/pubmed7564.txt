Astronauts are exposed to 56Fe ions that may pose a significant health hazard during and following prolonged missions in deep space. We showed previously that object recognition requiring the hippocampus a structure critical for cognitive function is affected in 2-month-old mice irradiated with 56Fe ions. Here we examined object recognition in 6-month-old mice irradiated with 56Fe ions a biological age more relevant to the typical ages of astronauts. Moreover because the mechanisms mediating the detrimental effects of 56Fe ions on hippocampal function are unclear we examined changes in hippocampal networks involved in synaptic plasticity and memory gene expression and epigenetic changes in cytosine methylation 5mC and hydroxymethylation 5hmC that could accompany changes in gene expression. We assessed the effects of whole body 56Fe ion irradiation at early 2 weeks and late 20 weeks time points on hippocampus-dependent memory and hippocampal network stability and whether these effects are associated with epigenetic changes in hippocampal DNA methylation both 5mC and 5hmC and gene expression. Short- and long-term effects of 56Fe irradiation on cognition and hippocampal DNA methylation and gene expression.
