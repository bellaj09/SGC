"Constructing accurate predictive models is at the heart of brain-computer interfaces BCIs because these models can ultimately translate brain activities into communication and control commands. The majority of the previous work in BCI use spatial temporal or spatiotemporal features of event-related potentials ERPs. In this study we examined the discriminatory effect of their spatiospectral features to capture the most relevant set of neural activities from electroencephalographic recordings that represent users mental intent. In this regard we model ERP waveforms using a sum of sinusoids with unknown amplitudes frequencies and phases. The effect of this signal modeling step is to represent high-dimensional ERP waveforms in a substantially lower dimensionality space which includes their dominant power spectral contents. We found that the most discriminative frequencies for accurate decoding of visual attention modulated ERPs lie in a spectral range less than 6.4\xa0Hz. This was empirically verified by treating dominant frequency contents of ERP waveforms as feature vectors in the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used herein. The constructed predictive models achieved remarkable performance which for some subjects was as high as 94% as measured by the area under curve. Using these spectral contents we further studied the discriminatory effect of each channel and proposed an efficient strategy to choose subject-specific subsets of channels that generally led to classifiers with comparable performance."
