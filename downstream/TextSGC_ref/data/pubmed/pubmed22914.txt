"Virtual Reality VR is proving to be an effective treatment tool in rehabilitation. Currently we are providing VR therapy to patients in an out-patient clinic and an adult day center. The main focus to this paper is to show how VR is used in occupational therapy to improve balance and dynamic standing tolerance with geriatric patients. We will discuss our research findings of specific treatment approaches that we are using in therapy. The benefits of VR in rehab as well as other rehab applications for this modality will also be discussed. We will illustrate the importance of addressing the visual and motor systems simultaneously for maximum efficiency in achieving our rehabilitation goals. The ultimate goal in occupational therapy is to increase a patients level of independence in activities of daily living and therefore improving their quality of life."
