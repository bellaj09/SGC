Transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS is a technique for brain modulation that has potential to be used in motor neurorehabilitation. Considering that the cerebellum and motor cortex exert influence on the motor network their stimulation could enhance motor functions such as motor imagery and be utilized for brain-computer interfaces BCIs during motor neurorehabilitation. Effect of tDCS stimulation of motor cortex and cerebellum on EEG classification of motor imagery and sensorimotor band power.
