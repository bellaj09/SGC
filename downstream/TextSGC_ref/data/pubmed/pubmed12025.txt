Positron emission topography PET has been substantially used in recent years. To minimize the potential health risks caused by the tracer radiation inherent to PET scans it is of great interest to synthesize the high-quality full-dose PET image from the low-dose one to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the image quality. In this paper we propose a locality adaptive multi-modality generative adversarial networks model LA-GANs to synthesize the full-dose PET image from both the low-dose one and the accompanying T1-weighted MRI to incorporate anatomical information for better PET image synthesis. This paper has the following contributions. First we propose a new mechanism to fuse multi-modality information in deep neural networks. Different from the traditional methods that treat each image modality as an input channel and apply the same kernel to convolute the whole image we argue that the contributions of different modalities could vary at different image locations and therefore a unified kernel for a whole image is not appropriate. To address this issue we propose a method that is locality adaptive for multimodality fusion. Second to learn this locality adaptive fusion we utilize 1  1  1 kernel so that the number of additional parameters incurred by our method is kept minimum. This also naturally produces a fused image which acts as a pseudo input for the subsequent learning stages. Third the proposed locality adaptive fusion mechanism is learned jointly with the PET image synthesis in an end-to-end trained 3D conditional GANs model developed by us. Our 3D GANs model generates high quality PET images by employing large-sized image patches and hierarchical features. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional multi-modality fusion methods used in deep networks as well as the state-of-the-art PET estimation approaches.
