EMG and kinetic measures have been primary tools in the study of movement and have provided the foundation for much of the work presented in this journal. Recently novel ways of combining these tools have provided opportunities to examine elements of motor learning and brain plasticity. This presentation reviews the quantification of EMG within the context of transcranial magnetic stimulation. This vehicle permits acquisition of measures that are fundamental to examining prospects for cortical reorganization among patients with stroke and employs a therapeutic approach called "constraint induced therapy" as a model to demonstrate the interpretation of changes in EMG measures among patients with stroke. Moreover interfacing novel uses of kinetic measurements during functional task performances is highlighted to illustrate how EMG and kinetics can provide further insight into mechanisms related to reacquisition of movement and concomitant changes in plasticity. Clinicians and researchers interested in expanding their use of these measurement tools are encouraged to learn more about application possibilities. Contemporary linkages between EMG kinetics and stroke rehabilitation.
