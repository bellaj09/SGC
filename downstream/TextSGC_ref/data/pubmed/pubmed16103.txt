Regression based methods have revolutionized 2D landmark localization with the exploitation of deep neural networks and massive annotated datasets in the wild. However it remains challenging for 3D landmark localization due to the lack of annotated datasets and the ambiguous nature of landmarks under 3D perspective. This paper revisits regression based methods and proposes an adversarial voxel and coordinate regression framework for 2D and 3D facial landmark localization in real-world scenarios. First a semantic volumetric representation is introduced to encode the per-voxel likelihood of positions being the 3D landmarks. Then an end-to-end pipeline is designed to jointly regress the proposed volumetric representation and the coordinate vector. Such a pipeline not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of the predictions but also unifies the 2D and 3D landmark localization so that 2D and 3D datasets could be utilized simultaneously. Further an adversarial learning strategy is exploited to distill 3D structure learned from synthetic datasets to real-world datasets under weakly supervised settings where an auxiliary regression discriminator is proposed to encourage the network to produce plausible predictions for both synthetic and real-world images. The effectiveness of our method is validated on benchmark datasets 3DFAW and AFLW2000-3D for both 2D and 3D facial landmark localization tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.
