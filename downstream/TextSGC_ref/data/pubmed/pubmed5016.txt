Control of multiple life-critical physiological and behavioral functions requires the hypothalamus. Here we provide a comprehensive description and rigorous analysis of mammalian intrahypothalamic network architecture. To achieve this at the gray matter region macroscale level macroscale connection macroconnection data for the rat hypothalamus were extracted from the primary literature. The dataset indicated the existence of 7982 of 16770 possible intrahypothalamic macroconnections. Network analysis revealed that the intrahypothalamic macroconnection network its macroscale subconnectome is divided into two identical top-level subsystems or subnetworks each composed of two nested second-level subsystems. At the top-level this suggests a deeply integrated network; however regional grouping of the two second-level subsystems suggested a partial separation between control of physiological functions and behavioral functions. Furthermore inclusion of four candidate hubs dominant network nodes in the second-level subsystem that is associated prominently with physiological control suggests network primacy with respect to this function. In addition comparison of network analysis with expression of gene markers associated with inhibitory GAD65 and excitatory VGLUT2 neurotransmission revealed a significant positive correlation between measures of network centrality dominance and the inhibitory marker. We discuss these results in relation to previous understandings of hypothalamic organization and provide and selectively interrogate an updated hypothalamus structure-function network model to encourage future hypothesis-driven investigations of identified hypothalamic subsystems.
