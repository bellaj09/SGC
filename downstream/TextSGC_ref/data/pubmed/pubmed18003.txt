A novel virtual reality executive function task Multitasking in the City Test MCT was developed with the aim of investigating planning and multitasking with ecological validity in mind in a normal population. Thirty healthy participants 21 females completed a neuropsychological test battery that included the MCT along with standardized tests of executive and other cognitive functions. The sample performed within normal limits on the standardized tests. The MCT was performed successfully although specific types of errors occurred frequently. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between the various test measures. Only the plan score from the MCT was significantly associated with one of the executive function tests administered Modified Six Elements Test suggesting that both variables may be measuring a similar construct. Statistically significant correlations were also found between the MCT and the Trail-Making Test Part A and Judgment of Line Orientation suggesting that "basic" cognitive functions such as information-processing speed and visuospatial skills are being tapped on the MCT. Preliminary evidence from this study suggested that the MCT may be an ecologically valid method of evaluating executive functioning. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
