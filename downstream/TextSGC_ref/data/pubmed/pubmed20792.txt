"Advanced upper limb prosthetics such as the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb MPL are now available for research and preliminary clinical applications. Research attention has shifted to developing means of controlling these prostheses. Penetrating microelectrode arrays are often used in animal and human models to decode action potentials for cortical control. These arrays may suffer signal loss over the long-term and therefore should not be the only implant type investigated for chronic BMI use. Electrocorticographic ECoG signals from electrodes on the cortical surface may provide more stable long-term recordings. Several studies have demonstrated ECoGs potential for decoding cortical activity. As a result clinical studies are investigating ECoG encoding of limb movement as well as its use for interfacing with and controlling advanced prosthetic arms. This overview presents the technical state of the art in the use of ECoG in controlling prostheses. Technical limitations of the current approach and future directions are also presented."
