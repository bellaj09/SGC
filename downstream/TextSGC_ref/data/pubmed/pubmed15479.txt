"The introduction of a problem-based learning PBL curriculum at the School of Medicine of the University of Melbourne has necessitated a reduction in the number of lectures and limited the use of dissection in teaching anatomy. In the new curriculum students learn the anatomy of different body systems using PBL tutorials practical classes pre-dissected specimens computer-aided learning multimedia and a few dissection classes. The aims of this study are: 1 to assess the views of first- and second-year medical students on the importance of dissection in learning about the anatomy 2 to assess if students views have been affected by demographic variables such as gender academic background and being a local or an international student and 3 to assess which educational tools helped them most in learning the anatomy and whether dissection sessions have helped them in better understanding anatomy." Do we need dissection in an integrated problem-based learning medical course? Perceptions of first- and second-year students.
