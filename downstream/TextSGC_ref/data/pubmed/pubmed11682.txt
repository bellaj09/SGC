Recently recurrent neural networks RNNs have been applied in predicting disease onset risks with Electronic Health Record EHR data. While these models demonstrated promising results on relatively small data sets the generalizability and transferability of those models and its applicability to different patient populations across hospitals have not been evaluated. In this study we evaluated an RNN model RETAIN over Cerner Health Facts EMR data for heart failure onset risk prediction. Our data set included over 150000 heart failure patients and over 1000000 controls from nearly 400 hospitals. Convincingly RETAIN achieved an AUC of 82% in comparison to an AUC of 79% for logistic regression demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning models for EHR predictive modeling. The prediction performance fluctuated across different patient groups and varied from hospital to hospital. Also we trained RETAIN models on individual hospitals and found that the model can be applied to other hospitals with only about 3.6% of reduction of AUC. Our results demonstrated the capability of RNN for predictive modeling with large and heterogeneous EHR data and pave the road for future improvements.
