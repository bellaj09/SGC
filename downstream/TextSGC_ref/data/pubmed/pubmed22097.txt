We propose a complex-valued multilayer feedforward neural network classifier for decoding of phase-coded information from steady-state visual evoked potentials. To optimize the performance of the classifier we supply it with two filter-based feature selection strategies. The proposed approaches could be used for a phase-coded brain-computer interface enabling to encode several targets using only one stimulation frequency. The proposed classifier is a multichannel one which distinguishes our approach from the existing single-channel ones. We show that the proposed approach outperforms others in terms of accuracy and length of the data segments used for decoding. We show that the decoding based on one optimally selected channel yields an inferior performance compared to the one based on several features which supports our argument for a multichannel approach.
