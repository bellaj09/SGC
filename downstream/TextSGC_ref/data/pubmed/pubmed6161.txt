This paper presents a novel method for learning the cyclic contents of stochastic time series: the deep time-growing neural network DTGNN. The DTGNN combines supervised and unsupervised methods in different levels of learning for an enhanced performance. It is employed by a multiscale learning structure to classify cyclic time series CTS in which the dynamic contents of the time series are preserved in an efficient manner. This paper suggests a systematic procedure for finding the design parameter of the classification method for a one-versus-multiple class application. A novel validation method is also suggested for evaluating the structural risk both in a quantitative and a qualitative manner. The effect of the DTGNN on the performance of the classifier is statistically validated through the repeated random subsampling using different sets of CTS from different medical applications. The validation involves four medical databases comprised of 108 recordings of the electroencephalogram signal 90 recordings of the electromyogram signal 130 recordings of the heart sound signal and 50 recordings of the respiratory sound signal. Results of the statistical validations show that the DTGNN significantly improves the performance of the classification and also exhibits an optimal structural risk.
