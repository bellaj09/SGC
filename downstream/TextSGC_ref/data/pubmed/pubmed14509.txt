Anatomic stenosis evaluation on coronary CT angiography CCTA lacks specificity in indicating the functional significance of a stenosis. Recent developments in CT techniques including dual-layer spectral detector CT SDCT and static stress CT perfusion CTP and image analyses including fractional flow reserve FFR derived from CCTA images FFRCT and deep learning analysis DL are potential strategies to increase the specificity of CCTA by combining both anatomical and functional information in one investigation. The aim of the current study is to assess the diagnostic performance of combinations of SDCT CTP FFRCT and DL for the identification of functionally significant coronary artery stenosis.
