"This paper presents the SLMeetingRoom a virtual reality online environment to support group meetings of geographically dispersed participants. A prototype was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using the Second Life platform. Ten additional components had to be added to Second Life environment to support group work essential activities such as participants communication tasks and participants coordination participants collaboration and work evolutions perception. Empirical studies both pilot and experiment were developed comparing four different meeting settings: face-to-face videoconference stand Second Life and SLMeetingRoom. The study involved graduate students enrolled in the Interface and Multimedia discipline at the Fluminense Federal University UFF in Brazil. Results indicated that groups working within SLMeetingRoom environment presented similar results as face-to-face meeting as far as sense of presence is concerned and with low cognitive effort. Task completion and degree of participation were not affected by the meeting set up. It was concluded that Second Life in conjunction with the SLMeetingRoom components is a good tool for holding synchronous remote meetings and coexists with other electronic meeting technologies." A collaborative working environment for small group meetings in Second Life.
