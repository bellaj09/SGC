Precise surgery is based on the integrated application of modern science and technology and integrated innovation of surgical technology revolution features. It is built in high-end digital medical bases. The purpose of precise surgery is to achieve accurate lesion resection minimize injury improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of surgery. In this paper we forward new concept of precise thoracic surgery. An overview was made on the development of precise surgery with great support of virtual reality technology augmented reality technology and image acquisition technology. Finally the paper illustrated the prospect of precise of thoracic surgery from the following aspects: preoperative planning the choice of surgical approach precise tumor localization postoperative immediate 3-dimension multi modality imaging evaluation. Precise thoracic surgery: new era of minimally invasive surgery.
