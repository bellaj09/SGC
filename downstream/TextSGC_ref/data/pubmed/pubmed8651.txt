Many vision science studies employ machine learning especially the version called "deep learning." Neuroscientists use machine learning to decode neural responses. Perception scientists try to understand how living organisms recognize objects. To them deep neural networks offer benchmark accuracies for recognition of learned stimuli. Originally machine learning was inspired by the brain. Today machine learning is used as a statistical tool to decode brain activity. Tomorrow deep neural networks might become our best model of brain function. This brief overview of the use of machine learning in biological vision touches on its strengths weaknesses milestones controversies and current directions. Here we hope to help vision scientists assess what role machine learning should play in their research. Deep learning-Using machine learning to study biological vision.
