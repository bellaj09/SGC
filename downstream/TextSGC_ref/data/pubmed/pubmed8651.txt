"Understanding a patients state is critical to providing optimal care. However information loss occurs during patient hand-offs e.g. emergency services EMS transferring patient care to a receiving hospital which hinders care quality. Augmenting the information flow from an EMS vehicle to a receiving hospital may reduce information loss and improve patient outcomes. Such augmentation requires a noninvasive system that can automatically recognize clinical procedures being performed and send near real-time information to a receiving hospital. An automatic clinical procedure detection system that uses wearable sensors video and machine-learning to recognize clinical procedures within a controlled environment is presented. The system demonstrated how contextual information and a majority vote method can substantially improve procedure recognition accuracy. Future work concerning computer vision techniques and deep learning are discussed." Automatic Clinical Procedure Detection for Emergency Services.
