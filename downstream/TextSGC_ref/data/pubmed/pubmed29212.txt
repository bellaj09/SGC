Currently detecting awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness DOC is a challenging task which is commonly addressed through behavioral observation scales such as the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide an alternative approach to detect awareness in patients with DOC. However these patients have a much lower capability of using BCIs compared to healthy individuals. This study proposed a novel BCI using temporally spatially and semantically congruent audiovisual stimuli involving numbers i.e. visual and spoken numbers. Subjects were instructed to selectively attend to the target stimuli cued by instruction. Ten healthy subjects first participated in the experiment to evaluate the system. The results indicated that the audiovisual BCI system outperformed auditory-only and visual-only systems. Through event-related potential analysis we observed audiovisual integration effects for target stimuli which enhanced the discriminability between brain responses for target and nontarget stimuli and thus improved the performance of the audiovisual BCI. This system was then applied to detect the awareness of seven DOC patients five of whom exhibited command following as well as number recognition. Thus this audiovisual BCI system may be used as a supportive bedside tool for awareness detection in patients with DOC.
