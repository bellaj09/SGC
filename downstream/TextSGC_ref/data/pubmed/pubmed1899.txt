Although several clinical trials are now underway to test possible therapies the worldwide response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment. We report here that Ivermectin an FDA-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro is an inhibitor of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 with a single addition to Vero-hSLAM cells 2\xa0h post infection with SARS-CoV-2 able to effect ~5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48\xa0h. Ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans. The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
