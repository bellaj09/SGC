We study the problem of photo cropping which aims to find a cropping window of an input image to preserve as much as possible its important parts while being aesthetically pleasant. Seeking a deep learning-based solution we design a neural network that has two branches for attention box prediction ABP and aesthetics assessment AA respectively. Given the input image the ABP network predicts an attention bounding box as an initial minimum cropping window around which a set of cropping candidates are generated with little loss of important information. Then the AA network is employed to select the final cropping window with the best aesthetic quality among the candidates. The two sub-networks are designed to share the same full-image convolutional feature map and thus are computationally efficient. By leveraging attention prediction and aesthetics assessment the cropping model produces high-quality cropping results even with the limited availability of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results on benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition our approach runs at 5 fps outperforming most previous solutions.
