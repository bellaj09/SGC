Patient-specific simulated rehearsal PsR of a carotid artery stenting procedure CAS enables the interventionalist to rehearse the case before performing the procedure on the actual patient by incorporating patient-specific computed tomographic data into the simulation software. This study aimed to evaluate whether PsR of a CAS procedure can enhance the operative performance versus a virtual reality VR generic CAS warm-up procedure or no preparation at all. Simulated procedure rehearsal is more effective than a preoperative generic warm-up for endovascular procedures.
