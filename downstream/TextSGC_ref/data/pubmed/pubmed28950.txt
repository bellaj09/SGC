Accurate implementation of real-time non-invasive brain-machine/computer interfaces BMI/BCI requires handling physiological and nonphysiological artifacts associated with the measurement modalities. For example scalp electroencephalographic EEG measurements are often considered prone to excessive motion artifacts and other types of artifacts that contaminate the EEG recordings. Although the magnitude of such artifacts heavily depends on the task and the setup complete minimization or isolation of such artifacts is generally not possible. Characterization and real-time removal of motion artifacts from EEG signals.
