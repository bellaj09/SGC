Intracortical electrode arrays provide the best spatial and temporal resolution signals for brain-machine interfaces. Wireless technologies are being developed to handle this information capacity but currently the only means to deliver neural information from the implant to a signal processing unit is by a physical connection starting at a skull-mounted connector. The failure rate of the attachment of these connectors is significant. In this study we report an improvement to the traditional connectors. Baseplate for two-stage cranial mounting of BMI connectors.
