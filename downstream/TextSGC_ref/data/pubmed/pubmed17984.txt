Dexterous manipulation of the hand one of the features of human motor control is often compromised after stroke to the detriment of basic functions. Despite the importance of independent movement of the digits to activities of daily living relatively few studies have assessed the impact of specifically targeting individuated movements of the digits on hand rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of such finger individuation training by means of a novel mechatronic-virtual reality system on fine motor control after stroke. Training finger individuation with a mechatronic-virtual reality system leads to improved fine motor control post-stroke.
