Drosophila is widely used in connectome studies due to its small brain size sophisticated genetic tools and the most complete single-neuron-based anatomical brain map. Surprisingly even the brain thickness is only 200-m common Ti:sapphire-based two-photon excitation cannot penetrate possibly due to light aberration/scattering of trachea. Here we quantitatively characterized scattering and light distortion of trachea-filled tissues and found that trachea-induced light distortion dominates at long wavelength by comparing one-photon 488-nm two-photon 920-nm and three-photon 1300-nm excitations. Whole-Drosophila-brain imaging is achieved by reducing tracheal light aberration/scattering via brain-degassing or long-wavelength excitation at 1300-nm. Our work paves the way toward constructing whole-brain connectome in a living Drosophila. Optical properties of adult Drosophila brains in one- two- and three-photon microscopy.
