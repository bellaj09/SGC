Synchrony of brain activity over time describes the functional connectivity between brain regions but does not address the temporal component of this relationship. We propose a complementary method of analysis by introducing the width of cross-correlation curves between functional MRI fMRI time series as a metric of the relative duration of synchronous activity between brain regions or "sustained connectivity". Using resting-state fMRI cognitive and demographics data from 1003 subjects included in the Human Connectome Project we find that sustained connectivity is a reproducible trait in individuals heritable more transient in females and shows changes with age in early adulthood. Sustained connectivity in sensory brain regions is specifically associated with differences in processing speed across subjects particularly in men. In contrast traditional functional connectivity was correlated with a measure of episodic memory but not with processing speed. Individual differences in hemodynamic response function HRF are closely approximated by sustained connectivity and width of the HRF is also correlated with processing speed across individuals suggesting that variability in hemodynamic response may be influenced by transient versus sustained neural activity rather than simply differences in vascularity and signal transduction. Sustained connectivity may provide new opportunities to study brain dynamics in clinical populations. Sustained versus instantaneous connectivity differentiates cognitive functions of processing speed and episodic memory.
