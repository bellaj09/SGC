Artificial intelligence tools are gaining more and more ground each year in bioinformatics. Learning algorithms can be taught for specific tasks by using the existing enormous biological databases and the resulting models can be used for the high-quality classification of novel un-categorized data in numerous areas including biological sequence analysis. Here we introduce SECLAF a webserver that uses deep neural networks for hierarchical biological sequence classification. By applying SECLAF for residue-sequences we have reported Methods 2018 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.034 the most accurate multi-label protein classifier to date UniProt-into 698 classes-AUC 99.99%; Gene Ontology-into 983 classes-AUC 99.45%. Our framework SECLAF can be applied for other sequence classification tasks as we describe in the present contribution.
