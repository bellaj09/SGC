"Three-dimensional 3D printing technology virtual reality and augmented reality technology have been used to help surgeons to complete complex total hip arthroplasty while their respective shortcomings limit their further application. With the development of technology mixed reality MR technology has been applied to improve the success rate of complicated hip arthroplasty because of its unique advantages. We presented a case of a 59-year-old man with an intertrochanteric fracture in the left femur who had received a prior left hip fusion. After admission to our hospital a left total hip arthroplasty was performed on the patient using a combination of MR technology and 3D printing technology. Before surgery 3D reconstruction of a certain bony landmark exposed in the surgical area was first performed. Then a veneer part was designed according to the bony landmark and connected to a reference registration landmark outside the body through a connecting rod. After that the series of parts were made into a holistic reference registration instrument using 3D printing technology and the patients data for bone and surrounding tissue along with digital 3D information of the reference registration instrument were imported into the head-mounted display HMD. During the operation the disinfected reference registration instrument was installed on the selected bony landmark and then the automatic real-time registration was realized by HMD through recognizing the registration landmark on the reference registration instrument whereby the patients virtual bone and other anatomical structures were quickly and accurately superimposed on the real body of the patient. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report to use MR combined with 3D printing technology in total hip arthroplasty."
