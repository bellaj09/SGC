"The aim of this study was to assess whether mixed practice of basic tasks on a virtual reality VR simulator improves the performance of advanced tasks on the same device used for training as well as on a video trainer VT. Thirty-six novices were allocated into 3 equal groups. Each group practiced on different combinations of basic tasks on a VR simulator: A peg transfer B peg transfer and clipping and C peg transfer clipping and cutting. Before and after training each group performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy LC scenario on the simulator and intracorporeal knot tying KT on a VT. Assessment metrics included time instruments path length penalty score and hand motion synchronization. Results showed that for the common training tasks plateau values were statistically equivalent for most assessment metrics P > .05. For LC all groups showed significant performance improvement P < .05. For KT group C improved significantly in pathlength P < .005 penalty score P < .05 and hand motion synchronization P < .05; the other groups failed to show an improvement P > .05. In conclusion training on different VR tasks seems to have no effect on the performance of more demanding tasks on the same device. However the number of different tasks practiced on the VR simulator seems to favorably affect the performance of advanced tasks on the VT."
