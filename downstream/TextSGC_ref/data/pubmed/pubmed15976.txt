There is currently a growing interest for conducting studies into the electrical and neurochemical activity of the pedunculopontine nucleus PPN due to the privileged position occupied by this structure in the flow of information to and from the cortex. This nucleus acts as a relay not only for the motor information that is processed in the basal ganglia but also for information of an emotional type whose main centre is the nucleus accumbens. It is also strongly linked with the aspects that determine the mechanisms governing addiction to certain drugs. The pedunculopontine nucleus. A structure involved in motor and emotional processing.
