Near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is a functional brain imaging method able to study hemodynamic changes during cortical activation. We studied the changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin oxy-Hb deoxy-Hb with a 52-channel NIRS system during simple mental arithmetic in ten healthy volunteers over the prefrontal cortex. We found that eight of the ten subjects showed a relative focal bilateral increase of oxy-Hb in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC in parallel with a decrease in the medial area of the anterior prefrontal cortex APFC. The oxy-Hb response in left DLPFC and APFC was significant while the deoxy-Hb response was clearly smaller and not significant. These observations were discussed within the context of "focal activation/surround deactivation". Focal frontal deoxyhemoglobin responses during simple arithmetic.
