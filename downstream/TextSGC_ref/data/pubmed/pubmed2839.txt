"A comprehensive understanding of the brain requires analysis although from a global perspective with cellular and even subcellular resolution. An important step towards this goal involves the establishment of three-dimensional high-resolution brain maps incorporating brain-wide information about the cells and their connections as well as the chemical architecture. The progress made in such anatomical brain mapping in recent years has been paralleled by the development of physiological techniques that enable investigators to generate global neural activity maps also with cellular resolution while simultaneously recording the organisms behavioral activity. Combination of the high-resolution anatomical and physiological maps followed by theoretical systems analysis of the deduced network will offer unprecedented opportunities for a better understanding of how the brain as a whole processes sensory information and generates behavior."
