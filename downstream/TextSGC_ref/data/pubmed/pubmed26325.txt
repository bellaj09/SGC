Brain-computer interfacing BCI applications based on the classification of electroencephalographic EEG signals require solving high-dimensional pattern classification problems with such a relatively small number of training patterns that curse of dimensionality problems usually arise. Multiresolution analysis MRA has useful properties for signal analysis in both temporal and spectral analysis and has been broadly used in the BCI field. However MRA usually increases the dimensionality of the input data. Therefore some approaches to feature selection or feature dimensionality reduction should be considered for improving the performance of the MRA based BCI. Classification of motor imagery tasks for BCI with multiresolution analysis and multiobjective feature selection.
