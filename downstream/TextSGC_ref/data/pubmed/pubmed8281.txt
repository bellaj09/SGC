Control of blood glucose is essential for diabetes management. Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis and patient state prediction among others. In this paper we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases root-mean-square error RMSE = 9.38\xa0  0.71 mg/dL over a 30-min horizon RMSE = 18.87\xa0  2.25 mg/dL over a 60-min horizon and real patient cases RMSE = 21.07\xa0  2.35 mg/dL for 30 min RMSE = 33.27\xa0  4.79% for 60 min. In addition the model provides competitive performance in providing effective prediction horizon Formula: see text with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset Formula: see text = 29.0  0.7 for 30 min and Formula: see text = 49.8\xa0  2.9 for 60 min and in a real patient dataset Formula: see text = 19.3\xa0  3.1 for 30 min and Formula: see text = 29.3\xa0  9.4 for 60 min. This approach is evaluated on a dataset of ten simulated cases generated from the UVA/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of ten real cases each containing glucose readings insulin bolus and meal carbohydrate data. Performance of the recurrent convolutional neural network is benchmarked against four algorithms. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an Android mobile phone with an execution time of 6\xa0ms on a phone compared to an execution time of 780\xa0ms on a laptop.
