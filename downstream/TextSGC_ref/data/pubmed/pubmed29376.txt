Brain-machine interfaces BMIs have exploded in popularity in the past decade. BMIs also called brain-computer interfaces provide a direct link between the brain and a computer usually to control an external device. BMIs have a wide array of potential clinical applications ranging from restoring communication to people unable to speak due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a stroke to restoring movement to people with paralysis from spinal cord injury or motor neuron disease to restoring memory to people with cognitive impairment. Because BMIs are controlled directly by the activity of prespecified neurons or cortical areas they also provide a powerful paradigm with which to investigate fundamental questions about brain physiology including neuronal behavior learning and the role of oscillations. This article reviews the clinical and neuroscientific applications of BMIs with a primary focus on motor BMIs.
