"The Gleason grading system remains the most powerful prognostic predictor for patients with prostate cancer since the 1960s. Its application requires highly-trained pathologists is tedious and yet suffers from limited inter-pathologist reproducibility especially for the intermediate Gleason score 7. Automated annotation procedures constitute a viable solution to remedy these limitations. In this study we present a deep learning approach for automated Gleason grading of prostate cancer tissue microarrays with Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E staining. Our system was trained using detailed Gleason annotations on a discovery cohort of 641 patients and was then evaluated on an independent test cohort of 245 patients annotated by two pathologists. On the test cohort the inter-annotator agreements between the model and each pathologist quantified via Cohens quadratic kappa statistic were 0.75 and 0.71 respectively comparable with the inter-pathologist agreement kappa\u2009=\u20090.71. Furthermore the models Gleason score assignments achieved pathology expert-level stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups on the basis of disease-specific survival data available for the test cohort. Overall our study shows promising results regarding the applicability of deep learning-based solutions towards more objective and reproducible prostate cancer grading especially for cases with heterogeneous Gleason patterns."
