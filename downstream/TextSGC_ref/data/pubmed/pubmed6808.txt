Altered reward circuitry function is observed in individuals with bipolar disorder BD and their unaffected offspring OBP. While OBP are at elevated risk for BD modifiable risk factors that may exacerbate neural vulnerabilities in OBP remain under-characterized. As sleep loss is strongly linked to mania in BD this study tested associations between sleep duration reward circuitry function and mood dysregulation in OBP. Preliminary investigation of the relationships between sleep duration reward circuitry function and mood dysregulation in youth offspring of parents with bipolar disorder.
