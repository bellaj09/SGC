Quantitative bioactivity and toxicity assessment of chemical compounds plays a central role in drug discovery as it saves a substantial amount of resources. To this end high-performance computing has enabled researchers and practitioners to leverage hundreds or even thousands of computed molecular descriptors for the activity prediction of candidate compounds. In this paper we evaluate the utility of two large groups of chemical descriptors by such predictive modelling as well as chemical structure discovery through empirical analysis. We use a suite of commercially available and in-house software to calculate molecular descriptors for two sets of chemical mutagens - a homogeneous set of 95 amines and a diverse set of 508 chemicals. Using calculated descriptors we model the mutagenic activity of these compounds using a number of methods from the statistics and machine-learning literature and use robust principal component analysis to investigate the low-dimensional subspaces that characterize these chemicals. Our results suggest that combining different sets of descriptors is likely to result in a better predictive model - but that depends on the compounds being modelled and the modelling technique being used.
