Sleep apnea is a common chronic respiratory disorder which occurs due to the repetitive complete or partial cessations of breathing during sleep. The gold standard assessment of sleep apnea requires full night polysomnography in a sleep laboratory which is expensive time consuming and inconvenient. Hence there is an urgent need for a convenient robust and wearable monitoring device for screening of sleep apnea. A simple and convenient accelerometer-based portable system is presented to estimate the severity of sleep apnea by analyzing tracheal movements. Respiratory related movements were recorded over the suprasternal notch using a 3D accelerometer. Twenty-one physiological features 7 features 3 accelerometer channels were extracted. Performance of three different deep learning models - convolutional neural network recurrent neural network and their combination - were evaluated for estimating the apnea hypopnea index AHI. The estimated AHI is compared to the gold standard polysomnography. In 3-fold cross-validation experiments with 20 participants 9 female age=47.818.0 years BMI=30.84.8 AHI=22.221.8 events/hr we achieved a correlation coefficient between gold standard and estimated values r-value = 0.84. The proposed system is an accurate convenient and portable device suitable for home sleep apnea screening. Sleep Apnea Severity Estimation from Respiratory Related Movements Using Deep Learning.
