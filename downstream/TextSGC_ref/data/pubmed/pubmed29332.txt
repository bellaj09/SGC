In this paper the work is mainly concentrated on removing non-linear parameters to make the physiological signals more linear and reducing the complexity of the signals. This paper discusses three different types of techniques that can be successfully utilised to remove non-linear parameters in EEG and ECG. i Transformation technique using Discrete Walsh-Hadamard Transform DWHT; ii application of fuzzy logic control and iii building the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System ANFIS model for fuzzy. This work has been inspired by the need to arrive at an efficient simple accurate and quicker method for analysis of bio-signal. Real-time estimation and detection of non-linearity in bio-signals using wireless brain-computer interface.
