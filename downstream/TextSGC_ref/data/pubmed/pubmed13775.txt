It is difficult to obtain an accurate segmentation due to the variety of lung nodules in computed tomography CT images. In this study we propose a data-driven model called the Cascaded Dual-Pathway Residual Network CDP-ResNet to improve the segmentation of lung nodules in the CT images. Our approach incorporates the multi-view and multi-scale features of different nodules from CT images. The proposed residual block based dual-path network extracts local features and rich contextual information of lung nodules. In addition we designed an improved weighted sampling strategy to select training samples based on the edge. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on an LIDC dataset which contains 986 nodules. Experimental results show that the CDP-ResNet achieves superior segmentation performance with an average DICE score standard deviation of 81.58% 11.05 on the LIDC dataset. Moreover we compared our results with those of four radiologists on the same dataset. The comparison shows that the CDP-ResNet is slightly better than human experts in terms of segmentation accuracy. Meanwhile the proposed segmentation method outperforms existing methods. A cascaded dual-pathway residual network for lung nodule segmentation in CT images.
