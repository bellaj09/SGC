Quantifying differences or similarities in connectomes has been a challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks. Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single local connectome fingerprint that allows for a direct comparison between structural connectomes. In four independently acquired data sets with repeated scans total N = 213 we show that the local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that achieved 100% accuracy across 17398 identification tests. The estimated classification error was approximately one thousand times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns for repeat scans acquired within 3 months. The local connectome fingerprint also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a decreasing trend in self-similarity across time whereas this change was not observed in the diffusivity measures. Moreover the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic marker revealing 12.51% similarity between monozygotic twins 5.14% between dizygotic twins and 4.51% between none-twin siblings relative to differences between unrelated subjects. This novel approach opens a new door for probing the influence of pathological genetic social or environmental factors on the unique configuration of the human connectome.
