In diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging DW-MRI the fiber orientation distribution function fODF is of great importance for solving complex fiber configurations to achieve reliable tractography throughout the brain which ultimately facilitates the understanding of brain connectivity and exploration of neurological dysfunction. Recently multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution MSMT-CSD method has been explored for reconstructing full fODFs. To achieve a reliable fitting similar to other model-based approaches a large number of diffusion measurements is typically required for MSMT-CSD method. The prolonged acquisition is however not feasible in practical clinical routine and is prone to motion artifacts. To accelerate the acquisition we proposed a method to reconstruct the fODF from downsampled diffusion-weighted images DWIs by leveraging the strong inference ability of the deep convolutional neural network CNN.
