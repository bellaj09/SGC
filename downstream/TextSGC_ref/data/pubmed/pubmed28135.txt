This paper presents a novel method based on multi-channel Empirical Mode Decomposition EMD of classifying the electroencephalogram EEG recordings of imagined movement by a subject within a brain-computer interfacing BCI framework. EMD is a technique that divides any non-linear or non-stationary signal into groups of frequency harmonics called Intrinsic Mode Functions IMFs. As frequency is a key component of both IMFs and the  rhythm 8-13 Hz brain activity generated during motor imagery IMFs are then grouped by frequency. EMD is applied to the recordings from two electrodes for each trial and the resulting IMFs are grouped according to peak-frequency band via Hierarchical Clustering Analysis HCA. The cluster containing the frequency band of the  rhythm 8-13 Hz is then selected and the sum-total of the IMFs from each electrode are summed together. A simple linear classifier is then sufficient to classify the motor-imagery with 89% sensitivity from a separate test set. Novel use of Empirical Mode Decomposition in single-trial classification of motor imagery for use in brain-computer interfaces.
