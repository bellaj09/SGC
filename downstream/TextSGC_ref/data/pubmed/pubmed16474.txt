We develop a deep learning refined kinematic model for accurately assessing upper limb joint angles using a single Kinect v2 sensor. We train a long short-term memory recurrent neural network using a supervised machine learning architecture to compensate for the systematic error of the Kinect kinematic model taking a marker-based three-dimensional motion capture system 3DMC as the golden standard. A series of upper limb functional task experiments were conducted namely hand to the contralateral shoulder hand to mouth or drinking combing hair and hand to back pocket. Our deep learning-based model significantly improves the performance of a single Kinect v2 sensor for all investigated upper limb joint angles across all functional tasks. Using a single Kinect v2 sensor our deep learning-based model could measure shoulder and elbow flexion/extension waveforms with mean CMCs >0.93 for all tasks shoulder adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation waveforms with mean CMCs >0.8 for most of the tasks. The mean deviations of angles at the point of target achieved and range of motion are under 5 for all investigated joint angles during all functional tasks. Compared with the 3DMC our presented system is easier to operate and needs less laboratory space. Deep Learning-Based Upper Limb Functional Assessment Using a Single Kinect v2 Sensor.
