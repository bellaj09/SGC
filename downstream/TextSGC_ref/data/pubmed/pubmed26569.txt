"Motor disability and/or ageing can prevent individuals from fully enjoying home facilities thus worsening their quality of life. Advances in the field of accessible user interfaces for domotic appliances can represent a valuable way to improve the independence of these persons. An asynchronous P300-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI system was recently validated with the participation of healthy young volunteers for environmental control. In this study the asynchronous P300-based BCI for the interaction with a virtual home environment was tested with the participation of potential end-users clients of a Frisian home care organization with limited autonomy due to ageing and/or motor disabilities. System testing revealed that the minimum number of stimulation sequences needed to achieve correct classification had a higher intra-subject variability in potential end-users with respect to what was previously observed in young controls. Here we show that the asynchronous modality performed significantly better as compared to the synchronous mode in continuously adapting its speed to the users state. Furthermore the asynchronous system modality confirmed its reliability in avoiding misclassifications and false positives as previously shown in young healthy subjects. The asynchronous modality may contribute to filling the usability gap between BCI systems and traditional input devices representing an important step towards their use in the activities of daily living."
