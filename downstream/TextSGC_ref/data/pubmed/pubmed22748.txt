"The main objective of neurosurgery is to establish safe and reliable surgical techniques. Medical technology has advanced during the 21st century enabling the development of increasingly sophisticated tools for preoperative study that can be used by surgeons before performing surgery on an actual patient. Laser-printed models are a robust tool for improving surgical performance planning an operative approach and developing the skills and strategy to deal with uncommon and high-risk intraoperative difficulties. Practice with these models enhances the surgeons understanding of 3D anatomy but has some limitations with regard to tactile perception. In this study the authors aimed to develop a preoperative planning method that combines a hybrid model with augmented reality AR to enhance preparation for and planning of a specific surgical procedure correction of metopic craniosynostosis also known as trigonocephaly." Augmented reality and physical hybrid model simulation for preoperative planning of metopic craniosynostosis surgery.
