Face attribute estimation has many potential applications in video surveillance face retrieval and social media. While a number of methods have been proposed for face attribute estimation most of them did not explicitly consider the attribute correlation and heterogeneity e.g. ordinal versus nominal and holistic versus local during feature representation learning. In this paper we present a Deep Multi-Task Learning DMTL approach to jointly estimate multiple heterogeneous attributes from a single face image. In DMTL we tackle attribute correlation and heterogeneity with convolutional neural networks CNNs consisting of shared feature learning for all the attributes and category-specific feature learning for heterogeneous attributes. We also introduce an unconstrained face database LFW+ an extension of public-domain LFW with heterogeneous demographic attributes age gender and race obtained via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes MORPH II LFW+ CelebA LFWA and FotW show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state of the art. Finally evaluations on a public-domain face database LAP with a single attribute show that the proposed approach has excellent generalization ability.
