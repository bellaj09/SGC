"The past decade has seen the emergence of rehabilitation treatments using virtual reality VR environments although translation into clinical practice has been limited so far. In this paper an immersive VR rehabilitation training system endowed with wearable haptics is proposed for children with neuromotor impairments: it aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of VR in adapting exercises to the patients need. An experimental rehabilitation session conducted with children with cerebral palsy CP and developmental dyspraxia DD has been performed to evaluate the usability of the system and proof of concept trial of the proposed approach. We compared CP/DD performance with both typically developing children and adult control group. Results show the system was compliant with different levels of motor skills and allowed patients to complete the experimental rehabilitation session with performance varying according to the expected motor abilities of different groups. Moreover a kinematic assessmentbased on the presented system has been designed. Obtained results reflected different motor abilities of patients and participants suggesting suitability of the proposed kinematic assessment as a motor function outcome."
