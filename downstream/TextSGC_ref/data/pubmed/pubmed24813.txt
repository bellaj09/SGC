Foraminal cervical nerve root compression can be caused by lateral disk herniation or osteophyte formation of the vertebrae. Improved diagnosis and evaluation can be achieved using different imaging techniques: radiographs computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging. We retrospectively evaluated the potential influence of a virtual reality VR visualization technique on surgery planning and evaluation of postoperative results in patients with monosegmental unilateral osseous cervical neuroforaminal stenosis. Virtual Reality-Based Evaluation of Surgical Planning and Outcome of Monosegmental Unilateral Cervical Foraminal Stenosis.
