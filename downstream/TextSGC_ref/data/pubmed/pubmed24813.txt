"Recent decades have seen BCI applications as a novel and promising new channel of communication control and entertainment for disabled and healthy people. However BCI technology can be prone to errors due to the basic emotional state of the user: the performance of reactive and active BCIs decrease when user becomes stressed or bored for example. Passive-BCI is a recent approach that fuses BCI technology with cognitive monitoring providing valuable information about the users intentions the situational interpretations and mainly the emotional state. In this work an architecture composed by passive-BCI co-working with SSVEP-BCI is proposed with the aim of improving the performance of the reactive-BCI. The possibility of adjusting recognition characteristics of SSVEP-BCIs using a passive-BCI output is evaluated. In this sense two ways to recover the accuracy of SSVEP are presented in this paper: 1 Adjusting of Amplitude of the SSVEP and 2 Adjusting of Frequency of the SSVEP response. The results are promising because accuracy of SSVEP-BCI can be recovered in the case that it was reduced by the BCI users emotional state." Towards an architecture of a hybrid BCI based on SSVEP-BCI and passive-BCI.
