"The development of therapeutic approaches to improve the life quality of people suffering from different types of body paralysis is a current major medical challenge. Brain-machine interface BMI can potentially help reestablishing lost sensory and motor functions allowing patients to use their own brain activity to restore sensorimotor control of paralyzed body parts. Chronic implants of multielectrodes employed to record neural activity directly from the brain parenchyma constitute the fundamental component of a BMI. However before this technique may be effectively available to human clinical trials it is essential to characterize its long-term impact on the nervous tissue in animal models. In the present study we evaluated how chronic implanted tungsten microelectrode arrays impact the distribution and morphology of interneurons reactive to calcium-binding proteins calbindin CB calretinin CR and parvalbumin PV across the rats motor cortex. Our results revealed that chronic microelectrode arrays were well tolerated by the nervous tissue with recordings remaining viable for up to 6 months after implantation. Furthermore neither the morphology nor the distribution of inhibitory neurons were broadly impacted. Moreover restricted microglial activation was observed on the implanted sites. On the whole our results confirm and expand the notion that tungsten multielectrodes can be deemed as a feasible candidate to future human BMI studies."
