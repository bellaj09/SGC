"People with autism spectrum disorder ASD often have difficulty comprehending social situations in the complex dynamic contexts encountered in the real world. To study the social brain under conditions which approximate naturalistic situations we measured brain activity with FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: while participants watched a full-length episode of the sitcom The Office. Having quantified the degree of social awkwardness at each moment of the episode as judged by an independent sample of controls we found that both individuals with ASD and control participants showed reliable activation of several brain regions commonly associated with social perception and cognition e.g. those comprising the mentalizing network during the more awkward moments. However individuals with ASD showed less activity than controls in a region near right temporo-parietal junction RTPJ extending into the posterior end of the right superior temporal sulcus RSTS. Further analyses suggested that despite the free-form nature of the experimental design this group difference was specific to this RTPJ/RSTS area of the mentalizing network; other regions of interest showed similar activity across groups with respect to both location and magnitude. These findings add support to a body of evidence suggesting that RTPJ/RSTS plays a special role in social processes across modalities and may function atypically in individuals with ASD navigating the social world."
