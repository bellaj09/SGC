Rapid serial visual presentation RSVP combined with the detection of event-related brain responses facilitates the selection of relevant information contained in a stream of images presented rapidly to a human. Event related potentials ERPs measured non-invasively with electroencephalography EEG can be associated with infrequent targets amongst a stream of images. Human-machine symbiosis may be augmented by enabling human interaction with a computer without overt movement and/or enable optimization of image/information sorting processes involving humans. Features of the human visual system impact on the success of the RSVP paradigm but pre-attentive processing supports the identification of target information post presentation of the information by assessing the co-occurrence or time-locked EEG potentials. This paper presents a comprehensive review and evaluation of the limited but significant literature on research in RSVP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Applications that use RSVP-based BCIs are categorized based on display mode and protocol design whilst a range of factors influencing ERP evocation and detection are analyzed. Guidelines for using the RSVP-based BCI paradigms are recommended with a view to further standardizing methods and enhancing the inter-relatability of experimental design to support future research and the use of RSVP-based BCIs in practice. A review of rapid serial visual presentation-based brain-computer interfaces.
