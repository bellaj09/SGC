The efficacy and safety of Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate LDX in the treatment of moderate to severe binge eating disorder BED has been demonstrated in multiple randomised clinical trials. Despite this little is known about how LDX acts to improve binge eating symptoms. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms by which LDX improves symptoms of BED. We hypothesise that LDX will act by normalising connectivity within neural circuits responsible for reward and impulse control and that this normalisation will correlate with reduced binge eating episodes. Understanding the neural mechanisms of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate LDX pharmacotherapy in Binge Eating Disorder BED: a study protocol.
