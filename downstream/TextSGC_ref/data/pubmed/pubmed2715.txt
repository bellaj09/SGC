Sex differences in human cognition are marked but little is known regarding their neural origins. Here in a sample of 674 human participants ages 9-22 we demonstrate that sex differences in cognitive profiles are related to multivariate patterns of resting-state functional connectivity MRI rsfc-MRI. Males outperformed females on motor and spatial cognitive tasks; females were faster in tasks of emotion identification and nonverbal reasoning. Sex differences were also prominent in the rsfc-MRI data at multiple scales of analysis with males displaying more between-module connectivity while females demonstrated more within-module connectivity. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified subject sex on the basis of their cognitive profile with 63% accuracy P < 0.001 but was more accurate using functional connectivity data 71% accuracy; P < 0.001. Moreover the degree to which a given participant\s cognitive profile was "male" or "female" was significantly related to the masculinity or femininity of their pattern of brain connectivity P = 2.3  10-7. This relationship was present even when considering males and female separately. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time that sex differences in patterns of cognition are in part represented on a neural level through divergent patterns of brain connectivity.
