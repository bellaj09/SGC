Accurate segmentation of uterus uterine fibroids and spine from MR images is crucial for high intensity focused ultrasound HIFU therapy but remains still difficult to achieve because of 1 the large shape and size variations among individuals 2 the low contrast between adjacent organs and tissues and 3 the unknown number of uterine fibroids. To tackle this problem in this paper we propose a large kernel Encoder-Decoder Network based on a 2D segmentation model. The use of this large kernel can capture multi-scale contexts by enlarging the valid receptive field. In addition a deep multiple atrous convolution block is also employed to enlarge the receptive field and extract denser feature maps. Our approach is compared to both conventional and other deep learning methods and the experimental results conducted on a large dataset show its effectiveness.
