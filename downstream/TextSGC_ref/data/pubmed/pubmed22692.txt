Volume data acquisition three dimensional 3D imaging and multiplanar reformatting have become widely used for computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI. As an extension of this technology virtual endoscopic visualization of hollow organs has become a reality that is now finding its way into clinical CT practice. The same methods of computer processing as are used for CT and MRI can be applied to an ultrasound US volume image data set with the same potential output; namely 3D multiplanar and virtual endoscopic images. The use of this image processing technology for US applications has lagged behind the CT and MRI applications but considerable progress in applying these methods to US has occurred in recent years. As a result US virtual endoscopic imaging now can be performed on a clinical basis by using standard US instruments and commercially available computer software. The use of newer US imaging methods such as tissue harmonic and power Doppler imaging has enhanced the potential for US virtual endoscopy. This article reviews the technology of US virtual endoscopy. In addition our preliminary experience of using this method for abdominal and vascular diagnosis is described. Finally we speculate on technical improvements and potential applications that are likely in the future. Ultrasound virtual endoscopic imaging.
