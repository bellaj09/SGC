"Recent studies on brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP have demonstrated their use to control objects or generate commands in virtual reality VR environments. However most SSVEP-based BCI studies performed in VR environments have adopted visual stimuli that are typically used in conventional LCD environments without considering the differences in the rendering devices head-mounted displays HMDs used in the VR environments. The proximity between the visual stimuli and the eyes in HMDs can readily cause eyestrain degrading the overall performance of SSVEP-based BCIs. Therefore in the present study we have tested two different types of visual stimuli-pattern-reversal checkerboard stimulus PRCS and grow/shrink stimulus GSS-on young healthy participants wearing HMDs. Preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the visual comfort of each participant during the presentation of the visual stimuli. In subsequent online avatar control experiments we observed considerable differences in the classification accuracy of individual participants based on the type of visual stimuli used to elicit SSVEP. Interestingly there was a close relationship between the subjective visual comfort score and the online performance of the SSVEP-based BCI: most participants showed better classification accuracy under visual stimulus they were more comfortable with. Our experimental results suggest the importance of an appropriate visual stimulus to enhance the overall performance of the SSVEP-based BCIs in VR environments. In addition it is expected that the appropriate visual stimulus for a certain user might be readily selected by surveying the users visual comfort for different visual stimuli without the need for the actual BCI experiments."
