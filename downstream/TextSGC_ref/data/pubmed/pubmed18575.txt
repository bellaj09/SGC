A radial arm maze RAM is an essential tool for assessing spatial learning and memory. Although this tool is widely used to study deficits in spatial memory in animal models it has several restrictions that prevent its adaptation to human research and training. Therefore we developed a head-mounted-display RAM HMD-RAM program for humans and verified its validity by comparing it to the results obtained by previous RAM studies. We also compared the HMD and a flat monitor as experimental devices. Spatial Learning and Memory Using a Radial Arm Maze with a Head-Mounted Display.
