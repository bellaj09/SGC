A novel implant surgery support system with computer simulation for implant insertion and fabrication of a surgical template that helps in drilling bone was developed. A virtual reality haptic device that gives the sense of touch was used for simulation and a surgical template was fabricated by CAD/CAM method. Surgical guides were applied for two clinical cases. CAD/CAM fabrication and clinical application of surgical template and bone model in oral implant surgery.
