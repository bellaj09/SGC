"One of the main objectives of Active and Assisted Living AAL environments is to ensure that elderly and/or disabled people perform/live well in their immediate environments; this can be monitored by among others the recognition of emotions based on non-highly intrusive sensors such as Electrodermal Activity EDA sensors. However designing a learning system or building a machine-learning model to recognize human emotions while training the system on a specific group of persons and testing the system on a totally a new group of persons is still a serious challenge in the field as it is possible that the second testing group of persons may have different emotion patterns. Accordingly the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the field of human emotion recognition by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network CNN architecture which ensures promising robustness-related results for both subject-dependent and subject-independent human emotion recognition. The CNN model has been trained using a grid search technique which is a model hyperparameter optimization technique to fine-tune the parameters of the proposed CNN architecture. The overall concepts performance is validated and stress-tested by using MAHNOB and DEAP datasets. The results demonstrate a promising robustness improvement regarding various evaluation metrics. We could increase the accuracy for subject-independent classification to 78% and 82% for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively and to 81% and 85% subject-dependent classification for MAHNOB and DEAP respectively 4 classes/labels. The work shows clearly that while using solely the non-intrusive EDA sensors a robust classification of human emotion is possible even without involving additional/other physiological signals."
