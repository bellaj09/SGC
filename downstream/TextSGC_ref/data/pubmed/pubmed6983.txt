"Combining machine learning with neuroimaging data has a great potential for early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment MCI and Alzheimers disease AD. However it remains unclear how well the classifiers built on one population can predict MCI/AD diagnosis of other populations. This study aimed to employ a spectral graph convolutional neural network graph-CNN that incorporated cortical thickness and geometry to identify MCI and AD based on 3089 T1-weighted MRI data of the ADNI-2 cohort and to evaluate its feasibility to predict AD in the ADNI-1 cohort n\u202f=\u202f3602 and an Asian cohort n\u202f=\u202f347. For the ADNI-2 cohort the graph-CNN showed classification accuracy of controls CN vs. AD at 85.8% and early MCI EMCI vs. AD at 79.2% followed by CN vs. late MCI LMCI 69.3% LMCI vs. AD 65.2% EMCI vs. LMCI 60.9% and CN vs. EMCI 51.8%. We demonstrated the robustness of the graph-CNN among the existing deep learning approaches such as Euclidean-domain-based multilayer network and 1D CNN on cortical thickness and 2D and 3D CNNs on T1-weighted MR images of the ADNI-2 cohort. The graph-CNN also achieved the prediction on the conversion of EMCI to AD at 75% and that of LMCI to AD at 92%. The find-tuned graph-CNN further provided a promising CN vs. AD classification accuracy of 89.4% on the ADNI-1 cohort and >90% on the Asian cohort. Our study demonstrated the feasibility to transfer AD/MCI classifiers learned from one population to the other. Notably incorporating cortical geometry in CNN has the potential to improve classification performance."
