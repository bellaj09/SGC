User-worn sensing units composed of inertial and magnetic sensors are becoming increasingly popular in various domains including biomedical engineering robotics virtual reality where they can also be applied for real-time tracking of the orientation of human body parts in the three-dimensional 3D space. Although they are a promising choice as wearable sensors under many respects the inertial and magnetic sensors currently in use offer measuring performance that are critical in order to achieve and maintain accurate 3D-orientation estimates anytime and anywhere. This paper reviews the main sensor fusion and filtering techniques proposed for accurate inertial/magnetic orientation tracking of human body parts; it also gives useful recipes for their actual implementation. Estimating three-dimensional orientation of human body parts by inertial/magnetic sensing.
