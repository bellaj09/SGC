This case report evaluates virtual reality hypnosis VRH in treating chronic neuropathic pain in a patient with a 5-year history of failed treatments. The patient participated in a 6-month trial of VRH and her pain ratings of intensity and unpleasantness dropped on average 36% and 33% respectively over the course of 33 sessions. In addition she reported both no pain and a reduction of pain for an average of 3.86 and 12.21 hours respectively after treatment sessions throughout the course of the VRH treatment. These reductions and the duration of treatment effects following VRH treatment were superior to those following a trial of standard hypnosis non-VR treatment. However the pain reductions with VRH did not persist over long periods of time. The findings support the potential of VRH treatment for helping individuals with refractory chronic pain conditions.
