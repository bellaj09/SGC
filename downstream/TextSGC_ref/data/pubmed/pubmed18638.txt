Immersive virtual reality VR is a technology that provides a more realistic environmental design and object tracking than ordinary VR. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of immersive VR on upper extremity function in patients with ischemic stroke. Sixty-five patients with ischemic stroke were included in this randomized controlled double-blind study. Patients were randomly divided into VR n = 33 and control n = 32 groups. The VR group received 60 minutes of the upper extremity immersive VR rehabilitation program and the control group received 45 minutes of conventional therapy and 15 minutes of a sham VR program. Rehabilitation consisted of 18 sessions of therapy three days per week for six weeks. The outcome measures were the Action Research Arm Test ARAT Functional Independence Measure FIM Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale FMUE and Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills PASS. In both the VR and control groups all parameters except the PASS improved over time. However independent t-test results showed that all of the FMUE ARAT FIM and PASS scores were significantly higher in the VR group compared with the control p < 0.05. The minimal clinically important difference MCID scores of the FMUE and ARAT were higher than the cut-off MCID scores described in the literature in the VR group whereas the FIM scores were below the cut-off MCID scores. All scores in the control group were below the cut-off scores. Immersive VR rehabilitation appeared to be effective in improving upper extremity function and self-care skills but it did not improve functional independence.
