Deep learning research on relation classification has achieved solid performance in the general domain. This study proposes a convolutional neural network CNN architecture with a multi-pooling operation for medical relation classification on clinical records and explores a loss function with a category-level constraint matrix. Experiments using the 2010 i2b2/VA relation corpus demonstrate these models which do not depend on any external features outperform previous single-model methods and our best model is competitive with the existing ensemble-based method.
