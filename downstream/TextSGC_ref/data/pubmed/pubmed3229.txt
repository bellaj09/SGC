The Developing Human Connectome Project dHCP seeks to create the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life. Understanding this connectome in detail may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. Following established best practices adopted by the WU-MINN Human Connectome Project HCP and pioneered by FreeSurfer the project utilises cortical surface-based processing pipelines. In this paper we propose a fully automated processing pipeline for the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI of the developing neonatal brain. This proposed pipeline consists of a refined framework for cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation cortical surface extraction and cortical surface inflation which has been specifically designed to address considerable differences between adult and neonatal brains as imaged using MRI. Using the proposed pipeline our results demonstrate that images collected from 465 subjects ranging from 28 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age PMA can be processed fully automatically; generating cortical surface models that are topologically correct and correspond well with manual evaluations of tissue boundaries in 85% of cases. Results improve on state-of-the-art neonatal tissue segmentation models and significant errors were found in only 2% of cases where these corresponded to subjects with high motion. Downstream these surfaces will enhance comparisons of functional and diffusion MRI datasets supporting the modelling of emerging patterns of brain connectivity.
