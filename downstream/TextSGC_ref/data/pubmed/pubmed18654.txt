There is a need for a better understanding of underlying pathology in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD to develop more effective treatments. The late positive potential LPP amplitude from electroencephalogram has been used to assess individual differences in emotional reactivity. There is evidence that olfaction is particularly important in emotional processing in PTSD. The current study examined LPP amplitudes in response to olfactory stimuli in 24 combat veterans with PTSD and 24 nonmilitary/non-PTSD controls. An olfactometer delivered three negatively valenced odorants with 12 trials of each delivered in a random order. The groups did not differ in LPP amplitude across odorants. However within the PTSD group higher Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores related to an increased LPP amplitude after diesel fuel and rotten egg but not n_butanol odorants. Results provide specific targets and theory for further research into clinical applications such as selection of idiographic odorants for use in virtual-reality exposure therapy.
