A total of 9 participants with right-hemisphere stroke performed a new virtual reality VR wheelchair navigation test of lateralized spatial attention and neglect. The test consists of a virtual path along which participants navigate or are navigated as they name virtual objects encountered. There are 4 VR conditions obtained by crossing the factors array complexity and driver. Participants performed the VR task a real-life wheelchair navigation task and a battery of attention and neglect tests. The VR test showed sensitivity to both array complexity and driver exhibited strong correlations with the wheelchair navigation test and detected lateralized attention deficits in mild patients. The VR task thus shows promise as a sensitive efficient measure of real-life navigation. Assessment of spatial attention and neglect with a virtual wheelchair navigation task.
