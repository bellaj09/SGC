This paper presents the simulation tool called SDDRIVE Simple Simulation of Driver performance which is the numerical computerised implementation of the theoretical architecture describing Driver-Vehicle-Environment DVE interactions contained in Cacciabue and Carsten Cacciabue P.C. Carsten O. A simple model of driver behaviour to sustain design and safety assessment of automated systems in automotive environments 2010. Following a brief description of the basic algorithms that simulate the performance of drivers the paper presents and discusses a set of experiments carried out in a Virtual Reality full scale simulator for validating the simulation. Then the predictive potentiality of the tool is shown by discussing two case studies of DVE interactions performed in the presence of different driver attitudes in similar traffic conditions. A numerical tool for reproducing driver behaviour: experiments and predictive simulations.
