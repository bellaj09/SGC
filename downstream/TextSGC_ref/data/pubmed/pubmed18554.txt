Motion tracking systems are commonly used in virtual reality-based interventions to detect movements in the real world and transfer them to the virtual environment. There are different tracking solutions based on different physical principles which mainly define their performance parameters. However special requirements have to be considered for rehabilitation purposes. This paper studies and compares the accuracy and jitter of three tracking solutions optical electromagnetic and skeleton tracking in a practical scenario and analyzes the subjective perceptions of 19 healthy subjects 22 stroke survivors and 14 physical therapists. The optical tracking system provided the best accuracy 1.074  0.417 cm while the electromagnetic device provided the most inaccurate results 11.027  2.364 cm. However this tracking solution provided the best jitter values 0.324  0.093 cm in contrast to the skeleton tracking which had the worst results 1.522  0.858 cm. Healthy individuals and professionals preferred the skeleton tracking solution rather than the optical and electromagnetic solution in that order. Individuals with stroke chose the optical solution over the other options. Our results show that subjective perceptions and preferences are far from being constant among different populations thus suggesting that these considerations together with the performance parameters should be also taken into account when designing a rehabilitation system.
