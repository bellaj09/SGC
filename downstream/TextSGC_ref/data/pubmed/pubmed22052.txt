As fear of falling is related to the increased likelihood of falls it is important to understand the effects of threat-related factors fear anxiety and confidence on dynamic postural reactions. Previous studies designed to examine threat effects on dynamic postural reactions have methodological limitations and lack a comprehensive analysis of simultaneous kinetic kinematic and electromyographical recordings. The current study addressed these limitations by examining postural reactions of 26 healthy young adults to unpredictable anterior-posterior support-surface translations acceleration=0.6m/s2 constant velocity=0.25m/s total displacement=0.75m while standing on a narrow virtual surface at Low 0.4cm and High 3.2m virtual heights. Standing at virtual height increased fear and anxiety and decreased confidence. Prior to perturbations threat led to increased tonic muscle activity in tibialis anterior resulting in a higher co-contraction index between lower leg muscles. For backward perturbations muscle activity in the lower leg and arm and center of pressure peak displacements were earlier and larger when standing at virtual height. In addition arm flexion significantly increased while leg trunk and center of mass displacements remained unchanged across heights. When controlling for leaning threat-related factors can influence the neuro-mechanical responses to an unpredictable perturbation causing specific characteristics of postural reactions to be facilitated in young adults when their balance is threatened.
