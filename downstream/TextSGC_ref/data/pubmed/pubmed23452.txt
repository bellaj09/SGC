"Freezing of gait FOG an episodic gait disturbance characterized by the inability to generate effective stepping occurs in more than half of Parkinsons disease patients. It is associated with both executive dysfunction and attention and becomes most evident during dual tasking performing two tasks simultaneously. This study examined the effect of dual motor-cognitive virtual reality training on dual-task performance in FOG. Twenty community dwelling participants with Parkinsons disease 13 with FOG 7 without FOG participated in a pre-assessment eight 20-minute intervention sessions and a post-assessment. The intervention consisted of a virtual reality maze DFKI Germany through which participants navigated by stepping-in-place on a balance board Nintendo Japan under time pressure. This was combined with a cognitive task Stroop test which repeatedly divided participants attention. The primary outcome measures were pre- and post-intervention differences in motor stepping time symmetry rhythmicity and cognitive accuracy reaction time performance during single- and dual-tasks. Both assessments consisted of 1 a single cognitive task 2 a single motor task and 3 a dual motor-cognitive task. Following the intervention there was significant improvement in dual-task cognitive and motor parameters stepping time and rhythmicity dual-task effect for those with FOG and a noteworthy improvement in FOG episodes. These improvements were less significant for those without FOG. This is the first study to show benefit of a dual motor-cognitive approach on dual-task performance in FOG. Advances in such virtual reality interventions for home use could substantially improve the quality of life for patients who experience FOG."
