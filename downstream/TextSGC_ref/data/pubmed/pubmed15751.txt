"The present article is a part of a project for the measurement of presence in educational virtual environments VEs since presence is correlated with higher levels of cognitive performance and emotional development factors that contribute to knowledge construction. The aim of our study was to investigate the sense of presence of 12-year-old pupils within an educational VE representing an ancient Greek house through a sense of embodiment and the ability to handle task performance while using various peripheral devices. This is the first report on presence measurement with children based on the indication that children and adults may apply very unrelated criteria. Our results showed statistically significant differences on the level of tiredness and ease of use in using six different input devices. The combination of the keyboard and mouse and the keyboard on its own were the least tedious and easiest input devices giving a sense of presence as stated by the pupils. Environmental richness and the high level of interactivity within the VE resulted in a high degree of presence for almost all the pupils. The majority of them felt a sense of presence whilst driving the avatar indicating that presence is significantly correlated with pupils degree of association with their virtual bodies. All the pupils felt a sense of presence when wearing the head-mounted display. Our findings are in line with those of other researchers and show evidence of personal social and environmental presence." Factors that influence presence in educational virtual environments.
