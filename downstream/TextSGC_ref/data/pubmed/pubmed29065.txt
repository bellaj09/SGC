After about 30 years of research on Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs there is little knowledge about the phenomenon that some people - healthy as well as individuals with disease - are not able to learn BCI-control. To elucidate this "BCI-inefficiency" phenomenon the current study investigated whether psychological parameters such as attention span personality or motivation could predict performance in a single session with a BCI controlled by modulation of sensorimotor rhythms SMR with motor imagery. Psychological predictors of SMR-BCI performance.
