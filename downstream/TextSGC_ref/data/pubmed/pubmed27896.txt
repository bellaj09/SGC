Electrocorticogram recordings for neuroprosthetics provide an intermediate level of abstraction between EEG and microwire single neuron recordings. For adaptive filtering methodologies used in neuroprosthetics extraction of spatio-control parameters remains a difficulty. Since amplitude modulation in extracellular recordings plays a key role in both neuronal activation and rate coding seeking spatial pattern classification and temporally intermittent population synchronization in terms of increased voltage may provide viable control signals. This study seeks to explore preprocessing modalities that emphasize amplitude modulation in the ECoG above the level of noise and background fluctuations in order to derive the commands for complex control tasks. The decoding performance of the amplitude modulation across the recording spectra was found to be spatially specific in the cortex.
