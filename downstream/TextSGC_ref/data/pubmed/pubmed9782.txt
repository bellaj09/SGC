"It is clear that sport coaches learn from multiple interconnected learning experiences yet there is limited direct evidence to elucidate what is learned and how these combined experiences shape coaches knowledge and day-to-day practice. This research aimed to investigate the impact of the learning of two groups of English youth soccer coaches over a period of a year and a half. Using the Coach Analysis and Intervention System CAIS and associated video-stimulated recall interviews changes in the practice behaviours and knowledge use of coaches completing a formal coach education course and equivalent coaches not undertaking formal education were compared. Data indicated that the learning period had a different effect on coaches taking part in formal coach education versus those not in education. Changes in the use of knowledge about individual players and tactics were reflected in increased behaviours directed towards individuals and an altered proportion of technical to tactically related questioning linked to coaches participation in education. Overall more change was evident in coaching knowledge than in practice behaviours suggesting an absence of deep learning that bridged the knowledge-practice gap."
