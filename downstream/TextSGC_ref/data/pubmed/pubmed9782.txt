"In this paper we present a method that estimates reflectance and illumination information from a single image depicting a single-material specular object from a given class under natural illumination. We follow a data-driven learning-based approach trained on a very large dataset but in contrast to earlier work we do not assume one or more components shape reflectance or illumination to be known. We propose a two-step approach where we first estimate the objects reflectance map and then further decompose it into reflectance and illumination. For the first step we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network CNN that directly predicts a reflectance map from the input image itself as well as an indirect scheme that uses additional supervision first estimating surface orientation and afterwards inferring the reflectance map using a learning-based sparse data interpolation technique. For the second step we suggest a CNN architecture to reconstruct both Phong reflectance parameters and high-resolution spherical illumination maps from the reflectance map. We also propose new datasets to train these CNNs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both steps by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation in both synthetic and real data as well as through numerous applications that show improvements over the state-of-the-art."
