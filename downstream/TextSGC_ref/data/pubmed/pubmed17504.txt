The use of electronic health eHealth technologies in practice often is lower than expected mostly because there is no optimal fit among a technology the characteristics of prospective users and their context. To improve this fit a thorough systematic development process is recommended. However more knowledge about suitable development methods is necessary to create a tool kit that guides researchers in choosing development methods that are appropriate for their context and users. In addition there is a need for reflection on the existing frameworks for eHealth development to be able to constantly improve them.
