Classification of ultrasound US kidney images for diagnosis of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract CAKUT in children is a challenging task. It is desirable to improve existing pattern classification models that are built upon conventional image features. In this study we propose a transfer learning-based method to extract imaging features from US kidney images in order to improve the CAKUT diagnosis in children. Particularly a pre-trained deep learning model imagenet-caffe-alex is adopted for transfer learning-based feature extraction from 3-channel feature maps computed from US images including original images gradient features and distanced transform features. Support vector machine classifiers are then built upon different sets of features including the transfer learning features conventional imaging features and their combination. Experimental results have demonstrated that the combination of transfer learning features and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing CAKUT patients from normal controls based on their US kidney images.
