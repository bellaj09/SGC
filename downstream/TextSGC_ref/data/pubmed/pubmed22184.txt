We present an improvement to the quaternion-based signal analysis QSA technique to extract electroencephalography EEG signal features with a view to developing real-time applications particularly in motor imagery IM cognitive processes. The proposed methodology iQSA improved QSA extracts features such as the average variance homogeneity and contrast of EEG signals related to motor imagery in a more efficient manner i.e. by reducing the number of samples needed to classify the signal and improving the classification percentage compared to the original QSA technique. Specifically we can sample the signal in variable time periods from 0.5\u2009s to 3\u2009s in half-a-second intervals to determine the relationship between the number of samples and their effectiveness in classifying signals. In addition to strengthen the classification process a number of boosting-technique-based decision trees were implemented. The results show an 82.30% accuracy rate for 0.5\u2009s samples and 73.16% for 3\u2009s samples. This is a significant improvement compared to the original QSA technique that offered results from 33.31% to 40.82% without sampling window and from 33.44% to 41.07% with sampling window respectively. We can thus conclude that iQSA is better suited to develop real-time applications. Improving EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification for Real-Time Applications Using the QSA Method.
