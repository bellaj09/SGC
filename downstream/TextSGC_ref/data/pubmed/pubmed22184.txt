This article presents a real-time GPU-based post-filtering method for rendering acceptable depth-of-field effects suited for virtual reality. Blurring is achieved by nonlinearly interpolating mipmap images generated from a pinhole image. Major artifacts common in the post-filtering techniques such as bilinear magnification artifact intensity leakage and blurring discontinuity are practically eliminated via magnification with a circular filter anisotropic mipmapping and smoothing of blurring degrees. The whole framework is accelerated using GPU programs for constant and scalable real-time performance required for virtual reality. We also compare our method to recent GPU-based methods in terms of image quality and rendering performance. Real-time depth-of-field rendering using anisotropically filtered mipmap interpolation.
