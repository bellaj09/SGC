For the development of intelligent transportation systems if real-time information on the number of people on buses can be obtained it will not only help transport operators to schedule buses but also improve the convenience for passengers to schedule their travel times accordingly. This study proposes a method for estimating the number of passengers on a bus. The method is based on deep learning to estimate passenger occupancy in different scenarios. Two deep learning methods are used to accomplish this: the first is a convolutional autoencoder mainly used to extract features from crowds of passengers and to determine the number of people in a crowd; the second is the you only look once version 3 architecture mainly for detecting the area in which head features are clearer on a bus. The results obtained by the two methods are summed to calculate the current passenger occupancy rate of the bus. To demonstrate the algorithmic performance experiments for estimating the number of passengers at different bus times and bus stops were performed. The results indicate that the proposed system performs better than some existing methods. Estimation of the Number of Passengers in a Bus Using Deep Learning.
