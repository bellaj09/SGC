The ability of Immersive Virtual Reality IVR systems to mimic the real world has made it possible to use this technology to create environments for remote collaborative work. This study aimed to understand the feasibility of immersive virtual reality when conducting a collaborative Information Architecture IA design task-card sorting with geographically dispersed participants. Using a between-subjects experimental design thirty groups of two individuals each completed a card sorting activity using conventional in-person video screen-sharing method or immersive virtual reality methods. The dependent measures included total time percentage match with master card set usability presence and perceived workload. Overall usability was found to be significantly higher for the immersive virtual reality condition when compared to conventional in-person card sorting. In addition the new immersive virtual reality technology performed as well as the other two conditions for other dependent variables. Qualitative data from the participants also indicated a positive reaction to the use of immersive virtual reality for this task. Overall the participants felt they were productive and enjoyed the IVR condition indicating the potential of IVR-based approaches as an alternative to conventional approaches for IA design. An empirical study to investigate the efficacy of collaborative immersive virtual reality systems for designing information architecture of software systems.
