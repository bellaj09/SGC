"To real-timely feel and see the manipulation process of multi-wall carbon nanotube MWCNT is required to better control its assembly based on atomic force microscope. Here real-time three-dimensional interactive forces between the probe and the sample can be fed back to the operator according to the proposed force model and position sensitive detectors signals and MWCNT motion can be online displayed on the visual interface according to probe position and applied force based on the proposed MWCNT motion model and virtual reality technology. Based on force and visual feedback the process and result of MWCNT manipulation can be online controlled and MWCNT manipulation experiment will be performed to verify the effectiveness of the method." AFM based MWCNT nanomanipulation with force and visual feedback.
