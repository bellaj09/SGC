"MicroRNAs miRNAs are small double-stranded RNAs that exert a fine-tuning sequence-specific regulation of cell transcriptome. While one unique miRNA regulates hundreds of mRNAs each mRNA molecule is commonly regulated by various miRNAs that bind to complementary sequences at 3-untranslated regions for triggering the mechanism of RNA interference. Unfortunately dysregulated miRNAs play critical roles in many disorders including Parkinsons disease PD the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world. Treatment of this slowly progressive and yet incurable pathology challenges neurologists. In addition to L-DOPA that restores dopaminergic transmission and ameliorate motor signs i.e. bradykinesia rigidity tremors patients commonly receive medication for mood disorders and autonomic dysfunctions. However the effectiveness of L-DOPA declines over time and the L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias commonly appear and become highly disabling. The discovery of more effective therapies capable of slowing disease progression -a neuroprotective agent-remains a critical need in PD. The present review focus on miRNAs as promising drug targets for PD examining their role in underlying mechanisms of the disease the strategies for controlling aberrant expressions and finally the current technologies for translating these small molecules from bench to clinics."
