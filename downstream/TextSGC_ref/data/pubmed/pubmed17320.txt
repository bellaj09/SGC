Fueled by innovation in the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities recent developments in computational neuroscience have used goal-driven hierarchical convolutional neural networks HCNNs to make strides in modeling neural single-unit and population responses in higher visual cortical areas. In this Perspective we review the recent progress in a broader modeling context and describe some of the key technical innovations that have supported it. We then outline how the goal-driven HCNN approach can be used to delve even more deeply into understanding the development and organization of sensory cortical processing. Using goal-driven deep learning models to understand sensory cortex.
