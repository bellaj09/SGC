"The management of pain and sedation during burn dressing change is challenging. Previous reviews and studies have identified wide variability in such practices in hospitalized burn patients. This survey-based study aimed to determine the most commonly utilized sedation and analgesia practices in adult burn patients treated in the outpatient setting. The goal was to identify opportunities for improvement and to assist burn centers in optimizing sedation procedures. A 23-question survey was sent to members of the American Burn Association. Nonpharmacological interventions including music television games and virtual reality were used by 68% of survey respondents. Eighty-one percent reported premedicating with oral opioids 32% with intravenous opioids and 45% with anxiolytics. Fifty-nine percentage of respondents indicated that the initial medication regimen for outpatient dressing changes consisted of the patients existing oral pain medications. Forty-three percent indicated that there were no additional options if this regimen provided inadequate analgesia. Fifty-six percentage of respondents felt that pain during dressing change was adequately controlled 75% to 100% of the time and 32% felt it was adequately controlled 50% to 75% of the time. Nitrous oxide was used by 8%. Anesthesia providers and an acute pain service are available in a minority of cases 13.7% and 28% respectively and are rarely consulted. Procedural burn pain remains significantly undertreated in the outpatient setting and the approach to treatment is variable among burn centers in the United States. Such variation likely represents an opportunity for identifying and implementing optimal practices and developing guidelines for burn pain management in the outpatient setting."
