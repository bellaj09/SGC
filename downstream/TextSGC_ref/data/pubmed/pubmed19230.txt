When the International Space Station ISS is completed and starts its operation crew members will be stationed for three months or more in orbit aboard the ISS. As they stay longer in the space environment "habitability" for them will become most important in the design of the interior space. One of the problems about habitability in a zero gravity 0 G environment is disorientation. Crew members have difficulty in discriminating between "up" and "down" and more serious disorientations may cause space motion sickness. Crew members rely on visual perception to orient themselves because they can\t use their sense of equilibrium in a 0 G environment. Although color and the direction of equipment of Space Shuttles or modules has been considered no systematic study has been conducted on interior space. This study intended to clarify how people acquire visual information and recognize their orientation in a 0 G environment by an experiment in which a subject wears a head-mounted display HMD and enters a virtual weightless state represented by computer graphics CG. Visual information of a room and the degree-of-freedom of motion were varied to examine the influence of the conditions on such a simple task as movement through several connected modules and the performance and the behavior of each subject were investigated.
