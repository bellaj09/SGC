Coral reefs around the world are under threat due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment. It is therefore important to develop methods to monitor the status of the reefs and detect changes in the health condition of the corals at an early stage before severe damage occur. In this work we evaluate underwater hyperspectral imaging as a method to detect changes in health status of both orange and white color morphs of the coral species Lophelia pertusa. Differing health status was achieved by exposing 60 coral samples to the toxic compound 2-methylnaphthalene in concentrations of 0 mg L-1 to 3.5 mg L-1. A machine learning model was utilized to classify corals according to lethal concentration LC levels LC5 5% mortality and LC25 25% mortality solely based on their reflectance spectra. All coral samples were classified to correct concentration group. This is a first step towards developing a remote sensing technique able to assess environmental impact on deep-water coral habitats over larger areas.
