Undersampling in Fourier single pixel imaging FSI is often employed to reduce imaging time for real-time applications. However the undersampled reconstruction contains ringing artifacts Gibbs phenomenon that occur because the high-frequency target information is not recorded. Furthermore by employing 3-step FSI strategy reduced measurements with low noise suppression with a low-grade sensor i.e. photodiode this ringing is coupled with noise to produce unwanted artifacts lowering image quality. To improve the imaging quality of real-time FSI a fast image reconstruction framework based on deep convolutional autoencoder network DCAN is proposed. The network through context learning over FSI artifacts is capable of deringing denoising and recovering details in 256\u2009\u2009256 images. The promising experimental results show that the proposed deep-learning-based FSI outperforms conventional FSI in terms of image quality even at very low sampling rates 1-4%.
