We introduce here ML4Tox a framework offering Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine models to predict agonist antagonist and binding activities of chemical compounds in this case for the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain. The ML4Tox models have been developed with a 10\u2009\u20095-fold cross-validation schema on the training portion of the CERAPP ToxCast dataset formed by 1677 chemicals each described by 777 molecular features. On the CERAPP "All Literature" evaluation set agonist: 6319 compounds; antagonist 6539; binding 7283 ML4Tox significantly improved sensitivity over published results on all three tasks with agonist: 0.78 vs 0.56; antagonist: 0.69 vs 0.11; binding: 0.66 vs 0.26. Machine learning models for predicting endocrine disruption potential of environmental chemicals.
