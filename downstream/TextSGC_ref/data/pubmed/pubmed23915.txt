In the last decade Virtual Reality has encountered a continuous development concerning medical purposes and there are a lot of devices based on the classic "cyberglove" concept that are used as new therapeutic method for upper limb pathology especially neurologic problems 1;2;3. One of the VR devices is Pablo Tyromotion with very sensitive sensors that can measure the hand grip strenght and the pinch force also the ROM range of motion for all the joints of the upper limb shoulder elbow wrist and offering the possibility of interactive games based on Virtual Reality concept with application in occupational therapy programs. We used Pablo in our study on patients with hand surgery as an objective tool for assessment and as additional therapeutic method to the classic Rehabilitation program 4;5. The results of the study proved that Pablo represents a modern option for evaluation of hand deficits and dysfunctions with objective measurement replacement of classic goniometry and dynamometry with computerized data base of patients with monitoring of parameters during the recovery program and with better muscular and neuro-cognitive feedback during the interactive therapeutic modules. Virtual reality as a method for evaluation and therapy after traumatic hand surgery.
