Neuronavigation systems are routinely used during neurosurgical procedures. Currently new imaging technologies are emerging such as virtual augmented and mixed reality. With mixed-reality devices the user can analyze and interact with the real environment using virtual objects. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to offer a proof of concept by testing the clinical feasibility and accuracy of a wearable mixed-reality device Hololens for preoperative neurosurgical planning. Clinical Feasibility of a Wearable Mixed-Reality Device in Neurosurgery.
