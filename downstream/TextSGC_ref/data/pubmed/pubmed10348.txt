In this paper we propose a method for deep-learning-based real-time road traffic predictions using long-term evolution LTE access data. The proposed system generates a road traffic speed learning model based on road speed data and historical LTE data collected from a plurality of base stations located within a predetermined radius from the road. Real-time LTE data were the input for the generated learning model in order to predict the real-time speed of traffic. Since the system was developed using a time-series-based road traffic speed learning model based on LTE data from the past it is possible for it to be used for a road where the environment has changed. Moreover even on roads where the collection of traffic data is invalid such as a radio shadow area it is possible to directly enter real-time wireless communications data into the traffic speed learning model to predict the traffic speed on the road in real time and in turn raise the accuracy of real-time road traffic predictions.
