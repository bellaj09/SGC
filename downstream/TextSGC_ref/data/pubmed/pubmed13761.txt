In this paper we present a semi-supervised deep learning approach to accurately recover high-resolution HR CT images from low-resolution LR counterparts. Specifically with the generative adversarial network GAN as the building block we enforce the cycle-consistency in terms of the Wasserstein distance to establish a nonlinear end-to-end mapping from noisy LR input images to denoised and deblurred HR outputs. We also include the joint constraints in the loss function to facilitate structural preservation. In this process we incorporate deep convolutional neural network CNN residual learning and network in network techniques for feature extraction and restoration. In contrast to the current trend of increasing network depth and complexity to boost the imaging performance we apply a parallel 11 CNN to compress the output of the hidden layer and optimize the number of layers and the number of filters for each convolutional layer. The quantitative and qualitative evaluative results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate efficient and robust for super-resolution SR image restoration from noisy LR input images. In particular we validate our composite SR networks on three large-scale CT datasets and obtain promising results as compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.
