This invited review is based upon a recent oral paper I presented at the Virtual Reality Symposium of the 34th International Ethological Conference 2015 Cairns Australia and as such it describes studies conducted mainly in my own laboratory. It reviews how we utilized visual stimuli for inducing behavioral responses in the zebrafish with a focus on shoaling group forming behavior. The zebrafish is gaining increasing popularity in neuroscience. With this interest its behavior is also more frequently studied. One of the many advantages of the zebrafish over traditional laboratory rodents is that this species is diurnal and it relies heavily upon its visual system. Thus similarly to our own species zebrafish respond to visual stimuli in a robust and easily quantifiable manner. For the past decade we have been exploring how to use such visual stimuli and have developed numerous paradigms with which we can induce and quantify a variety of behavioral responses including shoaling. This review summarizes some of these studies and discusses questions including whether one should use live fish as stimulus whether and how one could present animated moving images of fish and how one could optimize a range of stimulus presentation parameters to elicit the most robust responses in zebrafish. Although the zebrafish is a relative newcomer in ethology and behavioral neuroscience and although many of our findings only represent the first steps in this research our results suggest that the behavioral analysis of the zebrafish will have an important place in biomedical research.
