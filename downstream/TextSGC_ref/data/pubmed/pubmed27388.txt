Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy TR-fNIRS based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for "mental communication" on healthy participants. Twenty-one 21 participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for "yes" and to stay relaxed for "no." The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as "yes" or "no" responses. Linear-discriminant analysis LDA and support vector machine SVM classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76% using LDA and SVM respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition physiological parameters heart rate HR and mean arterial pressure MAP were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery MI and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.
