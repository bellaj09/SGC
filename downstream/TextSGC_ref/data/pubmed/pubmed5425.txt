The present study describes extraction of high-resolution structural connectome HRSC in 99 healthy subjects acquired and made available by the Human Connectome Project. Single subject connectomes were then registered to the common surface space to allow assessment of inter-individual reproducibility of this novel technique using a leave-one-out approach. The anatomic relevance of the surface-based connectome was examined via a clustering algorithm which identified anatomic subdivisions within the striatum. The connectivity of these striatal subdivisions were then mapped on the cortical and other subcortical surfaces. Findings demonstrate that HRSC analysis is robust across individuals and accurately models the actual underlying brain networks related to the striatum. This suggests that this method has the potential to model and characterize the healthy whole-brain structural network at high anatomic resolution.
