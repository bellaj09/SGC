Here we report PPB2 as a target prediction tool assigning targets to a query molecule based on ChEMBL data. PPB2 computes ligand similarities using molecular fingerprints encoding composition MQN molecular shape and pharmacophores Xfp and substructures ECfp4 and features an unprecedented combination of nearest neighbor NN searches and Nave Bayes NB machine learning together with simple NN searches NB and Deep Neural Network DNN machine learning models as further options. Although NNECfp4 gives the best results in terms of recall in a 10-fold cross-validation study combining NN searches with NB machine learning provides superior precision statistics as well as better results in a case study predicting off-targets of a recently reported TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor illustrating the value of this combined approach. PPB2 is available to assess possible off-targets of small molecule drug-like compounds by public access at http://gdb.unibe.ch .
