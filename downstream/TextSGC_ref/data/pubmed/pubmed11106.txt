Reliable automated segmentation of the prostate is indispensable for image-guided prostate interventions. However the segmentation task is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions variation in prostate anatomy among other problems. Manual segmentation can be time-consuming and is subject to inter- and intraobserver variation. We developed an automated deep learning-based method to address this technical challenge. Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.
