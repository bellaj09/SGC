The digitalization of modern imaging has led radiologists to become very familiar with computers and their user interfaces UI. New options for display and command offer expanded possibilities but the mouse and keyboard remain the most commonly utilized for usability reasons. In this work we review and discuss different UI and their possible application in radiology. We consider two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging displays in the context of interventional radiology and discuss interest in touchscreens kinetic sensors eye detection and augmented or virtual reality. We show that UI design specifically for radiologists is key for future use and adoption of such new interfaces. Next-generation UI must fulfil professional needs while considering contextual constraints. TEACHING POINTS:  The mouse and keyboard remain the most utilized user interfaces for radiologists.  Touchscreen holographic kinetic sensors and eye tracking offer new possibilities for interaction.  3D and 2D imaging require specific user interfaces.  Holographic display and augmented reality provide a third dimension to volume imaging.  Good usability is essential for adoption of new user interfaces by radiologists. A review of existing and potential computer user interfaces for modern radiology.
