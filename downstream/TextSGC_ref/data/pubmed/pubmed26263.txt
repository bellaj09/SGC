In this paper we present a novel approach for stable interactive cutting of deformable objects in virtual environments. Our method is based on the extended finite elements method allowing for a modeling of discontinuities without remeshing. As no new elements are created the impact on simulation performance is minimized. We also propose an appropriate mass lumping technique to guarantee for the stability of the simulation regardless of the position of the cut. A stable cutting method for finite elements based virtual surgery simulation.
