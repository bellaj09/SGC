Understanding the dynamics of vestibular perception is important for example for improving the realism of motion simulation and virtual reality environments or for diagnosing patients suffering from vestibular problems. Previous research has found a dependence of direction discrimination thresholds for rotational motions on the period length inverse frequency of a transient single cycle sinusoidal acceleration stimulus. However self-motion is seldom purely sinusoidal and up to now no models have been proposed that take into account non-sinusoidal stimuli for rotational motions. In this work the influence of both the period length and the specific time course of an inertial stimulus is investigated. Thresholds for three acceleration profile shapes triangular sinusoidal and trapezoidal were measured for three period lengths 0.3 1.4 and 6.7\xa0s in ten participants. A two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task was used where participants had to judge if a yaw rotation around an earth-vertical axis was leftward or rightward. The peak velocity of the stimulus was varied and the threshold was defined as the stimulus yielding 75\xa0% correct answers. In accordance with previous research thresholds decreased with shortening period length from ~2\xa0deg/s for 6.7\xa0s to ~0.8\xa0deg/s for 0.3\xa0s. The peak velocity was the determining factor for discrimination: Different profiles with the same period length have similar velocity thresholds. These measurements were used to fit a novel model based on a description of the firing rate of semi-circular canal neurons. In accordance with previous research the estimates of the model parameters suggest that velocity storage does not influence perceptual thresholds.
