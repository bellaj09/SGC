This study sought to develop a method that supports a more evidence-based approach to evaluating multiple design options in virtual reality VR combining subjective insights gathered using traditional approaches and objective feedback gathered using the VR platform. Additionally this study sought to understand how objective data garnered from the VR platform could be used to compliment traditional evaluation strategies. Using Virtual Reality to Compare Design Alternatives Using Subjective and Objective Evaluation Methods.
