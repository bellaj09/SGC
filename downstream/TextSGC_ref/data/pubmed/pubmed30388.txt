No effective therapeutic interventions exist for severe neural pathologies despite significant advances in regenerative medicine rehabilitation and neuroprosthetics. Our current hypothesis is that a specific combination of tissue engineering pharmacology cell replacement drug delivery and electrical stimulation together with plasticity-promoting and locomotor training neurorehabilitation is necessary to interact synergistically in order to activate and enable all damaged circuits. We postulate that various convergent themes exist among the different therapeutic fields. Therefore the objective of this review is to highlight the convergent themes which we believe have a common goal of restoring function after neural damage. The convergent themes discussed in this review include modulation of inflammation and secondary damage encouraging endogenous repair/regeneration using scaffolds cell transplantation and drug delivery application of electrical fields to modulate healing and/or activity and finally modulation of plasticity. Toward a convergence of regenerative medicine rehabilitation and neuroprosthetics.
