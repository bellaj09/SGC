An automated plant species identification system could help botanists and layman in identifying plant species rapidly. Deep learning is robust for feature extraction as it is superior in providing deeper information of images. In this research a new CNN-based method named D-Leaf was proposed. The leaf images were pre-processed and the features were extracted by using three different Convolutional Neural Network CNN models namely pre-trained AlexNet fine-tuned AlexNet and D-Leaf. These features were then classified by using five machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine SVM Artificial Neural Network ANN k-Nearest-Neighbor k-NN Nave-Bayes NB and CNN. A conventional morphometric method computed the morphological measurements based on the Sobel segmented veins was employed for benchmarking purposes. The D-Leaf model achieved a comparable testing accuracy of 94.88 percent as compared to AlexNet 93.26 percent and fine-tuned AlexNet 95.54 percent models. In addition CNN models performed better than the traditional morphometric measurements 66.55 percent. The features extracted from the CNN are found to be fitted well with the ANN classifier. D-Leaf can be an effective automated system for plant species identification as shown by the experimental results. Deep Learning for Plant Species Classification Using Leaf Vein Morphometric.
