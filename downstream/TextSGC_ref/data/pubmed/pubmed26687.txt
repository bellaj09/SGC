Adaptive behavior relies on the ability of the brain to form predictions and monitor action outcomes. In the human brain the same system is thought to monitor action outcomes regardless of whether the information originates from internal e.g. proprioceptive and external e.g. visual sensory channels. Neural signatures of processing motor errors and action outcomes communicated by external feedback have been studied extensively; however the existence of such a general action-monitoring system has not been tested directly. Here we use concurrent EEG-MEG measurements and a probabilistic learning task to demonstrate that event-related responses measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography display spatiotemporal patterns that allow an effective transfer of a multivariate statistical model discriminating the outcomes across the following conditions: a erroneous versus correct motor output b negative versus positive feedback c high- versus low-surprise negative feedback and d erroneous versus correct brain-computer-interface output. We further show that these patterns originate from highly-overlapping neural sources in the medial frontal and the medial parietal cortices. We conclude that information about action outcomes arriving from internal or external sensory channels converges to the same neural system in the human brain that matches this information to the internal predictions. Evidence for a general performance-monitoring system in the human brain.
