Stroke rehabilitation has undergone a revolution over the last three decades. Cohort studies have consistently reinforced the importance of post-stroke rehabilitation to stimulate recovery but the concepts of empirical methods originally proposed by therapists to rehabilitate these patients have not withstood clinical analysis. Functional neuroimaging and animal models have unveiled the mechanisms underlying functional recovery and helped teams understand its limitations and improvement modalities. These neuroscience discoveries constitute the grounds needed to understand the emergence of new technologies: robotics and virtual reality. The objective of this review of the literature was to select key works in this field to better understand current therapeutic possibilities. Post-stroke hemiplegia rehabilitation: evolution of the concepts.
