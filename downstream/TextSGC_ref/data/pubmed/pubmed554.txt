Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 is a major healthcare threat. Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We here aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. Profiling Early Humoral Response to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease COVID-19.
