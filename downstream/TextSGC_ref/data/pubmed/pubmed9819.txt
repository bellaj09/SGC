Artificial neural networks ANNs aim to simulate the biological neural activities. Interestingly many "engineering" prospects in ANN have relied on motivations from cognition and psychology studies. So far two important learning theories that have been subject of active research are the prototype and adaptive learning theories. The learning rules employed for ANNs can be related to adaptive learning theory where several examples of the different classes in a task are supplied to the network for adjusting internal parameters. Conversely the prototype-learning theory uses prototypes representative examples; usually one prototype per class of the different classes contained in the task. These prototypes are supplied for systematic matching with new examples so that class association can be achieved. In this paper we propose and implement a novel neural network algorithm based on modifying the emotional neural network EmNN model to unify the prototype- and adaptive-learning theories. We refer to our new model as "prototype-incorporated EmNN". Furthermore we apply the proposed model to two real-life challenging tasks namely static hand-gesture recognition and face recognition and compare the result to those obtained using the popular back-propagation neural network BPNN emotional BPNN EmNN deep networks an exemplar classification model and k-nearest neighbor.
