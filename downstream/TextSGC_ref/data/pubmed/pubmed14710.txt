Consistent empirical results showed that both night and day sleep enhanced memory consolidation. In this study we explore processes of consolidation of memory during awake hours. Since theta oscillations have been shown to play a central role in exchange of information we hypothesized that elevated theta during awake hours will enhance memory consolidation. We used a neurofeedback protocol to enhance the relative power of theta or beta oscillations. Participants trained on a tapping task were divided into three groups: neurofeedback theta; neurofeedback beta; control. We found a significant improvement in performance in the theta group relative to the beta and control groups immediately after neurofeedback. Performance was further improved after night sleep in all groups with a significant advantage favoring the theta group. Theta power during training was correlated with the level of improvement indicating a clear relationship between memory consolidation and theta neurofeedback. Better than sleep: theta neurofeedback training accelerates memory consolidation.
