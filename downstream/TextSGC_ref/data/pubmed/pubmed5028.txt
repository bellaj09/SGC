Resting-state functional connectivity FC which measures the temporal correlation of spontaneous hemodynamic activity between distant brain areas is a widely accepted method in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to assess the connectome of healthy and diseased human brains. A common assumption underlying FC is that it reflects the temporal structure of large-scale neuronal activity that is converted into large-scale hemodynamic activity. However direct observation of such relationship has been difficult. In this commentary we describe our recent progress regarding this topic. Recently transgenic mice that express a genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in neocortical neurons are enabling the optical recording of neuronal activity in large-scale with high spatiotemporal resolution. Using these mice we devised a method to simultaneously monitor neuronal and hemodynamic activity and addressed some key issues related to the neuronal basis of FC. We propose that many important questions about human resting-state fMRI can be answered using GCaMP expressing transgenic mice as a model system.
