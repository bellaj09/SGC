Individuals with vestibular dysfunction may experience visual vertigo VV in which symptoms are provoked or exacerbated by excessive or disorientating visual stimuli e.g. supermarkets. VV can significantly improve when customized vestibular rehabilitation exercises are combined with exposure to optokinetic stimuli. Virtual reality VR which immerses patients in realistic visually challenging environments has also been suggested as an adjunct to VR to improve VV symptoms. This pilot study compared the responses of sixteen patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorder randomly allocated to a VR regime incorporating exposure to a static Group S or dynamic Group D VR environment. Participants practiced vestibular exercises twice weekly for four weeks inside a static Group S or dynamic Group D virtual crowded square environment presented in an immersive projection theatre IPT and received a vestibular exercise program to practice on days not attending clinic. A third Group D1 completed both the static and dynamic VR training. Treatment response was assessed with the Dynamic Gait Index and questionnaires concerning symptom triggers and psychological state. At final assessment significant between-group differences were noted between Groups D p=0.001 and D1 p=0.03 compared to Group S for VV symptoms with the former two showing a significant 59.2% and 25.8% improvement respectively compared to 1.6% for the latter. Depression scores improved only for Group S p=0.01 while a trend towards significance was noted for Group D regarding anxiety scores p=0.07.
