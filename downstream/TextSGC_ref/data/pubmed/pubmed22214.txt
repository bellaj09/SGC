: Optimal atrial septal defect ASD closure should combine off-pump techniques with the effectiveness and versatility of open-heart techniques. We report our experience with off-pump ASD closure using the Universal Cardiac Introducer UCI in a porcine model. The goal was to create an ASD over the fossa ovale FO and position a patch over the ASD under ultrasound US imaging and augmented virtual reality guidance. Off-pump atrial septal defect closure using the universal cardiac introducer: creation of models of atrial septal defects in the pig access and surgical technique.
