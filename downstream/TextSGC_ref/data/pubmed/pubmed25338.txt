"In the past decade there has been a rapid advance in Virtual Reality VR technology. Key to the users VR experience are multimodal interactions involving all senses. The human brain must integrate real-time vision hearing vestibular and proprioceptive inputs to produce the compelling and captivating feeling of immersion in a VR environment. A serious problem with VR is that users may develop symptoms similar to motion sickness a malady called cybersickness. At present the underlying cause of cybersickness is not yet fully understood. Cybersickness may be due to a discrepancy between the sensory signals which provide information about the bodys orientation and motion: in many VR applications optic flow elicits an illusory sensation of motion which tells users that they are moving in a certain direction with certain acceleration. However since users are not actually moving their proprioceptive and vestibular organs provide no cues of self-motion. These conflicting signals may lead to sensory discrepancies and eventually cybersickness. Here we review the current literature to develop a conceptual scheme for understanding the neural mechanisms of cybersickness. We discuss an approach to cybersickness based on sensory cue integration focusing on the dynamic re-weighting of visual and vestibular signals for self-motion."
