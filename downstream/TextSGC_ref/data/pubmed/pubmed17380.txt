The proliferation of high resolution and affordable virtual reality VR headsets is quickly making room-scale VR experiences available in our homes. Most VR experiences strive to achieve complete immersion by creating a disconnect from the real world. However due to the lack of a standardized notification management system and minimal context awareness in VR an immersed user may face certain situations such as missing an important phone call digital scenario tripping over wandering pets physical scenario or losing track of time temporal scenario. In this paper we present the results of 1 a survey across 61 VR users to understand common interruptions and scenarios that would benefit from some form of notifications; 2 a design exercise with VR professionals to explore possible notification methods; and 3 an empirical study on the noticeability and perception of 5 different VR interruption scenarios across 6 modality combinations e.g. audio visual haptic audio + haptic visual + haptic and audio + visual implemented in Unity and presented using the HTC Vive headset. Finally we combine key learnings from each of these steps along with participant feedback to present a set of observations and recommendations for notification design in VR.
