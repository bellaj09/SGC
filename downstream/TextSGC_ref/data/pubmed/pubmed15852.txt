The advent of new devices technology machine learning techniques and the availability of free large speech corpora results in rapid and accurate speech recognition. In the last two decades extensive research has been initiated by researchers and different organizations to experiment with new techniques and their applications in speech processing systems. There are several speech command based applications in the area of robotics IoT ubiquitous computing and different human-computer interfaces. Various researchers have worked on enhancing the efficiency of speech command based systems and used the speech command dataset. However none of them catered to noise in the same. Noise is one of the major challenges in any speech recognition system as real-time noise is a very versatile and unavoidable factor that affects the performance of speech recognition systems particularly those that have not learned the noise efficiently. We thoroughly analyse the latest trends in speech recognition and evaluate the speech command dataset on different machine learning based and deep learning based techniques. A novel technique is proposed for noise robustness by augmenting noise in training data. Our proposed technique is tested on clean and noisy data along with locally generated data and achieves much better results than existing state-of-the-art techniques thus setting a new benchmark.
