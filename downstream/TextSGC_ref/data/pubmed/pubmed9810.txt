Compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging CS-MRI enables fast acquisition which is highly desirable for numerous clinical applications. This can not only reduce the scanning cost and ease patient burden but also potentially reduce motion artefacts and the effect of contrast washout thus yielding better image quality. Different from parallel imaging-based fast MRI which utilizes multiple coils to simultaneously receive MR signals CS-MRI breaks the Nyquist-Shannon sampling barrier to reconstruct MRI images with much less required raw data. This paper provides a deep learning-based strategy for reconstruction of CS-MRI and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning methods working only on data from a single image and prior knowledge from large training data sets. In particular a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-based model DAGAN-based model is proposed to reconstruct CS-MRI. In our DAGAN architecture we have designed a refinement learning method to stabilize our U-Net based generator which provides an end-to-end network to reduce aliasing artefacts. To better preserve texture and edges in the reconstruction we have coupled the adversarial loss with an innovative content loss. In addition we incorporate frequency-domain information to enforce similarity in both the image and frequency domains. We have performed comprehensive comparison studies with both conventional CS-MRI reconstruction methods and newly investigated deep learning approaches. Compared with these methods our DAGAN method provides superior reconstruction with preserved perceptual image details. Furthermore each image is reconstructed in about 5 ms which is suitable for real-time processing.
