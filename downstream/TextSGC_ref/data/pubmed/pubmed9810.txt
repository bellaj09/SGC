As an emerging sub-field of music information retrieval MIR music imagery information retrieval MIIR aims to retrieve information from brain activity recorded during music cognition-such as listening to or imagining music pieces. This is a highly inter-disciplinary endeavor that requires expertise in MIR as well as cognitive neuroscience and psychology. The OpenMIIR initiative strives to foster collaborations between these fields to advance the state of the art in MIIR. As a first step electroencephalography EEG recordings of music perception and imagination have been made publicly available enabling MIR researchers to easily test and adapt their existing approaches for music analysis like fingerprinting beat tracking or tempo estimation on this new kind of data. This paper reports on first results of MIIR experiments using these OpenMIIR datasets and points out how these findings could drive new research in cognitive neuroscience.
