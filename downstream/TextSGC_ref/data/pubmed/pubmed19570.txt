Emotional creativity EC which constitutes a main aspect of the general creativity concept is often shown to be substantially related to positive emotional experiences effective motivation and innovation at the workplace as well as at school. However little is known about the relationship between emotional creativity and the time people tend to spend playing video games.

They constitute a key element of popular culture and generate considerable economic profit as part of the public entertainment industry. Our study is based on the results of an emotional creativity inventory ECI survey that was administered at a snowball and convenient sample of 453 respondents aged 18-60 years M  SD: 23.68  6.36; 66.40% women 20.00% with higher education from the Czech Republic who were questioned about their habits and the time they devote to playing video games. The sample country was selected as one with a long tradition of homebrew video gaming going back to the 1980s. We employed a set of multinomial regression analyses which revealed that more time devoted to playing video games is associated with lower emotional creativity in general as well as with lower novelty preparedness and effectiveness components of emotional creativity. The negative association above was less pronounced for women than for men. Moreover in a sample containing only women a longer time devoted to playing video games was associated with the higher novelty component of emotional creativity the associations with the other two components were not statistically significant for women only. Our findings might considerably contribute to the study of the general overall long-term effect of video games and the use of digital technologies in general on public health.
