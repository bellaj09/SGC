In this paper a functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS-based online binary decision decoding framework is developed. Fourteen healthy subjects are asked to mentally make "yes" or "no" decisions in answers to the given questions. For obtaining "yes" decoding the subjects are asked to perform a mental task that causes a cognitive load on the prefrontal cortex while for making "no" decoding they are asked to relax. Signals from the prefrontal cortex are collected using continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy. It is observed and verified using the linear discriminant analysis LDA and the support vector machine SVM classifications that the cortical hemodynamic responses for making a "yes" decision are distinguishable from those for making a "no" decision. Using mean values of the changes in the concentration of hemoglobin as features binary decisions are classified into two classes "yes" and "no" with an average classification accuracy of 74.28% using LDA and 82.14% using SVM. These results demonstrate and suggest the feasibility of fNIRS for a brain-computer interface.
