"Several veterinary faculties have integrated virtual microscopy into their curricula in recent years to improve and refine their teaching techniques. The many advantages of this recent technology are described in the literature including remote access and an equal and constant slide quality for all students. However no study has analyzed the change of perception toward virtual microscopy at different time points of students academic educations. In the present study veterinary students in 3 academic years were asked for their perspectives and attitudes toward virtual microscopy and conventional light microscopy. Third- fourth- and fifth-year veterinary students filled out a questionnaire with 12 questions. The answers revealed that virtual microscopy was overall well accepted by students of all academic years. Most students even suggested that virtual microscopy be implemented more extensively as the modality for final histopathology examinations. Nevertheless training in the use of light microscopy and associated skills was surprisingly well appreciated. Regardless of their academic year most students considered these skills important and necessary and they felt that light microscopy should not be completely replaced. The reasons for this view differed depending on academic year as the perceived main disadvantage of virtual microscopy varied. Third-year students feared that they would not acquire sufficient light microscopy skills. Fifth-year students considered technical difficulties i.e. insufficient transmission speed to be the main disadvantage of this newer teaching modality."
