"Research in obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD produced inconsistent results in demonstrating an association between patients symptom severity and their cognitive impairments. The process involved in volition aspects of behavioral syndromes can be extensively analyzed using specific tests developed in virtual environments more suitable to manipulate rules and possible breaks of the normal task execution with different confusing or stopping instructions. The study involved thirty participants 15 OCD patients and 15 controls during task execution and the relative interferences. At this purpose the virtual version of Multiple Errands Test was used. Virtual reality setting with a higher ecological validity respect to a classic neuropsychological battery allowed us to take into account deficits of volition and the relative dysexecutive functions associated with OCD patients. The proposed paradigm also allows the development of innovative prototypes of coevolving technologies based on new theories and models and deeper understanding of human behavior."
