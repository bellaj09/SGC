This paper investigates the methods to detect and classify marmoset vocalizations automatically using a large data set of marmoset vocalizations and deep learning techniques. For vocalization detection neural networks-based methods including deep neural network DNN and recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units are designed and compared against a conventional rule-based detection method. For vocalization classification three different classification algorithms are compared including a support vector machine SVM DNN and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks LSTM-RNNs. A 1500-min audio data set containing recordings from four pairs of marmoset twins and manual annotations is employed for experiments. Two test sets are built according to whether the test samples are produced by the marmosets in the training set test set I or not test set II. Experimental results show that the LSTM-RNN-based detection method outperformed others and achieved 0.92% and 1.67% frame error rate on these two test sets. Furthermore the deep learning models obtained higher classification accuracy than the SVM model which was 95.60% and 91.67% on the two test sets respectively.
