The 12-week home-based virtual cycling training hVCT improved lower limb muscle strength and areal bone mineral density aBMD than the control program in children with cerebral palsy CP. A muscle strengthening program rather than general physical activity is more specific in enhancing aBMD for these children. A novel hVCT is an effective and efficient strategy that enhances lower limb bone density in these children. Efficacy of home-based virtual cycling training on bone mineral density in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy.
