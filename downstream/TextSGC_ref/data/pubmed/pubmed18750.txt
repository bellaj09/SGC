With the expansion of nanotechnology robots based on atomic force microscope AFM have been widely used as effective tools for displacing nanoparticles and constructing nanostructures. One of the most limiting factors in AFM-based manipulation procedures is the inability of simultaneously observing the controlled pushing and displacing of nanoparticles while performing the operation. To deal with this limitation a virtual reality environment has been used in this paper for observing the manipulation operation. In the simulations performed in this paper first the images acquired by the atomic force microscope have been processed and the positions and dimensions of nanoparticles have been determined. Then by dynamically modelling the transfer of nanoparticles and simulating the critical force-time diagrams a controlled displacement of nanoparticles has been accomplished. The simulations have been further developed for the use of rectangular V-shape and dagger-shape cantilevers. The established virtual reality environment has made it possible to simulate the manipulation of biological particles in a liquid medium.
