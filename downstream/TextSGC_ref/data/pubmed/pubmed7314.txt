Deep learning has been successfully introduced for 2D-image denoising but it is still unsatisfactory for hyperspectral image HSI denosing due to the unacceptable computational complexity of the end-to-end training process and the difficulty of building a universal 3D-image training dataset. In this paper instead of developing an end-to-end deep learning denoising network we propose a hyperspectral image denoising framework for the removal of mixed Gaussian impulse noise in which the denoising problem is modeled as a convolutional neural network CNN constrained non-negative matrix factorization problem. Using the proximal alternating linearized minimization the optimization can be divided into three steps: the update of the spectral matrix the update of the abundance matrix and the estimation of the sparse noise. Then we design the CNN architecture and proposed two training schemes which can allow the CNN to be trained with a 2D-image dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art denoising methods the proposed method has relatively good performance on the removal of the Gaussian and mixed Gaussian impulse noises. More importantly the proposed model can be only trained once by a 2D-image dataset but can be used to denoise HSIs with different numbers of channel bands.
