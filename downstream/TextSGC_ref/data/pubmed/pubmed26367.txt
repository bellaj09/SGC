"Motor imagery classification is an important topic in brain-computer interface BCI research that enables the recognition of a subjects intension to e.g. implement prosthesis control. The brain dynamics of motor imagery are usually measured by electroencephalography EEG as nonstationary time series of low signal-to-noise ratio. Although a variety of methods have been previously developed to learn EEG signal features the deep learning idea has rarely been explored to generate new representation of EEG features and achieve further performance improvement for motor imagery classification. In this study a novel deep learning scheme based on restricted Boltzmann machine RBM is proposed. Specifically frequency domain representations of EEG signals obtained via fast Fourier transform FFT and wavelet package decomposition WPD are obtained to train three RBMs. These RBMs are then stacked up with an extra output layer to form a four-layer neural network which is named the frequential deep belief network FDBN. The output layer employs the softmax regression to accomplish the classification task. Also the conjugate gradient method and backpropagation are used to fine tune the FDBN. Extensive and systematic experiments have been performed on public benchmark datasets and the results show that the performance improvement of FDBN over other selected state-of-the-art methods is statistically significant. Also several findings that may be of significant interest to the BCI community are presented in this article."
