Devices and systems that interact with the brain have become a growing field of research and development in recent years. Engineering students are well positioned to contribute to both hardware development and signal analysis techniques in this field. However this area has been left out of most engineering curricula. We developed an electroencephalography EEG based brain computer interface BCI laboratory course to educate students through hands-on experiments. The course is offered jointly by the Biomedical Engineering Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments of Columbia University in the City of New York and is open to senior undergraduate and graduate students. The course provides an effective introduction to the experimental design neuroscience concepts data analysis techniques and technical skills required in the field of BCI.
