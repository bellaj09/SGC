Improving walking for individuals with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions is an important aspect of rehabilitation. The capabilities of clinicians who address these rehabilitation issues could be augmented with innovations such as virtual reality gaming based technologies. The chapter provides an overview of virtual reality gaming based technologies currently being developed and tested to improve motor and cognitive elements required for ambulation and mobility in different patient populations. Included as well is a detailed description of a single VR system consisting of the rationale for development and iterative refinement of the system based on clinical science. These concepts include: neural plasticity part-task training whole task training task specific training principles of exercise and motor learning sensorimotor integration and visual spatial processing. Virtual reality and gaming systems to improve walking and mobility for people with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions.
