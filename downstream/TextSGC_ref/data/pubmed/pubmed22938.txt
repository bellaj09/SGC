Recent advances in computing rendering and display technologies have generated increased accessibility for virtual reality VR. VR allows the creation of dynamic high-fidelity environments to simulate dangerous situations test conditions and visualize concepts. Consequently numerous products have been developed but many of these are limited in scope. Therefore the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health researchers developed a VR framework called VR Mine to rapidly create an underground mine for human data collection simulation visualization and training. This paper describes the features of VR Mine using self-escape and proximity detection as case studies. Features include mine generation simulated networks proximity detection systems and the integration and visualization of real-time ventilation models.
