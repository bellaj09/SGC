Recently brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on visual evoked potentials VEPs have been shown to achieve remarkable communication speeds. As they use electroencephalography EEG as non-invasive method for recording neural signals the application of gel-based EEG is time-consuming and cumbersome. In order to achieve a more user-friendly system this work explores the usability of dry EEG electrodes with a VEP-based BCI. While the results show a high variability between subjects they also show that communication speeds of more than 100 bit/min are possible using dry EEG electrodes. To reduce performance variability and deal with the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the dry EEG electrodes an averaging method and a dynamic stopping method were introduced to the BCI system. Those changes were shown to improve performance significantly leading to an average classification accuracy of 76% with an average communication speed of 46 bit/min which is equivalent to a writing speed of 8.8 error-free letters per minute. Although the BCI system works substantially better with gel-based EEG dry EEG electrodes are more user-friendly and still allow high-speed BCI communication.
