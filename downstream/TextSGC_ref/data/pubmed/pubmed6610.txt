Recent advances of neuroimaging methodology and artificial intelligence have resulted in renewed interest in board games like chess and Baduk called Go game in the West and have provided clues as to the mechanisms behind the games. However an interesting question that remains to be answered is whether the board game expertise as one of cognitive skills goes beyond just being good at the trained game and how it maps on networks associated with cognitive abilities that are not directly trained. To address this issue we examined functional activity and connectivity in Baduk experts compared to novices while performing a visual n-back working memory WM task. We found that experts compared to novices had greater activation in superior parietal cortex during face WM though there were no group differences in behavioral performances. Using a data-driven whole-brain multivariate approach we also found significant group differences in the multivariate pattern of connectivity in frontal pole and inferior parietal cortex further showing greater connectivity between frontal and parietal regions and between frontal and temporal regions in experts. Our findings suggest that long-term trained Baduk experts have the reorganization of functional interactions between brain regions even for untrained cognitive ability.
