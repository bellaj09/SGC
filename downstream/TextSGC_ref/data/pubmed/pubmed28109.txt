As for stroke rehabilitation brain-computer interfaces could potentially be used for inducing neural plasticity in patients with cerebral palsy by pairing movement intentions with relevant somatosensory feedback. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate if movement intentions from children with cerebral palsy can be detected from single-trial EEG. Moreover different feature types and electrode setups were evaluated. Movement intention detection in adolescents with cerebral palsy from single-trial EEG.
