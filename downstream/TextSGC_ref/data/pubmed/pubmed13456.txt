Mammalian Target of Rapamycin mTOR is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and its role is integral to the autophagy pathway in cancer. Targeting mTOR for therapeutic interventions in cancer through autophagy pathway is challenging due to the dual roles of autophagy in tumor progression. The architecture of mTOR reveals two complexes - mTORC1 and mTORC2 each having multiple protein subunits. mTOR kinase inhibitors target the structurally and functionally similar catalytic subunits of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. In this paper we have explored two different categories of molecular features - descriptors and fingerprints for developing predictive models using machine learning techniques. Random Forest variable importance measures and autoencoders are used to identify molecular descriptors and fingerprints respectively. We have built various predictive models using identified features and their combination for predicting mTOR kinase inhibitors. Finally the best model based on the Mathew correlation co-efficient value over the validation dataset is selected for screening kinase SARfari bioactivity dataset. In this study we have identified twenty best performing descriptors for predicting mTOR kinase inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge it is the first study on integrating traditional machine learning and deep learning-based approaches for feature extraction to predict mTOR kinase inhibitors.
