"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus typically with periodic high frequency pulse trains has proven to be an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD. Here we use a biophysically-based model of spiking cells in the basal ganglia Terman et al. Journal of Neuroscience 22 2963-2976 2002; Rubin and Terman Journal of Computational Neuroscience 16 211-235 2004 to provide computational evidence that alternative temporal patterns of DBS inputs might be equally effective as the standard high-frequency waveforms but require lower amplitudes. Within this model DBS performance is assessed in two ways. First we determine the extent to which DBS causes Gpi globus pallidus pars interna synaptic outputs which are burstlike and synchronized in the unstimulated Parkinsonian state to cease their pathological modulation of simulated thalamocortical cells. Second we evaluate how DBS affects the GPi cells auto- and cross-correlograms. In both cases a nonlinear closed-loop learning algorithm identifies effective DBS inputs that are optimized to have minimal strength. The network dynamics that result differ from the regular entrained firing which some previous studies have associated with conventional high-frequency DBS. This type of optimized solution is also found with heterogeneity in both the intrinsic network dynamics and the strength of DBS inputs received at various cells. Such alternative DBS inputs could potentially be identified guided by the model-free learning algorithm in experimental or eventual clinical settings."
