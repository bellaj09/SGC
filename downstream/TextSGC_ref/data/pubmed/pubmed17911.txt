"Impairments in performing activities of daily living occur early in the course of Alzheimers disease AD. There is a great need to develop non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions likely to reduce dependency in everyday activities in AD patients. This study investigated whether it was possible to increase autonomy in these patients in cooking activities using interventions based on errorless learning vanishing-cue and virtual reality techniques. We recruited a 79-year-old woman who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. She was trained in four cooking tasks for four days per task one hour per day in virtual and in real conditions. Outcome measures included subjective data concerning the therapeutic intervention and the experience of virtual reality repeated assessments of training activities neuropsychological scores and self-esteem and quality of life measures. The results indicated that our patient could relearn some cooking activities using virtual reality techniques. Transfer to real life was also observed. Improvement of the task performance remained stable over time. This case report supports the value of a non-immersive virtual kitchen to help people with AD to relearn cooking activities."
