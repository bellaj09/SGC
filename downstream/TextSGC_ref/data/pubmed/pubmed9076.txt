"Detection of outliers in radar signals is a considerable challenge in maritime surveillance applications. High-Frequency Surface-Wave HFSW radars have attracted significant interest as potential tools for long-range target identification and outlier detection at over-the-horizon OTH distances. However a number of disadvantages such as their low spatial resolution and presence of clutter have a negative impact on their accuracy. In this paper we explore the applicability of deep learning techniques for detecting deviations from the norm in behavioral patterns of vessels outliers as they are tracked from an OTH radar. The proposed methodology exploits the nonlinear mapping capabilities of deep stacked autoencoders in combination with density-based clustering. A comparative experimental evaluation of the approach shows promising results in terms of the proposed methodologys performance."
