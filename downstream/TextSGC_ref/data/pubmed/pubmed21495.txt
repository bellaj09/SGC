In people with psychoses Self-Reflectiveness may rely on the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex VLPFC. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and a novel virtual reality paradigm to evaluate the role of the VLPFC for Self-Reflectiveness in 25 first-episode of schizophrenia FES participants and 24 controls. Participants first viewed 20 characters each paired with a unique object/location and later completed source memory judgements during fMRI scanning. Self-Reflectiveness measured with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale was significantly and positively correlated to activation in bilateral VLPFC in FES but not in controls providing further evidence that the VLPFC supports Self-Reflectiveness in FES. Cognitive insight in first-episode schizophrenia: further evidence for a role of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.
