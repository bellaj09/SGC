Finding biomedical named entities is one of the most essential tasks in biomedical text mining. Recently deep learning-based approaches have been applied to biomedical named entity recognition BioNER and showed promising results. However as deep learning approaches need an abundant amount of training data a lack of data can hinder performance. BioNER datasets are scarce resources and each dataset covers only a small subset of entity types. Furthermore many bio entities are polysemous which is one of the major obstacles in named entity recognition. CollaboNet: collaboration of deep neural networks for biomedical named entity recognition.
