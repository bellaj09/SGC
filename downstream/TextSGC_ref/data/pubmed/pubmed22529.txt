Distinctive EEG signals from the motor and somatosensory cortex are generated during mental tasks of motor imagery MI and somatosensory attentional orientation SAO. In this paper we hypothesize that a combination of these two signal modalities provides improvements in a brain-computer interface BCI performance with respect to using the two methods separately and generate novel types of multi-class BCI systems. Thirty two subjects were randomly divided into a Control-Group and a Hybrid-Group. In the Control-Group the subjects performed left and right hand motor imagery i.e. L-MI and R-MI. In the Hybrid-Group the subjects performed the four mental tasks i.e. L-MI R-MI L-SAO and R-SAO. The results indicate that combining two of the tasks in a hybrid manner such as L-SAO and R-MI resulted in a significantly greater classification accuracy than when using two MI tasks. The hybrid modality reached 86.1% classification accuracy on average with a 7.70% increase with respect to MI   and 7.21% to SAO   alone. Moreover all 16 subjects in the hybrid modality reached at least 70% accuracy which is considered the threshold for BCI illiteracy. In addition to the two-class results the classification accuracy was 68.1% and 54.1% for the three-class and four-class hybrid BCI. Combining the induced brain signals from motor and somatosensory cortex the proposed stimulus-independent hybrid BCI has shown improved performance with respect to individual modalities reducing the portion of BCI-illiterate subjects and provided novel types of multi-class BCIs.
