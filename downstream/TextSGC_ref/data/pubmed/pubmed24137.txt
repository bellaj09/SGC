Steady state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs are the brain signals induced by gazing at a constantly flickering target. Frame-based frequency approximation methods can be implemented in order to realize a high number of visual stimuli for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs on ordinary computer screens. In this paper we investigate the possibilities and limitations regarding the number of targets in SSVEP-based BCIs. The BCI-performance of seven healthy subjects was evaluated in an online experiment with six differently sized target matrices. Our results confirm previous observations according to which BCI accuracy and speed are dependent on the number of simultaneously displayed targets. The peak ITR achieved in the experiment was 130.15 bpm. Interestingly it was achieved with the 15 target matrix. Generally speaking the BCI performance dropped with an increasing number of simultaneously displayed targets. Surprisingly however one subject even gained control over a system with 84 flickering targets achieving an accuracy of 91.30% which verifies that stimulation frequencies separated by less than 0.1 Hz can still be distinguished from each other. Exploring the possibilities and limitations of multitarget SSVEP-based BCI applications.
