Since its discovery in December 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2\xa0180 000 people worldwide and has caused more than 150 000 deaths as of April 16 2020. SARS-CoV-2 which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2 as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Thus ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 in a wide variety of human tissues.
