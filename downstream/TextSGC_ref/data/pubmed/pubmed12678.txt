We propose a method to address challenges in unconstrained face detection such as arbitrary pose variations and occlusions. First a new image feature called Normalized Pixel Difference NPD is proposed. NPD feature is computed as the difference to sum ratio between two pixel values inspired by the Weber Fraction in experimental psychology. The new feature is scale invariant bounded and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second we propose a deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their combinations so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned rules. This way only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle unconstrained face detection. Furthermore we show that the NPD features can be efficiently obtained from a look up table and the detection template can be easily scaled making the proposed face detector very fast. Experimental results on three public face datasets FDDB GENKI and CMU-MIT show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting unconstrained faces with arbitrary pose variations and occlusions in cluttered scenes.
