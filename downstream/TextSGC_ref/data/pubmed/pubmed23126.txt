A significant proportion of the global population is obese foreshadowing an epidemic of chronic disease. Self-monitoring of diet exercise and body weight decreasing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure are robust predictors of successful weight loss. However few individuals consistently practice these behaviors making long-term weight loss and maintenance unlikely. Technologies afford unique opportunities to overcome barriers and increase the reach of traditional obesity interventions. In this article we introduce ENGAGED a technology-enhanced modification of the Diabetes Prevention Program designed to improve adherence to weight loss behaviors. Using a treatment implementation framework we suggest how virtual reality technologies might further improve the delivery receipt and enactment of ENGAGED to maximize patient impact. The potential of virtual reality technologies to improve adherence to weight loss behaviors.
