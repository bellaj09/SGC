Forecasting acute hypotensive episodes AHE in intensive care patients has been of recent interest to researchers in the healthcare domain. Advance warning of an impending AHE may give care providers additional information to help mitigate the negative clinical impact of a serious event such as an AHE or prompt a search for an evolving disease process. However the currently accepted definition of AHE is restrictive does not account for inter-patient variability. In this paper we propose a novel definition of an AHE based on patient-specific features of blood pressure recordings. Next we utilize a deep learning-based method to predict the onset of an AHE from multiple physiological readings for different definitions of the prediction task including variable input and gap lengths. Using a cohort of 538 patients our model was able to successfully predict the onset of an AHE with an accuracy and AUC score of 0.80 and 0.87 respectively. Compared to a baseline logistic regression model our model outperforms the baseline in most of the definitions of the prediction task.
