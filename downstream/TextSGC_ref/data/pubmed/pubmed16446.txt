The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the Virtual Reality VR version of the Multiple Errands Test MET Shallice &amp; Burgess 1991; Fortin et al. 2003 based on the NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular the MET is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where items need to be bought and information needs to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants n = 5 healthy young participants n = 5 and healthy older participants n = 5. Specific objectives were 1 to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test VMET and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions and 2 to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young controls and older controls in the VMET and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Validation of a Neuro Virtual Reality-based version of the Multiple Errands Test for the assessment of executive functions.
