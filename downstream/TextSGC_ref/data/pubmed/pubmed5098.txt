"We previously proposed a bipartite dorsal-ventral model of human arcuate fasciculus AF morphology. This model does not however account for the vertical temporo-parietal subdivision of the AF described in earlier dissection and tractographic studies. In an effort to address the absence of the vertical AF VAF within dorsal-ventral nomenclature we conducted a dedicated tractographic and white-matter dissection study of this tract and another short vertical posterior-hemispheric fascicle: the vertical occipital fasciculus VOF. We conducted atlas-based non-tensor deterministic tractography in 30 single subjects from the Human Connectome Project database and verified our results using an average diffusion atlas compiled from 842 separate normal subjects. We also performed white-matter dissection in four post-mortem specimens. Our \xa0tractography results demonstrate that the VAF is in fact a bipartite system connecting the ventral parietal and temporal regions with variable connective and no volumetric lateralization. The VOF is a non-lateralized non-segmented system connecting lateral occipital areas with basal-temporal regions. Importantly the VOF was spatially dissociated from the VAF. As the VAF demonstrates no overall connective or volumetric lateralization we postulate its distinction from the AF system and propose its re-naming to the temporo-parietal aslant tract TPAT with unique dorsal and ventral subdivisions. Our tractography results were supported by diffusion atlas and white-matter dissection findings."
