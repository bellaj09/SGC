Virtual reality VR is a promising tool for expanding the possibilities of psychological experimentation and implementing immersive training applications. Despite a recent surge in interest there remains an inadequate understanding of how VR impacts basic cognitive processes. Due to the artificial presentation of egocentric distance cues in virtual environments a number of cues to depth in the optic array are impaired or placed in conflict with each other. Moreover realistic haptic information is all but absent from current VR systems. The resulting conflicts could impact not only the execution of motor skills in VR but also raise deeper concerns about basic visual processing and the extent to which virtual objects elicit neural and behavioural responses representative of real objects. In this brief review we outline how the novel perceptual environment of VR may affect vision for action by shifting users away from a dorsal mode of control. Fewer binocular cues to depth conflicting depth information and limited haptic feedback may all impair the specialised efficient online control of action characteristic of the dorsal stream. A shift from dorsal to ventral control of action may create a fundamental disparity between virtual and real-world skills that has important consequences for how we understand perception and action in the virtual world. Virtually the same? How impaired sensory information in virtual reality may disrupt vision for action.
