Inanimate and virtual reality box training help in developing basic laparoscopic skills. The lack of tactile feedback and lack of reality may be a detriment when training with virtual reality trainers. This study examined the hypothesis that there is no difference in laparoscopic skills acquisition when virtual reality trainers are partially substituted for inanimate box trainers. Substituting virtual reality trainers for inanimate box trainers does not decrease laparoscopic skills acquisition.
