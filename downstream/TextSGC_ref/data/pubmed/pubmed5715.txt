Continuous blood pressure BP monitoring can produce a significant amount of digital data which increases the chance of early diagnosis and improve the rate of survival for people diagnosed with hypertension and Cardiovascular diseases CVDs. However mining and processing this vast amount of data are challenging. This research is aimed to address this challenge by proposing a deep learning technique convolutional neural network CNN to estimate the systolic blood pressure SBP using electrocardiogram ECG and photoplethysmography PPG signals. Two different methods are investigated and compared in this research. In the first method continuous wavelet transform CWT and CNN have been employed to estimate the SBP. For the second method we used random sampling within the stochastic gradient descent SGD optimization of CNN and the raw ECG and PPG signals for training the network. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care MIMIC III database is used for both methods which split to two parts 70% for training our network and the remaining used for testing the performance of the network. Both methods are capable of learning how to extract relevant features from the signals. Therefore there is no need for engineered feature extraction compared to previous works. Our experimental results show high accuracy for both CNN-based methods which make them promising and reliable architectures for SBP estimation.
