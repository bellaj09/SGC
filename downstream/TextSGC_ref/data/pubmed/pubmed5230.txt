Psychopathic traits of conduct disorder CD have a core callous-unemotional CU component and an impulsive-antisocial component. Previous task-driven fMRI studies have suggested that psychopathic traits are associated with dysfunction of several brain areas involved in different cognitive functions e.g. empathy reward and response inhibition etc. but the relationship between psychopathic traits and intrinsic brain functional architecture has not yet been explored in CD. Using a holistic brain-wide functional connectivity analysis this study delineated the alterations in brain functional networks in patients with conduct disorder. Compared with matched healthy controls we found decreased anti-synchronization between the fronto-parietal network FPN and default mode network DMN and increased intra-network synchronization within the frontothalamic-basal ganglia right frontoparietal and temporal/limbic/visual networks in CD patients. Correlation analysis showed that the weakened FPN-DMN interaction was associated with CU traits while the heightened intra-network functional connectivity was related to impulsivity traits in CD patients. Our findings suggest that decoupling of cognitive control FPN with social understanding of others DMN is associated with the CU traits and hyper-functions of the reward and motor inhibition systems elevate impulsiveness in CD.
