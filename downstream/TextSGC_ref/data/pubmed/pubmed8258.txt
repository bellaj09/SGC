Advancements in wireless sensor networks WSN technology and miniaturization of wearable sensors have enabled long-term continuous pervasive biomedical signal monitoring. Wrist-worn photoplethysmography PPG sensors have gained popularity given their form factor. However the signal quality suffers due to motion artifacts when used in ambulatory settings making vital parameter estimation a challenging task. In this paper we present a novel deep learning framework BioTranslator for computing the instantaneous heart rate IHR using wrist-worn PPG signals collected during physical activity. Using one-dimensional Convolution-Deconvolution Network we translate a single channel PPG signal to an electrocardiogramECG-like time series signal from which relevant R-peak information can be inferred enabling IHR measures. The proposed network configuration was evaluated on 12 subjects of the TROIKA dataset involved in physical activity. The proposed network identifies 92.8% of R-peaks besides achieving a mean absolute error of 516.3ms with respect to reference ECG-derived IHR.
