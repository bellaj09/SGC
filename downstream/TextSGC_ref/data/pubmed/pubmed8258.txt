We propose a novel optical computing architecture for massive parallel matrix manipulation based on reconfigurable time-wavelength plane manipulation and and dispersed time delay. Two linear weighting methods in either wavelength or time domain are proposed and validated. We perform the autocorrelation function of a 7-bit m-sequence with the speed at 1.181011 multiplications and accumulations per second MACs/s and a multiplication of a 4  4 matrix and a 4  1 vector at 2.69109 MACs/s. The edge extraction of 32  32 binary images is also realized in simulation by optical 2D convolution at 5108 MACs/s. The proposed optical computing unit can be a key building block to process complex computing tasks with advanced deep learning algorithms and it is promising for the future photonic neural network circuits.
