Type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM is associated with cognitive impairment. We investigated whether alterations of intranetwork and internetwork functional connectivity with T2DM progression exist by using resting-state functional MRI. MRI data were analysed from 19 T2DM patients with normal cognition DMCN and 19 T2DM patients with cognitive impairment DMCI 19 healthy controls HC. Functional connectivity among 36 previously well-defined brain regions which consisted of 5 resting-state network RSN systems default mode network DMN dorsal attention network DAN control network CON salience network SAL and sensorimotor network SMN was investigated at 3 levels integrity network and connectivity. Impaired intranetwork and internetwork connectivity were found in T2DM especially in DMCI on the basis of the three levels of analysis. The bilateral posterior cerebellum the right insula the DMN and the CON were mainly involved in these changes. The functional connectivity strength of specific brain architectures in T2DM was found to be associated with haemoglobin A1c HbA1c cognitive score and illness duration. These network alterations in intergroup differences which were associated with brain functional impairment due to T2DM indicate that network organizations might be potential biomarkers for predicting the clinical progression evaluating the cognitive impairment and further understanding the pathophysiology of T2DM.
