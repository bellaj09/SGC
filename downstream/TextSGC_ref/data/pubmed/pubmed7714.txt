Retinal fundus images are often corrupted by non-uniform and/or poor illumination that occur due to overall imperfections in the image acquisition process. This unwanted variation in brightness limits the pathological information that can be gained from the image. Studies have shown that poor illumination can impede human grading in about 10~15% of retinal images. For automated grading the effect can be even higher. In this perspective we propose a novel method for illumination correction in the context of retinal imaging. The method splits the color image into luminosity and chroma i.e. color components and performs illumination correction in the luminosity channel based on a novel background estimation technique. Extensive subjective and objective experiments were conducted on publicly available DIARETDB1 and EyePACS images to justify the performance of the proposed method. The subjective experiment has confirmed that the proposed method does not create false color/artifacts and at the same time performs better than the traditional method in 84 out of 89 cases. The objective experiment shows an accuracy improvement of 4% in automated disease grading when illumination correction is performed by the proposed method than the traditional method.
