The current industrial scenario demands advances that depend on expensive and sophisticated solutions. Augmented Reality AR can complement with virtual elements the real world. Faced with this features an AR experience can meet the demand for prototype testing and new solutions predicting problems and failures that may only exist in real situations. This work presents an environment for experimentation of advanced behaviors in smart factories allowing experimentation with multi-robot systems MRS interconnected cooperative and interacting with virtual elements. The concept of ARENA introduces a novel approach to realistic and immersive experimentation in industrial environments aiming to evaluate new technologies aligned with the Industry 4.0. The proposed method consists of a small-scale warehouse inspired in a real scenario characterized in this paper managing by a group of autonomous forklifts fully interconnected which are embodied by a swarm of tiny robots developed and prepared to operate in the small scale scenario. The AR is employed to enhance the capabilities of swarm robots allowing box handling and virtual forklifts. Virtual laser range finders LRF are specially designed as segmentation of a global RGB-D camera to improve robot perception allowing obstacle avoidance and environment mapping. This infrastructure enables the evaluation of new strategies to improve manufacturing productivity without compromising the production by automation faults.
