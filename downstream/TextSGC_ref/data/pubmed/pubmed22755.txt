The distributed sense of touch forms an essential component that defines real-time perception and situational awareness in humans. Electronic skins are an emerging technology in conferring an artificial sense of touch for smart human-machine interfaces. However assigning a conformably distributed sense of touch over a large area has been challenging to replicate in modern medical social and industrial robots. Herein we present a new class of soft tactile sensors that exploit the mechanisms of triplet-triplet annihilation exciton harvesting and a small Stokes shift in conjugated organic semiconductors such as rubrene. By multiplexing the electroluminescence and photosensing modes we show that a compact optoelectronic array of multifunctional rubrene/fullerene diodes can accurately measure pressure position and surface deformation applied to an overlying elastomeric layer. The dynamic range of sensing is defined by mechanical properties of the elastomer. Such optoelectronic approach paves the way for soft conformal and large-area compatible electronic skins for medicine and robotics.
