"The expansion of care in the community has highlighted the need for more effective educational and training media for people with learning disabilities and this paper suggests that virtual environments VEs may help to meet this need. Firstly key terms virtual environment cyberspace and artificial reality are defined. Secondly aspects of developmental and cognitive psychological theories and principles of computer-assisted learning are presented that suggest that VEs might be an especially valuable educational media for people with learning disabilities. Thirdly the existing literature in this field is reviewed. Fourthly ethical issues associated with the use of VE both generally and specifically by people with learning disabilities are discussed. Fifth possible future developments of VEs both in education and through their convergence with technologies of miniaturization are suggested. It is concluded that VEs are an effective affordable accessible and safe training and educational media for people with learning disabilities although further research will be required to realise their full potentials."
