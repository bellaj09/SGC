"Relevance and penetration of machine learning in clinical practice is a recent phenomenon with multiple applications being currently under development. Deep learning-and especially convolutional neural networks CNNs-is a subset of machine learning which has recently entered the field of thoracic imaging. The structure of neural networks organized in multiple layers allows them to address complex tasks. For several clinical situations CNNs have demonstrated superior performance as compared with classical machine learning algorithms and in some cases achieved comparable or better performance than clinical experts. Chest radiography a high-volume procedure is a natural application domain because of the large amount of stored images and reports facilitating the training of deep learning algorithms. Several algorithms for automated reporting have been developed. The training of deep learning algorithm CT images is more complex due to the dimension variability and complexity of the 3D signal. The role of these methods is likely to increase in clinical practice as a complement of the radiologists expertise. The objective of this review is to provide definitions for understanding the methods and their potential applications for thoracic imaging. KEY POINTS:  Deep learning outperforms other machine learning techniques for number of tasks in radiology.  Convolutional neural network is the most popular deep learning architecture in medical imaging.  Numerous deep learning algorithms are being currently developed; some of them may become part of clinical routine in the near future." Deep learning: definition and perspectives for thoracic imaging.
