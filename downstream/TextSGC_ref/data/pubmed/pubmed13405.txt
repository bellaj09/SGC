Computed tomography CT is widely used in medical diagnosis and non-destructive detection. Image reconstruction in CT aims to accurately recover pixel values from measured line integrals i.e. the summed pixel values along straight lines. Provided that the acquired data satisfy the data sufficiency condition as well as other conditions regarding the view angle sampling interval and the severity of transverse data truncation researchers have discovered many solutions to accurately reconstruct the image. However if these conditions are violated accurate image reconstruction from line integrals remains an intellectual challenge. In this paper a deep learning method with a common network architecture termed iCT-Net was developed and trained to accurately reconstruct images for previously solved and unsolved CT reconstruction problems with high quantitative accuracy. Particularly accurate reconstructions were achieved for the case when the sparse view reconstruction problem i.e. compressed sensing problem is entangled with the classical interior tomographic problems.
