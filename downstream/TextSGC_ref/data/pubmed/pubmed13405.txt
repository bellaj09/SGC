Recently telecom fraud has become a serious problem especially in developing countries such as China. At present it can be very difficult to coordinate different agencies to prevent fraud completely. In this paper we study how to detect large transfers that are sent from victims deceived by fraudsters at the receiving bank. We propose a new generative adversarial network GAN based model to calculate for each large transfer a probability that it is fraudulent such that the bank can take appropriate measures to prevent potential fraudsters to take the money if the probability exceeds a threshold. The inference model uses a deep denoising autoencoder to effectively learn the complex probabilistic relationship among the input features and employs adversarial training that establishes a minimax game between a discriminator and a generator to accurately discriminate between positive samples and negative samples in the data distribution. We show that the model outperforms a set of well-known classification methods in experiments and its applications in two commercial banks have reduced losses of about 10 million RMB in twelve weeks and significantly improved their business reputation.
