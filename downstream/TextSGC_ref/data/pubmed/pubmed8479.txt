Calling genetic variations from sequence reads is an important problem in genomics. There are many existing methods for calling various types of variations. Recently Google developed a method for calling single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs based on deep learning. Their method visualizes sequence reads in the forms of images. These images are then used to train a deep neural network model which is used to call SNPs. This raises a research question: can deep learning be used to call more complex genetic variations such as structural variations SVs from sequence data?
