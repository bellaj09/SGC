Using traditional approaches a brain-computer interface BCI requires the collection of calibration data for new subjects prior to online use. Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g. by subject-to-subject transfer of a pre-trained classifier or unsupervised adaptive classification methods which learn from scratch and adapt over time. While such heuristics work well in practice none of them can provide theoretical guarantees. Our objective is to modify an event-related potential ERP paradigm to work in unison with the machine learning decoder and thus to achieve a reliable unsupervised calibrationless decoding with a guarantee to recover the true class means.
