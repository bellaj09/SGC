"By focus group methodology we examined the opinions and requirements of persons with ALS their caregivers and health care assistants with regard to developing a brain-computer interface BCI system that fulfills the users needs. Four overarching topics emerged from this analysis: 1 lack of information on BCI and its everyday applications; 2 importance of a customizable system that supports individuals throughout the various stages of the disease; 3 relationship between affectivity and technology use; and 4 importance of individuals retaining a sense of agency. These findings should be considered when developing new assistive technology. Moreover the BCI community should acknowledge the need to bridge experimental results and its everyday application."
