Brain computer interfaces provide a novel channel for the communication between brain and output devices. The effectiveness of the brain computer interface is based on the classification accuracy of single trial brain signals. The common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is believed to be an effective algorithm for the classification of single trial brain signals. As the amplitude feature for spatial projection applied by this algorithm is based on a broad frequency bandpass filter mainly 5-30 Hz in which the frequency band is often selected by experience the CSP is sensitive to noise and the influence of other irrelevant information in the selected broad frequency band. In this paper to improve the CSP a novel relevant feature integration and extraction algorithm is proposed. Before projecting we integrated the motor relevant information to suppress the interference of noise and irrelevant information as well as to improve the spatial difference for projection. The algorithm was evaluated with public datasets. It showed significantly better classification performance with single trial electroencephalography EEG data increasing by 6.8% compared with the CSP.
