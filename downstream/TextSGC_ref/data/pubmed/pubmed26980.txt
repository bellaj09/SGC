"Electronic devices used to record biological signals are important in neuroscience brain-machine interfaces and medical applications. Placing electronic devices below the skin surface and recording the muscle offers accurate and robust electromyography EMG recordings. The device stretchability and flexibility must be similar to the tissues to achieve an intimate integration of the electronic device with the biological tissues. However conventional elastomer-based EMG electrodes have a Youngs modulus that is 20 times higher than that of muscle. In addition these stretchable devices also have an issue of displacement on the tissue surface thereby causing some challenges during accurate and robust EMG signal recordings. In general devices with kirigami design solve the issue of the high Youngs modulus of conventional EMG devices. In this study donut-shaped kirigami bioprobes are proposed to reduce the device displacement on the muscle surface. The fabricated devices are tested on an expanding balloon and they show no significant device microelectrode displacement. As the package the fabricated device is embedded in a dissolvable material-based scaffold for easy-to-use stretchable kirigami device in an animal experiment. Finally the EMG signal recording capability and stability using the fabricated kirigami device is confirmed in in vivo experiments without significant device displacements."
