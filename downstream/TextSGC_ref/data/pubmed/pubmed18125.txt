This creates a serous problem in regards to daily living activities. However the established methods for assessing and training of unilateral neglect patients have several deficits. Recently virtual reality VR technologies have been used as an assessment and treatment tool for rehabilitation. Hence this study designed a VR system to assess and train unilateral neglect patients. In addition the suitability and feasibility of our VR system for unilateral neglect patients was verified. A virtual reality assessment and training system for unilateral neglect.
