Assessing and predicting inhibition in adults is a common assignment for clinicians. However there is no single measure of inhibition that is complete sensitive and enjoyable. The main goal of this study was to develop a virtual reality neuropsychological task the bimodal VR-Stroop capable of measuring both cognitive control of internal and external interference and motor inhibition a go no-go paradigm with reaction time variation commission errors and omissions. Preliminary data obtained with 71 healthy adult participants confirmed that the VR-Stroop is capable of eliciting the Stroop effect with bimodal stimuli. Initial validation data also suggested that measures of the VR-Stroop significantly correlate with measures of the Elevator counting with distracters the Continuous Performance Task CPT-II and the Stop-it task. Finally regression analyses indicated that commission errors and variability of reaction times at the VR-Stroop were significantly predicted by scores of the Elevator task and the CPT-II. These preliminary results suggest that the VR-Stroop is an interesting measure of cognitive and motor inhibition for adults although confirmatory investigations are warranted. Development and initial assessment of a new paradigm for assessing cognitive and motor inhibition: the bimodal virtual-reality Stroop.
