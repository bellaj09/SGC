With the rapid development of EEG-based wearable healthcare devices and brain-computer interfaces reliable and user-friendly EEG sensors for EEG recording especially at forehead sites are highly desirable and challenging. However existing EEG sensors cannot meet the requirements since wet electrodes require tedious setup and conductive pastes or gels and most dry electrodes show unacceptable high contact impedance. In addition the existing electrodes cannot absorb sweat effectively; sweat would cause cross-interferences and even short circuits between adjacent electrodes especially in the moving scenarios or a hot and humid environment. To resolve these problems a novel printable flexible Ag/AgCl dry electrode array was developed for EEG acquisition at forehead sites mainly consisting of screen printing the Ag/AgCl coating conductive sweat-absorbable sponges and flexible tines. Towards emerging EEG applications: a novel printable flexible Ag/AgCl dry electrode array for robust recording of EEG signals at forehead sites.
