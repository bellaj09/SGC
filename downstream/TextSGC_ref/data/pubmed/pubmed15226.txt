Detection and classification of tree species from remote sensing data were performed using mainly multispectral and hyperspectral images and Light Detection And Ranging LiDAR data. Despite the comparatively lower cost and higher spatial resolution few studies focused on images captured by Red-Green-Blue RGB sensors. Besides the recent years have witnessed an impressive progress of deep learning methods for object detection. Motivated by this scenario we proposed and evaluated the usage of Convolutional Neural Network CNN-based methods combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV high spatial resolution RGB imagery for the detection of law protected tree species. Three state-of-the-art object detection methods were evaluated: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network Faster R-CNN YOLOv3 and RetinaNet. A dataset was built to assess the selected methods comprising 392 RBG images captured from August 2018 to February 2019 over a forested urban area in midwest Brazil. The target object is an important tree species threatened by extinction known as Dipteryx alata Vogel Fabaceae. The experimental analysis delivered average precision around 92% with an associated processing times below 30 miliseconds.
