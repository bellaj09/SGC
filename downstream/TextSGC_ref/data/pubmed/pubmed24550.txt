"Recently magnetoencephalography MEG-based real-time brain computing interfaces BCI have been developed to enable novel and promising methods of neuroscience research and therapy. Artifact rejection prior to source localization largely enhances the localization accuracy. However many BCI approaches neglect real-time artifact removal due to its time consuming processing. With cardiac artifact rejection for real-time analysis CARTA we introduce a novel algorithm capable of real-time cardiac artifact CA rejection. The method is based on constrained independent component analysis ICA where a priori information of the underlying source signal is used to optimize and accelerate signal decomposition. In CARTA this is performed by estimating the subjects individual density distribution of the cardiac activity which leads to a subject-specific signal decomposition algorithm. We show that the new method is capable of effectively reducing CAs within one iteration and a time delay of 1 ms. In contrast Infomax and Extended Infomax ICA converged not until seven iterations while FastICA needs at least ten iterations. CARTA was tested and applied to data from three different but most common MEG systems 4-D-Neuroimaging VSM MedTech Inc. and Elekta Neuromag. Therefore the new method contributes to reliable signal analysis utilizing BCI approaches." A constrained ICA approach for real-time cardiac artifact rejection in magnetoencephalography.
