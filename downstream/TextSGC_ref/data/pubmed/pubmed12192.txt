Recent advances in computer vision have made accurate fast and robust measurement of animal behavior a reality. In the past years powerful tools specifically designed to aid the measurement of behavior have come to fruition. Here we discuss how capturing the postures of animals-pose estimation - has been rapidly advancing with new deep learning methods. While challenges still remain we envision that the fast-paced development of new deep learning tools will rapidly change the landscape of realizable real-world neuroscience. Deep learning tools for the measurement of animal behavior in neuroscience.
