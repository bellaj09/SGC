"In a previous study we demonstrated continuous translation orientation and one-dimensional grasping control of a prosthetic limb seven degrees of freedom by a human subject with tetraplegia using a brain-machine interface BMI. The current study in the same subject immediately followed the previous work and expanded the scope of the control signal by also extracting hand-shape commands from the two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays implanted in the subjects left motor cortex." Ten-dimensional anthropomorphic arm control in a human brain-machine interface: difficulties solutions and limitations.
