"Two experiments are presented that serve as a framework for exploring auditory information processing. The framework is referred to as polychotic listening or auditory search and it requires a listener to scan multiple simultaneous auditory streams for the appearance of a target word the name of a letter such as A or M. Participants ability to scan between two and six simultaneous auditory streams of letter and digit names for the name of a target letter was examined using six loudspeakers. The main independent variable was auditory load or the number of active audio streams on a given trial. The primary dependent variables were target localization accuracy and reaction time. Results showed that as load increased performance decreased. The performance decrease was evident in reaction time accuracy and sensitivity measures. The second study required participants to practice the same task for 10 sessions for a total of 1800 trials. Results indicated that even with extensive practice performance was still affected by auditory load. The present results are compared with findings in the visual search literature. The implications for the use of multiple auditory displays are discussed. Potential applications include cockpit and automobile warning displays virtual reality systems and training systems."
