The advances made in recent years in the field of structural biology significantly increased the throughput and complexity of data that scientists have to deal with. Combining and analyzing such heterogeneous amounts of data became a crucial time consumer in the daily tasks of scientists. However only few efforts have been made to offer scientists an alternative to the standard compartmentalized tools they use to explore their data and that involve a regular back and forth between them. We propose here an integrated pipeline especially designed for immersive environments promoting direct interactions on semantically linked 2D and 3D heterogeneous data displayed in a common working space. The creation of a semantic definition describing the content and the context of a molecular scene leads to the creation of an intelligent system where data are 1 combined through pre-existing or inferred links present in our hierarchical definition of the concepts 2 enriched with suitable and adaptive analyses proposed to the user with respect to the current task and 3 interactively presented in a unique working environment to be explored. Semantics for an Integrative and Immersive Pipeline Combining Visualization and Analysis of Molecular Data.
