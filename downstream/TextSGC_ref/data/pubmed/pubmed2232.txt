"China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019. The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus called COVID-19 which has now infected more than 700000 people worldwide. With a death toll approaching that of Chinas SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health placing all health organizations on high alert. Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable inexpensive and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak."
