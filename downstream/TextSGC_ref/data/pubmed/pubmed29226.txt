Many individuals with moderate and severe stroke are unable to use their paretic hand. Currently the effect of conventional therapy on regaining meaningful hand function in this population is limited. Efforts have been made to use brain-machine interfaces BMIs to control hand function. To date almost all BMI classification algorithms are designed for detecting hand movements with a resting arm. However many functional movements require simultaneous movements of the arm and hand. Arm movement will possibly affect the detection of intended hand movements specifically for individuals with chronic stroke who have muscle synergies. The most prevalent upper-extremity synergy-flexor synergy-is expressed as an abnormal coupling between shoulder abductors and elbow/wrist/finger flexors.
