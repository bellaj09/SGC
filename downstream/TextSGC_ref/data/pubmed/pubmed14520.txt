"The ability to master discipline-specific knowledge is one of the competencies medical students must acquire. In this context mastering means being able to recall and apply knowledge. A way to assess this competency is to use both open- and closed-book tests. Student performance on both tests can be influenced by the way the student processes information. Deep information processing is expected to influence performance positively. The personal preferences of students in relation to how they process information in general i.e. their level of need for cognition may also be of importance. In this study we examined the inter-relatedness of deep learning need for cognition and preparation time and scores on open- and closed-book tests." Influences of deep learning need for cognition and preparation time on open- and closed-book test performance.
