In this research the effectiveness of neurofeedback along with virtual reality VR in reducing the level of inattention and impulsiveness was investigated. Twenty-eight male participants aged 14-18 with social problems took part in this study. They were separated into three groups: a control group a VR group and a non-VR group. The VR and non-VR groups underwent eight sessions of neurofeedback training over 2 weeks while the control group just waited during the same period. The VR group used a head-mounted display HMD and a head tracker which let them look around the virtual world. Conversely the non-VR group used only a computer monitor with a fixed viewpoint. All participants performed a continuous performance task CPT before and after the complete training session. The results showed that both the VR and non-VR groups achieved better scores in the CPT after the training session while the control group showed no significant difference. Compared with the other groups the VR group presented a tendency to get better results suggesting that immersive VR is applicable to neurofeedback for the rehabilitation of inattention and impulsiveness.
