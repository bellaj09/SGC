Imaging mass spectrometry imaging MS is an enabling technology for spatial metabolomics of tissue sections with rapidly growing areas of applications in biology and medicine. However imaging MS data is polluted with off-sample ions caused by sample preparation particularly by the MALDI matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization matrix application. Off-sample ion images confound and hinder statistical analysis metabolite identification and downstream analysis with no automated solutions available. OffsampleAI: artificial intelligence approach to recognize off-sample mass spectrometry images.
