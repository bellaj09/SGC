"The mild cognitive impairment MCI stage of Alzheimers disease AD may be optimal for clinical trials to test potential treatments for preventing or delaying decline to dementia. However MCI is heterogeneous in that not all cases progress to dementia within the time frame of a trial and some may not have underlying AD pathology. Identifying those MCIs who are most likely to decline during a trial and thus most likely to benefit from treatment will improve trial efficiency and power to detect treatment effects. To this end using multimodal imaging-derived inclusion criteria may be especially beneficial. Here we present a novel multimodal imaging marker that predicts future cognitive and neural decline from F-18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography PET amyloid florbetapir PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging based on a new deep learning algorithm randomized denoising autoencoder marker rDAm. Using ADNI2 MCI data we show that using rDAm as a trial enrichment criterion reduces the required sample estimates by at least five times compared with the no-enrichment regime and leads to smaller trials with high statistical power compared with existing methods."
