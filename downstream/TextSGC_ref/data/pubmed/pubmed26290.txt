Hybrid assistive neuromuscular dynamic stimulation HANDS therapy improved paretic upper extremity motor function in patients with severe to moderate hemiparesis. We hypothesized that brain machine interface BMI training would be able to increase paretic finger muscle activity enough to apply HANDS therapy in patients with severe hemiparesis whose finger extensor was absent. A new therapeutic application of\xa0brain-machine interface BMI training followed by hybrid assistive neuromuscular dynamic stimulation HANDS therapy for\xa0patients with severe hemiparetic stroke: A proof of concept study.
