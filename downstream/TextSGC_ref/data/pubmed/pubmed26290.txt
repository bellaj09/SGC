Mental state estimation is potentially useful for the development of asynchronous brain--computer interfaces. In this study four mental states have been identified and decoded from the electrocorticograms ECoGs of six epileptic patients engaged in a memory reach task. A novel signal analysis technique has been applied to high-dimensional statistically sparse ECoGs recorded by a large number of electrodes. The strength of the proposed technique lies in its ability to jointly extract spatial and temporal patterns responsible for encoding mental state differences. As such the technique offers a systematic way of analyzing the spatiotemporal aspects of brain information processing and may be applicable to a wide range of spatiotemporal neurophysiological signals.
