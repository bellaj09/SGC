Objective. To assess the face content and construct validity of the Voxel-Man TempoSurg Virtual Reality simulator. Participants and Methods. 74 ear nose and throat ENT surgeons participated. They were assigned to one of two groups according to their level of expertise: the expert group n = 16 and the novice group n = 58. The participants performed four temporal bone dissection tasks on the simulator. Performances were assessed by a global score and then compared to assess the construct validity of the simulator. Finally the expert group assessed the face and content validity by means of a five-point Likert-type scale. Results. experienced surgeons performed better p < .01 and faster p < .001 than the novices. However the groups did not differ in terms of bone volume removed p = .11 or number of injuries p = .37. 93.7% of experienced surgeons stated they would recommend this simulator for anatomical learning. Most 87.5% also thought that it could be integrated into surgical training. Conclusion. The Voxel-Man TempoSurg Virtual Reality simulator constitutes an interesting complementary tool to traditional teaching methods for training in otologic surgery.
