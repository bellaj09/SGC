This study investigated whether OROS methylphenidate OROS MPH Concerta or extended-release mixed amphetamine salts se-AMPH ER Adderall XR were associated with worsening of driving performance or drug rebound relative to placebo 16-17 hours post-ingestion. Nineteen male adolescent drivers aged 17-19 with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD were compared on a virtual reality driving simulator and an on-road drive after taking 72 mg of OROS MPH 30 mg of se-AMPH ER or placebo. Medication was taken at 08:00 in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants drove a simulator at 17:00 20:00 23:00 and 01:00 and drove their own cars over a 16-mile road course at 24:00. The main outcome measures were composite scores of driving performance. Neither OROS MPH nor se-AMPH ER was associated with significant worsening of simulator performance relative to placebo 17 hours post-ingestion in group comparisons. However inattentive on-road driving errors were significantly more common on se-AMPH ER relative to placebo at midnight p = 0.04 suggesting possible rebound. During both late simulator and on-road testing driving performance variance was approximately 300% greater during the se-AMPH ER compared to the OROS MPH condition. Rebound effects with long-acting amphetamine or methylphenidate stimulant medication preparations among adolescent male drivers with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
