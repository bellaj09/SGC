This study addresses for the first time the relationship between working memory and performance measures in image-guided instrument navigation with Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality MIST-VR and GI Mentor II a simulator for gastroendoscopy. In light of recent research on simulator training it is now prime time to ask why in a search for mechanisms rather than show repeatedly that conventional curriculum for simulation training has effect. Visual working memory influences the performance in virtual image-guided surgical intervention.
