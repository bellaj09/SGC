The quantitative morphological analysis of the trochlear region in the distal femur and the precise staging of the potential dysplastic condition constitute a key point for the use of personalized treatment options for the patella-femoral joint. In this paper we integrated statistical shape models SSM able to represent the individual morphology of the trochlea by means of a set of parameters and stacked sparse autoencoder SSPA networks which exploit the parameters to discriminate among different levels of abnormalities. Stacked sparse autoencoder networks and statistical shape models for automatic staging of distal femur trochlear dysplasia.
