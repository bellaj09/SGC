"For the purpose of developing multiple complementary fully labeled electronic brain atlases and an atlas-based neuroimaging system for analysis quantification and real-time manipulation of cerebral structures in two and three dimensions we have digitized enhanced segmented and labeled the following print brain atlases: Co-Planar Stereotaxic Atlas of the Human Brain by Talairach and Tournoux Atlas for Stereotaxy of the Human Brain by Schaltenbrand and Wahren Referentially Oriented Cerebral MRI Anatomy by Talairach and Tournoux and Atlas of the Cerebral Sulci by Ono Kubik and Abernathey. Three-dimensional extensions of these atlases have been developed as well. All two- and three-dimensional atlases are mutually preregistered and may be interactively registered with an actual patients data. An atlas-based neuroimaging system has been developed that provides support for reformatting registration visualization navigation image processing and quantification of clinical data. The anatomical index contains about 1000 structures and over 400 sulcal patterns. Several new applications of the brain atlas database also have been developed supported by various technologies such as virtual reality the Internet and electronic publishing. Fusion of information from multiple atlases assists the user in comprehensively understanding brain structures and identifying and quantifying anatomical regions in clinical data. The multiple brain atlas database and atlas-based neuroimaging system have substantial potential impact in stereotactic neurosurgery and radiotherapy by assisting in visualization and real-time manipulation in three dimensions of anatomical structures in quantitative neuroradiology by allowing interactive analysis of clinical data in three-dimensional neuroeducation and in brain function studies."
