Spinal cord injury SCI is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide causing a temporary or permanent impairment of neuromotor functions. Mostly associated to traumatic lesions but also to other forms of disease the appropriate treatment is still unsure. In this review several ongoing studies are presented that aim to provide methods of prevention that ensure quality of life and rehabilitation trends to patients who suffer from this injury. Stem cell research highlighted in this review seeks to reduce damage caused to the tissue as also provide spinal cord regeneration through the application of several types of stem cells. On the other hand research using brain-computer interface BCI technology proposes the development of interfaces based on the interaction of neural networks with artificial tools to restore motor control and full mobility of the injured area. PubMed MEDLINE and SciELO data basis analyses were performed to identify studies published from 2000 to date which describe the link between SCI with stem cells and BCI technology. Progress and prospects in neurorehabilitation: clinical applications of stem cells and brain-computer interface for spinal cord lesions.
