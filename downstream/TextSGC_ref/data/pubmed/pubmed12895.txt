The ventral striatum VS is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential LFP oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation DBS electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell subregions of the VS during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods logistic regression as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. We were able to predict the amount of food eaten the increase in consumption following food deprivation and the type of food eaten. Further we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying feeding behavior we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to domains of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.
