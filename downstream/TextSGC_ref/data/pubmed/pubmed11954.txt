"The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of ensemble methods in the context of deep learning with limited amounts of labeled data. We exploit an ensemble of neural networks derived using Monte Carlo dropout along with an ensemble of SVM classifiers which owes its effectiveness to the hand-crafted features used as inputs and to an active learning procedure. In order to leverage each classifiers respective strengths we combine them in an evidential framework which models specifically their imprecision and uncertainty. The application we consider in order to illustrate the interest of our Multiple Classifier System is pedestrian detection in high-density crowds which is ideally suited for its difficulty cost of labeling and intrinsic imprecision of annotation data. We show that the fusion resulting from the effective modeling of uncertainty allows for performance improvement and at the same time for a deeper interpretation of the result in terms of commitment of the decision."
