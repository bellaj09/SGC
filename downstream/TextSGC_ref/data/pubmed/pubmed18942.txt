In an immersive virtual reality environment subjects fail to notice when a scene expands or contracts around them despite correct and consistent information from binocular stereopsis and motion parallax resulting in gross failures of size constancy A. Glennerster L. Tcheang S. J. Gilson A. W. Fitzgibbon & A. J. Parker 2006. We determined whether the integration of stereopsis/motion parallax cues with texture-based cues could be modified through feedback. Subjects compared the size of two objects each visible when the room was of a different size. As the subject walked the room expanded or contracted although subjects failed to notice any change. Subjects were given feedback about the accuracy of their size judgments where the "correct" size setting was defined either by texture-based cues or in a separate experiment by stereo/motion parallax cues. Because of feedback observers were able to adjust responses such that fewer errors were made. For texture-based feedback the pattern of responses was consistent with observers weighting texture cues more heavily. However for stereo/motion parallax feedback performance in many conditions became worse such that paradoxically biases moved away from the point reinforced by the feedback. This can be explained by assuming that subjects remap the relationship between stereo/motion parallax cues and perceived size or that they develop strategies to change their criterion for a size match on different trials. In either case subjects appear not to have direct access to stereo/motion parallax cues. Stereo and motion parallax cues in human 3D vision: can they vanish without a trace?
