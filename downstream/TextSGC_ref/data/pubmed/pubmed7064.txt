Alterations in the normal developmental trajectory of amygdala resting state functional connectivity rs-FC have been associated with atypical emotional processes and psychopathology. Little is known however regarding amygdala rs-FC at birth or its relevance to outcomes. This study examined amygdala rs-FC in healthy full-term FT infants and in very preterm VPT infants and tested whether variability of neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing symptoms at age 2\xa0years.
