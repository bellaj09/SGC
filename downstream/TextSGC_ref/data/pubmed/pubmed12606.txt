Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation is the most effective treatment for Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome a condition affecting twin pregnancies in which there is a deregulation of blood circulation through the placenta that can be fatal to both babies. For the purposes of surgical planning we design the first automatic approach to detect and segment the intrauterine cavity from axial sagittal and coronal MRI stacks. Our methodology relies on the ability of capsule networks to successfully capture the part-whole interdependency of objects in the scene particularly for unique class instances i.e. intrauterine cavity. The presented deep Q-CapsNet reinforcement learning framework is built upon a context-adaptive detection policy to generate a bounding box of the womb. A capsule architecture is subsequently designed to segment or refine the whole intrauterine cavity. This network is coupled with a strided nnU-Net feature extractor which encodes discriminative feature maps to construct strong primary capsules. The method is robustly evaluated with and without the localization stage using 13 performance measures and directly compared with 15 state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on 71 singleton and monochorionic twin pregnancies. An average Dice score above 0.91 is achieved for all ablations revealing the potential of our approach to be used in clinical practice.
