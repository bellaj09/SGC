We created a system to simulate the heart allocation process in a transplant queue using a discrete event model and a neural network algorithm which we named the Lund Deep Learning Transplant Algorithm LuDeLTA. LuDeLTA is utilized to predict the survival of the patients both in the queue and after transplant. We tried four different allocation policies: wait time clinical rules and allocating the patients using either LuDeLTA or The International Heart Transplant Survival Algorithm IHTSA model. Both IHTSA and LuDeLTA were used to evaluate the results. The predicted mean survival for allocating according to wait time was about 4300 days clinical rules 4300 days and using neural networks 4700 days.
