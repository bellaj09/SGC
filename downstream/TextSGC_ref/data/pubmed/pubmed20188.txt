The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of virtual reality exercise VRE using Nintendo Wii-Fit on physical fitness of Korean adults with schizophrenia living in a mental health facility located in South Korea. Two male participants diagnosed with schizophrenia ages 53 and 61 were recruited and selected for inclusion in this study. The intervention using the Nintendo Wii-Fit consisted of 35-min sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks and was facilitated by the primary researcher and two graduate students. The senior fitness test and 10-m walking test were used to measure the physical functioning specifically physical fitness and mobility of the participants. The study was divided into three phases using an A-B-A single-subject design and involved multiple repeated measures of functional physical fitness. Both participants were evaluated each week for the duration of 18 weeks. Both participants exhibited measureable improvement in some of the physical fitness measures but not in the mobility. These results thus provide preliminary evidence to support the use of VRE to improve physical function for Korean adults with schizophrenia as an alternative exercise regimen to the conventional exercise.
