The work explores the use of denoising autoencoders DAEs for brain lesion detection segmentation and false-positive reduction. Stacked denoising autoencoders SDAEs were pretrained using a large number of unlabeled patient volumes and fine-tuned with patches drawn from a limited number of patients Formula: see text 40 65. The results show negligible loss in performance even when SDAE was fine-tuned using 20 labeled patients. Low grade glioma LGG segmentation was achieved using a transfer learning approach in which a network pretrained with high grade glioma data was fine-tuned using LGG image patches. The networks were also shown to generalize well and provide good segmentation on unseen BraTS 2013 and BraTS 2015 test data. The manuscript also includes the use of a single layer DAE referred to as novelty detector ND. ND was trained to accurately reconstruct nonlesion patches. The reconstruction error maps of test data were used to localize lesions. The error maps were shown to assign unique error distributions to various constituents of the glioma enabling localization. The ND learns the nonlesion brain accurately as it was also shown to provide good segmentation performance on ischemic brain lesions in images from a different database.
