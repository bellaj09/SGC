One in six Americans is currently affected by neurologic disease. As the United States population ages the number of neurologic complaints is expected to increase. Thus there is a pressing need for more neurologists as well as more neurology training in other specialties. Often interest in neurology begins during medical school so improving education in medical neural courses is a critical step toward producing more neurologists and better neurology training in other specialists. To this end a novel applied neuroanatomy elective was designed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio UTHSCSA to complement the traditional first-year medical neuroscience course and promote engagement and deep learning of the material with a focus on neurosensory pathways. The elective covered four neurosensory modalities proprioception/balance vision auditory and taste/olfaction over four sessions each with a short classroom component and a much longer activity component. At each session students reviewed the neurosensory pathways through structured presentations and then applied them to preplanned interactive activities many of which allowed students to utilize their artistic talents. Students were required to complete subjective pre-course and post-course surveys and reflections. The survey results and positive student comments suggest that the elective was a valuable tool when used in parallel with the traditional medical neuroscience course in promoting engagement and reinforcement of the neurosensory material.
