Coronary artery calcium CAC is biomarker of advanced subclinical coronary artery disease and predicts myocardial infarction and death prior to age 60 years. The slice-wise manual delineation has been regarded as the gold standard of coronary calcium detection. However manual efforts are time and resource consuming and even impracticable to be applied on large-scale cohorts. In this paper we propose the attention identical dual network AID-Net to perform CAC detection using scan-rescan longitudinal non-contrast CT scans with weakly supervised attention by only using per scan level labels. To leverage the performance 3D attention mechanisms were integrated into the AID-Net to provide complementary information for classification tasks. Moreover the 3D Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping Grad-CAM was also proposed at the testing stage to interpret the behaviors of the deep neural network. 5075 non-contrast chest CT scans were used as training validation and testing datasets. Baseline performance was assessed on the same cohort. From the results the proposed AID-Net achieved the superior performance on classification accuracy 0.9272 and AUC 0.9627.
