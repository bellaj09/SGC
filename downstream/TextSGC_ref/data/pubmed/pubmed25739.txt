"A new type of brain-computer interface was elaborated. It considers a variety of brain activity parameters to determine the type of mental operation being performed at the moment. The corresponding algorithm previously developed in the lab was modified for real-time application. The possibility of interface application for cognitive skills training was investigated. In the proposed paradigm as soon as the EEG spectral pattern was adequate for the current task some clue to the solution was presented. As we supposed such positive biofeedback should facilitate memorization of the current brain state. After just one learning session the differences in EEG spectra corresponding two types of tasks were concentrated in more narrow frequency ranges. It indicates the decrease of mental effort. Moreover the majority of subjects succeeded to solve the tasks faster thats an evidence of efficiency increased. The developed interface could be used for the new type of training based on objective features of brain activity." Cognitive brainComputer interface and probable aspects of its practical application.
