Intertemporal decision-making is naturally ubiquitous to us: individuals always make a decision with different consequences occurring at different moments. These choices are invariably involved in life-changing outcomes regarding marriage education fertility long-term well-being and even public policy. Previous studies have clearly uncovered the neurobiological mechanism of the intertemporal decision in the schemes of regional location or sub-network. However it still remains unclear how to characterize intertemporal behavior with multimodal whole-brain network metrics to date. Here we combined diffusion tensor image and resting-state functional connectivity MRI technology in conjunction with graph-theoretical analysis to explore the link between topological properties of integrated structural and functional whole-brain networks and intertemporal decision-making. Graph-theoretical analysis illustrated that the participants with steep discounting rates exhibited the decreased global topological organizations including small-world and rich-club regimes in both functional and structural connectivity networks and reflected the dreadful local topological dynamics in the modularity of functional connectome. Furthermore in the cross-modalities configuration the same relationship was predominantly observed for the coupling of structural-functional connectivity as well. Above topological metrics are commonly indicative of the communication pattern of simultaneous global and local parallel information processing and it thus reshapes our accounts on intertemporal decision-making from functional regional/sub-network scheme to multimodal brain overall organization. Altered structural and functional brain network overall organization predict human intertemporal decision-making.
