Heart transplantations have made it possible to extend the median survival time to 12 years for patients with end-stage heart diseases. This operation is unfortunately limited by the availability of donor organs and patients have to wait on average about 200 days in a waiting list before being operated. This waiting time varies considerably across the patients. In this paper we studied the outcome for patients entering a transplantation waiting list using deep learning techniques. We implemented a model in the form of two-layer neural networks and we predicted the outcome as still waiting transplanted or dead in the waiting list at three different time points: 180 days 365 days and 730 days. As data source we used the United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS registry where we extracted adult patients >17 years from January 2000 to December 2011. We trained our model using the Keras framework and we report F1 macro scores of respectively 0.674 0.680 and 0.680 compared to a baseline of 0.271. We also applied a backward elimination procedure using our neural network to extract the 10 most significant parameters predicting the patient status for the three different time points.
