"Alzheimers disease is an incurable progressive neurological brain disorder. Earlier detection of Alzheimers disease can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Several statistical and machine learning models have been exploited by researchers for Alzheimers disease diagnosis. Analyzing magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a common practice for Alzheimers disease diagnosis in clinical research. Detection of Alzheimers disease is exacting due to the similarity in Alzheimers disease MRI data and standard healthy MRI data of older people. Recently advanced deep learning techniques have successfully demonstrated human-level performance in numerous fields including medical image analysis. We propose a deep convolutional neural network for Alzheimers disease diagnosis using brain MRI data analysis. While most of the existing approaches perform binary classification our model can identify different stages of Alzheimers disease and obtains superior performance for early-stage diagnosis. We conducted ample experiments to demonstrate that our proposed model outperformed comparative baselines on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies dataset."
