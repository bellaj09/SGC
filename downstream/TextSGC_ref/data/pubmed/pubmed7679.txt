"Precisely labeling teeth on digitalized 3D dental surface models is the precondition for tooth position rearrangements in orthodontic treatment planning. However it is a challenging task primarily due to the abnormal and varying appearance of patients teeth. The emerging utilization of intraoral scanners IOSs in clinics further increases the difficulty in automated tooth labeling as the raw surfaces acquired by IOS are typically low-quality at gingival and deep intraoral regions. In recent years some pioneering end-to-end methods e.g. PointNet have been proposed in the communities of computer vision and graphics to consume directly raw surface for 3D shape segmentation. Although these methods are potentially applicable to our task most of them fail to capture fine-grained local geometric context that is critical to the identification of small teeth with varying shapes and appearances. In this paper we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method called MeshSegNet for automated tooth labeling on raw dental surfaces. Using multiple raw surface attributes as inputs MeshSegNet integrates a series of graph-constrained learning modules along its forward path to hierarchically extract multi-scale local contextual features. Then a dense fusion strategy is applied to combine local-to-global geometric features for the learning of higher-level features for mesh cell annotation. The predictions produced by our MeshSegNet are further post-processed by a graph-cut refinement step for final segmentation. We evaluated MeshSegNet using a real-patient dataset consisting of raw maxillary surfaces acquired by 3D IOS. Experimental results performed 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that MeshSegNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation."
