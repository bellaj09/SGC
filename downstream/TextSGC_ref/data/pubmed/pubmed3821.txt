Cerebral involvement is common in patients with systemic Lupus erythematosus SLE and is characterized by multiple clinical presentations including cognitive disorders headaches and syncope. Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated cerebral dysfunction during different tasks among SLE patients; however there have been few studies designed to characterize network alterations or to identify clinical markers capable of reflecting the cerebral involvement in SLE patients. This study was designed to characterize the profile of the cerebral activation area and the functional connectivity of cognitive function in SLE patients by using a task-based and a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI technique and to determine whether or not any clinical biomarkers could serve as an indicator of cerebral involvement in this disease. The well-established cognitive function test Paced Visual Serial Adding Test PVSAT was used. Thirty SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were examined using PVSAT task-based and resting state fMRI. Outside the scanner the performance of patients and the healthy controls was similar. In the PVSAT task-based fMRI patients presented significantly expanded areas of activation and the activated areas exhibited significantly higher functional connectivity strength in patients in the resting state. A positive correlation existed between individual connectivity strength and disease activity scoring. No correlation with cerebral involvement existed for serum markers such as C3 C4 and anti-dsDNA. Thus our findings may shed new light on the pathologic mechanism underlying neuropsychiatric SLE and suggests that disease activity may be a potential effective biomarker reflecting cerebral involvement in SLE. Abnormalities of frontal-parietal resting-state functional connectivity are related to disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
