Rehabilitation for stroke patients with severe motor impairments e.g. inability to perform wrist or finger extension on the affected side is burdensome and difficult because most current rehabilitation options require some volitional movement to retrain the affected side. However although these patients participate in therapy requiring volitional movement previous research has shown that they may receive modest benefits from action observation virtual reality VR and brain-computer interfaces BCIs. These approaches have shown some success in strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor recovery after stroke in the absence of volitional movement. The purpose of this study was to combine the principles of VR and BCI in a platform called REINVENT and assess its effects on four chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor impairment. REINVENT acquires post-stroke EEG signals that indicate an attempt to move and drives the movement of a virtual avatar arm allowing patient-driven action observation neurofeedback in VR. In addition synchronous electromyography EMG data were also captured to monitor overt muscle activity. Here we tested four chronic stroke survivors and show that this EEG-based BCI can be safely used over repeated sessions by stroke survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally individual results suggest that patients with more severe motor impairments may benefit the most from EEG-based neurofeedback while patients with more mild impairments may benefit more from EMG-based feedback harnessing existing sensorimotor pathways. We note that although this work is promising due to the small sample size these results are preliminary. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population.
