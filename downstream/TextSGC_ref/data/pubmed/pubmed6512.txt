The psoas-major muscle has been reported as a predictive factor of sarcopenia. The cross-sectional area CSA of the psoas-major muscle in axial images has been indicated to correlate well with the whole-body skeletal muscle mass. In this study we evaluated the segmentation accuracy of low-dose X-ray computed tomography CT images of the psoas-major muscle using the U-Net convolutional neural network which is a deep-learning technique. Deep learning has been recently known to outperform conventional image-segmentation techniques. We used fivefold cross validation to validate the segmentation performance n\u2009=\u2009100 of the psoas-major muscle. For the intersection over union and CSA ratio segmentation accuracies of 86.0 and 103.1% respectively were achieved. These results suggest that the U-Net network is competitive compared with the previous methods. Therefore the proposed technique is useful for segmenting the psoas-major muscle even in low-dose CT images.
