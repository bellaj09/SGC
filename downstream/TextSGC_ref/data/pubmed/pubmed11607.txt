Skin disease is a prevalent condition all over the world. Computer vision-based technology for automatic skin lesion classification holds great promise as an effective screening tool for early diagnosis. In this paper we propose an accurate and interpretable deep learning pipeline to achieve such a goal. Comparing with existing research we would like to highlight the following aspects of our model. 1 Rather than a single model our approach ensembles a set of deep learning architectures to achieve better classification accuracy; 2 Generative adversarial network GAN is involved in the model training to promote data scale and diversity; 3 Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation LIME strategy is applied to extract evidence from the skin images to support the classification results. Our experimental results on real-world skin image corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The explainability of our model further enhances its applicability in real clinical practice. Towards Interpretable Skin Lesion Classification with Deep Learning Models.
