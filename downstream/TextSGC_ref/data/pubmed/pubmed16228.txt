Embodied cognition studies have shown motor resonance during action language processing indicating that linguistic representations are at least partially multimodal. However constraints of this activation linked to linguistic and extra-linguistic context function and timing have not yet been fully explored. Importantly embodied cognition binds social and physical contexts to cognition suggesting that more ecologically valid contexts will yield more valid measures of cognitive processing. Herein we measured cortical motor activation during language processing in a fully immersive Cave automatic virtual environment CAVE. EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a Go/No-Go task. They heard action verbs and for Go trials performed a corresponding action on a virtual object. ERSP event-related spectral perturbation was calculated during verb processing corresponding to the pattern of power suppression event-related desynchronization - ERD and enhancement event-related synchronization - ERS relative to the reference interval. Significant ERD emerged during verb processing in both the  8-13\u202fHz and beta band 20-30\u202fHz for both Go and No-Go trials.  ERD emerged in the 400-500\u202fmsec time window associated with lexical-semantic processing. Greater  ERD emerged for Go compared to No-Go trials. The present results provide compelling evidence in a naturalistic setting of how motor and linguistic processes interact.
