Olfactory stimulation evokes a column of activity within the olfactory bulb extending from the glomerular layer to the granule cell layer that can be visualized with 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography optical imaging Fos protein immunohistochemistry and c-fos mRNA in situ hybridization. The Fos response to odors is typified by the activity of relatively few juxtaglomerular cells which often occur in foci and a large number of granule cells extending through much of the bulb. In this study we characterized the granule cell response to an odor for which young rats had acquired a preference. Fos-like immunoreactive granule cells were quantified by image analysis and densely stained cells were counted in a region previously shown to be responsive to peppermint odor. We found that odor-trained pups have about half the number of Fos-immunopositive superficial granule cells which respond to a learned odor than do control pups. We then determined whether there was a correlation between the juxtaglomerular cell response and the response of the superficial granule cells deep to those glomerular layer cells. We found a positive correlation between the number of juxtaglomerular cells and the number of granule cells demonstrating Fos immunoreactivity in both control and trained pups a relationship that changed with early olfactory training. A learned odor decreases the number of Fos-immunopositive granule cells in the olfactory bulb of young rats.
