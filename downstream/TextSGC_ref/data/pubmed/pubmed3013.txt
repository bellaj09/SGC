Radiation therapy RT is a critical treatment modality for patients with brain tumors although it can cause adverse effects. Recent data suggest that brain RT is associated with dose-dependent cortical atrophy which could disrupt neocortical networks. This study examines whether brain RT affects structural network properties in brain tumor patients. We applied graph theory to MRI-derived cortical thickness estimates of 54 brain tumor patients before and after RT. Cortical surfaces were parcellated into 68 regions and correlation matrices were created for patients pre- and post-RT. Significant changes in graph network properties were tested using nonparametric permutation tests. Linear regressions were conducted to measure the association between dose and changes in nodal network connectivity. Increases in transitivity modularity and global efficiency n\u2009=\u200954 p\u2009<\u20090.0001 were all observed in patients post-RT. Decreases in local efficiency n\u2009=\u200954 p\u2009=\u20090.007 and clustering coefficient n\u2009=\u200954 p\u2009=\u20090.005 were seen in regions receiving higher RT doses including the inferior parietal lobule and rostral anterior cingulate. These findings demonstrate alterations in global and local network topology following RT characterized by increased segregation of brain regions critical to cognition. These pathological network changes may contribute to the late delayed cognitive impairments observed in many patients following brain RT.
