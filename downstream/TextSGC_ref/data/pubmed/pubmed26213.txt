Recordings from invasive implants can degrade over time resulting in a loss of spiking activity for some electrodes. For brain-machine interfaces BMI such a signal degradation lowers control performance. Achieving reliable performance over time is critical for BMI clinical viability. One approach to improve BMI longevity is to simultaneously use spikes and other recording modalities such as local field potentials LFP which are more robust to signal degradation over time. We have developed a multiscale decoder that can simultaneously model the different statistical profiles of multi-scale spike/LFP activity discrete spikes vs. continuous LFP. This decoder can also run at multiple time-scales millisecond for spikes vs. tens of milliseconds for LFP. Here we validate the multiscale decoder for estimating the movement of 7 major upper-arm joint angles in a non-human primate NHP during a 3D reach-to-grasp task. The multiscale decoder uses motor cortical spike/LFP recordings as its input. We show that the multiscale decoder can improve decoding accuracy by adding information from LFP to spikes while running at the fast millisecond time-scale of the spiking activity. Moreover this improvement is achieved using relatively few LFP channels demonstrating the robustness of the approach. These results suggest that using multiscale decoders has the potential to improve the reliability and longevity of BMIs. Multiscale decoding for reliable brain-machine interface performance over time.
