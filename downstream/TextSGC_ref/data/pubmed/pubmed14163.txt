Street Scene Parsing SSP is a fundamental and important step for autonomous driving and traffic scene understanding. Recently Fully Convolutional Network FCN based methods have delivered expressive performances with the help of large-scale dense-labeling datasets. However in urban traffic environments not all the labels contribute equally for making the control decision. Certain labels such as pedestrian car bicyclist road lane or sidewalk would be more important in comparison with labels for vegetation sky or building. Based on this fact in this paper we propose a novel deep learning framework named Residual Atrous Pyramid Network RAPNet for importance-aware SSP. More specifically to incorporate the importance of various object classes we propose an Importance-Aware Feature Selection IAFS mechanism which automatically selects the important features for label predictions. The IAFS can operate in each convolutional block and the semantic features with different importance are captured in different channels so that they are automatically assigned with corresponding weights. To enhance the labeling coherence we also propose a Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid RASP module to sequentially aggregate global-to-local context information in a residual refinement manner. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks have shown that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances and can consistently obtain more accurate results on the semantic classes with high importance levels.
