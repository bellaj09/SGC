Pediatric laparoscopy is a novelty that has yet to be critically assessed in large randomized controlled trials. Just because an operation can be performed laparoscopically does not mean it must be done that way. Many procedures can now be performed more quickly and cheaply through small incisions without the added cardiorespiratory risks seen in laparoscopy. Reports of serious complications are beginning to appear in publications. It will become important to compare laparoscopic techniques with both open surgery and the minimally invasive approach for the same procedure. Many published studies suggest laparoscopy offers significant advantages for some operations and for sicker patients. Practitioners must have a thorough understanding of the physiologic changes that follow pneumoperitoneum and extremes of positioning. As enthusiasm builds it is essential to maintain safety standards. Endoscopists must be appropriately trained and peer reviewed. The use of virtual reality models now allows surgeons to develop and perfect their laparoscopic skills. When the laparoscopic approach is difficult surgeons must be willing to convert to open surgery rather than persevere and risk iatrogenic damage. The role of pediatric laparoscopy has yet to be defined although current trends suggest that it will assume an important position in pediatric surgery.
