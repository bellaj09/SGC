It has been suggested that orthographic transparency and age changes may affect the relationship between visual attention span VAS deficit and reading difficulty. The present study explored the developmental trend of VAS in children with developmental dyslexia DD in Chinese a logographic language with a deep orthography. Fifty-seven Chinese children with DD and fifty-four age-matched normal readers participated. The visual 1-back task was adopted to examine VAS. Phonological and morphological awareness tests and reading tests in single-character and sentence levels were used for reading skill measurements. Results showed that only high graders with dyslexia exhibited lower accuracy than the controls in the VAS task revealing an increased VAS deficit with development in the dyslexics. Moreover the developmental trajectory analyses demonstrated that the dyslexics seemed to exhibit an atypical but not delayed pattern in their VAS development as compared to the controls. A correlation analysis indicated that VAS was only associated with morphological awareness for dyslexic readers in high grades. Further regression analysis showed that VAS skills and morphological awareness made separate and significant contributions to single-character reading for high grader with dyslexia. These findings suggested a developmental increasing trend in the relationship between VAS skills and reading disability in Chinese. Increased deficit of visual attention span with development in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia.
