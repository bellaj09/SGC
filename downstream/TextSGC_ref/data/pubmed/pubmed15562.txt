The most common encoding strategies used by participants in word list studies include rehearsal and using the story mnemonic. Previous studies have suggested that with a rote-rehearsal strategy mixed lists lead people to borrow rehearsal time from massed items and to give it to spaced items. Using rehearse-aloud methodologies we demonstrated in Experiment 1 that the borrowing effect does not occur in the story mnemonic. However the rates of rehearsal of individual items provided a good prediction of their subsequent recall rates with spaced items being rehearsed more often in both mixed and pure lists. In experiment 2 we demonstrated that creating "story links" between items enhanced recall but it did not affect the magnitude of the spacing effect. These results suggest that a massed-item deficit in encoding may underlie the spacing effect in the story mnemonic. A deeper analysis of the spacing effect after "deep" encoding.
