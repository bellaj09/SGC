Detection of pulmonary nodules is an important aspect of an automatic detection system. Incomputer-aided diagnosis CAD systems the ability to detect pulmonary nodules is highly important which plays an important role in the diagnosis and early treatment of lung cancer. Currently the detection of pulmonary nodules depends mainly on doctor experience which varies. This paper aims to address the challenge of pulmonary nodule detection more effectively. A CAD system for pulmonary nodule prediction based on deep three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning.
