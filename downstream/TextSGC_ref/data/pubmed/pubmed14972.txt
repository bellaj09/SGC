This article proposes a novel regularization deep cascade broad learning system DCBLS architecture which includes one cascaded feature mapping nodes layer and one cascaded enhancement nodes layer. Then the transformation feature representation is easily obtained by incorporating the enhancement nodes and the feature mapping nodes. Once such a representation is established a final output layer is constructed by implementing a simple convex optimization model. Furthermore a parallelization framework on the new method is designed to make it compatible with large-scale data. Simultaneously an adaptive regularization parameter criterion is adopted under some conditions. Moreover the stability and error estimate of this method are discussed and proved mathematically. The proposed method could extract sufficient available information from the raw data compared with the standard broad learning system and could achieve compellent successes in image denoising. The experiments results on benchmark datasets including natural images as well as hyperspectral images verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches for image denoising.
