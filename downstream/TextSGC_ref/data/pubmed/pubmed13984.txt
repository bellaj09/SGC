Genome-wide marker data are used both in phenotypic genome-wide association studies GWAS and genome-wide prediction GWP. Typically such studies include high-dimensional data with thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs recorded in hundreds to a few thousands individuals. Different machine-learning approaches have been used in GWAS and GWP effectively but the use of neural networks NN and deep-learning is still scarce. This study presents a NN model for genomic SNP data. Approximate Bayesian neural networks in genomic prediction.
