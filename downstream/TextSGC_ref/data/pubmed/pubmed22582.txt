Linear endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration EBUS-TBNA represents a pivotal innovation in interventional pulmonology; determining the best approach to guarantee systematic and efficient training is expected to become a main issue in the forthcoming years. Virtual reality simulators have been proposed as potential EBUS-TBNA training instruments to avoid unskilled beginners practicing directly in real-life settings. A validated and perfected simulation program could be used before allowing beginners to practice on patients. Our goal was to test the reliability of the EBUS-Skills and Task Assessment Tool STAT and its subscores for measuring the competence of experienced bronchoscopists approaching EBUS-guided TBNA using only the virtual reality simulator as both a training and an assessment tool. EBUS-STAT Subscore Analysis to Predict the Efficacy and Assess the Validity of Virtual Reality Simulation for EBUS-TBNA Training Among Experienced Bronchoscopists.
