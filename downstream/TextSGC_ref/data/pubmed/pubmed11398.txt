The daily operation of clinical laboratories will be drastically impacted by two disruptive technologies: automation and artificial intelligence the development and use of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These technologies will also expand the scope of laboratory medicine. Automation will result in increased efficiency but will require changes to laboratory infrastructure and a shift in workforce training requirements. The application of artificial intelligence to large clinical datasets generated through increased automation will lead to the development of new diagnostic and prognostic models. Together automation and artificial intelligence will support the move to personalized medicine. Changes in pathology and clinical doctoral scientist training will be necessary to fully participate in these changes.
