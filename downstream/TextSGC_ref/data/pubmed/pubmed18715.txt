Recent research suggests that virtual reality VR enhanced exposure therapy may enhance the efficacy of treatment through increasing patient engagement in the exposure. This study evaluated the use of VR in the treatment of PTSD following the WTC attack of September 11 2001. Individuals in a 14 session VR-enhanced treatment n=9 were compared to a waitlist WL control group n=8. ANOVA showed a significant interaction of time by group p<.01 with a large effect size of 1.53. The VR group showed significantly greater post-treatment decline in CAPS scores compared to the WL. Our preliminary data suggests that VR is an effective tool for enhancing exposure therapy for both civilians and disaster workers who suffer from PTSD.
