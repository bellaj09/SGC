The possibility of using deep brain stimulation DBS for memory enhancement has recently been reported but the precise underlying mechanisms of its effects remain unknown. Our previous study suggested that spatial memory improvement by medial septum MS-DBS may be associated with cholinergic regulation and neurogenesis. However the affected stage of memory could not be distinguished because the stimulation was delivered during the execution of all memory processes. Therefore this study was performed to determine the stage of memory affected by MS-DBS. Rats were administered 192 IgG-saporin to lesion cholinergic neurons. Stimulation was delivered at different times in different groups of rats: 5\xa0days before the Morris water maze test pre-stimulation 5\xa0days during the training phase of the Morris water maze test training-stimulation and 2\xa0h before the Morris water maze probe test probe-stimulation. A fourth group of rats was lesioned but received no stimulation. These four groups were compared with a normal control group. Identifying the appropriate time for deep brain stimulation to achieve spatial memory improvement on the Morris water maze.
