Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insights into the behavior of molecular systems. Extending the recent trend of using machine learning techniques to predict physicochemical properties from molecular dynamics data we propose to consider the trajectories as multidimensional time series represented by 2D tensors containing the ligand-protein interaction descriptor values for each time step. Similar in structure to the time series encountered in modern approaches for signal speech and natural language processing these time series can be directly analyzed using long short-term memory LSTM recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks CNNs. The predictive regression models for the ligand-protein affinity were built for a subset of the PDBbind v.2017 database and applied to inhibitors of tankyrase an enzyme of the polyADP-ribose-polymerase PARP family that can be used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. As an additional test set a subset of the Community Structure-Activity Resource CSAR data set was used. For comparison the random forest and simple neural network models based on the crystal pose or the trajectory-averaged descriptors were used as well as the commonly employed docking and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area MM-PBSA scores. Convolutional neural networks based on the 2D tensors of ligand-protein interaction descriptors for short 2 ns trajectories provide the best accuracy and predictive power reaching the Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.73 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 for the tankyrase test set. Taking into account the recent increase in computational power of modern GPUs and relatively low computational complexity of the proposed approach it can be used as an advanced virtual screening filter for compound prioritization.
