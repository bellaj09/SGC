Trainees require extensive experience to perform radical hysterectomy. Before starting training during an actual operation trainees should be familiar with the pelvic anatomy and should simulate surgical procedures. Many simulators are available for virtual reality training of laparoscopic operations but they are very expensive. The materials required to construct our model included sponges and colored wires sold in home improvement stores that allowed for superior cost effectiveness. The model represented almost all peripheral vessels and nerves around the uterus including the minor vessels. Attaching and detaching the vessels was easy facilitating reconstruction of the dissected vessels. The wires were easy to bend ensuring high operability. This model allows for the simulation of laparoscopic radical hysterectomy in a dry box. Our model was superior to a 2-dimensional picture for the memorization of branching and positional relationships of the blood vessels. Comparison of our model with actual operative videos showed that the dry box provided an identical surgical view of an actual laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. We developed a peripheral bloodstream model of the uterus for repeated simulation of laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with an actual surgical view using a dry box.
