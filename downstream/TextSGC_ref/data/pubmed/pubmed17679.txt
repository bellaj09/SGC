"Phantom motor execution PME facilitated by myoelectric pattern recognition MPR and virtual reality VR is positioned to be a viable option to treat phantom limb pain PLP. A recent clinical trial using PME on upper-limb amputees with chronic intractable PLP yielded promising results. However further work in the area of signal acquisition is needed if such technology is to be used on subjects with lower-limb amputation. We propose two alternative electrode configurations to conventional bipolar targeted recordings for acquiring surface electromyography. We evaluated their performance in a real-time MPR task for non-weight-bearing lower-limb movements. We found that monopolar recordings using a circumferential electrode of conductive fabric performed similarly to classical bipolar recordings but were easier to use in a clinical setting. In addition we present the first case study of a lower-limb amputee with chronic intractable PLP treated with PME. The patients Pain Rating Index dropped by 22 points from 32 to 10 68% after 23 PME sessions. These results represent a methodological advancement and a positive proof-of-concept of PME in lower limbs. Further work remains to be conducted for a high-evidence level clinical validation of PME as a treatment of PLP in lower-limb amputees."
