Action observation training based on the theory of activation of the mirror-neuron system has been used for the rehabilitation of patients with stroke. In this paper we sought to assess whether a brain-computer interface BCI-based action observation rehabilitation game using a flickering action video could preferentially activate the mirror-neuron system. Feedback of stimulus observation evoked by the flickering action video was provided using steady state visually evoked potential and event-related desynchronization. Fifteen healthy subjects have experienced the game with BCI interaction game and interaction without BCI interaction game without interaction observed non-flickering stimuli and flickering stimuli without the game background stimuli only in a counter-balanced order. The game and interface condition was resulted in significantly stronger activation of the mirror-neuron system than did the other three conditions. In addition the amount of mirror-neuron system activation is gradually decreased in the game without interface non-flickering stimuli and stimuli only conditions in a time-dependent manner; however in the game and interface condition the amount of mirror-neuron system activation was maintained until the end of the training. Taken together these data suggest that the proposed game paradigm which integrates the action observation paradigm with BCI technology could provide interactive responses for whether watching video clips can engage patients and enhance rehabilitation.
