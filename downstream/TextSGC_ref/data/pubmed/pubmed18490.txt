"With emerging technology computerised internet-based and virtual reality VR-based treatment and training became increasingly popular. VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder ASD is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies AIMTech Centre at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation M\xa0=\xa020.2 SD\xa0=\xa03.00 than before the training M\xa0=\xa018.9 SD\xa0=\xa03.57 t35\xa0=\xa0-2.174 p\xa0=\xa0.037 and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training M\xa0=\xa021.8 SD\xa0=\xa02.99 than before training M\xa0=\xa020.2 SD\xa0=\xa03.43 t35\xa0=\xa0-3.987 p\xa0<\xa0.0005. There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions F1 70\xa0=\xa05.223 p\xa0=\xa0.025 partial 2\xa0=\xa0.069 and on social reciprocity F1 70\xa0=\xa07.769 p\xa0=\xa0.007 partial 2\xa0=\xa0.100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers or therapists support has yet to be further investigated."
