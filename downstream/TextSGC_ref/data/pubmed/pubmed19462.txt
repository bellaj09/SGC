"According to embodied cognition bodily interactions with our environment shape the perception and representation of our body and the surrounding space that is peripersonal space. To investigate the adaptive nature of these spatial representations we introduced a multisensory conflict between vision and proprioception in an immersive virtual reality. During individual bimanual interaction trials we gradually shifted the visual hand representation. As a result participants unknowingly shifted their actual hands to compensate for the visual shift. We then measured the adaptation to the invoked multisensory conflict by means of a self-localization and an external localization task. While effects of the conflict were observed in both tasks the effects systematically interacted with the type of localization task and the available visual information while performing the localization task i.e. the visibility of the virtual hands. The results imply that the localization of ones own hands is based on a multisensory integration process which is modulated by the saliency of the currently most relevant sensory modality and the involved frame of reference. Moreover the results suggest that our brain strives for consistency between its body and spatial estimates thereby adapting multiple related frames of reference and the spatial estimates within due to a sensory conflict in one of them." Lost in space: multisensory conflict yields adaptation in spatial representations across frames of reference.
