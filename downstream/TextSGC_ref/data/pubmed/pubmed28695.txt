Invasive brain-machine-interface BMI has the prospect to empower tetraplegic patients with independent mobility through the use of brain-controlled wheelchairs. For the practical and long-term use of such control systems the system has to distinguish between stop and movement states and has to be robust to overcome non-stationarity in the brain signals. In this work we investigates the non-stationarity of the stop state on neural data collected from a macaque trained to control a robotic platform to stop and move in left right forward directions We then propose a hybrid approach that employs both random forest and linear discriminant analysis LDA. Using this approach we performed offline decoding on 8 days of data collected over the course of three months during joystick control of the robotic platform. We compared the results of using the proposed approach with the use of LDA alone to perform direct classifications of stop left right and forward. The results showed an average performance increment of 22.7% using the proposed hybrid approach. The results yielded significant improvements during sessions where LDA showed a heavy bias towards the stop state. This suggests that the proposed hybrid approach addresses the non-stationarity in the stop state and subsequently facilitates a more accurate decoding of the movement states.
