Stroke is a main cause for long-term disability. Stroke symptoms cover various domains e.g. motor sensory language or other cognitive functions. In clinical practice and rehabilitation research especially motor impairment attracts much attention. However also cognitive impairments are common after stroke effecting approximately two-thirds of stroke patients in the acute phase. Although 30% of stroke patients spontaneously recover from their cognitive impairments large amounts of patients remain cognitively impaired. These patients have more problems reintegrating in personal and professional life. To date cognitive rehabilitation strategies are not yet satisfactory. One promising strategy is combining non-invasive brain stimulation NIBS with cognitive training. In the current review we will discuss the relevance of cognitive impairment after stroke and innovative interventional strategies to improve cognition such as NIBS. Furthermore we will address the potential of using cognitive training to enhance recovery in other behavioural domains such as the motor domain. Non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance cognitive rehabilitation after stroke.
