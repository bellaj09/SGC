Numerous studies have examined the neuronal inputs and outputs of many areas within the mammalian cerebral cortex but how these areas are organized into neural networks that communicate across the entire cortex is unclear. Over 600 labeled neuronal pathways acquired from tracer injections placed across the entire mouse neocortex enabled us to generate a cortical connectivity atlas.\xa0A total of 240 intracortical connections were manually reconstructed within a common neuroanatomic framework forming a cortico-cortical connectivity map that facilitates comparison of connections from different cortical targets. Connectivity matrices were generated to provide an overview of all intracortical connections and subnetwork clusterings. The connectivity matrices and cortical map revealed that the entire cortex is organized into four somatic sensorimotor two medial and two lateral subnetworks that display unique topologies and can interact through select cortical areas. Together these data provide a resource that can be used to further investigate cortical networks and their corresponding functions. Neural networks of the mouse neocortex.
