"This paper proposes a novel adaptive online-feedback methodology for Brain Computer Interfaces BCI. The method uses ElectroEncephaloGraphic EEG signals and combines motor with speech imagery to allow for tasks that involve multiple degrees of freedom DoF. The main approach utilizes the covariance matrix descriptor as feature and the Relevance Vector Machines RVM classifier. The novel contributions include 1 a new method to select representative data to update the RVM model and 2 an online classifier which is an adaptively-weighted mixture of RVM models to account for the users exploration and exploitation processes during the learning phase. Instead of evaluating the subjects performance solely based on the conventional metric of accuracy we analyze their skills improvement based on 3 other criteria namely the confusion matrixs quality the separability of the data and their instability. After collecting calibration data for 8 minutes in the first run 8 participants were able to control the system while receiving visual feedback in the subsequent runs. We observed significant improvement in all subjects including two of them who fell into the BCI illiteracy category. Our proposed BCI system complements the existing approaches in several aspects. First the co-adaptation paradigm not only adapts the classifiers but also allows the users to actively discover their own way to use the BCI through their exploration and exploitation processes. Furthermore the auto-calibrating system can be used immediately with a minimal calibration time. Finally this is the first work to combine motor and speech imagery in an online feedback experiment to provide multiple DoF for BCI control applications."
