"In the course of screening lipopolysaccharide LPS-induced nitric oxide NO production inhibitors two related benzodiazepine derivatives cyclopenol and cyclopenin were isolated from the extract of a deep marine-derived fungal strain Aspergillus sp. SCSIOW2. Cyclopenol and cyclopenin inhibited the LPS-induced formation of NO and secretion of IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells at nontoxic concentrations. In terms of the mechanism underlying these effects cyclopenol and cyclopenin were found to inhibit the upstream signal of NF-B activation. These compounds also inhibited the expression of IL-1 IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS in mouse microglia cells macrophages in the brain. In relation to the cause of Alzheimers disease amyloid--peptide is known to induce inflammation in the brain. Therefore the present study investigated the ameliorative effects of these inhibitors on an in vivo Alzheimers model using flies. Learning deficits were induced by the overexpression of amyloid-42 in flies and cyclopenin but not cyclopenol was found to rescue learning impairment. Therefore novel anti-inflammatory activities of cyclopenin were identified which may be useful as a candidate of anti-inflammatory agents for neurodegenerative diseases." Inhibition of cellular inflammatory mediator production and amelioration of learning deficit in flies by deep sea Aspergillus-derived cyclopenin.
