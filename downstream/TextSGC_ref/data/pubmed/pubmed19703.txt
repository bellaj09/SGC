"The Pico Lantern is a miniature projector developed for structured light surface reconstruction augmented reality and guidance in laparoscopic surgery. During surgery it will be dropped into the patient and picked up by a laparoscopic tool. While inside the patient it projects a known coded pattern and images onto the surface of the tissue. The Pico Lantern is visually tracked in the laparoscopes field of view for the purpose of stereo triangulation between it and the laparoscope. In this paper the first application is surface reconstruction. Using a stereo laparoscope and an untracked Pico Lantern the absolute error for surface reconstruction for a plane cylinder and ex vivo kidney is 2.0 mm 3.0 mm and 5.6 mm respectively. Using a mono laparoscope and a tracked Pico Lantern for the same plane cylinder and kidney the absolute error is 1.4 mm 1.5 mm and 1.5 mm respectively. These results confirm the benefit of the wider baseline produced by tracking the Pico Lantern. Virtual viewpoint images are generated from the kidney surface data and an in vivo proof-of-concept porcine trial is reported. Surface reconstruction of the neck of a volunteer shows that the pulsatile motion of the tissue overlying a major blood vessel can be detected and displayed in vivo. Future work will integrate the Pico Lantern into standard and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery."
