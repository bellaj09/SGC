Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction estimation and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network enabling a compact and efficient embedding while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus we benefit from the power of deep learning while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings. Deep learning for universal linear embeddings of nonlinear dynamics.
