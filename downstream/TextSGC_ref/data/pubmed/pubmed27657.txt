"Discriminative features have to be properly extracted and selected from the electroencephalographic EEG signals of each specific subject in order to achieve an adaptive brain-computer interface BCI system. This work presents an efficient wrapper-based methodology for feature selection and least squares discrimination of high-dimensional EEG data with low computational complexity. Features are computed in different time segments using three widely used methods for motor imagery tasks and then they are concatenated or averaged in order to take into account the time course variability of the EEG signals. Once EEG features have been extracted proposed framework comprises two stages. The first stage entails feature ranking and in this work two different procedures have been considered the least angle regression LARS and the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the performance of each one. The second stage selects the most relevant features using an efficient leave-one-out LOO estimation based on the Allens PRESS statistic. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art BCI methods shows that this approach gives better results than current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recognition rates and computational requirements and also with respect to the first ranking stage it is confirmed that the LARS algorithm provides better results than the Wilcoxon rank sum test for these experiments."
