A robust lung segmentation method using a deep convolutional neural network CNN was developed and evaluated on high-resolution computed tomography HRCT and volumetric CT of various types of diffuse interstitial lung disease DILD. Chest CT images of 617 patients with various types of DILD including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia COP usual interstitial pneumonia UIP and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia NSIP were scanned using HRCT 1-2-mm slices 5-10-mm intervals and volumetric CT sub-millimeter thickness without intervals. Each scan was segmented using a conventional image processing method and then manually corrected by an expert thoracic radiologist to create gold standards. The lung regions in the HRCT images were then segmented using a two-dimensional U-Net architecture with the deep CNN using separate training validation and test sets. In addition 30 independent volumetric CT images of UIP patients were used to further evaluate the model. The segmentation results for both conventional and deep-learning methods were compared quantitatively with the gold standards using four accuracy metrics: the Dice similarity coefficient DSC Jaccard similarity coefficient JSC mean surface distance MSD and Hausdorff surface distance HSD. The mean and standard deviation values of those metrics for the HRCT images were 98.84\u2009\u20090.55% 97.79\u2009\u20091.07% 0.27\u2009\u20090.18\xa0mm and 25.47\u2009\u200913.63\xa0mm respectively. Our deep-learning method showed significantly better segmentation performance p\u2009<\u20090.001 and its segmentation accuracies for volumetric CT were similar to those for HRCT. We have developed an accurate and robust U-Net-based DILD lung segmentation method that can be used for patients scanned with different clinical protocols including HRCT and volumetric CT.
