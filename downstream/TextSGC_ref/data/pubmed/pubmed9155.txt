Handwritten digits recognition is a challenging problem in recent years. Although many deep learning-based classification algorithms are studied for handwritten digits recognition the recognition accuracy and running time still need to be further improved. In this paper an adaptive deep Q-learning strategy is proposed to improve accuracy and shorten running time for handwritten digit recognition. The adaptive deep Q-learning strategy combines the feature-extracting capability of deep learning and the decision-making of reinforcement learning to form an adaptive Q-learning deep belief network Q-ADBN. First Q-ADBN extracts the features of original images using an adaptive deep auto-encoder ADAE and the extracted features are considered as the current states of Q-learning algorithm. Second Q-ADBN receives Q-function reward signal during recognition of the current states and the final handwritten digits recognition is implemented by maximizing the Q-function using Q-learning algorithm. Finally experimental results from the well-known MNIST dataset show that the proposed Q-ADBN has a superiority to other similar methods in terms of accuracy and running time.
