Arthroscopy is one of the cornerstone skills learned during orthopaedic residency training. Previous studies have attempted to identify characteristics of arthroscopy naive individuals leading to superior initial arthroscopic performance with conflicting findings. Furthermore other virtual reality simulator studies consisting of beginner trainees have noted that certain individuals fail to progress at the rate of their peers despite rigorous training. Therefore the purpose of this study was to 1 identify trainee characteristics that may have an impact on initial arthroscopy skill and performance and 2 identify trainee characteristics affecting their ability to improve through training on an arthroscopy simulator. Factors Impacting Initial Arthroscopy Performance and Skill Progression in Novice Trainees.
