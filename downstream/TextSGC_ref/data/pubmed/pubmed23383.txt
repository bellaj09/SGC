Although traditional forms of therapy for anxiety-related disorders eg cognitive behavioral therapy CBT have been effective there have been long-standing issues with these therapies that largely center around the costs and risks associated with the components comprising the therapeutic process. To treat certain types of specific phobias sessions may need to be held in public therefore risking patient confidentiality and the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances eg weather and bystander behavior or additional expenses such as travel to reach a destination. To address these issues past studies have implemented virtual reality VR technologies for virtual reality exposure therapy VRET to provide an immersive interactive experience that can be conducted privately and inexpensively. The versatility of VR allows various environments and scenarios to be generated while giving therapists control over variables that would otherwise be impossible in a natural setting. Although the outcomes from these studies have been generally positive despite the limitations of legacy VR systems it is necessary to review these studies to identify how modern VR systems can and should improve to treat disorders in which anxiety is a key symptom including specific phobias posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder and paranoid ideations.
