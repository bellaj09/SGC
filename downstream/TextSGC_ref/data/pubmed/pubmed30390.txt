"Recent research has linked bodily self-consciousness to the processing and integration of multisensory bodily signals in temporoparietal premotor posterior parietal and extrastriate cortices. Studies in which subjects receive ambiguous multisensory information about the location and appearance of their own body have shown that these brain areas reflect the conscious experience of identifying with the body self-identification also known as body-ownership the experience of where I am in space self-location and the experience of the position from where I perceive the world first-person perspective. Along with phenomena of altered states of self-consciousness in neurological patients and electrophysiological data from non-human primates these findings may form the basis for a neurobiological model of bodily self-consciousness."
