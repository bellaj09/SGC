The heart continuously and cyclically communicates with the brain. Beyond homeostatic regulation and sensing recent neuroscience research has started to shed light on brain-heart interactions in diverse cognitive and emotional processes. In particular neural responses to heartbeats as measured with the so-called heartbeat-evoked potential have been shown to be useful for investigating cortical activity processing cardiac signals. In this review we first overview and discuss the basic properties of the HEP such as underlying physiological pathways brain regions and neural mechanisms. We then provide a systematic review of the mental processes associated with cortical HEP activations notably heartbeat perception emotional feelings perceptual awareness and self-consciousness in healthy subjects and clinical populations. Finally we discuss methodological issues regarding the experimental design and data analysis for separating genuine HEP components from physiological artifacts e.g. cardiac field artifact pulse artifact or other neural activities that are not specifically associated with the heartbeat. Findings from this review suggest that when intrinsic limitations e.g. artifacts are carefully controlled the HEP could provide a reliable neural measure for investigating brain-viscera interactions in diverse mental processes.
