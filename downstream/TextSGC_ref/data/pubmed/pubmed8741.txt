"Rheumatologists use classification criteria to separate patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases IRD. They change over time and the concepts of the diseases also change. The paradigm is currently moving as the goal of classification in the future will be more to select which patients may be relevant for a specific treatment rather than to describe their characteristics. Therefore the challenge will be to reclassify multifactorial diseases on the basis of their biological mechanisms rather than their clinical phenotype. Currently various projects are trying to reclassify diseases using bioinformatics approaches and in the near future the use of advanced machine learning algorithms with large omics datasets could lead to new classification models not only based on a clinical phenotype but also on complex biological profile and common sensitivity to targeted treatment. These models would highlight common biological pathways between patients classified in the same cluster and provide a deep understanding of the mechanisms involved in the patients clinical phenotype. Such approaches would ultimately lead to classification models that rely more on biological causes than on symptoms. This overview on current classification of subgroups of IRD summarises the classification criteria that we use routinely and how we will classify IRD in the future using bioinformatics and artificial intelligence techniques." New criteria and new methodological tools for devising criteria sets of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
