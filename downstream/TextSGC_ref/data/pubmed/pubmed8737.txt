Sparsely sampled computed tomography CT has been attracting attention as a technique that can reduce the high radiation dose of conventional CT. In general iterative reconstruction techniques have been applied to sparsely sampled CT to realize high quality images. These methodologies require high computing power due to the modeling of the system and the trajectory of radiation rays. Therefore the purpose of this study was to obtain high quality three-dimensional 3D reconstructed images with deep learning under sparse sampling conditions. High quality imaging from sparsely sampled computed tomography data with deep learning and wavelet transform in various domains.
