Deep brain stimulation DBS of the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular CM-Pf region is the most common target to treat refractory Tourette syndrome TS but the improvement among the patients is quite variable. This study describes the outcomes of stimulation in TS patients and attempts to determine whether the volume of tissue activated VTA inside the thalamus or the structural connectivity between the area stimulated and different regions of the brain is associated with tic improvement. Exploring the clinical outcomes after deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome.
