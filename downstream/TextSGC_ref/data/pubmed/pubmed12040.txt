This paper develops a deep learning framework for the design of on-off keying OOK based binary signaling transceiver in dimmable visible light communication VLC systems. The dimming support for the OOK optical signal is achieved by adjusting the number of ones in a binary codeword which boils down to a combinatorial design problem for the codebook of a constant weight code CWC over signal-dependent noise channels. To tackle this challenge we employ an autoencoder AE approach to learn a neural network of the encoder-decoder pair that reconstructs the output identical to an input. In addition optical channel layers and binarization techniques are introduced to reflect the physical and discrete nature of the OOK-based VLC systems. The VLC transceiver is designed and optimized via the end-to-end training procedure for the AE. Numerical results verify that the proposed transceiver performs better than baseline CWC schemes.
