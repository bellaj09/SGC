In this study the effects of a form of cooperative group instruction Student Teams Achievement Divisions on student motivation and achievement in a high school geometry class were examined. Eighty students were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving traditional instruction or one of two treatment groups receiving cooperative learning instruction. Geometry achievement was assessed using scores from the IOWA Test of Basic Skills and teacher-made exams. An 83-item questionnaire was used as a pretest posttest and post-posttest assessment of efficacy intrinsic valuing goal orientation and cognitive processing. Students in the cooperative treatment groups exhibited significantly greater gains than the control group in geometry achievement efficacy intrinsic valuing of geometry learning goal orientation and reported uses of deep processing strategies. The implications for cooperative group structures and motivation theory are discussed. The Effects of Cooperative Learning on Student Achievement and Motivation in a High School Geometry Class
