One major assumption used in most existing hashing approaches is that the domain of interest i.e. the target domain could provide sufficient training data either labeled or unlabeled. However this assumption may be violated in practice. To address this so-called data sparsity issue in hashing a new framework termed transfer hashing with privileged information THPI is proposed which marriages hashing and transfer learning TL. To show the efficacy of THPI we propose three variants of the well-known iterative quantization ITQ as a showcase. The proposed methods ITQ+ LapITQ+ and deep transfer hashing DTH solve the aforementioned data sparsity issue from different aspects. Specifically ITQ+ is a shallow model which makes ITQ achieve hashing in a TL manner. ITQ+ learns a new slack function from the source domain to approximate the quantization error on the target domain given by ITQ. To further improve the performance of ITQ+ LapITQ+ is proposed by embedding the geometric relationship of the source domain into the target domain. Moreover DTH is proposed to show the generality of our framework by utilizing the powerful representative capacity of deep learning. To the best of our knowledge this could be one of the first DTH works. Extensive experiments on several popular data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our shallow and DTH approaches comparing with several state-of-the-art hashing approaches.
