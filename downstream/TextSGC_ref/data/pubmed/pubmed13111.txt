Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing AS in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states motivated two streams of research experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models also known as splicing codes which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date these models have utilized only expression data. In this work we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. Integrative deep models for alternative splicing.
