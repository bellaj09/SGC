Virtual endoscopy is the computerized creation of images depicting the inside of patient anatomy reconstructed in a virtual reality environment. It permits interactive noninvasive 3-dimensional visual inspection of anatomical cavities or vessels. This can aid in diagnostics potentially replacing an actual endoscopic procedure and help in the preparation of a surgical intervention by bridging the gap between plain 2-dimensional radiologic images and the 3-dimensional depiction of anatomy during actual endoscopy. If not only the endoscopic vision but also endoscopic handling including realistic haptic feedback is simulated virtual endoscopy can be an effective training tool for novice surgeons. In neurosurgery the main fields of the application of virtual endoscopy are third ventriculostomy endonasal surgery and the evaluation of pathologies in cerebral blood vessels. Progress in this very active field of research is achieved through cooperation between the technical and the medical communities. While the technology advances and new methods for modeling reconstruction and simulation are being developed clinicians evaluate existing simulators steer the development of new ones and explore new fields of application. This review introduces some of the most interesting virtual reality systems for endoscopic neurosurgery developed in recent years and presents clinical studies conducted either on areas of application or specific systems. In addition benefits and limitations of single products and simulated neuroendoscopy in general are pointed out. Virtual endoscopy in neurosurgery:  a review.
