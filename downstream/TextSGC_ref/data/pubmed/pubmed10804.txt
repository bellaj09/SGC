Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is often considered to be a reliable biomarker of diagnosis and screening of various diseases including cardiovascular diseases diabetic and ophthalmologic diseases. Recently deep learning DL algorithms have demonstrated high performance in segmenting retinal images that may enable fast and lifesaving diagnoses. To our knowledge there is no systematic review of the current work in this research area. Therefore we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of the DL algorithms in retinal vessel segmentation.
