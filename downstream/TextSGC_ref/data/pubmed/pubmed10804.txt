Antenna selection in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output MIMO systems has attracted increasing attention due to the challenge of keeping a balance between communication performance and computational complexity. Recently deep learning based methods have achieved promising performance in many application fields. This paper proposed a deep learning DL based antenna selection technique. First we generated the label of training antenna systems by maximizing the channel capacity. Then we adopted the deep convolutional neural network CNN on the channel matrices to explicitly exploit the massive latent cues of attenuation coefficients. Finally we used the adopted CNN to assign the class label and then select the optimal antenna subset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art baselines for data-driven based antenna selection.
