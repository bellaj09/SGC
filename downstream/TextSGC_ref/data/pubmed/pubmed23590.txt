We have been developing the Hyper Hospital a network based VR mediated medical care system. The Hyper Hospital is composed of two seamlessly integrated environments that is the virtual and the real worlds. Of them its virtual environment expands the conventional medical care system using the virtual reality technology as a principal human interface and a collaboration tool in the present study an attempt to extend the Hyper Hospital system to various modalities of communication network is reported. A satellite communication based multi-media network using Internet protocols with the WWW interface is used. Data transmission rate and other performances were measured under various conditions and the satellite network was shown to be suitable to the Hyper Hospital network.
