We develop a machine learning tool useful for predicting the instantaneous dynamical state of sub-monomer features within long linear polymer chains as well as extracting the dominant macromolecular motions associated with sub-monomer behaviors of interest. We employ the tool to better understand and predict sub-monomer A2 domain unfolding dynamics occurring amidst the dominant large-scale macromolecular motions of the biopolymer von Willebrand Factor vWF immersed in flow. Results of coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics MD simulations of non-grafted vWF multimers subject to a shearing flow were used as input variables to a Random Forest Algorithm RFA. Twenty unique features characterizing macromolecular conformation information of vWF multimers were used for training the RFA. The corresponding responses classify instantaneous A2 domain state as either folded or unfolded and were directly taken from coarse-grained MD simulations. Three separate RFAs were trained using feature/response data of varying resolution which provided deep insights into the highly correlated macromolecular dynamics occurring in concert with A2 domain unfolding events. The algorithm is used to analyze results of simulation but has been developed for use with experimental data as well.
