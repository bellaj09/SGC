Arthroscopic surgery is a steadily expanding component of orthopaedic practice that changes continuously as new techniques and indications develop. The many arthroscopy training activities offered to residents include fellowships practice on cadaver specimens and simulators and teaching in the operating room. Current practices for arthroscopy training of orthopaedic residents in France have not yet been evaluated. The objectives of this study were to describe current arthroscopy training practices and to assess the perceptions and expectations of residents and junior physicians in France in order to contribute to the development of a new training strategy for residents.
