In spike sorting systems front-end electronics is a crucial pre-processing step that not only has a direct impact on detection and sorting accuracy but also on power and silicon area. In this work a behavioural front-end model is proposed to assess the impact of the design parameters including signal-to-noise ratio filter type/order bandwidth converter resolution/rate on subsequent spike processing. Initial validation of the model is provided by applying a test stimulus to a hardware platform and comparing the measured circuit response to the expected from the behavioural model. Our model is then used to demonstrate the effect of the Analogue Front-End AFE on subsequent spike processing by testing established spike detection and sorting methods on a selection of systems reported in the literature. It is revealed that although these designs have a wide variation in design parameters and thus also circuit complexity the ultimate impact on spike processing performance is relatively low 10-15%. This can be used to inform the design of future systems to have an efficient AFE whilst also maintaining good processing performance. An analogue front-end model for developing neural spike sorting systems.
