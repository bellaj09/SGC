Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy pCLE is a recent imaging modality that allows performing in vivo optical biopsies. The design of pCLE hardware and its reliance on an optical fibre bundle fundamentally limits the image quality with a few tens of thousands fibres each acting as the equivalent of a single-pixel detector assembled into a single fibre bundle. Video registration techniques can be used to estimate high-resolution HR images by exploiting the temporal information contained in a sequence of low-resolution LR images. However the alignment of LR frames required for the fusion is computationally demanding and prone to artefacts.
