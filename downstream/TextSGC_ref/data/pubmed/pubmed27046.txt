"The bases for understanding the neuronal mechanisms that underlie the control of reach-to-grasp movements among nonhuman primates particularly macaques has been widely studied. However only a few kinematic descriptions of their prehensile actions are available. A thorough understanding of macaques prehensile movements is manifestly critical in light of their role in biomedical research as valuable models for studying neuromotor disorders and brain mechanisms as well as for developing brain-machine interfaces to facilitate arm control. This article aims to review the current state of knowledge on the kinematics of grasping movements that macaques perform in naturalistic seminaturalistic and laboratory settings to answer the following questions: Are kinematic signatures affected by the context within which the movement is performed? In what ways are kinematics of humans and macaques prehensile actions similar/dissimilar? Our analysis reflects the challenges involved in making comparisons across settings and species due to the heterogeneous picture in terms of the number of subjects stimuli conditions and hands used. The kinematics of free-ranging macaques are characterized by distinctive features that are exhibited neither by macaques in laboratory setting nor by human subjects. The temporal incidence of key kinematic landmarks diverges significantly between species indicating disparities in the overall organization of movement. Given such complexities we attempt a synthesis of the extant body of evidence intending to generate some significant implications for directions that future research might take to recognize the remaining gaps and pursue the insights and resolutions to generate an interpretation of movement kinematics that accounts for all settings and subjects."
