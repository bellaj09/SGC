Unlike Papanicolaou tests there are no commercially available computer-assisted automated screening systems for urine specimens. Despite The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology there still is poor interobserver agreement with urine cytology and many cases in which a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. In the current study the authors have reported on the development of an image algorithm that applies computational methods to digitized liquid-based urine cytology slides. Performance of an artificial intelligence algorithm for reporting urine cytopathology.
