"Digital slides obtained from whole slide imaging WSI platforms are typically viewed in two dimensions using desktop personal computer monitors or more recently on mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any studies viewing digital pathology slides in a virtual reality VR environment. VR technology enables users to be artificially immersed in and interact with a computer-simulated world. Oculus Rift is among the worlds first consumer-targeted VR headsets intended primarily for enhanced gaming. Our aim was to explore the use of the Oculus Rift for examining digital pathology slides in a VR environment."
