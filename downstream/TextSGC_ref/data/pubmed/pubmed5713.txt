For decades task functional magnetic resonance imaging has been a powerful noninvasive tool to explore the organizational architecture of human brain function. Researchers have developed a variety of brain network analysis methods for task fMRI data including the general linear model independent component analysis and sparse representation methods. However these shallow models are limited in faithful reconstruction and modeling of the hierarchical and temporal structures of brain networks as demonstrated in more and more studies. Recently recurrent neural networks RNNs exhibit great ability of modeling hierarchical and temporal dependence features in the machine learning field which might be suitable for task fMRI data modeling. To explore such possible advantages of RNNs for task fMRI data we propose a novel framework of a deep recurrent neural network DRNN to model the functional brain networks from task fMRI data. Experimental results on the motor task fMRI data of Human Connectome Project 900 subjects release demonstrated that the proposed DRNN can not only faithfully reconstruct functional brain networks but also identify more meaningful brain networks with multiple time scales which are overlooked by traditional shallow models. In general this work provides an effective and powerful approach to identifying functional brain networks at multiple time scales from task fMRI data.
