"This study sought to determine the features of an ideal serve in mens professional tennis. A total of 25680 first serves executed by 151 male tennis players during Australian Open competition were classified as either aces or returned into play. Spatiotemporal impact location speed projection angles landing location and relative player locations and contextual score features of each serve were extracted from Hawk-Eye data and used to construct a classification tree model with decision rules that predicted serve outcome. k-means clustering was applied to the landing locations to quantify optimal landing locations for aces. The classification tree revealed that 1 serve directionality relative to the returner; 2 the balls landing proximity to the nearest service box line and 3 serve speed classified aces with an accuracy of 87.02%. Hitting aces appeared more contingent on accuracy than speed with serves directed >5.88 from the returner and landing <15.27\xa0cm from a service box line most indicative of an ace. k-means clustering revealed four distinct locations 0.73\xa0m wide\xa0\xa02.35\xa0m deep in the corners of the service box that corresponded to aces. These landing locations provide empirically derived target locations for players to adhere to during practice and competition."
