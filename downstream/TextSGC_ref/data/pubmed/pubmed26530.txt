"A brain-computer interface is an alternative for communication between people and computers through the acquisition and analysis of brain signals. Research related to this field has focused on serving people with different types of motor visual or auditory disabilities. On the other hand affective computing studies and extracts information about the emotional state of a person in certain situations an important aspect for the interaction between people and the computer. In particular this manuscript considers people with visual disabilities and their need for personalized systems that prioritize their disability and the degree that affects them. In this article a review of the state of the techniques is presented where the importance of the study of the emotions of people with visual disabilities and the possibility of representing those emotions through a brain-computer interface and affective computing are discussed. Finally the authors propose a framework to study and evaluate the possibility of representing and interpreting the emotions of people with visual disabilities for improving their experience with the use of technology and their integration into todays society."
