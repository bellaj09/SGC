Conducting surveys in low- and middle-income countries is often challenging because many areas lack a complete sampling frame have outdated census information or have limited data available for designing and selecting a representative sample. Geosampling is a probability-based gridded population sampling method that addresses some of these issues by using geographic information system GIS tools to create logistically manageable area units for sampling. GIS grid cells are overlaid to partition a country\s existing administrative boundaries into area units that vary in size from 50\xa0m\u2009\u200950\xa0m to 150\xa0m\u2009\u2009150\xa0m. To avoid sending interviewers to unoccupied areas researchers manually classify grid cells as "residential" or "nonresidential" through visual inspection of aerial images. "Nonresidential" units are then excluded from sampling and data collection. This process of manually classifying sampling units has drawbacks since it is labor intensive prone to human error and creates the need for simplifying assumptions during calculation of design-based sampling weights. In this paper we discuss the development of a deep learning classification\xa0model to predict whether aerial images are residential or nonresidential thus reducing manual labor and eliminating the need for simplifying assumptions.
