Fourier ptychographic microscopy allows for the collection of images with a high space-bandwidth product at the cost of temporal resolution. In Fourier ptychographic microscopy the light source of a conventional widefield microscope is replaced with a light-emitting diode LED matrix and multiple images are collected with different LED illumination patterns. From these images a higher-resolution image can be computationally reconstructed without sacrificing field-of-view. We use deep learning to achieve single-shot imaging without sacrificing the space-bandwidth product reducing the acquisition time in Fourier ptychographic microscopy by a factor of 69. In our deep learning approach a training dataset of high-resolution images is used to jointly optimize a single LED illumination pattern with the parameters of a reconstruction algorithm. Our work paves the way for high-throughput imaging in biological studies. Illumination pattern design with deep learning for single-shot Fourier ptychographic microscopy.
