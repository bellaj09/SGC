Mapping the connectome a wiring diagram of the entire brain requires large-scale imaging of numerous single neurons with diverse morphology. It is a formidable challenge to reassemble these neurons into a virtual brain and correlate their structural networks with neuronal activities which are measured in different experiments to analyze the informational flow in the brain. Here we report an in situ brain imaging technique called Fly Head Array Slice Tomography FHAST which permits the reconstruction of structural and functional data to generate an integrative connectome in Drosophila. Using FHAST the head capsules of an array of flies can be opened with a single vibratome sectioning to expose the brains replacing the painstaking and inconsistent brain dissection process. FHAST can reveal in situ brain neuroanatomy with minimal distortion to neuronal morphology and maintain intact neuronal connections to peripheral sensory organs. Most importantly it enables the automated 3D imaging of 100 intact fly brains in each experiment. The established head model with in situ brain neuroanatomy allows functional data to be accurately registered and associated with 3D images of single neurons. These integrative data can then be shared searched visualized and analyzed for understanding how brain-wide activities in different neurons within the same circuit function together to control complex behaviors.
