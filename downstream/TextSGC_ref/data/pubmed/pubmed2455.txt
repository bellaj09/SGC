China announced an outbreak of new coronavirus in the city of Wuhan on December 31 2019; lash to now the virus transmission has become pandemic worldwide. Severe cases from Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan were confirmed pneumonia with a novel coronavirus. 2019-nCoV. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of genome selection and packaging is critical for developing antiviral strategies. Thus we defined the correlation in ten SARS-CoV2 sequences from different countries to analyze the genomic patterns of disease origin and evolution aiming for development new control pandemic processes. Genomic Analysis and Comparative Multiple Sequence of SARS-CoV2.
