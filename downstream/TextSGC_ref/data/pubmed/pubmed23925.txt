The Technology Team at the Ruth Lilly Medical Library Indiana University IU first started exploring virtual reality VR in 2016. In 2017 we began offering weekly sessions dubbed VRidays "VR Fridays" to give students an opportunity to experience the technology. We also purchased a portable VR setup that allowed us to demonstrate VR at our regional campuses. Creating a new "reality" for medical education: the Nexus Reality Lab for virtual reality.
