To investigate the topological properties of the functional connectivity and their relationships with cognition impairment in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment SVCI patients resting-state fMRI and graph theory approaches were employed in 23 SVCI patients and 20 healthy controls. Functional connectivity between 90 brain regions was estimated using bivariate correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. Moreover all of them were subjected to a battery of cognitive assessment and the correlations between graph metrics and cognitive performance were further analyzed. Our results are as follows: functional brain networks of both SVCI patients and controls showed small-world attributes over a range of thresholds0.15sparsity0.40. However global topological organization of the functional brain networks in SVCI was significantly disrupted as indicated by reduced global and local efficiency clustering coefficients and increased characteristic path lengths relative to normal subjects. The decreased activity areas in SVCI predominantly targeted in the frontal-temporal lobes while subcortical regions showed increased topological properties which are suspected to compensate for the inefficiency of the functional network. We also demonstrated that altered brain network properties in SVCI are closely correlated with general cognitive and praxis dysfunction. The disruption of whole-brain topological organization of the functional connectome provides insight into the functional changes in the human brain in SVCI.
