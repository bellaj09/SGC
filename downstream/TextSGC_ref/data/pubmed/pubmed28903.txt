"Recent advances in the brain-computer interfaces BCIs have demonstrated the inference of movement related activity using non-invasive EEG. However most of the sensorspace approaches that study sensorimotor rhythms using EEG do not reveal the underlying neurophysiological phenomenon while executing or imagining the movement with finer control. Therefore there is a need to examine feature extraction techniques in the cortical source space which can provide more information about the task compared to sensor-space. In this study we extend the traditional sensor-space feature extraction method Common Spatial Pattern CSP to the source space using various regularization approaches. We use Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate wMNE as a source localization technique. We show that for a multi-direction hand movement classification problem the source space features can result in an increase of over 10% accuracy compared to sensor space features. Fishers Linear Discriminant FLD classifier with the One-versus-rest approach is used for the classification." Multi-direction hand movement classification using EEG-based source space analysis.
