There is little empirical support in the nursing education literature related to the process of learning. This quasi-experimental study examined the effect of a metacognitive intervention concept mapping on approach to learning and self-regulation of learning in a sample of baccalaureate nursing students. Significant group differences were found in the concept mapping group with an increase in deep approach to learning and adaptive control belief mean scores at the end of the semester. Students in the control group experienced a decrease in the deep approach to learning mean score and an increase in the surface approach to learning mean score at the end of the semester. Therefore students who used concept mapping demonstrated an increase in deep approach to learning and the self-regulation of that learning compared with students who did not use concept mapping. The results of this study provide empirical support for the use of concept mapping as a metacognitive intervention.
