"To perform accurate hepatectomy without injury it is necessary to understand the anatomical relationship among the branches of Glissons sheath hepatic veins and tumor. In Japan three-dimensional 3D preoperative simulation for liver surgery is becoming increasingly common and liver 3D modeling and 3D hepatectomy simulation by 3D analysis software for liver surgery have been covered by universal healthcare insurance since 2012. Herein we review the history of virtual hepatectomy using computer-assisted surgery CAS and our research to date and we discuss the future prospects of CAS. We have used the SYNAPSE VINCENT medical imaging system Fujifilm Medical Tokyo Japan for 3D visualization and virtual resection of the liver since 2010. We developed a novel fusion imaging technique combining 3D computed tomography CT with magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The fusion image enables us to easily visualize anatomic relationships among the hepatic arteries portal veins bile duct and tumor in the hepatic hilum. In 2013 we developed an original software called Liversim which enables real-time deformation of the liver using physical simulation and a randomized control trial has recently been conducted to evaluate the use of Liversim and SYNAPSE VINCENT for preoperative simulation and planning. Furthermore we developed a novel hollow 3D-printed liver model whose surface is covered with frames. This model is useful for safe liver resection has better visibility and the production cost is reduced to one-third of a previous model. Preoperative simulation and navigation with CAS in liver resection are expected to help planning and conducting a surgery and surgical education. Thus a novel CAS system will contribute to not only the performance of reliable hepatectomy but also to surgical education."
