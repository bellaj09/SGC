Emotional or non-emotional image stimulus is recently applied to event-related potential ERP based brain computer interfaces BCI. Though the classification performance is over 80% in a single trial a discrimination between those ERPs has not been considered. In this research we tried to clarify the discriminability of four-class ERP-based BCI target data elicited by desk seal spider images and letter intensifications. A conventional self organizing map SOM and newly proposed discriminant space SOM ds-SOM were applied then the discriminabilites were visualized. We also classify all pairs of those ERPs by stepwise linear discriminant analysis SWLDA and verify the visualization of discriminabilities. As a result the ds-SOM showed understandable visualization of the data with a shorter computational time than the traditional SOM. We also confirmed the clear boundary between the letter cluster and the other clusters. The result was coherent with the classification performances by SWLDA. The method might be helpful not only for developing a new BCI paradigm but also for the big data analysis. Multi-class ERP-based BCI data analysis using a discriminant space self-organizing map.
