The present study evaluated the efficacy of adding a virtual reality VR component to the treatment of compulsive hoarding CH following inference-based therapy IBT. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control condition. Seven participants received the experimental and seven received the control condition. Five sessions of 1\u2009h were administered weekly. A significant difference indicated that the level of clutter in the bedroom tended to diminish more in the experimental group as compared to the control group F224\u2009=\u20092.28 p\u2009=\u20090.10. In addition the results demonstrated that both groups were immersed and present in the environment. The results on posttreatment measures of CH Saving Inventory revised Saving Cognition Inventory and Clutter Image Rating scale demonstrate the efficacy of IBT in terms of symptom reduction. Overall these results suggest that the creation of a virtual environment may be effective in the treatment of CH by helping the compulsive hoarders take action over their clutter.
