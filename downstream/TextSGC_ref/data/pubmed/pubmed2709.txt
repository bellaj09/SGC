Nearly 5500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 had been conducted on March 31 2020 across the Indian Council of Medical Research ICMR-approved public and private laboratories in India. Given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR-based testing capacity over the next few months. The objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up COVID-19 testing in India in the public sector. Strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for COVID-19 in India.
