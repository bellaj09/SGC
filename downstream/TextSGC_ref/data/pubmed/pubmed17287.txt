"Identifying individuals intent through the emotional valence conveyed by their facial expression influences our capacity to approach-avoid these individuals during social interactions. Here we explore if and how the emotional valence of others facial expressiveness modulates peripersonal-action and interpersonal-social spaces. Through Immersive Virtual Reality participants determined reachability-distance for peripersonal space and comfort-distance for interpersonal space from male/female virtual confederates exhibiting happy angry and neutral facial expressions while being approached by passive-approach or walking toward active-approach them. Results showed an increase of distance when seeing angry rather than happy confederates in both approach conditions of comfort-distance. The effect also appeared in reachability-distance but only in the passive-approach. Anger prompts avoidant behaviors and thus an expansion of distance particularly with a potential violation of near body space by an intruder. Overall the findings suggest that peripersonal-action space in comparison with interpersonal-social space is similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of stimuli. We propose that this similarity could reflect a common adaptive mechanism shared by these spaces presumably at different degrees for ensuring self-protection functions."
