Image blur kernel estimation is critical to blind image deblurring. Most existing approaches exploit handcrafted blur features that are optimized for a certain uniform blur across the image which is unrealistic in a real blind deconvolution setting where the blur type is often unknown. To deal with this issue we aim at identifying the blur type for each input image patch and then estimating the kernel parameter in this paper. A learning-based method using a pre-trained deep neural network DNN and a general regression neural network GRNN is proposed to first classify the blur type and then estimate its parameters taking advantages of both the classification ability of DNN and the regression ability of GRNN. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that pre-trained DNN and GRNN have been applied to the problem of blur analysis. First our method identifies the blur type from a mixed input of image patches corrupted by various blurs with different parameters. To this aim a supervised DNN is trained to project the input samples into a discriminative feature space in which the blur type can be easily classified. Then for each blur type the proposed GRNN estimates the blur parameters with very high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in several tasks with better or competitive results compared with the state of the art on two standard image data sets i.e. the Berkeley segmentation data set and the Pascal VOC 2007 data set. In addition blur region segmentation and deblurring on a number of real photographs show that our method outperforms the previous techniques even for non-uniformly blurred images.
