The use of psycho-dynamic psychotherapy integrating virtual reality VR dealt with in this study on the treatment of erection dysfunctions and premature ejaculation started several years ago after having seen the scarce results we obtained using exclusively a psycho-dynamic approach accompanied by pre-recorded sound and music. Considering the particular way that full-immersion VR involves the subject who experiences it we hypothesized that better results could be obtained during therapy for these sexual disorders and in particular regarding the nature of erection dysfunction commonly referred to as impotence "a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity an adequate erection." The plan for therapy consisted of 12 hour-long sessions over a 25-week period and the methods involved the use of a VR helmet joystick and miniature television screens that projected specially-designed CD-ROM programs on psychological development. A VR based therapy for the treatment of impotence and premature ejaculation.
