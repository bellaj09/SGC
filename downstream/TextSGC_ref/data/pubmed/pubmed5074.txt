"Neuronal circuit mapping using electron microscopy demands laborious proofreading or reconciliation of multiple independent reconstructions. Here we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of Drosophila sensorimotor larva and visual adult systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small microtubule-free twigs which branch off a single microtubule-containing backbone. Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96% of errors. However the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity."
