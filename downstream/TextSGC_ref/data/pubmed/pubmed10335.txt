"We report a database consisting of the putative minima and 3.2  106 local minima lying within 5 kcal/mol from the putative minima for water clusters of sizes n = 3-25 using an improved version of the Monte Carlo temperature basin paving MCTBP global optimization procedure in conjunction with the ab initio based flexible polarizable Thole-Type Model TTM2.1-F version 2.1 interaction potential for water. Several of the low-lying structures as well as low-lying penta-coordinated water networks obtained with the TTM2.1-F potential were further refined at the Mller-Plesset second order perturbation MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. In total we have identified 3 138 303 networks corresponding to local minima of the clusters n = 3-25 whose Cartesian coordinates and relative energies can be obtained from the webpage https://sites.uw.edu/wdbase/. Networks containing penta-coordinated water molecules start to appear at n = 11 and quite surprisingly are energetically close within 1-3 kcal/mol to the putative minima a fact that has been confirmed from the MP2 calculations. This large database of water cluster minima spanning quite dissimilar hydrogen bonding networks is expected to influence the development and assessment of the accuracy of interaction potentials for water as well as lower scaling electronic structure methods such as different density functionals. Furthermore it can also be used in conjunction with data science approaches including but not limited to neural networks and machine and deep learning to understand the properties of water natures most important substance."
