Self-interacting proteins SIPs whose more than two identities can interact with each other play significant roles in the understanding of cellular process and cell functions. Although a number of experimental methods have been designed to detect the SIPs they remain to be extremely time-consuming expensive and challenging even nowadays. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop the computational methods for predicting SIPs. In this study we propose a deep forest based predictor for accurate prediction of SIPs using protein sequence information. More specifically a novel feature representation method which integrate position-specific scoring matrix PSSM with wavelet transform is introduced. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method cross-validation tests are performed on two widely used benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieved high accuracies of 95.43 and 93.65% on human and yeast datasets respectively. The AUC value for evaluating the performance of the proposed method was also reported. The AUC value for yeast and human datasets are 0.9203 and 0.9586 respectively. To further show the advantage of the proposed method it is compared with several existing methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is better than other SIPs prediction methods. This work can offer an effective architecture to biologists in detecting new SIPs.
