Cognitive Radio CR is a promising technology to overcome spectrum scarcity which currently faces lots of unsolved problems. One of the critical challenges for setting up such systems is how to coordinate multiple protocol layers such as routing and spectrum access in a partially observable environment. In this paper a deep reinforcement learning approach is adopted for solving above problem. Firstly for the purpose of compressing huge action space in the cross-layer design problem a novel concept named responsibility rating is introduced to help decide the transmission power of every Secondary User SU. In order to deal with problem of dimension curse while reducing replay memory the Prioritized Memories Deep Q-Network PM-DQN is proposed. Furthermore PM-DQN is applied to solve the joint routing and resource allocation problem in cognitive radio ad hoc network for minimizing the transmission delay and power consumption. Simulation results illustrates that our proposed algorithm can reduce the end-to-end delay packet loss ratio and estimation error while achieving higher energy efficiency compared with traditional algorithm.
