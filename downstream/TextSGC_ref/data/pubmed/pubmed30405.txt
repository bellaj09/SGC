Implantable devices have provided various potential diagnostic options and therapeutic methods in diverse medical fields. A variety of hard-material-based implantable electrodes have been developed. However several limitations for their chronic implantation remain including mechanical mismatches at the interface between the electrode and the soft tissue and biocompatibility. Soft-material-based implantable devices are suitable candidates for complementing the limitations of hard electrodes. Advances in microtechnology and materials science have largely solved many challenges such as optimization of shape minimization of infection enhancement of biocompatibility and integration with components for diverse functions. Significant strides have also been made in mechanical matching of electrodes to soft tissue. In this review we provide an overview of recent advances in soft-material-based implantable electrodes for medical applications categorized according to their implantation site and material composition. We then review specific applications in three categories: neuroprosthetics neural signal recording and neuromodulation. Finally we describe various strategies for the future development and application of implantable soft-material-based devices. Soft implantable microelectrodes for future medicine: prosthetics neural signal recording and neuromodulation.
