We report a new technique for building a wide-angle lightweight thin-form-factor cost-effective easy-to-manufacture near-eye head-mounted display HMD for virtual reality applications. Our approach adopts an aperture mask containing an array of pinholes and a screen as a source of imagery. We demonstrate proof-of-concept HMD prototypes with a binocular field of view FOV of 7045 or total diagonal FOV of 83. This FOV should increase with increasing display panel size. The optical angular resolution supported in our prototype can go down to 1.4-2.1 arcmin by adopting a display with 20-30\xa0m pixel pitch. Slim near-eye display using pinhole aperture arrays.
