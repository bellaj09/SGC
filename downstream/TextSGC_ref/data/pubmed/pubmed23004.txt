By progression of the disease motor neurons degenerate in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS eventually lose nearly all voluntary muscles in the body. They are awake and aware but cannot move or communicate locked-in state. Since the function of the brain is preserved one possible measure to support their communication is to interpret their motor intention by decoding deciphering brain signals and present it with external devices. This technology called "brain-machine interface BMI" is now close to clinical use in Japan and USA.In our system we record electrocorticogram ECoG obtained with subudural electrodes during their motor imagery decode it and determine the movement they intended. So far one patient of ALS with severe paralysis implanted with this electrodes successfully operated the PC communication tool only by thinking. Communication with ALS patients: neurosurgical approach.
