"Recently neuroimaging-based Alzheimers disease AD or mild cognitive impairment MCI diagnosis has attracted researchers in the field due to the increasing prevalence of the diseases. Unfortunately the unfavorable high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging\xa0data but a limited small number of samples available makes it challenging to build a robust computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning techniques have been considered as a useful tool in this respect and among various methods sparse regression has shown its validity in the literature. However to our best knowledge the existing sparse regression methods mostly try to select features based on the optimal regression coefficients in one step. We argue that since the training feature vectors are composed of both informative and uninformative or less informative features the resulting optimal regression coefficients are inevidently affected by the uninformative or less informative features. To this end we first propose a novel deep architecture to recursively discard uninformative features by performing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchical fashion. We further hypothesize that the optimal regression coefficients reflect the relative importance of features in representing the target response variables. In this regard we use the optimal regression coefficients learned in one hierarchy as feature weighting factors in the following hierarchy and formulate a weighted sparse multi-task learning method. Lastly we also take into account the distributional characteristics of samples per class and use clustering-induced subclass label vectors as target response values in our sparse regression model. In our experiments on the ADNI cohort we performed both binary and multi-class classification tasks in AD/MCI diagnosis and showed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods."
