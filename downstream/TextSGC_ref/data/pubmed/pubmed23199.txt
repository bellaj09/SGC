"Advances in virtual and augmented reality AR are having an impact on the medical field in areas such as surgical simulation. Improvements to surgical simulation will provide students and residents with additional training and evaluation methods. This is particularly important for procedures such as the endoscopic third ventriculostomy ETV which residents perform regularly. Simulators such as NeuroTouch have been designed to aid in training associated with this procedure. The authors have designed an affordable and easily accessible ETV simulator and compare it with the existing NeuroTouch for its usability and training effectiveness. This simulator was developed using Unity Vuforia and the leap motion LM for an AR environment. The participants 16 novices and two expert neurosurgeons were asked to complete 40 targeting tasks. Participants used the NeuroTouch tool or a virtual hand controlled by the LM to select the position and orientation for these tasks. The length of time to complete each task was recorded and the trajectory log files were used to calculate performance. The resulting data from the novices and experts speed and accuracy are compared and they discuss the objective performance of training in terms of the speed and accuracy of targeting accuracy for each system."
