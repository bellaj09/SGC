The field of pediatric neurorehabilitation has rapidly evolved with the introduction of technological advancements over recent years. Rehabilitation robotics and computer-assisted systems can complement conventional physiotherapeutics or occupational therapies. These systems appear promising especially in children where exciting and challenging virtual reality scenarios could increase motivation to train intensely in a playful therapeutic environment. Despite promising experience and a large acceptance by the patients and parents so far only a few therapy systems have been evaluated in children and well-designed randomized controlled studies in this field are still lacking. This narrative review aims to provide an overview about the to-date robot-assisted and computer-based therapies and the current level of evidence and to share the authors experience about the clinical implication of these new technologies available for children with cerebral palsy. Robot-assisted and computer-enhanced therapies for children with cerebral palsy: current state and clinical implementation.
