In this study the virtual reality VR proprioception rehabilitation system was developed for stroke patients to use proprioception feedback in upper limb rehabilitation by blocking visual feedback. To evaluate its therapeutic effect 10 stroke patients onset>3 month trained proprioception feedback rehabilitation for one week and visual feedback rehabilitation for another week in random order. Proprioception functions were checked before a week after and at the end of training. The results show the click count error distance and total error distance among proprioception evaluation factors were significantly reduced after proprioception feedback training compared to visual feedback training respectively p=0.005 p=0.001 and p=0.007. In addition subjects were significantly improved in conventional behavioral tests after training. In conclusion we showed the effectiveness and possible use of the VR to recover the proprioception of stroke patients. Development of virtual reality proprioceptive rehabilitation system for stroke patients.
