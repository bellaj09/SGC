Understanding the mechanisms and structural mappings between molecules and pathway classes are critical for design of reaction predictors for synthesizing new molecules. This article studies the problem of prediction of classes of metabolic pathways series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell in which a given biochemical compound participates. We apply a hybrid machine learning approach consisting of graph convolutional networks used to extract molecular shape features as input to a random forest classifier. In contrast to previously applied machine learning methods for this problem our framework automatically extracts relevant shape features directly from input SMILES representations which are atom-bond specifications of chemical structures composing the molecules. A deep learning architecture for metabolic pathway prediction.
