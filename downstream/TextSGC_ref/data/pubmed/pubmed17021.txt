Research from multiple areas in neuroscience suggests a link between self-locomotion and memory. In two free recall experiments with adults we looked for a link between a memory and b the coherence of movement and optic flow. In both experiments participants heard lists of words while on a treadmill and wearing a virtual reality VR headset. In the first experiment the VR scene and treadmill were stationary during encoding. During retrieval all participants walked forward but the VR scene was stationary moved forward or moved backwards. In the second experiment during encoding all participants walked forward and viewed a forward-moving VR scene. During retrieval all participants continued to walk forward but the VR scene was stationary forward-moving or backward-moving. In neither experiment was there a significant difference in the amount recalled or output order strategies attributable to differences in movement conditions. Thus any effects of movement on memory are more limited than theories of hippocampal function and theories in cognitive psychology anticipate. Retrieving Against the Flow: Incoherence Between Optic Flow and Movement Direction Has Little Effect on Memory for Order.
