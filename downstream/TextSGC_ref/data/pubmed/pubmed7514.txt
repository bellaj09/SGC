Artur Yakimovich works in the field of computational virology and applies machine learning algorithms to study host-pathogen interactions. In this mSphere of Influence article he reflects on two papers "Holographic Deep Learning for Rapid Optical Screening of Anthrax Spores" by Jo et al. Y. Jo S. Park J. Jung J. Yoon et al. Sci Adv 3:e1700606 2017 https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1700606 and "Bacterial Colony Counting with Convolutional Neural Networks in Digital Microbiology Imaging" by Ferrari and colleagues A. Ferrari S. Lombardi and A. Signoroni Pattern Recognition 61:629-640 2017 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2016.07.016. Here he discusses how these papers made an impact on him by showcasing that artificial intelligence algorithms can be equally applicable to both classical infection biology techniques and cutting-edge label-free imaging of pathogens. mSphere of Influence: the Rise of Artificial Intelligence in Infection Biology.
