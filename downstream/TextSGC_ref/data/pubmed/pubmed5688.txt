"Principles of network topology have been widely studied in the human connectome. Of particular interest is the modularity of the human brain where the connectome is divided into subnetworks from which changes with development aging or disease can be investigated. We present a weighted network measure the Network Dependency Index NDI to identify an individual regions importance to the global functioning of the network. Importantly we utilize NDI to differentiate four subnetworks Tiers in the human connectome following Gaussian mixture model fitting. We analyze the topological aspects of each subnetwork with respect to age and compare it to rich club-based subnetworks rich club feeder and seeder. Our results first demonstrate the efficacy of NDI to identify more consistent central nodes of the connectome across age groups when compared with the rich club framework. Stratifying the connectome by NDI led to consistent subnetworks across the life-span revealing distinct patterns associated with age where for example the key relay nuclei and cortical regions are contained in a subnetwork with highest NDI. The divisions of the human connectome derived from our data-driven NDI framework have the potential to reveal topological alterations described by network measures through the life-span."
