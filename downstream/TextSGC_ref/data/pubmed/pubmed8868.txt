In this commentary we highlight a crucial challenge posed by the proposal of Lake et al. to introduce key elements of human cognition into deep neural networks and future artificial-intelligence systems: the need to design effective sophisticated architectures. We propose that looking at the brain is an important means of facing this great challenge. The architecture challenge: Future artificial-intelligence systems will require sophisticated architectures and knowledge of the brain might guide their construction.
