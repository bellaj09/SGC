Brain-computer interfaces BCIs enable paralyzed patients to communicate; however up to date no creative expression was possible. The current study investigated the accuracy and user-friendliness of P300-Brain Painting a new BCI application developed to paint pictures using brain activity only. Two different versions of the P300-Brain Painting application were tested: A colored matrix tested by a group of ALS-patients n\u2009=\u20093 and healthy participants n\u2009=\u200910 and a black and white matrix tested by healthy participants n\u2009=\u200910. The three ALS-patients achieved high accuracies; two of them reaching above 89% accuracy. In healthy subjects a comparison between the P300-Brain Painting application colored matrix and the P300-Spelling application revealed significantly lower accuracy and P300 amplitudes for the P300-Brain Painting application. This drop in accuracy and P300 amplitudes was not found when comparing the P300-Spelling application to an adapted black and white matrix of the P300-Brain Painting application. By employing a black and white matrix the accuracy of the P300-Brain Painting application was significantly enhanced and reached the accuracy of the P300-Spelling application. ALS-patients greatly enjoyed P300-Brain Painting and were able to use the application with the same accuracy as healthy subjects. P300-Brain Painting enables paralyzed patients to express themselves creatively and to participate in the prolific society through exhibitions.
