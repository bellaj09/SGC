In core computer vision tasks we have witnessed significant advances in object detection localisation and tracking. However there are currently no methods to detect localize and track objects in road environments and taking into account real-time constraints. In this paper our objective is to develop a deep learning multi object detection and tracking technique applied to road smart mobility. Firstly we propose an effective detector-based on YOLOv3 which we adapt to our context. Subsequently to localize successfully the detected objects we put forward an adaptive method aiming to extract 3D information i.e. depth maps. To do so a comparative study is carried out taking into account two approaches: Monodepth2 for monocular vision and MADNEt for stereoscopic vision. These approaches are then evaluated over datasets containing depth information in order to discern the best solution that performs better in real-time conditions. Object tracking is necessary in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. Unlike traditional tracking approaches which require target initialization beforehand our approach consists of using information from object detection and distance estimation to initialize targets and to track them later. Expressly we propose here to improve SORT approach for 3D object tracking. We introduce an extended Kalman filter to better estimate the position of objects. Extensive experiments carried out on KITTI dataset prove that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art approches.
