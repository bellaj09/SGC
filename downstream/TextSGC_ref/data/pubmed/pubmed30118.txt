Motor recovery after stroke is an unsolved challenge despite intensive rehabilitation training programs. Brain stimulation techniques have been explored in addition to traditional rehabilitation training to increase the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex. This modulation of cortical excitability augments the response to afferent input during motor exercises thereby enhancing skilled motor learning by long-term potentiation-like plasticity. Recent approaches examined brain stimulation applied concurrently with voluntary movements to induce more specific use-dependent neural plasticity during motor training for neurorehabilitation. Unfortunately such approaches are not applicable for the many severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function. These patients require novel activity-dependent stimulation paradigms based on intrinsic brain activity. Here we report on such brain state-dependent stimulation BSDS combined with haptic feedback provided by a robotic hand orthosis. Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS of the motor cortex and haptic feedback to the hand were controlled by sensorimotor desynchronization during motor-imagery and applied within a brain-machine interface BMI environment in one healthy subject and one patient with severe hand paresis in the chronic phase after stroke. BSDS significantly increased the excitability of the stimulated motor cortex in both healthy and post-stroke conditions an effect not observed in non-BSDS protocols. This feasibility study suggests that closing the loop between intrinsic brain state cortical stimulation and haptic feedback provides a novel neurorehabilitation strategy for stroke patients lacking residual hand function a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.
