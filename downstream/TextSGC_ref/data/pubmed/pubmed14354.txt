"Buildings in the developing world are inadequately mapped. Lack of such critical geospatial data adds unnecessary challenges to locating and reaching a large segment of the worlds most vulnerable population impeding sustainability goals ranging from disaster relief to poverty reduction. Use of volunteered geographic information VGI has emerged as a widely accepted source to fill such voids. Despite its promise availability of building maps for developing countries significantly lags behind demand. We present a new approach coupling deep convolutional neural networks CNNs with VGI for automating building map generation from high-resolution satellite images for Kano state Nigeria. Specifically we trained a CNN with VGI building outlines of limited quality and quantity and generated building maps for a 50000\u2009km2 area. Resulting maps are in strong agreement with existing settlement maps and require a fraction of the manual input needed for the latter. The VGI-based maps will provide support across multiple facets of socioeconomic development in Kano state and demonstrates potential advancements in current mapping capabilities in resource constrained countries."
