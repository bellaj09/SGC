Palpation is a widely used diagnostic method in medical practice. The sensitivity of palpation is highly dependent upon the skill of clinicians which is often difficult to master. There is a need of simulators in palpation training. This paper summarizes important work and the latest achievements in simulation for palpation training. Three types of simulators; physical models Virtual Reality VR based simulations and hybrid computerized and physical simulators are surveyed. Comparisons among different kinds of simulators are presented. A survey of simulators for palpation training.
