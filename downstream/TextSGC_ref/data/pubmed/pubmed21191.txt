Food cravings FCs are associated with overeating and obesity and are triggered by environmental cues. The study of FCs is challenged by difficulty replicating the natural environment in a laboratory. Virtual reality VR could be used to deliver naturalistic cues in a laboratory. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether food related cues delivered by VR could induce greater FCs than neutral VR cues photographic food cues or real food. Sixty normal weight non-dieting women were recruited; and to prevent a floor effect half were primed with a monotonous diet MD. Experimental procedures involved delivering neutral cues via VR and food related cues via VR photographs and real food in counterbalanced order while measuring subjective self-report and objective salivation FCs. FCs produced by VR were marginally greater than a neutral cue not significantly different from picture cues and significantly less than real food. The modest effects may have been due to quality of the VR system and/or measures of FC i.e. self-report and salivation. FC threshold among non-dieting normal weight women was lowered with the use of a MD condition. Weight loss programs with monotonous diets may inadvertently increase FCs making diet compliance more difficult. Using virtual reality to study food cravings.
