It has been shown that gait parameters vary systematically with the slope of the surface when walking uphill UH or downhill DH Andriacchi et al. 1977; Crowe et al. 1996; Kawamura et al. 1991; Kirtley et al. 1985; McIntosh et al. 2006; Sun et al. 1996. However gait trials performed on inclined surfaces have been subject to certain technical limitations including using fixed speed treadmills TMs or alternatively sampling only a few gait cycles on inclined ramps. Further prior work has not analyzed upper body kinematics. This study aims to investigate effects of slope on gait parameters using a self-paced TM SPTM which facilitates more natural walking including measuring upper body kinematics and gait coordination parameters. Gait of 11 young healthy participants was sampled during walking in steady state speed. Measurements were made at slopes of +10 0 and -10. Force plates and a motion capture system were used to reconstruct twenty spatiotemporal gait parameters. For validation previously described parameters were compared with the literature and novel parameters measuring upper body kinematics and bilateral gait coordination were also analyzed. Results showed that most lower and upper body gait parameters were affected by walking slope angle. Specifically UH walking had a higher impact on gait kinematics than DH walking. However gait coordination parameters were not affected by walking slope suggesting that gait asymmetry left-right coordination and gait variability are robust characteristics of walking. The findings of the study are discussed in reference to a potential combined effect of slope and gait speed. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the relative effects of each of these factors.
