"The purpose of this research was to characterize the use of simulation in initial paramedic education programs in order assist stakeholders efforts to target educational initiatives and resources. This group sought to provide a snapshot of what simulation resources programs have or have access to and how they are used; faculty perceptions about simulation; whether program characteristics resources or faculty training influence simulation use; and if simulation resources are uniform for patients of all ages."
