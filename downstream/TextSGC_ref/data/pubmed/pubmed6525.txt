Today the human brain can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent different regions and links stand for statistical interactions between their activities as recorded by different neuroimaging techniques. Empirical studies have lead to the hypothesis that brain functions rely on the coordination of a scattered mosaic of functionally specialized brain regions modules or sub-networks forming a web-like structure of coordinated assemblies a network of networks. NoN. The study of brain dynamics would therefore benefit from an inspection of how functional sub-networks interact between them. In this paper we model the brain as an interconnected system composed of two specific sub-networks the left L and right R hemispheres which compete with each other for centrality a topological measure of importance in a networked system. Specifically we considered functional scalp EEG networks SEN derived from high-density electroencephalographic EEG recordings and investigated how node centrality is shaped by interhemispheric connections. Our results show that the distribution of centrality strongly depends on the number of functional connections between hemispheres and the way these connections are distributed. Additionally we investigated the consequences of node failure on hemispherical centrality and showed how the abundance of inter-hemispheric links favors the functional balance of centrality distribution between the hemispheres. Role of inter-hemispheric connections in functional brain networks.
