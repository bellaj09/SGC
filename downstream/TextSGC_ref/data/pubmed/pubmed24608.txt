Three-dimensional displays are used extensively in movies and games. These displays are also essential in mixed reality where virtual and real spaces overlap. Therefore engineers and creators should be trained to master 3D display technologies. For this reason the Department of Information Media at the Kanagawa Institute of Technology has launched two 3D image display courses specifically designed for students who aim to become information media engineers and creators. 3D Image Display Courses for Information Media Students.
