Self-paced EEG-based BCIs SP-BCIs have traditionally been avoided due to two sources of uncertainty: 1 precisely when an intentional command is sent by the brain i.e. the command onset detection problem and 2 how different the intentional command is when compared to non-specific or idle states. Performance evaluation is also a problem and there are no suitable standard metrics available. In this paper we attempted to tackle these issues. A novel onset detection technique for brain-computer interfaces using sound-production related cognitive tasks in simulated-online system.
