Image-based computer-aided diagnosis CAD algorithms by the use of convolutional neural network CNN which do not require the image-feature extractor are powerful compared with conventional feature-based CAD algorithms which require the image-feature extractor for classification of lung abnormalities. Moreover computer-aided detection and segmentation algorithms by the use of CNN are useful for analysis of lung abnormalities. Deep learning will improve the performance of CAD systems dramatically. Therefore they will change the roles of radiologists in the near future. In this article we introduce development and evaluation of such image-based CAD algorithms for various kinds of lung abnormalities such as lung nodules and diffuse lung diseases.
