"This proposed novel method consists of three levels of analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data: 1 voxel level analysis of fractional anisotropy of white matter tracks 2 connection level analysis based on fiber tracks between specific brain regions and 3 network level analysis based connections among multiple brain regions. Machine-learning techniques of Fisher score feature selection Support Vector Machine pattern classification and Leave-one-out cross-validation are performed for recognition of the neural connectivity patterns for diagnostic purposes. For validation proposes this multilevel approach achieved an average classification accuracy of 90% between Alzheimers disease and healthy controls 83% between Alzheimers disease and mild cognitive impairment and 83% between mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The results indicate that the multilevel diffusion tensor imaging approach used in this analysis is a potential diagnostic tool for clinical evaluations of brain disorders. The presented pipeline is now available as a tool for scientifically applications in a broad range of studies from both clinical and behavioral spectrum which includes studies about autism dyslexia schizophrenia dementia motor body performance among others." Multilevel diffusion tensor imaging classification technique for characterizing neurobehavioral disorders.
