Statistical books can provide deep insights into statistics and software. There are however many resources available to the practitioner. Book reviews have the capacity to function as a critical mechanism for the learner to assess the merits of engaging in part in full or at all with a book. The "ten simple rules" format pioneered in computational biology was applied here to writing effective book reviews for statistics because of the wide breadth of offerings in this domain including topical introductions computational solutions and theory. Learning by doing is a popular paradigm in statistics and computation but there is still a niche for books in the pedagogy of self-taught and instruction-based learning. Primarily these rules ensure that book reviews function as a form of short syntheses to inform and guide readers in deciding to use a specific book relative to other options for resolving statistical challenges.
