Human-machine information transfer through tactile excitation has addressed new applications in virtual reality robotics telesurgery sensory substitution and rehabilitation for the handicapped in the past few years. Power consumption is an important factor in the design of vibrotactile displays because it affects energy needs and the size weight heat dissipation and cost of the associated electronics. An experimental study is presented on the power required to reach tactile thresholds in electromechanical and piezo-electric transducers. Three different waveforms are considered with an excitatory period formed by a burst of rectangular 50% duty cycle pulses R50 rectangular low duty cycle pulses RLO and sinusoidal pulses SIN. Ten different pulse repetition periods RPs were considered in the range 1/550-1/25 s. The voltage and current waveforms applied to the transducers at sensation thresholds in a group of 12 healthy subjects were sampled and stored in a digital oscilloscope. The average power was determined for each subject and differences of two orders of magnitude were measured between the electromechanical and the piezo-electric transducer power consumption. Results show that for the electromechanical transducer a smaller power consumption of 25 microW was determined for RP = 1/25 s and the RLO waveform. In the case of the piezo-electric transducer power of 0.21 microW was determined for SIN excitation and RP = 1/250 s. These results show the advantages of reducing power requirements for vibrotactile displays which can be optimised by the choice of appropriate types of transducer excitatory waveforms and pulse repetition periods.
