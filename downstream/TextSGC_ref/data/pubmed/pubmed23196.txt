In the field of Brain Machine Interfaces BMI researchers still are not able to produce clinically viable solutions that meet the requirements of long-term operation without the use of wires or batteries. Another problem is neural compatibility with the electrode probes. One of the possible ways of approaching these problems is the use of semiconductor biocompatible materials silicon carbide combined with an integrated circuit designed to operate with low power consumption. This paper describes a low-power neural signal amplifier chip named Cortex fabricated using 0.18 m CMOS process technology with all electronics integrated in an area of 0.40 mm2. The chip has 4 channels total power consumption of only 144 W and is impedance matched to silicon carbide biocompatible electrodes. Transmission of wireless neural signals through a 0.18 m CMOS low-power amplifier.
