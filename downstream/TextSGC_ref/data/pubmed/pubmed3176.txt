"Higher functional connectivity FC in resting-state networks has been shown in individuals at risk of Alzheimers disease AD by many studies. However the longitudinal trajectories of the FC remain unknown. The present 35-month follow-up study aimed to explore longitudinal changes in higher FC in multiple resting-state networks in subjects with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele ApoE4 and/or amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI."
