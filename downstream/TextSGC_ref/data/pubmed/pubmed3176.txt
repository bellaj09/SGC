Cerebellar abnormalities are commonly reported in autism spectrum disorder ASD. Dentate nuclei DNs are key structures in the anatomical circuits linking the cerebellum to the extracerebellum. Previous resting-state functional connectivity RsFc analyses reported DN abnormalities in high-functioning ASD HF-ASD. This study examined the RsFc of the DN in young adults with HF-ASD compared with healthy controls HCs with the aim to expand upon previous findings of DNs in a dataset using advanced imaging acquisition methods that optimize spatiotemporal resolution and statistical power. Additional seed-to-voxel analyses were carried out using motor and nonmotor DN coordinates reported in previous studies as seeds. We report abnormal dentato-cerebral and dentato-cerebellar functional connectivity in ASD. Our results expand and in part replicate previous descriptions of DN RsFc abnormalities in this disorder and reveal correlations between DN-cerebral RsFc and ASD symptom severity.
