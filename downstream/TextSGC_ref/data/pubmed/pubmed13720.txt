With the rapid development of indoor localization in recent years; signals of opportunity have become a reliable and convenient source for indoor localization. The mobile device cannot only capture images of the indoor environment in real-time but can also obtain one or more different types of signals of opportunity as well. Based on this we design a convolutional neural network CNN model that concatenates features of image data and signals of opportunity for localization by using indoor scene datasets and simulating the situation of indoor location probability. Using the method of transfer learning on the Inception V3 network model feature information is added to assist in scene recognition. The experimental result shows that for two different experiment sceneries the accuracies of the prediction results are 97.0% and 96.6% using the proposed model compared to 69.0% and 81.2% by the method of overlapping positioning information and the base map and compared to 73.3% and 77.7% by using the fine-tuned Inception V3 model. The accuracy of indoor scene recognition is improved; in particular the error rate at the spatial connection of different scenes is decreased and the recognition rate of similar scenes is increased.
