Sleep is an important part of our life. That importance is highlighted by the multitude of health problems which result from sleep disorders. Detecting these sleep disorders requires an accurate interpretation of physiological signals. Prerequisite for this interpretation is an understanding of the way in which sleep stage changes manifest themselves in the signal waveform. With that understanding it is possible to build automated sleep stage scoring systems. Apart from their practical relevance for automating sleep disorder diagnosis these systems provide a good indication of the amount of sleep stage related information communicated by a specific physiological signal. A review of automated sleep stage scoring based on physiological signals for the new millennia.
