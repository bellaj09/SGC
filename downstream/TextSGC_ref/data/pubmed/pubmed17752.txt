Virtual reality VR therapy is a new neurorehabilitation intervention aimed at enhancing motor performance in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy CP. This case report investigated the effects of VR therapy on cortical reorganization and associated motor function in an 8-year-old male with hemiparetic CP. Cortical activation and associated motor development were measured before and after VR therapy using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and standardized motor tests. Before VR therapy the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices SMCs and ipsilateral supplementary motor area SMA were predominantly activated during affected elbow movement. After VR therapy the altered activations disappeared and the contralateral SMC was activated. This neuroplastic change was associated with enhanced functional motor skills including reaching self-feeding and dressing. These functions were not possible before the intervention. To our knowledge this is the first fMRI study in the literature that provides evidence for neuroplasticity after VR therapy in a child with hemiparetic CP.
