Among the most important innovations within the psychotherapeutic care system are the new opportunities in the field of e-mental health. During the past decade Internet-based and other e-mental health approaches for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and related stress-associated symptoms have been developed in great variety. Solely Internet-based self-help programs are the lowest-threshold approaches in a stepped-care system. By contrast individualized online psychotherapy and virtual reality programs are at the opposite pole of the spectrum. Approaches in the field of mobile-mental health complement these new developments in psychotherapy. The existing evidence supports the clinical efficacy of all the described approaches although not all have been tested rigorously analog to phase III studies in psychopharmacology. Nonetheless e-mental health approaches will shape our field more and more in the future. Personalized Internet-based treatment services for posttraumatic stress disorder.
