The problem of reverse-engineering the evolution of a dynamic network known broadly as network archaeology is one of profound importance in diverse application domains. In analysis of infection spread it reveals the spatial and temporal processes underlying infection. In analysis of biomolecular interaction networks e.g. protein interaction networks it reveals early molecules that are known to be differentially implicated in diseases. In economic networks it reveals flow of capital and associated actors. Beyond these recognized applications it provides analytical substrates for novel studies - for instance on the structural and functional evolution of the human brain connectome. In this paper we model formulate and rigorously analyze the problem of inferring the arrival order of nodes in a dynamic network from a single snapshot. We derive limits on solutions to the problem present methods that approach this limit and demonstrate the methods on a range of applications from inferring the evolution of the human brain connectome to conventional citation and social networks where ground truth is known. Inferring Temporal Information from a Snapshot of a Dynamic Network.
