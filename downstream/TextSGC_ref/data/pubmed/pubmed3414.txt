Hippocampome.org is a comprehensive knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation dentate gyrus CA3 CA2 CA1 subiculum and entorhinal cortex. Although the hippocampal literature is remarkably information-rich neuron properties are often reported with incompletely defined and notoriously inconsistent terminology creating a formidable challenge for data integration. Our extensive literature mining and data reconciliation identified 122 neuron types based on neurotransmitter axonal and dendritic patterns synaptic specificity electrophysiology and molecular biomarkers. All 3700 annotated properties are individually supported by specific evidence 14000 pieces in peer-reviewed publications. Systematic analysis of this unprecedented amount of machine-readable information reveals novel correlations among neuron types and properties the potential connectivity of the full hippocampal circuitry and outstanding knowledge gaps. User-friendly browsing and online querying of Hippocampome.org may aid design and interpretation of both experiments and simulations. This powerful simple and extensible neuron classification endeavor is unique in its detail utility and completeness. Hippocampome.org: a knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampus.
