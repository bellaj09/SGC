The aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that senses environmental exogenous and endogenous ligands or xenobiotic chemicals. In particular exposure of the liver to environmental metabolism-disrupting chemicals contributes to the development and propagation of steatosis and hepatotoxicity. However the mechanisms for AhR-induced hepatotoxicity and tumor propagation in the liver remain to be revealed due to the wide variety of AhR ligands. Recently quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR analysis using deep neural network DNN has shown superior performance for the prediction of chemical compounds. Therefore this study proposes a novel QSAR analysis using deep learning DL called the DeepSnap-DL method to construct prediction models of chemical activation of AhR. Compared with conventional machine learning ML techniques such as the random forest XGBoost LightGBM and CatBoost the proposed method achieves high-performance prediction of AhR activation. Thus the DeepSnap-DL method may be considered a useful tool for achieving high-throughput in silico evaluation of AhR-induced hepatotoxicity.
