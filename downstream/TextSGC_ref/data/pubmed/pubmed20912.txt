People with chronic fatigue syndrome CFS have increased rates of depression anxiety and illness intrusiveness; they may also suffer from cognitive problems such as retrospective memory RM deficits and concentration difficulties that can stem from diminished information-processing capability. We predicted that this diminished capacity may also lead to deficits in other cognitive functions such as prospective memory ProM. Event- time- and activity-based ProM was assessed in 11 women with CFS and 12 healthy women using a computer-generated virtual environment VE. RM was assessed using a free-recall test and subjective assessment of both ProM and RM was assessed by questionnaire. Groups were equivalent in age and measures of IQ. People with CFS performed slightly worse than healthy controls on both the event- and time-based ProM measures although these were not statistically significant. However the CFS group performed significantly worse than the healthy controls on both the free recall-task and on subjective assessment of both RM and ProM. Women with CFS do have some subtle decrements in memory particularly RM. However it is possible that the decrements found in the present sample would be greater in real life. Further studies utilizing both healthy controls and illness controls are now needed to ascertain how sensitive the VE measure is and to inform the development of tasks in the VE that place progressively increasing demands on working memory capacity.
