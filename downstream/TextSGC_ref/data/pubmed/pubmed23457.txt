Purpose This study investigated the therapeutic effects of virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training on brain activity in patients with stroke. Subjects and Methods Eighteen chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups: the virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group n = 10 and the bilateral upper-limb training group n = 8. The virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group performed bilateral upper-extremity exercises in a virtual reality environment while the bilateral upper-limb training group performed only bilateral upper-extremity exercise. All training was conducted 30 minutes per day three times per week for six weeks followed by brain activity evaluation. Results Electroencephalography showed significant increases in concentration in the frontopolar 2 and frontal 4 areas and significant increases in brain activity in the frontopolar 1 and frontal 3 areas in the virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training group. Conclusion Virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training can improve the brain activity of stroke patients. Thus virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training is feasible and beneficial for improving brain activation in stroke patients. Effects of virtual reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training on brain activity in post-stroke patients.
