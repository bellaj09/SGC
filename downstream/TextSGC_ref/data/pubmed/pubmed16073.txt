"On one hand people admire the often strikingly efficient results of organic evolution. On the other hand however they decry mutation and selection to be a rather prodigal inefficient trial-and-error strategy. Taking into account the parallel information processing in a heterogeneous population and sexual propagation with recombination as well as the genetic control of the reproduction accuracy computer simulated evolution reveals a couple of interesting sometimes surprising properties of natures learning-by-doing algorithm. Survival of the fittest Spencers rsum of Darwins view turns out to be a bad advice if taken literally. Individual death forgetting and even regression show up to be necessary ingredients of the life game. Whether the process should be named gradualistic or punctualistic is a matter of the observers point of view." Deep insight from simple models of evolution.
