The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of mental fatigue on Positive 300 P300 and Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials SSVEP during virtual wheelchair navigation. For this purpose experimental protocols were setup in order to induce mental fatigue P300 and SSVEP. Next the correlation between mental fatigue and P300/SSVEP parameters were investigated. At the end the best correlated features from both modalities were used as inputs for three classification techniques. Depending on the subject samples healthy vs palsy The best overall classification rate reached 80% for P300 modality. The results of this investigation constitute the first steps towards an anticipatory system that can assist the wheelchair driver during navigation depending on his mental fatigue level. Influence of mental fatigue on P300 and SSVEP during virtual wheelchair navigation.
