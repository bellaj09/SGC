"The first virtual-reality-based simulator for Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery NOTES is developed called the Virtual Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery Trainer VTEST<sup>TM</sup>. VTEST<sup>TM</sup> aims to simulate hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy procedure using a rigid scope inserted through the vaginal port. The hardware interface is designed for accurate motion tracking of the scope and laparoscopic instruments to reproduce the unique hand-eye coordination. The haptic-enabled multimodal interactive simulation includes exposing the Calots triangle and detaching the gall bladder while performing electrosurgery. The developed VTEST<sup>TM</sup> was demonstrated and validated at NOSCAR 2013."
