"Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs have the potential to detect intraoperative awareness during general anaesthesia. Traditionally BCI research is aimed at establishing or improving communication and control for patients with permanent paralysis. Patients experiencing intraoperative awareness also lack the means to communicate after administration of a neuromuscular blocker but may attempt to move. This study evaluates the principle of detecting attempted movements from the electroencephalogram EEG during local temporary neuromuscular blockade. EEG was obtained from four healthy volunteers making 3-second hand movements both before and after local administration of rocuronium in one isolated forearm. Using offline classification analysis we investigated whether the attempted movements the participants made during paralysis could be distinguished from the periods when they did not move or attempt to move. Attempted movement trials were correctly identified in 81 68-94% mean 95% CI and 84 74-93% of the cases using 30 and 9 EEG channels respectively. Similar accuracies were obtained when training the classifier on the participants actual movements. These results provide proof of the principle that a BCI can detect movement attempts during neuromuscular blockade. Based on this in the future a BCI may serve as a communication channel between a patient under general anaesthesia and the anaesthesiologist."
