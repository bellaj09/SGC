In this paper we propose deep architecture to dynamically learn the most discriminative features from data for both single-cell and object tracking in computational biology and computer vision. Firstly the discriminative features are automatically learned via a convolutional deep belief network CDBN. Secondly we design a simple yet effective method to transfer features learned from CDBNs on the source tasks for generic purpose to the object tracking tasks using only limited amount of training data. Finally to alleviate the tracker drifting problem caused by model updating we jointly consider three different types of positive samples. Extensive experiments validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Single-Cell/Object Tracking in Computational Biology and Computer Vision.
