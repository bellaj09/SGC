This work studies a novel transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS montage to improve a brain-machine interface BMI lower limb motor imagery detection. The tDCS montage is composed by two anodes and one cathode. One anode is located over the motor cortex and the other one over the cerebellum. Ten healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They were randomly separated into two groups: sham which received a fake stimulation and active tDCS which received a real stimulation. Each subject was experimented on five consecutive days. Results pointed out that there was a significant difference $p < 0 .05$ in the classification accuracy between the sham and the active tDCS group. On each of the five days of the experiment the active tDCS group achieved better accuracy results than the sham group: 4% 10% 10% 9% and 7% higher respectively. Novel tDCS montage favors lower limb motor imagery detection.
