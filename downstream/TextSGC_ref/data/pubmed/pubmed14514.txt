Background: Accurate glioma grading before surgery is of the utmost importance in treatment planning and prognosis prediction. But previous studies on magnetic resonance imaging MRI images were not effective enough. According to the remarkable performance of convolutional neural network CNN in medical domain we hypothesized that a deep learning algorithm can achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the World Health Organization WHO low grade and high grade gliomas. Methods: One hundred and thirteen glioma patients were retrospectively included. Tumor images were segmented with a rectangular region of interest ROI which contained about 80% of the tumor. Then 20% data were randomly selected and leaved out at patient-level as test dataset. AlexNet and GoogLeNet were both trained from scratch and fine-tuned from models that pre-trained on the large scale natural image database ImageNet to magnetic resonance images. The classification task was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation CV on patient-level split. Results: The performance measures including validation accuracy test accuracy and test area under curve AUC averaged from five-fold CV of GoogLeNet which trained from scratch were 0.867 0.909 and 0.939 respectively. With transfer learning and fine-tuning better performances were obtained for both AlexNet and GoogLeNet especially for AlexNet. Meanwhile GoogLeNet performed better than AlexNet no matter trained from scratch or learned from pre-trained model. Conclusion: In conclusion we demonstrated that the application of CNN especially trained with transfer learning and fine-tuning to preoperative glioma grading improves the performance compared with either the performance of traditional machine learning method based on hand-crafted features or even the CNNs trained from scratch.
