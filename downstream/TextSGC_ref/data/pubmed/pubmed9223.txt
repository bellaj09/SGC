Having the least lenses the significant feature of the singlet imaging system helps the development of the portable and cost-effective microscopes. A novel method of monochromatic/color singlet microscopy which is combined with only one aspheric lens and deep learning computational imaging technology is proposed in this article. The designed singlet aspheric lens is an approximate linear signal system which means modulation-transfer-function curves on all field-of-views 5\u2009mm diagonally are almost coincident with each other. The purpose of the designed linear signal system is to further improve the resolution of our microscope by using deep learning algorithm. As a proof of concept we designed a singlet microscopy based on our method which weighs only 400\u2009g. The experimental data and results of the sample USAF-1951 target and bio-sample the Equisetum-arvense Strobile L.S prove that the performance of the proposed singlet microscope is competitive to a commercial microscope with the 4X/NA0.1 objective lens. We believe that our idea and method would guide to design more cost-effective and powerful singlet imaging system. Portable deep learning singlet microscope.
