Dielectric damage occurring in vivo to neural electrodes leading to conductive material exposure and impedance reduction over time limits the functional lifetime and clinical viability of neuroprosthetics. We used silicon micromachined Utah Electrode Arrays UEAs with iridium oxide IrOx tip metallization and parylene C dielectric encapsulation to understand the factors affecting device resilience and drive improvements. Neural electrode resilience against dielectric damage may be improved by use of highly doped silicon as a conductive material.
