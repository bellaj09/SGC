The aim of this work was to design a personalized BCI model to detect pedaling intention through EEG signals. The approach sought to select the best among many possible BCI models for each subject. The choice was between different processing windows feature extraction algorithms and electrode configurations. Moreover data was analyzed offline and pseudo-online in a way suitable for real-time applications with a preference for the latter case. A process for selecting the best BCI model was described in detail. Results for the pseudo-online processing with the best BCI model of each subject were on average 76.7% of true positive rate 4.94 false positives per minute and 55.1% of accuracy. The personalized BCI model approach was also found to be significantly advantageous when compared to the typical approach of using a fixed feature extraction algorithm and electrode configuration. The resulting approach could be used to more robustly interface with lower limb exoskeletons in the context of the rehabilitation of stroke patients.
