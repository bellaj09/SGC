The growing interest in laparoscopic hernia surgery and in surgical simulators has motivated our current research. In this paper we present our work in simulating the process of stapling used in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. By connecting two separate deformable preperitoneal meshes together our model has simulated the repair process for a bilateral hernia correction. The task of mesh placement and stapling of corners was simulated to allow surgeons to practice their hand-eye coordination. Various deformable models and numerical methods were researched to comply with the real time requirements. The stapling simulator can either be independently used as a part-task sub-task trainer or be integrated as a module of a complete VR-based simulator. A phantom device was used to provide haptic-based force feedback during task rehearsals. StapSim: a virtual reality-based stapling simulator for laparoscopic hemiorrhaphy.
