"The UK Defence Medical Services Pre-Hospital Emergency Care PHEC capability includes rapid-deployment Medical Emergency Response Teams MERTs comprising tri-service trauma consultants paramedics and specialised nurses all of whom are qualified to administer emergency care under extreme conditions to improve the survival prospects of combat casualties. The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in mission-specific contexts. Until now the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft eg the CH-47 Chinook helicopter or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinooks rear cargo/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces. This paper describes the development of an inexpensive reconfigurable and transportable MERT training concept based on mixed reality technologies-in effect the blending of real-world objects of training relevance with virtual reality reconstructions of operational contexts."
