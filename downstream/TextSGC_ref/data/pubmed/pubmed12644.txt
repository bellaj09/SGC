In this paper camera recognition with the use of deep learning technique is introduced. To identify the various cameras their characteristic photo-response non-uniformity PRNU noise pattern was extracted. In forensic science it is important especially for child pornography cases to link a photo or a set of photos to a specific camera. Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning which trains the computer as a human brain to recognize similarities and differences by scanning it in order to identify an object. The innovation of this research is the use of PRNU noise patterns and a deep learning technique in order to achieve camera identification. In this paper AlexNet was modified producing an improved training procedure with high maximum accuracy of 80%-90%. DIGITS showed to have identified correctly six cameras out of 10 with a success rate higher than 75% in the database. However many of the cameras were falsely identified indicating a fault occurring during the procedure. A possible explanation for this is that the PRNU signal is based on the quality of the sensor and the artefacts introduced during the production process of the camera. Some manufacturers may use the same or similar imaging sensors which could result in similar PRNU noise patterns. In an attempt to form a database which contained different cameras of the same model as different categories the accuracy rate was low. This provided further proof of the limitations of this technique since PRNU is stochastic in nature and should be able to distinguish between different cameras from the same brand. Therefore this study showed that current convolutional neural networks CNNs cannot achieve individualization with PRNU patterns. Nevertheless the paper provided material for further research.
