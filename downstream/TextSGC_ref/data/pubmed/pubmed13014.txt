Building materials can contain elevated levels of naturally occurring radioactive materials NORM in particular Ra-226 Th-232 and K-40. Safety standards such as IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part 3 dictate particular activities that must be fulfilled to ensure adequate safety. Traditional methods include spectral analysis of material samples measured by a HPGe detector then processed to calculate the specific activity of the NORM in Bq/Kg with 1.96  uncertainty. This paper describes a new method that pre-processes the raw spectrum then feeds the result into a set of pre-trained neural networks thus generating the required specific radionuclide activity as well as the 1.96  uncertainty. Highly accurate prediction of specific activity using deep learning.
