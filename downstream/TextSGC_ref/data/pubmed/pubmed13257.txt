Inferring the properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the key problems in bioinformatics. Most state-of-the-art approaches for protein classification are tailored to single classification tasks and rely on handcrafted features such as position-specific-scoring matrices from expensive database searches. We argue that this level of performance can be reached or even be surpassed by learning a task-agnostic representation once using self-supervised language modeling and transferring it to specific tasks by a simple fine-tuning step.
