Advancements in wireless sensor network technologies have enabled the proliferation of miniaturized body-worn sensors capable of long-term pervasive biomedical signal monitoring. Remote cardiovascular monitoring has been one of the beneficiaries of this development resulting in non-invasive photoplethysmography PPG sensors being used in ambulatory settings. Wrist-worn PPG although a popular alternative to electrocardiogram suffers from motion artifacts inherent in daily life. Hence in this paper we present a novel deep learning framework CorNET to efficiently estimate heart rate HR information and perform biometric identification BId using only a wrist-worn single-channel PPG signal collected in ambulant environment. We have formulated a completely personalized data-driven approach using a four-layer deep neural network. Two convolution neural network layers are used in conjunction with two long short-term memory layers followed by a dense output layer for modeling the temporal sequence inherent within the pulsatile signal representative of cardiac activity. The final dense layer is customized with respect to the application functioning as: regression layer-having a single neuron to predict HR; classification layer-two neurons that identify a subject among a group. The proposed network was evaluated on the TROIKA dataset having 22 PPG records collected during various physical activities. We achieve a mean absolute error of 1.47  3.37 beats per minute for HR estimation and an average accuracy of 96% for BId on 20 subjects. CorNET was further evaluated successfully in an ambulant use-case scenario with custom sensors for two subjects.
