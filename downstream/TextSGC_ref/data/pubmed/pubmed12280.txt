Over the past 20 years there has been a dramatic transformation in the goals of science teaching at all levels and within all disciplines. The emphasis has moved from students obtaining a base of scientific facts to students developing a deep understanding of important concepts. This transformation requires a significant shift in the approach and attitude of the instructors and students as well as in the procedures and techniques that are required to teach cell biology. Cell biology should be taught as science is practised.
