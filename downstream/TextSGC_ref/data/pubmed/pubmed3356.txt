Lesion-symptom mapping is often employed to define brain structures that are crucial for human behavior. Even though poststroke deficits result from gray matter damage as well as secondary white matter loss the impact of structural disconnection is overlooked by conventional lesion-symptom mapping because it does not measure loss of connectivity beyond the stroke lesion. This study describes how traditional lesion mapping can be combined with structural connectome lesion symptom mapping CLSM and connectome dynamics lesion symptom mapping CDLSM to relate residual white matter networks to behavior. Using data from a large cohort of stroke survivors with aphasia we observed improved prediction of aphasia severity when traditional lesion symptom mapping was combined with CLSM and CDLSM. Moreover only CLSM and CDLSM disclosed the importance of temporal-parietal junction connections in aphasia severity. In summary connectome measures can uniquely reveal brain networks that are necessary for function improving the traditional lesion symptom mapping approach.
