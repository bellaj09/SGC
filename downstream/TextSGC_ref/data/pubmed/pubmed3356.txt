"Connectomics alterations associated with subtle forms of cerebrovascular neuropathology-such as cerebral microbleeds CMBs-can result in substantial neurological and/or cognitive deficits in victims of traumatic brain injury TBI. Quantifying CMB-related connectome changes in mild TBI mTBI patients requires ingenious neuroinformatics to integrate structural magnetic resonance imaging sMRI with diffusion-weighted imaging DWI for patient-tailored profiling while preserving the data scientists ability to implement population studies. Such solutions however can assist the refinement of rehabilitation protocols and streamline large-scale analysis while accommodating the heterogeneity of mTBI. This study describes a pipeline for the multimodal integration of sMRI/DWI/DTI to quantify white matter WM neural network circuitry alterations associated with mTBI-related CMBs. The approach incorporates WM streamline matching topology-compliant streamline prototyping and along-tract analysis within a unified framework. When applied to the analysis of neuroimaging data acquired from both mTBI and healthy control volunteers the approach facilitates the identification of patient-specific CMB-related connectomic changes while incorporating the ability to perform group analyses. This pipeline for the identification and profiling of connectopathies can assist the adaptation of clinical rehabilitation protocols to patients individual needs."
