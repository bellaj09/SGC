By virtue of the combined merits of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy imaging flow cytometry IFC has become an established tool for cell analysis in diverse biomedical fields such as cancer biology microbiology immunology hematology and stem cell biology. However the performance and utility of IFC are severely limited by the fundamental trade-off between throughput sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we present an optomechanical imaging method that overcomes the trade-off by virtually freezing the motion of flowing cells on the image sensor to effectively achieve 1000 times longer exposure time for microscopy-grade fluorescence image acquisition. Consequently it enables high-throughput IFC of single cells at >10000 cells s-1 without sacrificing sensitivity and spatial resolution. The availability of numerous information-rich fluorescence cell images allows high-dimensional statistical analysis and accurate classification with deep learning as evidenced by our demonstration of unique applications in hematology and microbiology.
