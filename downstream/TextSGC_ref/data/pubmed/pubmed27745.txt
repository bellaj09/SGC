Increasing the freedom of communication using conventional row/column RC P300 paradigm by naive way increasing matrix size may deteriorate inherent distraction effect and interaction speed. In this paper we propose a two-level predictive TLP paradigm by integrating a 33 two-level matrix paradigm with a statistical language model. The TLP paradigm is evaluated using offline and online data from ten healthy subjects. Significantly larger event-related potentials ERPs are evoked by the TLP paradigm compared with the classical 66 RC. During an online task correctly spell an English sentence with 57 characters accuracy and information transfer rate for the TLP are increased by 14.45% and 29.29% respectively when compared with the 66 RC. Time to complete the task is also decreased by 24.61% using TLP. In sharp contrast an 88 RC naive extension of the 66 RC consumed 19.18% more time than the classical 66 RC. Furthermore the statistical language model is also exploited to improve classification accuracy in a Bayesian approach. The proposed Bayesian fusion method is tested offline on data from the online spelling tasks. The results show its potential improvement on single-trial ERP classification.
