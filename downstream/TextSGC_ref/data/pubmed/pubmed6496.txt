"The development of accurate prognoses in multiple sclerosis is difficult as the disease is characterized by heterogeneous patterns of brain abnormalities that relate in an unclear way to future impairments. Here we use a statistical modeling approach to determine if the baseline pattern of connectome disruption due to T2-FLAIR lesions could predict a patients future processing speed as measured using the Symbol Digits Modality Test scores. Imaging data demographics and Symbol Digits Modality Test scores were collected from 61 early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients. The Network Modification Tool was used to estimate damage to the connectome by quantifying white matter abnormalities effects on 1 global network properties 2 regional connectivity and 3 connectivity between pairs of regions. MS subjects showed significant improvement of processing speed between baseline and follow-up t\u202f=\u202f-2.6 p\u202f=\u202f0.0096; however both baseline t\u202f=\u202f-4.01 p\u202f=\u202f0.00012 and follow-up t\u202f=\u202f-2.10 p\u202f=\u202f0.038 processing speed were significantly lower than age-matched healthy controls. Partial Least Squares Regression was used to create models that predict future processing speed from between baseline imaging metrics and demographics. The model based on region-pair disconnection and gray matter atrophy had the lowest AIC and highest prediction accuracy R2\u202f=\u202f0.79 compared to models based on global R2\u202f=\u202f0.41 or regional R2\u202f=\u202f0.66 disconnection and gray matter atrophy overlap with an ROI-based atlas and gray matter atrophy R2\u202f=\u202f0.73 or gray matter atrophy alone R2\u202f=\u202f0.71. We found that baseline measures of connectivity disruption in various parietal temporal occipital and subcortical regions and atrophy in the putamen were important predictors of future processing speed. We conclude that information about disruptions to pairwise brain connections is more informative of future processing speed than regional or global metrics or gray matter atrophy alone. The combination of quantitative disconnectome metrics gray matter atrophy and statistical modeling approaches could enable clinicians in developing more accurate individualized prognoses of future cognitive status in multiple sclerosis patients." Baseline biomarkers of connectome disruption and atrophy predict future processing speed in early multiple sclerosis.
