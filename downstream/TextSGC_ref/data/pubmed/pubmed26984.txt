Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI are systems that allow the interaction of people and devices on the grounds of brain activity. The noninvasive and most viable way to obtain such information is by using electroencephalography EEG. However these signals have a low signal-to-noise ratio as well as a low spatial resolution. This work proposes a new method built from the combination of a Blind Source Separation BSS to obtain estimated independent components a 2D representation of these component signals using the Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT and a classification stage using a Convolutional Neural Network CNN approach. A criterion based on the spectral correlation with a Movement Related Independent Component MRIC is used to sort the estimated sources by BSS thus reducing the spatial variance. The experimental results of 94.66% using a k-fold cross validation are competitive with techniques recently reported in the state-of-the-art.
