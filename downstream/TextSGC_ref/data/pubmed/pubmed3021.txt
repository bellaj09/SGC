Functional neuroimaging modalities play an important role in deciding the diagnosis and course of treatment of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This article presents an analytical tool with visualization by exploiting the strengths of the MEG magnetoencephalographic neuroimaging technique. The tool automates MEG data import in tSSS format channel information extraction time/frequency decomposition and circular graph visualization connectogram for simple result inspection. For advanced users the tool also provides magnitude squared coherence MSC values allowing personalized threshold levels and the computation of default model from MEG data of control population. Default model obtained from healthy population data serves as a useful benchmark to diagnose and monitor neuronal recovery during treatment. The proposed tool further provides optional labels with international 10-10 system nomenclature in order to facilitate comparison studies with EEG electroencephalography sensor space. Potential applications in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury studies are also discussed. Early visual analysis tool using magnetoencephalography for treatment and recovery of neuronal dysfunction.
