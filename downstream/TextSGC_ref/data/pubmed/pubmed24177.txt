Computer based surgical training is believed to be capable of providing a controlled virtual environment for medical professionals to conduct standardized training or new experimental procedures on virtual human body parts which are generated and visualised three-dimensionally on a digital display unit.\xa0The main objective of this study was to conduct virtual phacoemulsification cataract surgery to compare performance by users with different proficiency on a virtual reality platform equipped with a visual guidance system and a set of performance parameters. Virtual phacoemulsification surgical simulation using visual guidance and performance parameters as a feasible proficiency assessment tool.
