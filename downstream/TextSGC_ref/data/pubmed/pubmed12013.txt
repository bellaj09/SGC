The development of fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms is a central aspect of computed tomography. In this paper we investigate this issue for the sparse data problem in photoacoustic tomography PAT. We develop a direct and highly efficient reconstruction algorithm based on deep learning. In our approach image reconstruction is performed with a deep convolutional neural network CNN whose weights are adjusted prior to the actual image reconstruction based on a set of training data. The proposed reconstruction approach can be interpreted as a network that uses the PAT filtered backprojection algorithm for the first layer followed by the U-net architecture for the remaining layers. Actual image reconstruction with deep learning consists in one evaluation of the trained CNN which does not require time-consuming solution of the forward and adjoint problems. At the same time our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach reconstructs images with a quality comparable to state of the art iterative approaches for PAT from sparse data.
