"The idea that synchronous neural activity underlies cognition has driven an extensive body of research in human and animal neuroscience. Yet insufficient data on intracranial electrical connectivity has precluded a direct test of this hypothesis in a whole-brain setting. Through the lens of memory encoding and retrieval processes we construct whole-brain connectivity maps of fast gamma 30-100\u2009Hz and slow theta 3-8\u2009Hz spectral neural activity based on data from 294 neurosurgical patients fitted with indwelling electrodes. Here we report that gamma networks desynchronize and theta networks synchronize during encoding and retrieval. Furthermore for nearly all brain regions we studied gamma power rises as that region desynchronizes with gamma activity elsewhere in the brain establishing gamma as a largely asynchronous phenomenon. The abundant phenomenon of theta synchrony is positively correlated with a brain regions gamma power suggesting a predominant low-frequency mechanism for inter-regional communication." Widespread theta synchrony and high-frequency desynchronization underlies enhanced cognition.
