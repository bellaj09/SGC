Although a large body of research has identified discrete neuroanatomical regions involved in social cognition and behavior the "social brain" the existing findings are based largely on studies of specific brain structures defined within the context of particular tasks or for specific types of social behavior. The objective of the current work was to view these regions as nodes of a larger collective network and to quantitatively characterize both the topology of that network and the relative criticality of its many nodes. Large-scale data mining was performed to generate seed regions of the social brain. High-quality diffusion MRI data of typical adults were used to map anatomical networks of the social brain. Network topology and nodal centrality were analyzed using graph theory. The structural social brain network demonstrates a high degree of global functional integration with strong local segregation. Bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortices and amygdala play the most central roles in the network. Strong probabilistic evidence supports modular divisions of the social brain into subnetworks bearing good resemblance to functionally classified clusters. The present network-driven approach quantifies the structural topology of the social brain as a whole. This work can serve as a critical benchmark against which to compare 1 developmental change in social brain topology over time from infancy through adolescence and beyond and 2 atypical network topologies that may be a sign or symptom of disorder as in conditions such as autism Williams syndrome schizophrenia and others.
