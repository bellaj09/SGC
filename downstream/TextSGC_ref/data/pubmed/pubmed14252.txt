"Background A multitask deep learning model might be useful in large epidemiologic studies wherein detailed structural assessment of osteoarthritis still relies on expert radiologists readings. The potential of such a model in clinical routine should be investigated. Purpose To develop a multitask deep learning model for grading radiographic hip osteoarthritis features on radiographs and compare its performance to that of attending-level radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed hip joints seen on weight-bearing anterior-posterior pelvic radiographs from participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative OAI. Participants were recruited from February 2004 to May 2006 for baseline measurements and follow-up was performed 48 months later. Femoral osteophytes FOs acetabular osteophytes AOs and joint-space narrowing JSN were graded as absent mild moderate or severe according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas. Subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cysts were graded as present or absent. The participants were split at 80% n = 3494 10% n = 437 and 10% n = 437 by using split-sample validation into training validation and testing sets respectively. The multitask neural network was based on DenseNet-161 a shared convolutional features extractor trained with multitask loss function. Model performance was evaluated in the internal test set from the OAI and in an external test set by using temporal and geographic validation consisting of routine clinical radiographs. Results A total of 4368 participants mean age 61.0 years  9.2 standard deviation; 2538 women were evaluated 15\u2009364 hip joints on 7738 weight-bearing anterior-posterior pelvic radiographs. The accuracy of the model for assessing these five features was 86.7% 1333 of 1538 for FOs 69.9% 1075 of 1538 for AOs 81.7% 1257 of 1538 for JSN 95.8% 1473 of 1538 for subchondral sclerosis and 97.6% 1501 of 1538 for subchondral cysts in the internal test set and 82.7% 86 of 104 for FOS 65.4% 68 of 104 for AOs 80.8% 84 of 104 for JSN 88.5% 92 of 104 for subchondral sclerosis and 91.3% 95 of 104 for subchondral cysts in the external test set. Conclusion A multitask deep learning model is a feasible approach to reliably assess radiographic features of hip osteoarthritis."
