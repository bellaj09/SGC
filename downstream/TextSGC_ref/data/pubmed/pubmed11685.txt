At present deep-learning methods have been widely used in road extraction from remote-sensing images and have effectively improved the accuracy of road extraction. However these methods are still affected by the loss of spatial features and the lack of global context information. To solve these problems we propose a new network for road extraction the coord-dense-global CDG model built on three parts: a coordconv module by putting coordinate information into feature maps aimed at reducing the loss of spatial information and strengthening road boundaries an improved dense convolutional network DenseNet that could make full use of multiple features through own dense blocks and a global attention module designed to highlight high-level information and improve category classification by using pooling operation to introduce global information. When tested on a complex road dataset from Massachusetts USA CDG achieved clearly superior performance to contemporary networks such as DeepLabV3+ U-net and D-LinkNet. For example its mean IoU intersection of the prediction and ground truth regions over their union and mean F1 score evaluation metric for the harmonic mean of the precision and recall metrics were 61.90% and 76.10% respectively which were 1.19% and 0.95% higher than the results of D-LinkNet the winner of a road-extraction contest. In addition CDG was also superior to the other three models in solving the problem of tree occlusion. Finally in universality research with the Gaofen-2 satellite dataset the CDG model also performed well at extracting the road network in the test maps of Hefei and Tianjin China.
