"Cognitive planning deficits affect patients with Parkinsons disease PD and traditional psychometric tests meet difficulties to evaluate their impact on daily life activities. Virtual reality VR may provide a new means of assessment. The objective of this study was firstly to develop a virtual environment VE useful to explore planning and secondly to examine the effectiveness of using VR in the assessment of cognitive planning for patients with PD. A virtual supermarket VS was designed in which participants carried out a task close to daily activities: a test of shopping list. There were two preliminary sessions to familiarize the participants with the software and the supermarkets layout. Then during the assessment session participants completed the task without any time limitation. Global intellectual efficiency was assessed in order to exclude patients with dementia. Data related to the performance in the VS were recorded. Five patients with PD and five age-matched healthy volunteers meeting inclusion criteria constituted our convenience sample. The patients did not perform as well as the control group. In particular the sessions duration and the distance covered were longer. The patients path is specific with numerous stops turning around and hesitancies. Finally their motivation for further training sessions is aroused. The results underline the potential of using VR in the assessment of cognitive planning in PD. A larger analysis is currently being carried out to confirm and to explore all the outcome measures."
