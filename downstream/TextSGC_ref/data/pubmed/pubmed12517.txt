We investigated a machine-learning-based fast banknote serial number recognition method. Unlike existing methods the proposed method not only recognizes multi-digit serial numbers simultaneously but also detects the region of interest for the serial number automatically from the input image. Furthermore the proposed method uses knowledge distillation to compress a cumbersome deep-learning model into a simple model to achieve faster computation. To automatically decide hyperparameters for knowledge distillation we applied the Bayesian optimization method. In experiments using Japanese Yen Korean Won and Euro banknotes the proposed method showed significant improvement in computation time while maintaining a performance comparable to a sequential region of interest ROI detection and classification method.
