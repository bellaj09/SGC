Little is known about the attributes of men who sexually assault drinking women as compared with men who sexually assault sober women and nonperpetrators. Findings from a cross-sectional survey of 548 men and a laboratory computer-simulated date completed by a subset  n = 87 support the hypothesis that both groups of perpetrators would share some common risk factors and differ regarding alcohol beliefs and consumption.
