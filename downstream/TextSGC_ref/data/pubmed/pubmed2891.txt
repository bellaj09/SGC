Patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD have intestinal inflammation and are treated with immune-modulating medications. In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the Gut of Patients With IBD.
