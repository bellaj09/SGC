Depression is associated with changes in the pattern of interaction of cerebral networks which can reflect both existing symptoms and compensatory processes. The study is based on analysis of resting state fMRI data from 15 patients with mild depression and 19 conventionally healthy individuals. From fMRI signal recorded at rest for 4 min the independent components were reconstructed. The intergroup differences and dynamics of functional connectivity from the first to the second recording were analyzed. Initially depressive patients demonstrated weaker connectivity between cerebellar declive network CN and left central executive network CEN and also sensorimotor network SMN; left CEN and primary visual network PVN. During the second recording the patients demonstrated more intensive reciprocal connection of the dorsal domain of default mode network DMN and auditory network AN. In healthy subjects positive correlations of the dorsal DMN and left CEN right CEN and CN and negative correlation of dorsal DMN and visuospatial network weakened from the first to second record. In the depression group the interaction of AN with PVN the right CEN with the anterior salience network and with ventral DMN weakened. At the same time the connectivity between SMN and CN were strengthened. The results can be interpreted as spontaneous normalization of brain activity but no direct evidence for their relation to the improvement of depression symptoms was found.
