"The use of ImageNet pre-trained networks is becoming widespread in the medical imaging community. It enables training on small datasets commonly available in medical imaging tasks. The recent emergence of a large Chest X-ray dataset opened the possibility for learning features that are specific to the X-ray analysis task. In this work we demonstrate that the features learned allow for better classification results for the problem of Tuberculosis detection and enable generalization to an unseen dataset.To accomplish the task of feature learning we train a DenseNet-121 CNN on 112K images from the ChestXray14 dataset which includes labels of 14 common thoracic pathologies. In addition to the pathology labels we incorporate meta-data which is available in the dataset: Patient Positioning Gender and Patient Age. We term this architecture MetaChexNet. As a by-product of the feature learning we demonstrate state of the art performance on the task of patient Age & Gender estimation using CNNs. Finally we show the features learned using ChestXray14 allow for better transfer learning on small-scale datasets for Tuberculosis."
