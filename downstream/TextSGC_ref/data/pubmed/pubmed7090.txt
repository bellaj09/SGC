Anhedonia is central to multiple psychiatric disorders and causes substantial disability. A dimensional conceptualization posits that anhedonia severity is related to a transdiagnostic continuum of reward deficits in specific neural networks. Previous functional connectivity studies related to anhedonia have focused on case-control comparisons in specific disorders using region-specific seed-based analyses. Here the authors explore the entire functional connectome in relation to reward responsivity across a population of adults with heterogeneous psychopathology.
