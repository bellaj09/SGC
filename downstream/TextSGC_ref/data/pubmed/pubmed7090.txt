As the interaction between clinicians and computational processes increases in complexity more nuanced mechanisms are required to describe how their communication is mediated. Medical image segmentation in particular affords a large number of distinct loci for interaction which can act on a deep knowledge-driven level which complicates the naive interpretation of the computer as a symbol processing machine. Using the perspective of the computer as dialogue partner we can motivate the semiotic understanding of medical image segmentation. Taking advantage of Peircean semiotic traditions and new philosophical inquiry into the structure and quality of metaphors we can construct a unified framework for the interpretation of medical image segmentation as a sign exchange in which each sign acts as an interface metaphor. This allows for a notion of finite semiosis described through a schematic medium that can rigorously describe how clinicians and computers interpret the signs mediating their interaction. Altogether this framework provides a unified approach to the understanding and development of medical image segmentation interfaces. The semiotics of medical image Segmentation.
