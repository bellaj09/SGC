A new neuroimaging dimension is currently being adopted. The structural connectome reveals macroscale white matter connectivity of the human brain providing insights into brain networks organization. Connectomics analysis of the connectome has potential for elucidating aberrant networks eg in congenital brain malformations especially axonal pathfinding disorders. Connectomics provides a powerful set of network measures which can serve as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis prognostication and treatment response of children. We discuss the principles of connectome reconstruction and visualization of the pediatric structural connectome using current state-of-the-art neuroimaging and postprocessing techniques and we describe potential connectomics applications to study brain malformations.
