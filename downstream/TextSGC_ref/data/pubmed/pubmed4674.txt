Increasing numbers of neuroimaging studies are acquiring data to examine changes in brain architecture by investigating intrinsic functional networks IFN from longitudinal resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI. At the subject level these IFNs are determined by cross-sectional procedures which neglect intra-subject dependencies and result in suboptimal estimates of the networks. Here a novel longitudinal approach simultaneously extracts subject-specific IFNs across multiple visits by explicitly modeling functional brain development as an essential context for seeking change. On data generated by an innovative simulation based on real rs-fMRI the method was more accurate in estimating subject-specific IFNs than cross-sectional approaches. Furthermore only group-analysis based on longitudinally consistent estimates identified significant developmental effects within IFNs of 246 adolescents from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence NCANDA study. The findings were confirmed by the cross-sectional estimates when the corresponding group analysis was confined to the developmental effects. Those effects also converged with current concepts of neurodevelopment. Longitudinally consistent estimates of intrinsic functional networks.
