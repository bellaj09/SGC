Brain-computer interfaces BCI are designed to enable individuals with severe motor impairments such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS to communicate and control their environment. A focus group was conducted with individuals with ALS n=8 and their caregivers n=9 to determine the barriers to and mediators of BCI acceptance in this population. Two key categories emerged: personal factors and relational factors. Personal factors which included physical physiological and psychological concerns were less important to participants than relational factors which included corporeal technological and social relations with the BCI. The importance of these relational factors was analysed with respect to published literature on actor-network theory ANT and disability and concepts of voicelessness and personhood. Future directions for BCI research are recommended based on the emergent focus group themes. Barriers to and mediators of brain-computer interface user acceptance: focus group findings.
