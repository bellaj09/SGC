Order-preserving submatrices OPSMs have been applied in many fields such as DNA microarray data analysis automatic recommendation systems and target marketing systems as an important unsupervised learning model. Unfortunately most existing methods are heuristic algorithms which are unable to reveal OPSMs entirely in NP-complete problem. In particular deep OPSMs corresponding to long patterns with few supporting sequences incur explosive computational costs and are completely pruned by most popular methods. In this paper we propose an exact method to discover all OPSMs based on frequent sequential pattern mining. First an existing algorithm was adjusted to disclose all common subsequence ACS between every two row sequences and therefore all deep OPSMs will not be missed. Then an improved data structure for prefix tree was used to store and traverse ACS and Apriori principle was employed to efficiently mine the frequent sequential pattern. Finally experiments were implemented on gene and synthetic datasets. Results demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of this method. A New Approach for Mining Order-Preserving Submatrices Based on All Common Subsequences.
