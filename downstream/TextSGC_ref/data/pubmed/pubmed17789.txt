Saccadic eye movementis an important ability in our daily life and is especially important in driving and sports. Traditionally the Developmental Eye Movement DEM test and the King-Devick K-D test have been used to measure saccadic eye movement but these only involve measurements with "adjusted time". Therefore a different approach is required to obtain the eye movement speed and reaction rate in detail as some are rapid eye movements while others are slow actions and vice versa. This study proposed a extended method that can acquire the "rest time" and "transfer time" as well as the "adjusted time" by implementing a virtual reality-based DEM test using a FOVE virtual reality VR head-mounted display equipped with an eye-tracking module. This approach was tested in 30 subjects with normal vision and no ophthalmologic disease by using a 2-diopter 50-cm distance. This allowed for measurement of the "adjusted time" and the "rest time" for focusing on each target number character the "transfer time" for moving to the next target number character and recording of the gaze-tracking log. The results of this experiment showed that it was possible to analyze more parameters of the saccadic eye movement with the proposed method than with the traditional methods.
