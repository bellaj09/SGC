The research in non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface BCI has led to significant improvements in the recent years for potential end users. However the user experience and the BCI illiteracy problem remains challenging areas to address for obtaining robust and resilient clinical applications. In this study we address the choice of the time segment for the detection of steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP detection. This problem has been widely addressed for the detection of event-related potentials compared to SSVEP based BCIs. The choice of this parameter is typically fixed and has a direct influence on both the detection accuracy and the information transfer rate. We propose to shift the problem of the time segment to the choice of the threshold for determining if a response has been properly detected. We consider two open-datasets for benchmarking the rationale of the approach. The results support the conclusion that an adaptive time segment for each trial based on the selection of a threshold can lead to a substantial higher ITR 86.92 bits/min compared to the time segment chosen at the user 79.56 bits/min or group level 73.78 bits/min. Finally the results suggest that the threshold could be determined automatically in relation to the number of classes. Such an approach can leverage the literacy of SSVEP based BCI.
