Parameter setting plays an important role for improving the performance of a brain computer interface BCI. Currently parameters e.g. channels and frequency band are often manually selected. It is time-consuming and not easy to obtain an optimal combination of parameters for a BCI. In this paper motor imagery-based BCIs are considered in which channels and frequency band are key parameters. First a semi-supervised support vector machine algorithm is proposed for automatically selecting a set of channels with given frequency band. Next this algorithm is extended for joint channel-frequency selection. In this approach both training data with labels and test data without labels are used for training a classifier. Hence it can be used in small training data case. Finally our algorithms are applied to a BCI competition data set. Our data analysis results show that these algorithms are effective for selection of frequency band and channels when the training data set is small.
