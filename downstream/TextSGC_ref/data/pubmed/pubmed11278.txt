"Understanding the structure and purpose of sleep remains one of the grand challenges of neurobiology. Here we use a mean-field linearized theory of the sleeping cortex to derive statistics for synaptic learning and memory erasure. The growth in correlated low-frequency high-amplitude voltage fluctuations during slow-wave sleep SWS is characterized by a probability density function that becomes broader and shallower as the transition into rapid-eye-movement REM sleep is approached. At transition the Shannon information entropy of the fluctuations is maximized. If we assume Hebbian-learning rules apply to the cortex then its correlated response to white-noise stimulation during SWS provides a natural mechanism for a synaptic weight change that will tend to shut down reverberant neural activity. In contrast during REM sleep the weights will evolve in a direction that encourages excitatory activity. These entropy and weight-change predictions lead us to identify the final portion of deep SWS that occurs immediately prior to transition into REM sleep as a time of enhanced erasure of labile memory. We draw a link between the sleeping cortex and Landauers dissipation theorem for irreversible computing R. Landauer IBM J. Res. Devel. 5 183 1961 arguing that because information erasure is an irreversible computation there is an inherent entropy cost as the cortex transits from SWS into REM sleep."
