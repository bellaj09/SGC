"Self-disclosure is an essential component of social communication that has been associated with trust liking and ultimately strong relationships. As technology continues to develop so do the number of methods to create and maintain relationships. While speaking face-to-face FtF remains the primary way to communicate computer-mediated communication has become more common meaning that research into self-disclosure has expanded to new domains including virtual reality VR. This study compared self-disclosure between three conversation contexts: FtF online text-based OTB communication or VR. Zero-contact dyads comprised female university students who completed 20-minute conversations guided by one of two discussion prompts: the closeness-generating or small talk procedure. These prompts were designed to either increase or not increase self-disclosure. These conversations were recorded and coded for the frequency of total factual cognitive and emotional self-disclosures as objective measures. Participants perceptions of personal and partners self-disclosures were also assessed by questionnaires as perceived measures. FtF and VR conditions exceeded OTB communication in perceived and objective measures of self-disclosure. Although no significant differences emerged between FtF and VR conditions for factual or perceived self-disclosure participants in the FtF condition had more total cognitive and emotional self-disclosures than VR conditions. Implications for communication and teletherapy are discussed. The present study offers preliminary evidence that VR could potentially rival FtF as a communication medium and be as effective in facilitating self-disclosure. Findings offer a starting point for research on social applications of VR."
