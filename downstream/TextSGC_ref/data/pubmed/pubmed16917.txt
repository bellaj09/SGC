The processes of conscious memory CM and unconscious memory UM are explored based on the results of the current and previous studies in which the 2 forms of memory within a test were separated by either the process dissociation or metacognition-based dissociation procedure. The results assessing influences of shallow and deep processing association and self-generation on CM in explicit and implicit tests are taken as evidence that CM in a test is driven not only conceptually but also by the driving nature of the test and CM benefits from an encoding condition to the extent that information processing for CM recapitulates that engaged in the encoding condition.Those influences on UM in explicit and implicit tests are taken to support the view that UM in a test is driven by the nature of the test itself and UM benefits from an encoding condition to the extent that the cognitive environments at test and at study match to activate the same type of information e.g. visual lexical or semantic about memory items or the same content of a preexisting association or categorical structure. Processes of conscious and unconscious memory: evidence from current research on dissociation of memories within a test.
