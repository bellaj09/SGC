Predicting protein structure from sequence alone is challenging. Thus the majority of methods for protein structure prediction rely on evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments. In previous work we showed that Long Short-Term Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks LSTM-BRNNs improved over regular neural networks by better capturing intra-sequence dependencies. Here we show a single-sequence-based prediction method employing LSTM-BRNNs SPIDER3-Single that consistently achieves Q3 accuracy of 72.5% and correlation coefficient of 0.67 between predicted and actual solvent accessible surface area. Moreover it yields reasonably accurate prediction of eight-state secondary structure main-chain angles backbone  and  torsion angles and C -atom-based  and  angles half-sphere exposure and contact number. The method is more accurate than the corresponding evolutionary-based method for proteins with few sequence homologs and computationally efficient for large-scale screening of protein-structural properties. It is available as an option in the SPIDER3 server and a standalone version for download at http://sparks-lab.org.
