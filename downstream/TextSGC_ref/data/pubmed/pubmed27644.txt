Following recent evidence for a link between interoception emotion and empathy we investigated relationships between these factors in autism spectrum disorder ASD. 26 adults with ASD and 26 healthy participants completed tasks measuring interoception alexithymia and empathy. ASD participants with alexithymia demonstrated lower cognitive and affective empathy than ASD participants without alexithymia. ASD participants showed reduced interoceptive sensitivity IS and also reduced interoceptive awareness IA. IA was correlated with empathy and alexithymia but IS was related to neither. Alexithymia fulfilled a mediating role between IA and empathy. Our findings are suggestive of an alexithymic subgroup in ASD with distinct interoceptive processing abilities and have implications for diagnosis and interventions.
