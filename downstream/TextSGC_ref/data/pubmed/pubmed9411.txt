Combining the strength of flow cytometry with fluorescence imaging and digital image analysis imaging flow cytometry is a powerful tool in diverse fields including cancer biology immunology drug discovery microbiology and metabolic engineering. It enables measurements and statistical analyses of chemical structural and morphological phenotypes of numerous living cells to provide systematic insights into biological processes. However its utility is constrained by its requirement of fluorescent labeling for phenotyping. Here we present label-free chemical imaging flow cytometry to overcome the issue. It builds on a pulse pair-resolved wavelength-switchable Stokes laser for the fastest-to-date multicolor stimulated Raman scattering SRS microscopy of fast-flowing cells on a 3D acoustic focusing microfluidic chip enabling an unprecedented throughput of up to 140 cells/s. To show its broad utility we use the SRS imaging flow cytometry with the aid of deep learning to study the metabolic heterogeneity of microalgal cells and perform marker-free cancer detection in blood.
