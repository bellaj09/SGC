Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs offer restoration of communication to those with the most severe movement impairments but performance is not yet ideal. Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter the variation in timing of the brain responses plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation CBLE and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares LS step-wise linear discriminant analysis SWLDA and support vector machine SVM. Of these three LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.
