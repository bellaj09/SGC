We propose a Deep Boosting Framework DBF for real-world image denoising by integrating the deep learning technique into the boosting algorithm. The DBF replaces conventional handcrafted boosting units by elaborate convolutional neural networks which brings notable advantages in terms of both performance and speed. We design a lightweight Dense Dilated Fusion Network DDFN as an embodiment of the boosting unit which addresses the vanishing of gradients during training due to the cascading of networks while promoting the efficiency of limited parameters. The capabilities of the proposed method are first validated on several representative simulation tasks including non-blind and blind Gaussian denoising and JPEG image deblocking. We then focus on a practical scenario to tackle with the complex and challenging real-world noise. To facilitate leaning-based methods including ours we build a new Real-world Image Denoising RID dataset which contains 200 pairs of high-resolution images with diverse scene content under various shooting conditions. Moreover we conduct comprehensive analysis on the domain shift issue for real-world denoising and propose an effective one-shot domain transfer scheme to address this issue. Comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly surpasses existing methods on the task of real-world image denoising.
