Predicting where people look in static scenes a.k.a visual saliency has received significant research interests recently. However relatively less effort has been spent in understanding visual attention over dynamic scenes. This work makes three contributions to video saliency research. First we introduce a new benchmark called DHF1K for predicting fixations during dynamic scene free-viewing which is a long-time need in this field. DHF1K consists of 1K high-quality elaborately selected videos annotated by 17 observers using an eye tracker. The videos span a wide range of scenes motions object types and backgrounds. Second we propose a novel video saliency model called ACLNet that augments the CNN-LSTM network with a supervised attention mechanism to enable fast end-to-end learning. The attention mechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information thus allowing LSTM to focus on learning a more flexible temporal saliency representation. Such a design leverages existing large-scale static fixation datasets avoids overfitting and significantly improves training efficiency and testing performance. Third we perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art saliency models on three current datasets i.e. DHF1K Hollywood2 UCF sports. Experimental results over more than 1.2K testing videos containing 400K frames demonstrate that ACLNet outperforms other contenders and has a fast processing speed 40fps.
