"Motor rehabilitation using brain-computer interface BCI systems may facilitate functional recovery in individuals after stroke or spinal cord injury. Nevertheless these systems are typically ill-suited for widespread adoption due to their size cost and complexity. In this paper a small portable and extremely cost-efficient <;$200 BCI system has been developed using a custom electroencephalographic EEG amplifier array and a commercial microcontroller and touchscreen. The systems performance was tested using a movement-related BCI task in 3 able-bodied subjects with minimal previous BCI experience. Specifically subjects were instructed to alternate between relaxing and dorsiflexing their right foot while their EEG was acquired and analyzed in real-time by the BCI system to decode their underlying movement state. The EEG signals acquired by the custom amplifier array were similar to those acquired by a commercial amplifier maximum correlation coefficient =0.85. During real-time BCI operation the average correlation between instructional cues and decoded BCI states across all subjects =0.70 was comparable to that of full-size BCI systems. Small portable and inexpensive BCI systems such as the one reported here may promote a widespread adoption of BCI-based movement rehabilitation devices in stroke and spinal cord injury populations."
