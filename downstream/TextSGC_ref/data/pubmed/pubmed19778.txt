Cigarette smoking in adolescents is a major public health problem. To address the increasing need for efficacious assessment and treatment methods we developed and tested a novel virtual reality cue reactivity assessment system. A case study of a controlled virtual reality cue reactivity trial with a 17-year-old adolescent cigarette smoker is presented. During the trial the participant was exposed to virtual reality VR smoking cues and VR neutral cues and assessments of subjective craving and skin conductance response SCR were recorded. Upon exposure to VR smoking cues craving increased. A novel methodology for collecting and analyzing SCR in VR was developed and explored to expand the role of physiological variables in VR research. SCR data indicated specific reactions to smoking cue stimuli with the subject experiencing increased reactivity to smoking cues i.e. cigarettes compared to food or drinks. Based on this case study further research using VR cue reactivity assessment in adolescent smokers is warranted. The impact of VR in drug research and future applications in research are also discussed. Virtual reality cue reactivity assessment: a case study in a teen smoker.
