"Image representation methods based on deep convolutional neural networks CNNs have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks such as image retrieval and person re-identification. We recognize that more discriminative feature embeddings can be learned with supervised deep metric learning and handcrafted features for image retrieval and similar applications. In this paper we propose a new supervised deep feature embedding with a handcrafted feature model. To fuse handcrafted feature information into CNNs and realize feature embeddings a general fusion unit is proposed called Fusion-Net. We also define a network loss function with image label information to realize supervised deep metric learning. Our extensive experimental results on the Stanford online products data set and the in-shop clothes retrieval data set demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods of image retrieval by a large margin. Moreover we also explore the applications of the proposed methods in person re-identification and vehicle re-identification; the experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods."
