Neurology especially aphasiology was mainly built on behavioral-structural correlations "lesion method". In this setting Broca\s area has been considered as the "speech area"; moreover this observation led to localizationism. However advances in brain mapping techniques as functional neuroimaging and direct electrical stimulation in patients undergoing awake surgery for gliomas has resulted in a paradigmatic shift regarding models of neural architecture. In fact the brain is organized in distributed complex networks underpinning sensorimotor visuospatial language cognitive and emotional functions. In this connectomal workframe cerebral processing is not conceived as the sum of segregated subfunctions but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel even if partially overlapped subcircuits. Such a networking model taking into account cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints explains interindividual variability in physiology and after brain damage particularly in aphasiology - e.g. double dissociations during electrostimulations as comprehension versus naming disorders semantic versus phonemic paraphasias or syntactic disturbances versus anomia. This dynamic organization mediated by the well-synchronized functioning of delocalized groups of interconnected neurons rather than by discrete centers also explains the huge potential of neuroplasticity following cerebral insult on the condition that the axonal connectivity is preserved. According to this principle massive surgical resection of brain regions dogmatically considered as "critical" in a localisationist view can be achieved with no functional deficit as the removal of Broca\s area - which is not the speech area - without disorders. This connectomal account of neural processing may have major implications in cognitive neurosciences and in therapeutic management of brain-damaged patients. The error of Broca: From the traditional localizationist concept to a connectomal anatomy of human brain.
