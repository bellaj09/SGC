Experimenting in medicine can be accomplished by virtual reality system. VRML is a tool to build virtual object and scenes which can realize static and animated applications in medicine. However to creat a real environment the demanded level of interactivity and dynamics is difficult to achieve. In this paper we describe some approaches and techniques which can realize dynamic 3D. Our demonstration is based on the implementation of a virtual baby model whose character can be accomplished by external JAVA applications. Dynamic VRML for training in medicine.
