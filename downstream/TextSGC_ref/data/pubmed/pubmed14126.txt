Intubation and ventilation impossible mask is a dramatic situation with potentially serious consequences. We report the case of a patient of 43\xa0years followed for a goiter which was scheduled for a total thyroidectomy under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation is not noted signs of compression or tracheal deviation and there were no criteria predictive of intubation or difficult mask ventilation. The induction of anesthesia was standard. Mask ventilation was effective allowing paralysis. The standard laryngoscopy showed a score of Cormack and Lehane grade IV. Several attempts at intubation were made leading to a situation of intubation and ventilation impossible mask with deep desaturation. A tracheostomy was done urgently. The patient was operated on six months later with a fiber optic intubation. Through this case the authors draw attention to the difficulty of achieving an emergency tracheotomy in the presence of goiter and emphasize the need for integration of different modes of learning and retention of management skills of the upper airway. Difficult intubation: should follow the recommendations.
