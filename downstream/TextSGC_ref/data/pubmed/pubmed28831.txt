CMOS-based opto-electronic neural interface devices are presented. The devices are designed with target application of in vitro and in vivo optogenetics. Two types of the opto-electronic neural interface devices are presented. One is single-chip type device for on-chip optogenetics and the other is multi-chip type device with flexibility and wide-area coverage for in vivo optogenetics on brain. Design packaging and functional evaluations are presented. CMOS-based opto-electronic neural interface devices for optogenetics.
