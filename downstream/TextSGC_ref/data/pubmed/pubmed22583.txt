"The usual event-related potential ERP estimation is the average across epochs time-locked on stimuli of interest. These stimuli are repeated several times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio SNR and only one evoked potential is estimated inside the temporal window of interest. Consequently the average estimation does not take into account other neural responses within the same epoch that are due to short inter stimuli intervals. These adjacent neural responses may overlap and distort the evoked potential of interest. This overlapping process is a significant issue for the eye fixation-related potential EFRP technique in which the epochs are time-locked on the ocular fixations. The inter fixation intervals are not experimentally controlled and can be shorter than the neural responses latency. To begin the Tikhonov regularization applied to the classical average estimation was introduced to improve the SNR for a given number of trials. The generalized cross validation was chosen to obtain the optimal value of the ridge parameter. Then to deal with the issue of overlapping the general linear model GLM was used to extract all neural responses inside an epoch. Finally the regularization was also applied to it. The models the classical average and the GLM with and without regularization were compared on both simulated data and real datasets from a visual scene exploration in co-registration with an eye-tracker and from a P300 Speller experiment. The regularization was found to improve the estimation by average for a given number of trials. The GLM was more robust and efficient its efficiency actually reinforced by the regularization."
