OBJECTIVE. The objective of this article is to show how artificial intelligence AI has impacted different components of the imaging value chain thus far as well as to describe its potential future uses. CONCLUSION. The use of AI has the potential to greatly enhance every component of the imaging value chain. From assessing the appropriateness of imaging orders to helping predict patients at risk for fracture AI can increase the value that musculoskeletal imagers provide to their patients and to referring clinicians by improving image quality patient centricity imaging efficiency and diagnostic accuracy.
