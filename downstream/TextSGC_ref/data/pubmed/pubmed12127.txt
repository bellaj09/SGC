Automatic surgical workflow recognition is a key component for developing the context-aware computer-assisted surgery CA-CAS systems. However automatic surgical phase recognition focused on colorectal surgery has not been reported. We aimed to develop a deep learning model for automatic surgical phase recognition based on laparoscopic sigmoidectomy Lap-S videos which could be used for real-time phase recognition and to clarify the accuracies of the automatic surgical phase and action recognitions using visual information. Real-time automatic surgical phase recognition in laparoscopic sigmoidectomy using the convolutional neural network-based deep learning approach.
