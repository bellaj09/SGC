Nearly ten years of research on the feasibility of specific immunotherapy targeting the junctional regions of BCR-ABL has considerably increased our knowledge of which MHC alleles might present BCR-ABL peptides yet has failed to provide us with definite proof of appropriate processing of the hybrid oncoprotein into such antigenic peptides. This paper intends to provide an overview of the current state of affairs as well as to delineate limitations and future directions of this line of research. BCR-ABL directed immunotherapy: a virtual reality?
