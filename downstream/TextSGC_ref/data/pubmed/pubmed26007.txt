Current brain-computer interfaces BCIs that make use of EEG acquisition techniques require unpleasant electrode gel causing skin abrasion during the standard preparation procedure. Electrodes that require tap water instead of electrolytic electrode gel would make both daily setup and clean up much faster easier and comfortable. This paper presents the results from ten subjects that controlled an SSVEP-based BCI speller system using two EEG sensor modalities: water-based and gel-based surface electrodes. Subjects performed in copy spelling mode using conventional gel-based electrodes and water-based electrodes with a mean information transfer rate ITR of 29.68  14.088 bit min-1 and of 26.56  9.224 bit min-1 respectively. A paired t-test failed to reveal significant differences in the information transfer rates and accuracies of using gel- or water-based electrodes for EEG acquisition. This promising result confirms the operational readiness of water-based electrodes for BCI applications. Brain-computer interface using water-based electrodes.
