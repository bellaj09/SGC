Research on brain-machine interfaces has been ongoing for at least a decade. During this period simultaneous recordings of the extracellular electrical activity of hundreds of individual neurons have been used for direct real-time control of various artificial devices. Brain-machine interfaces have also added greatly to our knowledge of the fundamental physiological principles governing the operation of large neural ensembles. Further understanding of these principles is likely to have a key role in the future development of neuroprosthetics for restoring mobility in severely paralysed patients. Principles of neural ensemble physiology underlying the operation of brain-machine interfaces.
