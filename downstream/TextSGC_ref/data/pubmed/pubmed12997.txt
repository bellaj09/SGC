Computational elucidation of membrane protein MP structures is challenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology modeling. Here we describe a high-throughput deep transfer learning method that first predicts MP contacts by learning from non-MPs and then predicts 3D structure models using the predicted contacts as distance restraints. Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs our method has contact prediction accuracy at least 0.18 better than existing methods predicts correct folds for 218 MPs and generates 3D models with root-mean-square deviation RMSD less than 4 and 5\xa0 for 57 and 108 MPs respectively. A rigorous blind test in the continuous automated model evaluation project shows that our method predicted high-resolution 3D models for two recent test MPs of 210 residues with RMSD 2\xa0. We estimated that our method could predict correct folds for 1345-1871 reviewed human multi-pass MPs including a few hundred new folds which shall facilitate the discovery of drugs targeting at MPs.
