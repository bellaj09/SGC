We propose a multi-view data analysis approach using radiomics and dosiomics R&D texture features for predicting acute-phase weight loss WL in lung cancer radiotherapy. Baseline weight of 388 patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT was measured between 1 month prior to and 1 week after the start of IMRT. Weight change between 1 week and 2 months after the commencement of IMRT was analyzed and dichotomized at 5% WL. Each Patient had a planning CT and contours of gross tumor volume GTV and esophagus ESO. A total of 355 features including clinical parameter CP GTV and ESO GTV&ESO dose-volume histogram DVH GTV radiomics and GTV&ESO dosiomics features were extracted. R&D features were categorized as first- L1 second- L2 higher-order L3 statistics and three combined groups L1+L2 L2+L3 and L1+L2+L3. Multi-view texture analysis was performed to identify optimal R&D input features. In the training set 194 earlier patients feature selection was performed using Boruta algorithm followed by collinearity removal based on variance inflation factor. Machine-learning models were developed using Laplacian kernel support vector machine lpSVM deep neural network DNN and their averaged ensemble classifiers. Prediction performance was tested on an independent test set 194 more recent patients and compared among 7 different input conditions: CP-only DVH-only R&D-only DVH+CP R&D+CP R&D+DVH and R&D+DVH+CP. Combined GTV L1+L2+L3 radiomics and GTV&ESO L3 dosiomics were identified as optimal input features which achieved the best performance with an ensemble classifier AUC=0.710 having statiscially significantly higher predictability compared with DVH and/or CP features p<0.05. When this performance was compared to that with full R&D-only features which reflect traditional single-view data there was a statistically significant difference p<0.05. Using optimized multi-view R&D input features is beneficial for predicting early WL in lung cancer radiotherapy leading to improved performance compared to using conventional DVH and/or CP features.
