BACKGROUND: The perception-action coupling task PACT was designed as a more ecologically valid measure of alertness/reaction times compared to currently used measures by aerospace researchers. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability within-subject variability and systematic bias associated with the PACT.METHODS: There were 16 subjects men/women = 9 / 7; age = 27.8  3.6 yr who completed 4 identical testing sessions. The PACT requires subjects to make judgements on whether a virtual ball could fit into an aperture. For each session subjects completed nine cycles of the PACT with each cycle lasting 5 min. Judgement accuracy and reaction time parameters were calculated for each cycle. Systematic bias was assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients ICC and within-subject variability with coefficients of variation CVTE.RESULTS: Initiation time Mean = 0.1065 s showed the largest systematic bias requiring the elimination of three cycles to reduce bias with all other variables requiring at the most one. All variables showed acceptable reliability ICC > 0.70 and within-subject variability CVTE < 20% with only one cycle after elimination of the first three cycles.CONCLUSIONS: With a three-cycle familiarization period the PACT was found to be reliable and stable.Connaboy C Johnson CD LaGoy AD Pepping G-J Simpson RJ Deng Z Ma L Bower JL Eagle SR Flanagan SD Alfano CA.
