The exponential increase of medical information creates a need for new methods in the visualization of medical imaging modalities for diagnosis and therapy. In this sense visualization includes the display of medical image data and image-guided stereotaxic navigation as well as the advice of an expert. The Artma Virtual Patient System enables a remote expert to observe the surgical procedure via the Internet and interactively modify the interoperative visualization from the remote location. The expert in the remote location receives the planning data almost in real time over TCP/IP from a stereotaxic videoserver. In addition to live video streaming stereotaxic navigation data are sent over the network as rigid body coordinates. The expert modifies the surgical simulation on the remote computer and the modified operating plan is sent back to the operating site. By teleconsulting the composite images and overlapping graphics--instruments target structures landmarks contour--can be seen in affiliated clinics with the possibility of interactive graphical assistance. With this image fusion technology the knowledge of a remote expert is included in virtual data structures and visualized by the overlay with live video data augmented reality in real time during surgery. Telenavigation and expert consultation using a stereotaxic surgical videoserver.
