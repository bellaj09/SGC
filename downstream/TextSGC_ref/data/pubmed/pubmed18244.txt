To date poor treatment options are available for patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia CPT a pediatric orphan disease. In this study we have performed an in silico clinical trial on 200 virtual subjects generated from a previously established model of murine bone regeneration to tackle the challenges associated with the small pediatric patient population. Each virtual subject was simulated to receive no treatment and bone morphogenetic protein BMP treatment. We have shown that the degree of severity of CPT is significantly reduced with BMP treatment although the effect is highly subject-specific. Using machine learning techniques we were also able to stratify the virtual subject population in adverse responders non-responders responders and asymptomatic. In summary this study shows the potential of in silico medicine technologies as well as their implications for other orphan diseases. In silico clinical trials for pediatric orphan diseases.
