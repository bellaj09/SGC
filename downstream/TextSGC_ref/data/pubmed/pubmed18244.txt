Virtual reality VR is demonstrating increasing potential for therapeutic benefit in elderly care but it is still generally considered to be the domain of the visually unimpaired. Even where VR and augmented reality AR are being explored for use with low vision it is generally with a focus on creating bespoke software and hardware. However the properties of commercial off-the-shelf COTS headsets such as high luminance may render them accessible even to very low vision users. Using a case-study approach we explored the differences in visual perception from baseline to pass-through AR and commercial VR applications for an elderly female Mrs. M with advanced age-related macular degeneration. We found notable improvements in object face and color recognition particularly with higher display brightness. Furthermore Mrs. M was able to engage fully and enthusiastically with a number of unmodified VR applications providing detailed descriptions of both static and moving elements. We suggest that the high luminance available in COTS VR may support more stable fixation closer to the fovea improving visual resolution. Furthermore the improvements we noted in color perception support previous suggestions that increasing luminance may improve photosensitivity by reducing the uptake of limited oxygen by the rod cells. We conclude that low vision should not automatically preclude users from engaging in VR research or entertainment and that they may be able to use well-illuminated VR applications without any special modifications.
