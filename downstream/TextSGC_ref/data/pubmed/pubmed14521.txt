Phytoplankton species identification and counting is a crucial step of water quality assessment. Especially drinking water reservoirs bathing and ballast water need to be regularly monitored for harmful species. In times of multiple environmental threats like eutrophication climate warming and introduction of invasive species more intensive monitoring would be helpful to develop adequate measures. However traditional methods such as microscopic counting by experts or high throughput flow cytometry based on scattering and fluorescence signals are either too time-consuming or inaccurate for species identification tasks. The combination of high qualitative microscopy with high throughput and latest development in machine learning techniques can overcome this hurdle. Combining high-throughput imaging flow cytometry and deep learning for efficient species and life-cycle stage identification of phytoplankton.
