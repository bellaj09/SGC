Automatic emotion recognition is one of the most challenging tasks. To detect emotion from nonstationary EEG signals a sophisticated learning algorithm that can represent high-level abstraction is required. This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network DLN to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder SAE using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem principal component analysis PCA is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLN is capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52% and 46.03% respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55% and 6.53%. Moreover DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.
