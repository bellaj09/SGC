Recent understanding that the brain at rest does not remain in a single state but transiently visits multiple states emphasizes the importance of state changes embedded in the brain network. Due to the effectiveness of larger networks in characterizing brain states there is an increasing need for a network-based change point detection method that is applicable to large-size networks particularly those with longer time series. This paper presents a fast and efficient method for detecting change points in the large-size functional networks of resting-state fMRI. To detect change points a statistic for the covariance change at each time point is tested by a local false discovery rate estimated based on the empirical null principle using a semiparametric mixture model. We present simulations and empirical analyses of task-based and resting-state fMRI data sets with various network sizes up to 300 nodes selected from the Human Connectome Project database. We demonstrate that the proposed method is not only efficient in detecting change points in large samples of large-size networks but also is less sensitive to the window size selection and provides the consequent identification of the changed edges. The covariance-based change point detection method in this study would be very useful in exploring characteristics of dynamic states in long-term large-size resting-state brain networks.
