Brain-computer interface-based communication plays an important role in brain-computer interface BCI applications; electronic mail is one of the most common communication tools. In this study we propose a hybrid BCI-based mail client that implements electronic mail communication by means of real-time classification of multimodal features extracted from scalp electroencephalography EEG. With this BCI mail client users can receive read write and attach files to their mail. Using a BCI mouse that utilizes hybrid brain signals that is motor imagery and P300 potential the user can select and activate the function keys and links on the mail client graphical user interface GUI. An adaptive P300 speller is employed for text input. The system has been tested with 6 subjects and the experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method.
