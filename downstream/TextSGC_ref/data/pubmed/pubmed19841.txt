"RGB displays effectively simulate millions of colors in the eyes of humans by modulating the relative amount of light emitted by 3 differently colored juxtaposed lights red green and blue. The relationship between the ratio of red green and blue light and the perceptual experience of that light has been well defined by psychophysical experiments in humans but is unknown in animals. The perceptual experience of an animal looking at an RGB display of imagery designed for humans is likely to poorly represent an animals experience of the same stimulus in the real world. This is due in part to the fact that many animals have different numbers of photoreceptor classes than humans do and that their photoreceptor classes have peak sensitivities centered over different parts of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum. However it is sometimes possible to generate videos that accurately mimic natural stimuli in the eyes of another animal even if that animals sensitivity extends into the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. How independently each RGB phosphor stimulates each of an animals photoreceptor classes determines the range of colors that can be simulated for that animal. What is required to determine optimal color rendering for another animal is a device capable of measuring absolute or relative quanta of light across the portion of the spectrum visible to the animal i.e. a spectrometer and data on the spectral sensitivities of the animals photoreceptor classes. In this article we outline how to use such equipment and information to generate video stimuli that mimic as closely as possible an animals color perceptual experience of real-world objects.
