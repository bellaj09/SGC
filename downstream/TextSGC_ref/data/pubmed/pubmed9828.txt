Compressive sensing CS has proved effective for tomographic reconstruction from sparsely collected data or under-sampled measurements which are practically important for few-view computed tomography CT tomosynthesis interior tomography and so on. To perform sparse-data CT the iterative reconstruction commonly uses regularizers in the CS framework. Currently how to choose the parameters adaptively for regularization is a major open problem. In this paper inspired by the idea of machine learning especially deep learning we unfold the state-of-the-art "fields of experts"-based iterative reconstruction scheme up to a number of iterations for data-driven training construct a learned experts\ assessment-based reconstruction network LEARN for sparse-data CT and demonstrate the feasibility and merits of our LEARN network. The experimental results with our proposed LEARN network produces a superior performance with the well-known Mayo Clinic low-dose challenge data set relative to the several state-of-the-art methods in terms of artifact reduction feature preservation and computational speed. This is consistent to our insight that because all the regularization terms and parameters used in the iterative reconstruction are now learned from the training data our LEARN network utilizes application-oriented knowledge more effectively and recovers underlying images more favorably than competing algorithms. Also the number of layers in the LEARN network is only 50 reducing the computational complexity of typical iterative algorithms by orders of magnitude.
