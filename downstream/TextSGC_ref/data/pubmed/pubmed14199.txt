This study provides an overview of the perceptions of alumni in relation to their experience of open-book examinations OBEs as post-graduate students. This type of assessment was introduced as a way of allowing these adult learners to demonstrate their conceptual understanding and ability to apply knowledge in practice which in theory would equip them with problem-solving skills required for the workplace. This study demonstrates that alumni-shown to be predominantly deep learners-typically regarded OBEs as less stressful than closed-book examinations and as an effective way to assess the application of knowledge to real-life problems. Additional staff training and student induction particularly for international students are suggested as a means of improving the acceptability and effectiveness of OBEs. Value and benefits of open-book examinations as assessment for deep learning in a post-graduate animal health course.
