"In clinical practice invasiveness is an important reference indicator for differentiating the malignant degree of subsolid pulmonary nodules. These nodules can be classified as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia AAH adenocarcinoma in situ AIS minimally invasive adenocarcinoma MIA or invasive adenocarcinoma IAC. The automatic determination of a nodules invasiveness based on chest CT scans can guide treatment planning. However it is challenging owing to the insufficiency of training data and their interclass similarity and intraclass variation. To address these challenges we propose a two-stage deep learning strategy for this task: prior-feature learning followed by adaptive-boost deep learning." Feature-shared adaptive-boost deep learning for invasiveness classification of pulmonary subsolid nodules in CT images.
