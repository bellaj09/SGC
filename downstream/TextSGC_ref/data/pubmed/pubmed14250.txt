While single cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq is invaluable for studying cell populations cell-surface proteins are often integral markers of cellular function and serve as primary targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we propose a transfer learning framework single cell Transcriptome to Protein prediction with deep neural network cTP-net to impute surface protein abundances from scRNA-seq data by learning from existing single-cell multi-omic resources. Surface protein imputation from single cell transcriptomes by deep neural networks.
