Syndromic genetic conditions in aggregate affect 8% of the population1. Many syndromes have recognizable facial features2 that are highly informative to clinical geneticists3-5. Recent studies show that facial analysis technologies measured up to the capabilities of expert clinicians in syndrome identification6-9. However these technologies identified only a few disease phenotypes limiting their role in clinical settings where hundreds of diagnoses must be considered. Here we present a facial image analysis framework DeepGestalt using computer vision and deep-learning algorithms that quantifies similarities to hundreds of syndromes. DeepGestalt outperformed clinicians in three initial experiments two with the goal of distinguishing subjects with a target syndrome from other syndromes and one of separating different genetic subtypes in Noonan syndrome. On the final experiment reflecting a real clinical setting problem DeepGestalt achieved 91% top-10 accuracy in identifying the correct syndrome on 502 different images. The model was trained on a dataset of over 17000 images representing more than 200 syndromes curated through a community-driven phenotyping platform. DeepGestalt potentially adds considerable value to phenotypic evaluations in clinical genetics genetic testing research and precision medicine.
