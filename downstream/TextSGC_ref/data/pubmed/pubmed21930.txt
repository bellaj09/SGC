As we explore the use of consumer virtual reality technology for training applications there is a need to evaluate its validity compared to more traditional training formats. In this paper we present a study that compares the effectiveness of virtual training and physical training for teaching a bimanual assembly task. In a between-subjects experiment 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions training was delivered via paper- and video-based instructions with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition in which physical blocks were available during training for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times. Performance in retention tests two weeks after training was generally not as good as expected for all experimental conditions. We discuss the implications of the results and highlight the validity of virtual reality systems in training. A Comparison of Virtual and Physical Training Transfer of Bimanual Assembly Tasks.
