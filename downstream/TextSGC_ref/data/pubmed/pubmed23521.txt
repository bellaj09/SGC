The Self Powered Human Centrifuge or Space Cycle is a countermeasure to the adverse physiologic effects of prolonged human exposure to spaceflight microgravity. This unique device simultaneously provides exercise impact loading and gravity analogous acceleration to emulate conditions on Earth. One or two crewmembers pedal themselves about a shaft mounted to the space craft located "above" their heads. This creates a short arm centrifuge with a head-to-toe acceleration orientation. The potential advantages of the Space Cycle include: a reversal of cephalad fluid shift minimizing post flight orthostatic intolerance; b pedaling to maintain muscular and cardiovascular fitness; and c enhancement of skeletal homeostasis by impact loading with a pedal-crank mounted cam and frame mounted resistive device. Other anticipated advantages include generation of usable electricity physiologic monitoring and a means of mass measurement. Motion sickness is controlled with restraints and virtual reality headsets. The device is compatible with International Space Station dimensional constraints.
