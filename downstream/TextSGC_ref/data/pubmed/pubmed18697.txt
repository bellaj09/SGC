The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of homonymous visual field defects HVFDs on collision avoidance of dynamic obstacles at an intersection under virtual reality VR conditions. Overall performance was quantitatively assessed as the number of collisions at a virtual intersection at two difficulty levels. HVFDs were assessed by binocular semi-automated kinetic perimetry within the 90 visual field stimulus III4e and the area of sparing within the affected hemifield A-SPAR in deg2 was calculated. The effect of A-SPAR age gender side of brain lesion time since brain lesion and presence of macular sparing on the number of collisions as well as performance over time were investigated. Thirty patients 10 female 20 male age range: 19-71 years with HVFDs due to unilateral vascular brain lesions and 30 group-age-matched subjects with normal visual fields were examined. The mean number of collisions was higher for patients and in the more difficult level they experienced more collisions with vehicles approaching from the blind side than the seeing side. Lower A-SPAR and increasing age were associated with decreasing performance. However in agreement with previous studies wide variability in performance among patients with identical visual field defects was observed and performance of some patients was similar to that of normal subjects. Both patients and healthy subjects displayed equal improvement of performance over time in the more difficult level. In conclusion our results suggest that visual-field related parameters per se are inadequate in predicting successful collision avoidance. Individualized approaches which also consider compensatory strategies by means of eye and head movements should be introduced.
