Clustering is concerned with coherently grouping observations without any explicit concept of true groupings. Spectral graph clustering-clustering the vertices of a graph based on their spectral embedding-is commonly approached via K-means or more generally Gaussian mixture model clustering composed with either Laplacian spectral embedding LSE or adjacency spectral embedding ASE. Recent theoretical results provide deeper understanding of the problem and solutions and lead us to a "two-truths" LSE vs. ASE spectral graph clustering phenomenon convincingly illustrated here via a diffusion MRI connectome dataset: The different embedding methods yield different clustering results with LSE capturing left hemisphere/right hemisphere affinity structure and ASE capturing gray matter/white matter core-periphery structure.
