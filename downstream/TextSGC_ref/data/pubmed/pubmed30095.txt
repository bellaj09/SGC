Decades of technological developments have populated the field of neuroprosthetics with myriad replacement strategies neuromodulation therapies and rehabilitation procedures to improve the quality of life for individuals with neuromotor disorders. Despite the few but impressive clinical successes and multiple breakthroughs in animal models neuroprosthetic technologies remain mainly confined to sophisticated laboratory environments. We summarize the core principles and latest achievements in neuroprosthetics but also address the challenges that lie along the path toward clinical fruition. We propose a pragmatic framework to personalize neurotechnologies and rehabilitation for patient-specific impairments to achieve the timely dissemination of neuroprosthetic medicine. Personalized neuroprosthetics.
