"Steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs can provide relatively easy reliable and high speed communication. However the performance is still not satisfactory especially in some users who are not able to generate strong enough SSVEP signals. This work aims to strengthen a users SSVEP by alpha down-regulating neurofeedback training NFT and consequently improve the performance of the user in using SSVEP-based BCIs." Alpha neurofeedback training improves SSVEP-based BCI performance.
