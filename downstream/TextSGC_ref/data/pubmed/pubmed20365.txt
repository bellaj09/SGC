The tripartite model of anxiety includes three response domains: cognitive most often identified by self report behavioral and physiological. Each is suggested to bring a separate element of response characteristics and in some cases potentially independent underlying mechanisms to the construct of anxiety. In this chapter commonly used behavioral correlates of anxiety in human research including startle reflex attentional bias and avoidance tasks as well as future tasks using virtual reality technology will be discussed. The focus will be in evaluating their translational utility supported by 1 convergent validity with other measures of anxiety traits or anxiety disorders 2 their use in identifying neural and genetic mechanisms of anxiety and 3 ability to predict treatment efficacy. Behavioral correlates of anxiety.
