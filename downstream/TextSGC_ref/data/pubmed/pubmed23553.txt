"Video game technology is changing from 2D to 3D and virtual reality VR graphics. In this research we analyze how an identical video game that is either played in a 2D stereoscopic 3D or Head-Mounted-Display HMD VR version is experienced by the players and how brands that are placed in the video game are affected. The game related variables which are analyzed are presence attitude towards the video game and arousal while playing the video game. Brand placement related variables are attitude towards the placed brands and memory recall and recognition for the placed brands. 237 players took part in the main study and played a jumpnrun game consisting of three levels. Results indicate that presence was higher in the HMD VR than in the stereoscopic 3D than in the 2D video game but neither arousal nor attitude towards the video game differed. Memory for the placed brands was lower in the HMD VR than in the stereoscopic 3D than in the 2D video game whereas attitudes towards the brands were not affected. A post hoc study n = 53 shows that cognitive load was highest in the VR game and lowest in the 3D game. Subjects reported higher levels of dizziness and motion-sickness in the VR game than in the 3D and in the 2D game. Limitations are addressed and implications for researchers marketers and video game developers are outlined."
