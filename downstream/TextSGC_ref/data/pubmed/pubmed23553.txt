We previously developed a system with which we have created more than 100 virtual cancer images from CT or MR data of individual patients with cancer Cancer Edutainment Virtual Reality Theater: CEVRT. These images can be used to help explain procedures findings etc. to the patient to obtain informed consent to simulate surgery and to estimate cancer invasion to surrounding organs. We recently developed a web-based object-oriented database both to access these cancer images and to register medical images at international research sites via the Internet. In this report we introduce an international medical VR data warehouse created using an object-oriented database. Virtual cancer image data warehouse.
