"Midbrain dopaminergic neurons MDN represent 0.0005% of the brains neuronal population and mediate cognition food intake and metabolism. MDN are also posited to underlay the neurobiological dysfunction of schizophrenia SCZ a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by psychosis as well as multifactorial medical co-morbidities including metabolic disease contributing to markedly increased morbidity and mortality. Paradoxically however the genetic risk sequences of psychosis and traits associated with metabolic disease such as body mass show very limited overlap." A chromosomal connectome for psychiatric and metabolic risk variants in adult dopaminergic neurons.
