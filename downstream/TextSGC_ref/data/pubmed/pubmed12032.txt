Text mining has become an important tool for biomedical research. The most fundamental text-mining task is the recognition of biomedical named entities NER such as genes chemicals and diseases. Current NER methods rely on pre-defined features which try to capture the specific surface properties of entity types properties of the typical local context background knowledge and linguistic information. State-of-the-art tools are entity-specific as dictionaries and empirically optimal feature sets differ between entity types which makes their development costly. Furthermore features are often optimized for a specific gold standard corpus which makes extrapolation of quality measures difficult. Deep learning with word embeddings improves biomedical named entity recognition.
