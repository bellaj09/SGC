Beta oscillations 13 to 30 Hz have been observed during many perceptual cognitive and motor processes in a plethora of brain recording studies. Although the function of beta oscillations hereafter "beta" for short is unlikely to be explained by any single monolithic description we here discuss several convergent findings. In prefrontal cortex PFC increased beta appears at the end of a trial when working memory information needs to be erased. A similar "clear-out" function might apply during the stopping of action and the stopping of long-term memory retrieval stopping thoughts where increased prefrontal beta is also observed. A different apparent role for beta in PFC occurs during the delay period of working memory tasks: it might serve to maintain the current contents and/or to prevent interference from distraction. We confront the challenge of relating these observations to the large literature on beta recorded from sensorimotor cortex. Potentially the clear-out of working memory in PFC has its counterpart in the postmovement clear-out of the motor plan in sensorimotor cortex. However recent studies support alternative interpretations. In addition we flag emerging research on different frequencies of beta and the relationship between beta and single-neuron spiking. We also discuss where beta might be generated: basal ganglia cortex or both. We end by considering the clinical implications for adaptive deep-brain stimulation.
