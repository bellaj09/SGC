"Mechanisms underlying the self/other distinction have been mainly investigated focusing on visual tactile or proprioceptive cues whereas very little is known about the contribution of acoustical information. Here the ability to distinguish between self and others voice is investigated by using a neuropsychological approach. Right RBD and left brain damaged LBD patients and healthy controls were submitted to a voice discrimination and a voice recognition task. Stimuli were paired words/pseudowords pronounced by the participant by a familiar or unfamiliar person. In the voice discrimination task participants had to judge whether two voices were same or different whereas in the voice recognition task participants had to judge whether their own voice was or was not present. Crucially differences between patient groups were found. In the discrimination task only RBD patients were selectively impaired when their own voice was present. By contrast in the recognition task both RBD and LBD patients were impaired and showed two different biases: RBD patients misattributed the others voice to themselves while LBD patients denied the ownership of their own voice. Thus two kinds of bias can affect self-voice recognition: we can refuse self-stimuli voice disownership or we can misidentify others stimuli as our own embodiment of others voice. Overall these findings reflect different impairments in self/other distinction both at behavioral and anatomical level the right hemisphere being involved in voice discrimination and both hemispheres in the voice identity explicit recognition. The finding of selective brain networks dedicated to processing ones own voice demonstrates the relevance of self-related acoustic information in bodily self-representation."
