It is known that non-clinical subjects with high levels of schizotypal personality traits High-S as well as schizophrenic patients have difficulties to judge how a scene would appear so-called Appearance questions from a point of view other than their own after having performed a disembodied perspective taking D-PT a mental self-rotation cued by an object like a chair. This inability has been defined allocentric simulation deficit. However it is still unclear whether this inability might also regard an embodied transformation E-PT which is a self-rotation cued by another individual in the scene and whether the observed deficit regards the pure mental transformation phase. In the present study we took advantage of a virtual reality environment to explore both embodied and disembodied allocentric simulation in healthy volunteers with low and high levels of schizotypal personality traits as assessed by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. All subjects performed a pure self-rotation cued by a chair D-PT or by an avatar E-PT or a control array rotation. Each rotation was followed by classical Appearance and Item questions. Results revealed no between-groups differences in the mental transformation phase while High-S subjects were significantly slower than Low-S subjects in the Appearance task after D-PT but not after E-PT. Accordingly higher schizotypy levels cognitive-perceptual subscale were positively correlated with slower reaction times in the Appearance task after D-PT. These data suggest the existence of a disembodied allocentric simulation deficit in non-clinical High-S paving the way to future studies on clinical populations.
