Recent advancements in brain computer interfaces BCI have demonstrated control of robotic systems by mental processes alone. Together with invasive BCI electroencephalographic EEG BCI represent an important direction in the development of BCI systems. In the context of EEG BCI the processing of EEG data is the key challenge. Unfortunately advances in that direction have been complicated by a lack of large and uniform datasets that could be used to design and evaluate different data processing approaches. In this work we release a large set of EEG BCI data collected during the development of a slow cortical potentials-based EEG BCI. The dataset contains 60\u2009h of EEG recordings 13 participants 75 recording sessions 201 individual EEG BCI interaction session-segments and over 60\u2009000 examples of motor imageries in 4 interaction paradigms. The current dataset presents one of the largest EEG BCI datasets publically available to date. A large electroencephalographic motor imagery dataset for electroencephalographic brain computer interfaces.
