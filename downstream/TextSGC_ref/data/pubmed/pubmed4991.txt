"Network connectivity fingerprints are among todays best choices to obtain a faithful sampling of an individuals brain and cognition. Widely available MRI scanners can provide rich information tapping into network recruitment and reconfiguration that now scales to hundreds and thousands of humans. Here we contemplate the advantages of analysing such connectome profiles using Bayesian strategies. These analysis techniques afford full probability estimates of the studied network coupling phenomena provide analytical machinery to separate epistemological uncertainty and biological variability in a coherent manner usher us towards avenues to go beyond binary statements on existence versus non-existence of an effect and afford credibility estimates around all model parameters at play which thus enable single-subject predictions with rigorous uncertainty intervals. We illustrate the brittle boundary between healthy and diseased brain circuits by autism spectrum disorder as a recurring theme where we argue network-based approaches in neuroscience will require careful probabilistic answers. This article is part of the theme issue Unifying the essential concepts of biological networks: biological insights and philosophical foundations." Analysing brain networks in population neuroscience: a case for the Bayesian philosophy.
