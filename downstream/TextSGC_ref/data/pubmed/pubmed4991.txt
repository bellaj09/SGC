Researchers believe that recognition of functional impairment in some of brain networks such as frontal-parietal default mode network DMN anterior medial prefrontal cortex MPFC and striatal structures could be a beneficial biomarker for diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. Although it is well recognized brain functional connectome in OCD patients shows changes debate still remains on characteristics of the changes. In this regard little has been done so far to statistically assess the altered pattern using whole brain electroencephalography. In this study resting state EEG data of 39 outpatients with OCD and 19 healthy controls HC were recorded. After brain functional network was estimated from the cleaned EEG data using the weighted phase lag index algorithm. Output matrices of OCD group and HCs were then statistically compared to represent meaningful differences. Significant differences in functional connectivity pattern were demonstrated in several regions. As expected the most significant changes were observed in frontal cortex more significant in frontal-temporal connections between F3 and F7 and T5 regions. These results in OCD patients are consistent with previous studies and confirm the role of frontal and temporal brain regions in OCD.
