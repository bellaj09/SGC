Ribosome profiling brings insight to the process of translation. A basic step in profile construction at transcript level is to map Ribo-seq data to transcripts and then assign a huge number of multiple-mapped reads to similar isoforms. Existing methods either discard the multiple mapped-reads or allocate them randomly or assign them proportionally according to transcript abundance estimated from RNA-seq data.
