Adults aging with HIV are at risk for poorer neurocognitive and daily functioning. Identifying factors to protect such outcomes is a significant research priority. The aim of this study was to explore the role of resilience in cognitive and everyday functioning in a largely African American and low socioeconomic status sample of adults and older adults with HIV in the Deep South. Resilience attenuates the association between neurocognitive functioning and everyday functioning in individuals aging with HIV in the Deep South.
