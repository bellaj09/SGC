"Although the functional connectivity of patients with disorders of consciousness DOC has been widely examined less is known about brain white matter connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore structural network alterations for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with chronic DOC. Eleven DOC patients and 11 sex- and age-matched controls were included in the study. Participants underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI and T1-weighted structural MRI at 7 tesla 7\u202fT. Graph-theoretical analysis and network-based statistics were used to analyze the group differences. Two patients were scanned twice for a longitudinal study to examine the relationship between connectome metrics and the patients prognoses. Compared with healthy controls DOC patients showed significantly elevated transitivity p\u202f<\u202f.001 local efficiency p\u202f=\u202f.009 and clustering coefficient p\u202f=\u202f.039. When comparing the connectome metrics within the three groups healthy controls minimally conscious state MCS and vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome VS/UWS significant group differences were observed in transitivity p\u202f<\u202f.001 and local efficiency p\u202f=\u202f.031. Significantly increased transitivity was observed in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome compared with minimally conscious state p\u202f=\u202f.0217 Bonferroni corrected. Transitivity showed significant negative correlations with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score r\u202f=\u202f-0.6902 p\u202f=\u202f.023 consistent with the longitudinal study results. A subnetwork with significantly decreased structural connections was identified using network-based statistical analysis comparing DOC patients with healthy controls which was mainly located in the frontal cortex limbic system and occipital and parietal lobes. This preliminary study suggests that graph theoretical approaches for assessing white matter connectivity may enable various states of DOC to be distinguished. Of the metrics analyzed transitivity had a critical role in distinguishing the diagnostic groups. Larger cohorts will be necessary to confirm the predictive value of 7\u202fT MRI in the prognosis of DOC patients."
