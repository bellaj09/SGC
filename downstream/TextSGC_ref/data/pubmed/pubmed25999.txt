To ensure patient safety and surgical efficiency much emphasis has been placed on the training of laparoscopic skills using virtual reality simulators. The purpose of this study was to determine whether laparoscopic skills can be objectively quantified by measuring specific skill parameters during training in a virtual reality surgical simulator VRSS. Can the learning of laparoscopic skills be quantified by the measurements of skill parameters performed in a virtual reality simulator?
