It is important to construct rehabilitation system for elderly people people who have suffered strokes and so on. In recent years the need for rehabilitation support systems is increasing that using force display devices. When using force display systems it is most important to ensure safety mechanically in order to prevent operators from hurting. Conventional force display systems are active-type devices with actuators but these devices may become dangerous when going out of control. On the other hand passive-type force display devices with only passive elements are thought to be an effective method for assuring inherent safety. In this paper we evaluate force display ability about a 2-D passive-type force display device with fast-response MR Magneto-Rheological fluid brakes to apply this device to rehabilitation training. Passive-type rehabilitation systems for upper limbs with MR fluid brake and its training software.
