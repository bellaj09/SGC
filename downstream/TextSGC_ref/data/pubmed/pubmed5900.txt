Computer graphic images CGI can be manufactured very similar to natural images NI by state-of-the-art algorithms in computer graphic filed. Thus there are various identification algorithms proposed to detect CGI. However the manipulation is complicated and difficult for an ultimate CGI against the forensic algorithms. Further the forensics on CGI and NI made achievements in the different aspects with the encouragement of deep learning. Though the generated CGI can achieve high quality automatically by generative adversarial networks GAN CGI generation based on GAN is difficult to ensure that it cannot be detected by forensics. In this paper we propose a brief and effective architecture based on GAN for preventing the generated images being detected under the forensics on CGI and NI. The adapted characteristics will make the CGI generated by GAN fools the detector and keep the end-to-end generation mode of GAN. An anti-forensic scheme on computer graphic images and natural images using generative adversarial networks.
