Abnormalities in structural and functional brain connectivity have been increasingly reported in patients with bipolar disorder BD. However alterations of remitted BD RBD in functional connectivity between the cerebral hemispheres are still not well understood. This study was designed to analyze the pattern of the interhemispheric functional connectivity of the whole brain in patients with remitted BD during resting state. Twenty patients with RBD and 38 healthy controls HC underwent the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity between any pair of symmetrical interhemispheric voxels i.e. functional homotopy was measured by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity VMHC. The patients with RBD showed lower VMHC than HC in the middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. No regions of increased VMHC were detected in the RBD patients. There were no significant correlations between the VMHC values in these regions and the clinical variables. These findings suggest substantial impairment of interhemispheric coordination in RBD and they may represent trait rather than state neurobiological feature of brain function in BD.
