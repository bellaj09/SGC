An appropriate localization of ictal onset zone in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy favors an adequate outcome associated with surgical treatment. When video-electroencephalogram video-EEG and magnetic resonance imaging do not provide accurate data to locate ictal onset zone the use of subdural or deep intracranial electrodes is indicated. Hippocampal electrode placement could generate functional changes in an unaffected hippocampus. Changes in verbal and nonverbal memory associated with bilateral hippocampal electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery.
