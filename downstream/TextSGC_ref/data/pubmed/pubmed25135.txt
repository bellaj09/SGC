Intradialytic exercise can improve physical function and health-related quality of life HRQoL in hemodialysis HD patients but is not implemented in routine clinical practice. Virtual reality VR exercise has resulted in benefits in non-dialysis contexts but implementation in HD patients has been limited. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of VR present the results of a 12-week intradialytic VR exercise intervention and compare VR to conventional exercise. The secondary aim was to review the effect of VR exercise during the last 30\xa0minutes of the HD session on hemodynamic stability. We conclude that VR exercise during HD is safe and can improve physical function and HRQoL and can be performed safely toward the end of the HD session.
