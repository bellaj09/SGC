Psychosis is hypothesized to occur on a spectrum between psychotic disorders and healthy individuals. In the middle of the spectrum are individuals who endorse psychotic-like experiences PLEs that may not impact daily functioning or cause distress. Individuals with PLEs show alterations in both cognitive ability and functional connectivity of several brain networks but the relationship between PLEs cognition and functional networks remains poorly understood. Cingulo-opercular network efficiency mediates the association between psychotic-like experiences and cognitive ability in the general population.
