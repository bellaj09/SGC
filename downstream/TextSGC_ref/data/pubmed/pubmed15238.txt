Purpose The job of secondary school teachers involves a lot of head down posture as frequent reading assignment correction computer use and writing on a board put them at risk of developing occupational related neck pain. Available studies of neck pain experienced by teachers are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether training of deep cervical flexor muscles with pressure biofeedback has any significant advantage over conventional training for pain and disability experienced by school teachers with neck pain. Subjects Thirty teachers aged 25-45 years with neck pain and poor craniocervical flexion test participated in this study. Methods A pretest posttest experimental group design was used in which experimental group has received training with pressure biofeedback and conventional exercises while control group received conventional exercises only. Measurements of dependent variables were taken at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of training. Pain intensity was assessed using a numeric pain rating scale and functional disability was assessed using the neck disability index. Results The data analysis revealed that there was significant improvement in pain and disability in both the groups and the results were better in the experimental group. Conclusion Addition of pressure biofeedback for deep cervical flexor muscles training gave a better result than conventional exercises alone. Feedback helps motor learning which is the set of processes associated with practice or experience leading to permanent changes in ability to respond. Effect of deep cervical flexor muscles training using pressure biofeedback on pain and disability of school teachers with neck pain.
