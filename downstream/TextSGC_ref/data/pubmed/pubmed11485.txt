In assessing the severity of age-related macular degeneration AMD the Age-Related Eye Disease Study AREDS Simplified Severity Scale predicts the risk of progression to late AMD. However its manual use requires the time-consuming participation of expert practitioners. Although several automated deep learning systems have been developed for classifying color fundus photographs CFP of individual eyes by AREDS severity score none to date has used a patient-based scoring system that uses images from both eyes to assign a severity score.
