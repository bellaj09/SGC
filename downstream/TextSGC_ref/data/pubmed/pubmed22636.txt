Hysteroscopy has already become an irreplaceable method in gynaecoloic diagnosis and therapy. In the diagnostic case the hysteroscope with a 30 degrees optic is insert transvaginally in the therapeutic case the resectoscope with a 12 degrees optic is used. The endoscopic intervention requires special surgical skills for endoscope handling and remote instrument control. To acquire these skills currently hands-on training in clinical praxis has become standard which is linked with higher danger for the women. To overcome current drawbacks of traditional training methods the European project LAHYSTOTRAIN was set up that tries to combine Virtual Reality VR Multimedia MM technology and Intelligent Tutoring Systems ITS to develop an alternative training system for hysteroscopic interventions. The first prototype of the LAHYSTOTRAIN demonstrator has been shown on several European conferences. An evaluation of the system was performed with the idea to collect feedback and impressions that should be considered in further developments. This paper presents the LAHYSTOTRAIN prototype and the results of these evaluations. LAHYSTOTRAIN development and evaluation of a complex training system for hysteroscopy.
