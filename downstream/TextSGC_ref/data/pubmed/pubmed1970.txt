To date brain structure and function changes in children with complex regional pain syndrome CRPS as a result of disease and treatment remain unknown. Here we investigated a gray matter GM differences between patients with CRPS and healthy controls and b GM and functional connectivity FC changes in patients following intensive interdisciplinary psychophysical pain treatment. Twenty-three patients 13 females 9 males; average age\xa0\xa0SD\xa0=\xa013.3\xa0\xa02.5\xa0years and 21 healthy sex- and age-matched controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to controls patients had reduced GM in the primary motor cortex premotor cortex supplementary motor area midcingulate cortex orbitofrontal cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlPFC posterior cingulate cortex precuneus basal ganglia thalamus and hippocampus. Following treatment patients had increased GM in the dlPFC thalamus basal ganglia amygdala and hippocampus and enhanced FC between the dlPFC and the periaqueductal gray two regions involved in descending pain modulation. Accordingly our results provide novel evidence for GM abnormalities in sensory motor emotional cognitive and pain modulatory regions in children with CRPS. Furthermore this is the first study to demonstrate rapid treatment-induced GM and FC changes in areas implicated in sensation emotion cognition and pain modulation. Rapid treatment-induced brain changes in pediatric CRPS.
