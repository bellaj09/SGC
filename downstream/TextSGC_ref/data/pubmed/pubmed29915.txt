Recently hybrid brain-computer interfaces BCIs combining more than one modality have been investigated with the aim of boosting the performance of the existing single-modal BCIs in terms of accuracy and information transfer rate ITR. Previously we introduced a novel hybrid BCI in which EEG and fTCD modalities are used simultaneously to measure electrical brain activity and cerebral blood velocity during motor imagery MI tasks. Common spatial pattern and wavelet decomposition for motor imagery EEG- fTCD brain-computer interface.
