Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship QSAR modeling has been widely used in medicinal chemistry and computational toxicology for many years. Today as the amount of chemicals is increasing dramatically QSAR methods have become pivotal for the purpose of handling the data identifying a decision and gathering useful information from data processing. The advances in this field have paved a way for numerous alternative approaches that require deep mathematics in order to enhance the learning capability of QSAR models. One of these directions is the use of Multiple Classifier Systems MCSs that potentially provide a means to exploit the advantages of manifold learning through decomposition frameworks while improving generalization and predictive performance. In this paper we presented MCS as a next generation of QSAR modeling techniques and discuss the chance to mining the vast number of models already published in the literature. We systematically revisited the theoretical frameworks of MCS as well as current advances in MCS application for QSAR practice. Furthermore we illustrated our idea by describing ensemble approaches on modeling histone deacetylase HDACs inhibitors. We expect that our analysis would contribute to a better understanding about MCS application and its future perspectives for improving the decision making of QSAR models.
