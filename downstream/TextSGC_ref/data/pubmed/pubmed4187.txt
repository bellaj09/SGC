Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies in healthy volunteers have shown alterations in brain connectivity following anesthesia as compared to the awake state. It is not known if the anesthesia-induced changes in brain connectivity are different in a pathological state. This study aims to evaluate changes in the resting state functional connectivity in the brain after propofol anesthesia in patients with chronic back pain CBP. Effect of propofol anesthesia on resting state brain functional connectivity in Indian population with chronic back pain.
