Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components originating from the measuring instrument and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq scRNA-seq are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data are not properly calibrated.
