"Risk stratification model for lung cancer with gene expression profile is of great interest. Instead of previous models based on individual prognostic genes we aimed to develop a novel system-level risk stratification model for lung adenocarcinoma based on gene coexpression network. Using multiple microarray gene coexpression network analysis was performed to identify survival-related networks. A deep learning based risk stratification model was constructed with representative genes of these networks. The model was validated in two test sets. Survival analysis was performed using the output of the model to evaluate whether it could predict patients survival independent of clinicopathological variables. Five networks were significantly associated with patients survival. Considering prognostic significance and representativeness genes of the two survival-related networks were selected for input of the model. The output of the model was significantly associated with patients survival in two test sets and training set p < 0.00001 p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02 for training and test sets 1 and 2 resp.. In multivariate analyses the model was associated with patients prognosis independent of other clinicopathological features. Our study presents a new perspective on incorporating gene coexpression networks into the gene expression signature and clinical application of deep learning in genomic data science for prognosis prediction."
