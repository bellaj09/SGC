Recent trends in health care informatics and telemedicine indicate that systems are being developed with a primary focus on technology and business not on the process of medicine itself. The authors present a new model of health care information distributed medical intelligence which promotes the development of an integrative medical communication system addressing the process of providing expert medical knowledge to the point of need. The model incorporates audio video high-resolution still images and virtual reality applications into an integrated medical communications network. Three components of the model care portals Docking Station and the bridge are described. The implementation of this model at the East Carolina University School of Medicine is also outlined. Telemedicine and distributed medical intelligence.
