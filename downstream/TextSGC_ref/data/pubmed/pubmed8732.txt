The goal of drug design is to discover molecular structures that have suitable pharmacological properties in vast chemical space. In recent years the use of deep generative models DGMs is getting a lot of attention as an effective method of generating new molecules with desired properties. However most of the properties do not have three-dimensional 3D information such as shape and pharmacophore. In drug discovery pharmacophores are valuable clues in finding active compounds. In this study we propose a computational strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for generating molecular structures with a desired pharmacophore. In addition to extract selective molecules against a target protein chemical genomics-based virtual screening CGBVS is used as post-processing method of deep reinforcement learning. As an example study we have employed this strategy to generate molecular structures of selective TIE2 inhibitors. This strategy can be adopted into general use for generating selective molecules with a desired pharmacophore.
