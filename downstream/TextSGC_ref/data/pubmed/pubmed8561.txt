The Accident and Emergency Department A&ED is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately relative A&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years which leads to overcrowding in A&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A&ED patient flow under different triage levels by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks. A universal deep learning approach for modeling the flow of patients under different severities.
