"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide individuals with a means of interacting with a computer using only neural activity. To date the majority of near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS BCIs have used prescribed tasks to achieve binary control. The goals of this study were to evaluate the possibility of using a personalized approach to establish control of a two- three- four- and five-class NIRS-BCI and to explore how various user characteristics correlate to accuracy. Ten able-bodied participants were recruited for five data collection sessions. Participants performed six mental tasks and a personalized approach was used to select each individuals best discriminating subset of tasks. The average offline cross-validation accuracies achieved were 78 61 47 and 37% for the two- three- four- and five-class problems respectively. Most notably all participants exceeded an accuracy of 70% for the two-class problem and two participants exceeded an accuracy of 70% for the three-class problem. Additionally accuracy was found to be strongly positively correlated Pearsons with perceived ease of session \u2009=\u20090.653 ease of concentration \u2009=\u20090.634 and enjoyment \u2009=\u20090.550 but strongly negatively correlated with verbal IQ \u2009=\u2009-0.749."
