"In thought-based steering of robots error potentials ErrP can appear when the action resulting from the brain-machine interface BMI classifier/controller does not correspond to the users thought. Using the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials SSVEP techniques ErrP which appear when a classification error occurs are not easily recognizable by only examining the temporal or frequency characteristics of EEG signals. A supplementary classification process is therefore needed to identify them in order to stop the course of the action and back up to a recovery state. This paper presents a set of time-frequency t-f features for the detection and classification of EEG ErrP in extra-brain activities due to misclassification observed by a user exploiting non-invasive BMI and robot control in the task space. The proposed features are able to characterize and detect ErrP activities in the t-f domain. These features are derived from the information embedded in the t-f representation of EEG signals and include the Instantaneous Frequency IF t-f information complexity SVD information energy concentration and sub-bands energies. The experiment results on real EEG data show that the use of the proposed t-f features for detecting and classifying EEG ErrP achieved an overall classification accuracy up to 97% for 50 EEG segments using 2-class SVM classifier."
