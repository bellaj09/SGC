At its 2009 annual symposium chaired by Dr. William Bill Pollett the Canadian Association of University Surgeons brought together speakers with expertise in surgery and medical education to discuss the role of surgical simulation for improving surgical training and safety. Dr. Daniel Jones of Harvard University and the 2009 Charles Tator Lecturer highlighted how simulation has been used to teach advanced laparoscopic surgery. He also outlined how the American College of Surgeons is moving toward competency assessments as a requirement before surgeons are permitted to perform laparoscopic surgery on patients. Dr. Teodor Grantcharov from the University of Toronto highlighted the role of virtual reality simulators in laparoscopic surgery as well as box trainers. Dr. Peter Brindley from the University of Alberta although a strong proponent of simulation cautioned against an overzealous adoption without addressing its current limitations. He also emphasized simulation\s value in team training and crisis resource management training. Dr. Chris de Gara also from the University of Alberta questioned to what extent simulators should be used to determine competency. He raised concerns that if technical skills are learned in isolation they may become "decontextualized" and therefore simulation might become counterproductive. He outlined how oversimplification can have an "enchanting" effect including a false sense of security. As a result simulation must be used appropriately and along the entire education continuum. Furthermore far more needs to be done to realize its role in surgical safety. "Canadian Association of University Surgeons Annual Symposium.
