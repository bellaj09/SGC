Neurosurgery represents one of the most challenging and delicate of any surgical procedure. Skull base tumors in particular oftentimes present as a very technically difficult procedures in the setting of neurosurgical teaching. Virtual reality technology is one of the most promising surgical planning tools. It can perform fast three-dimensional 3D reconstruction of computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI and other imaging data sets under conditions of virtual reality VR. Surgical simulation can more intuitively understand the anatomical relationship of the surgical area in significantly greater detail. Virtual reality technology for teaching neurosurgery of skull base tumor.
