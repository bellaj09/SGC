"Path integration the constant updating of the navigators knowledge of position and orientation during movement requires both visuospatial knowledge and memory. This study aimed to develop a systems-level understanding of human path integration by examining the basic building blocks of path integration in humans. To achieve this goal we used functional imaging to examine the neural mechanisms that support the tracking and memory of translational and rotational components of human path integration. Critically and in contrast to previous studies we examined movement in translation and rotation tasks with no defined end-point or goal. Navigators accumulated translational and rotational information during virtual self-motion. Activity in hippocampus retrosplenial cortex RSC and parahippocampal cortex PHC increased during both translation and rotation encoding suggesting that these regions track self-motion information during path integration. These results address current questions regarding distance coding in the human brain. By implementing a modified delayed match to sample paradigm we also examined the encoding and maintenance of path integration signals in working memory. Hippocampus PHC and RSC were recruited during successful encoding and maintenance of path integration information with RSC selective for tasks that required processing heading rotation changes. These data indicate distinct working memory mechanisms for translation and rotation which are essential for updating neural representations of current location. The results provide evidence that hippocampus PHC and RSC flexibly track task-relevant translation and rotation signals for path integration and could form the hub of a more distributed network supporting spatial navigation.
