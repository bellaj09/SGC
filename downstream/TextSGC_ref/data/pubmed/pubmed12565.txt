Despite its initial promise neuroimaging has not been widely translated into clinical psychiatry to assist in the prediction of diagnoses prognoses and optimal therapeutic strategies. Machine learning approaches may enhance the translational potential of neuroimaging because they specifically focus on overcoming biases by optimizing the generalizability of pipelines that measure complex brain patterns to predict targets at a single-subject level. This article introduces some fundamentals of a translational machine learning approach before selectively reviewing literature to-date. Promising initial results are then balanced by the description of limitations that should be considered in order to interpret existing research and maximize the possibility of future translation. Future directions are then presented in order to inspire further research and progress the field towards clinical translation. Translational machine learning for psychiatric neuroimaging.
