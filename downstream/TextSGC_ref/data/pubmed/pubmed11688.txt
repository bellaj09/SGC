Despite the recent increase in use of mouse models in scientific research researchers continue to use cognitive tasks that were originally designed and validated for rat use. The Radial Water Tread RWT maze test of spatial memory designed specifically for mice and requiring no swimming has been shown previously to successfully distinguish between controlled cortical impact-induced TBI mice and sham controls. Here a detailed protocol for this task is presented. The RWT maze capitalizes on the natural tendency of mice to avoid open areas in favor of hugging the sides of an apparatus thigmotaxis. The walls of the maze are lined with nine escape holes placed above the floor of the apparatus and mice are trained to use visual cues to locate the escape hole that leads out of the maze. The maze is filled with an inch of cold water sufficient to motivate escape but not deep enough to require that the mouse swim. The acquisition period takes only four training days with a test of memory retention on day five and a long-term memory test on day 12. The results reported here suggest that the RWT maze is a feasible alternative to rat-validated swimming-based cognitive tests in the assessment of spatial memory deficits in mouse models of TBI.
