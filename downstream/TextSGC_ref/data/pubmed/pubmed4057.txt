"A large number of morphology-based studies have previously reported a variety of regional abnormalities in hemispheric asymmetry in Alzheimers disease AD. Recently neuroimaging studies have revealed changes in the topological organization of the structural network in AD. However little is known about the alterations in topological asymmetries. In the present study we used diffusion tensor image tractography to construct the hemispheric brain white matter networks of 25 AD patients 95 mild cognitive impairment MCI patients and 48 normal control NC subjects. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate hemispheric topological properties. Rightward asymmetry in both global and local network efficiencies were observed between the two hemispheres only in AD patients. The brain regions/nodes exhibiting increased rightward asymmetry in both AD and MCI patients were primarily located in the parahippocampal gyrus and cuneus. The observed rightward asymmetry was attributed to changes in the topological properties of the left hemisphere in AD patients. Finally we found that the abnormal hemispheric asymmetries of brain network properties were significantly correlated with memory performance Reys Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Our findings provide new insights into the lateralized nature of hemispheric disconnectivity and highlight the potential for using hemispheric asymmetry of brain network measures as biomarkers for AD."
