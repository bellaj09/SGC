This paper introduces the Clifford support vector machines CSVM as a generalization of the real and complex-valued support vector machines using the Clifford geometric algebra. In this framework we handle the design of kernels involving the Clifford or geometric product. In this approach one redefines the optimization variables as multivectors. This allows us to have a multivector as output. Therefore we can represent multiple classes according to the dimension of the geometric algebra in which we work. We show that one can apply CSVM for classification and regression and also to build a recurrent CSVM. The CSVM is an attractive approach for the multiple input multiple output processing of high-dimensional geometric entities. We carried out comparisons between CSVM and the current approaches to solve multiclass classification and regression. We also study the performance of the recurrent CSVM with experiments involving time series. The authors believe that this paper can be of great use for researchers and practitioners interested in multiclass hypercomplex computing particularly for applications in complex and quaternion signal and image processing satellite control neurocomputation pattern recognition computer vision augmented virtual reality robotics and humanoids.
