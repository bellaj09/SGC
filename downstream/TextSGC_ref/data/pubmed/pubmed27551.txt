Motor imagery MI induced EEG patterns are widely used as control signals for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Kinetic and kinematic factors have been proved to be able to change EEG patterns during motor execution and motor imagery. However to our knowledge there is still no literature reporting an effective online MI-BCI using kinetic factor regulated EEG oscillations. This study proposed a novel MI-BCI paradigm in which users can online output multiple commands by imagining clenching their right hand with different force loads. A brain-computer interface driven by imagining different force loads on a single hand: an online feasibility study.
