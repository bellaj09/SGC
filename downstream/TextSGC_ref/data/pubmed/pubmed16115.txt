We translated a well-established laboratory paradigm to study sensory integration into a Head-Mounted-Display HMD. In the current study a group of 23 individuals with unilateral vestibular dysfunction and 16 age-matched controls observed moving spheres projected from the Oculus Rift. We confirmed increased visual weighting with an unstable surface and decreased visual weighting i.e. reweighting with increased visual amplitude. We did not observe significant differences in gains and phases between individuals with vestibular dysfunction and age-matched controls. The vestibular group increased sway in mid and high frequencies significantly more than controls with the change in surface or visual amplitude. Mild visual perturbations within HMDs carry the potential to become a useful portable assessment of postural control in individuals with vestibular disorders. Weighting and reweighting of visual input via head mounted display given unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction.
