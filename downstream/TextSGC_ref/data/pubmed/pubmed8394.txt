With the advent of deep convolutional neural networks machines now rival humans in terms of object categorization. The neural networks solve categorization with a hierarchical organization that shares a striking resemblance to their biological counterpart leading to their status as a standard model of object recognition in biological vision. Despite training on thousands of images of object categories however machine-learning networks are poorer generalizers often fooled by adversarial images with very simple image manipulations that humans easily distinguish as a false image. Humans on the other hand can generalize object classes from very few samples. Here we provide a dataset of novel object classifications in humans. We gathered thousands of crowd-sourced human responses to novel objects embedded either with 1 or 16 context samples. Human decisions and stimuli together have the potential to be re-used 1 as a tool to better understand the nature of the gap in category learning from few samples between human and machine and 2 as a benchmark of generalization across machine learning networks. A dataset for evaluating one-shot categorization of novel object classes.
