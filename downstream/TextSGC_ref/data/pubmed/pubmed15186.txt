Dual-task performance depends on both modalities e.g. vision audition haptics and task types spatial or object-based and the order by which different task types are organized. Previous studies on haptic and especially auditory-haptic attentional blink AB are scarce and the effect of task types and their order have not been fully explored. In this study 96 participants divided into four groups of task type combinations identified auditory or haptic Target 1 T1 and haptic Target 2 T2 in rapid series of sounds and forces. We observed a haptic AB i.e. the accuracy of identifying T2 increased with increasing stimulus onset asynchrony between T1 and T2 in spatial object-based and object-spatial tasks but not in spatial-object task. Changing the modality of an object-based T1 from haptics to audition eliminated the AB but similar haptic-to-auditory change of the modality of a spatial T1 had no effect on the AB if it exists. Our findings fill a gap in the literature regarding the auditory-haptic AB and substantiate the importance of modalities task types and their order and the interaction between them. These findings were explained by how the cerebral cortex is organized for processing spatial and object-based information in different modalities.
