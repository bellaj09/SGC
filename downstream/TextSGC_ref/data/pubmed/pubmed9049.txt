Quantitative evaluation of diseased myocardium in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The development of a user interface with state-of-the-art techniques would be beneficial for the efficient post-processing and analysis of cardiac images. The aim of this study was to develop a custom user interface tool for the quantitative evaluation of the short-axis left ventricle LV and myocardium. Modules for cine perfusion late gadolinium enhancement LGE and T1 mapping data analyses were developed in Python and a module for three-dimensional 3D visualization was implemented using PyQtGraph library. The U-net segmentation and manual contour correction in the user interface were effective in generating reference myocardial segmentation masks which helped obtain labeled data for deep learning model training. The proposed U-net segmentation resulted in a mean Dice score of 0.87 0.02 in cine diastolic myocardial segmentation. The LV mass measurement of the proposed method showed good agreement with that of manual segmentation intraclass correlation coefficient\u202f=\u202f0.97 mean difference and 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement\u202f=\u202f4.4  12.2\xa0g. C++ implementation of voxel-wise T1 mapping and its binding via pybind11 led to a significant computational gain in calculating the T1 maps. The 3D visualization enabled fast user interactions in rotating and zooming-in/out of the 3D myocardium and scar transmurality. The custom tool has the potential to provide a fast and comprehensive analysis of the LV and myocardium from multi-parametric MRI data in clinical settings.
