"Opioids are the preferred medications for the treatment of pain in the intensive care unit. While under-treatment leads to unrelieved pain and poor clinical outcomes excessive use of opioids puts patients at risk of experiencing multiple adverse effects. In this work we present a sequential decision making framework for opioid dosing based on deep reinforcement learning. It provides real-time clinically interpretable dosing recommendations personalized according to each patients evolving pain and physiological condition. We focus on morphine one of the most commonly prescribed opioids. To train and evaluate the model we used retrospective data from the publicly available MIMIC-3 database. Our results demonstrate that reinforcement learning may be used to aid decision making in the intensive care setting by providing personalized pain management interventions."
