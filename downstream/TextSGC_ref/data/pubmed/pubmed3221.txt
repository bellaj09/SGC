Due to its well-described neural circuitry and identified connectome the Caenorhabditis elegans model is well-suited for demonstrating connections between neuron signaling and behavioral outcome. In the 2017 FUN workshop at Dominican University three behavior-based techniques were introduced for their ease of introduction to students the flexible data collection options they offer and the inexpensive cost to implement in an education setting. These behavioral assays were adapted to address some of the challenges of performing C. elegans behavior experiments in lab classes and included: an associative chemosensory avoidance task to examine behavior of groups of worms a mechanosensory task to observe individual worm behavior and an optogenetics assay to directly manipulate neuron signaling and simultaneously observe resultant behavior. Methods for these assays as well as example data collected by undergraduate students in a lab class are provided. FUN Workshop feedback and assessment indicate these assays were well-received and overall seen as valuable for introducing neuroscience and behavior to undergraduates in a lab class.
