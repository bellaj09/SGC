Drug-induced liver injury DILI has been the single most frequent cause of safety-related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years. Recently deep learning DL has been successfully applied in many fields due to its exceptional and automatic learning ability. In this study DILI prediction models were developed using DL architectures and the best model trained on 475 drugs predicted an external validation set of 198 drugs with an accuracy of 86.9% sensitivity of 82.5% specificity of 92.9% and area under the curve of 0.955 which is better than the performance of previously described DILI prediction models. Furthermore with deep analysis we also identified important molecular features that are related to DILI. Such DL models could improve the prediction of DILI risk in humans.
