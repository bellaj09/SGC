Faster Region-based Convolutional Network Faster R-CNN is a state-of-the-art object detection method. However the object detection effect of Faster R-CNN is not good based on the Region Proposal Network RPN. Inspired by RPN of Faster R-CNN we propose a novel proposal generation method called Enhanced Region Proposal Network ERPN. Four improvements are presented in ERPN. Firstly our proposed deconvolutional feature pyramid network DFPN is introduced to improve the quality of region proposals. Secondly novel anchor boxes are designed with interspersed scales and adaptive aspect ratios. Thereafter the capability of object localization is increased. Thirdly a particle swarm optimization PSO based support vector machine SVM termed PSO-SVM is developed to distinguish the positive and negative anchor boxes. Fourthly the classification part of multi-task loss function in RPN is improved. Consequently the effect of classification loss is strengthened. In this study our proposed ERPN is compared with five object detection methods on both PASCAL VOC and COCO data sets. For the VGG-16 model our ERPN obtains 78.6% mAP on VOC 2007 data set 74.4% mAP on VOC 2012 data set and 31.7% on COCO data set. The performance of ERPN is the best among the comparison object detection methods. Furthermore the detection speed of ERPN is 5.8 fps. Additionally ERPN obtains good effect on small object detection.
