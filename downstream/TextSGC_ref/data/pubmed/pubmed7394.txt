"The performance of deep learning in natural language processing has been spectacular but the reasons for this success remain unclear because of the inherent complexity of deep learning. This paper provides empirical evidence of its effectiveness and of a limitation of neural networks for language engineering. Precisely we demonstrate that a neural language model based on long short-term memory LSTM effectively reproduces Zipfs law and Heaps law two representative statistical properties underlying natural language. We discuss the quality of reproducibility and the emergence of Zipfs law and Heaps law as training progresses. We also point out that the neural language model has a limitation in reproducing long-range correlation another statistical property of natural language. This understanding could provide a direction for improving the architectures of neural networks." Do neural nets learn statistical laws behind natural language?
