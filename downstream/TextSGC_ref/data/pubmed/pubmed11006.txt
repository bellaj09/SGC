Radiology reports are rich resources for biomedical researchers. Before utilization of radiology reports experts must manually review these reports to identify the categories. In fact automatically categorizing electronic medical record EMR text with key annotation is difficult because it has a free-text format. To address these problems we developed an automated system for disease annotation. Automatic Disease Annotation From Radiology Reports Using Artificial Intelligence Implemented by a Recurrent Neural Network.
