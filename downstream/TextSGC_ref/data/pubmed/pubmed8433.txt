Video inpainting aims to fill in spatio-temporal holes in videos with plausible content. Despite tremendous progress on deep learning-based inpainting of a single image it is still challenging to extend these methods to video domain due to the additional time dimension. In this paper we propose a recurrent temporal aggregation framework for fast deep video inpainting. In particular we construct an encoder-decoder model where the encoder takes multiple reference frames which can provide visible pixels revealed from the scene dynamics. These hints are aggregated and fed into the decoder. We apply a recurrent feedback in an auto-regressive manner to enforce temporal consistency in the video results. We propose two architectural designs based on this framework. Our first model is a blind video decaptioning network BVDNet that is designed to automatically remove and inpaint text overlays in videos without any mask information. Our BVDNet wins the first place in the ECCV Chalearn 2018 LAP Inpainting Competition Track 2: Video Decaptioning. Second we propose a network for more general video inpainting VINet to deal with more arbitrary and larger holes. Video results demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
