Virtual reality surgical simulation of temporal bone surgery requires digitized models of the full anatomical region in high quality and colour information to allow realistic texturization. Existing datasets which are usually based on microCT imaging are unable to fulfil these requirements as per the limited specimen size and lack of colour information. The OpenEar Dataset provides a library consisting of eight three-dimensional models of the human temporal bone to enable surgical training including colour data. Each dataset is based on a combination of multimodal imaging including Cone Beam Computed Tomography CBCT and micro-slicing. 3D reconstruction of micro-slicing images and subsequent registration to CBCT images allowed for relatively efficient multimodal segmentation of inner ear compartments middle ear bones tympanic membrane relevant nerve structures blood vessels and the temporal bone. Raw data from the experiment as well as voxel data and triangulated models from the segmentation are provided in full for use in surgical simulators or any other application which relies on high quality models of the human temporal bone.
