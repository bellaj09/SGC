We developed a virtual reality test to assess the cognitive function of Japanese people in near-daily-life environment namely a virtual shopping test VST. In this test participants were asked to execute shopping tasks using touch panel operations in a "virtual shopping mall." We examined differences in VST performances among healthy participants of different ages and correlations between VST and screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination MMSE and Everyday Memory Checklist EMC. We included 285 healthy participants between 20 and 86\xa0years of age in seven age groups. Therefore each VST index tended to decrease with advancing age; differences among age groups were significant. Most VST indices had a significantly negative correlation with MMSE and significantly positive correlation with EMC. VST may be useful for assessing general cognitive decline; effects of age must be considered for proper interpretation of the VST scores.
