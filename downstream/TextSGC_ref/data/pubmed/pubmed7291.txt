Interests have been rapidly growing in the field of radiotherapy to replace CT with magnetic resonance imaging MRI due to superior soft tissue contrast offered by MRI and the desire to reduce unnecessary radiation dose. MR-only radiotherapy also simplifies clinical workflow and avoids uncertainties in aligning MR with CT. Methods however are needed to derive CT-equivalent representations often known as synthetic CT sCT from patient MR images for dose calculation and DRR-based patient positioning. Synthetic CT estimation is also important for PET attenuation correction in hybrid PET-MR systems. We propose in this work a novel deep convolutional neural network DCNN method for sCT generation and evaluate its performance on a set of brain tumor patient images.
