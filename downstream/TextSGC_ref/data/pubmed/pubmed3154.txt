Severe and moderate traumatic brain injury sTBI often results in long-term cognitive deficits such as reduced processing speed and attention. The intraparietal sulcus IPS is a neocortical structure that plays a crucial role in the deeply interrelated processes of multi-sensory processing and top down attention. Therefore we hypothesized that disruptions in the functional and structural connections of the IPS may play a role in the development of such deficits. To examine these connections we used resting state magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI and diffusion kurtosis imaging DKI in a cohort of 27 patients with sTBI 29.3\u2009\u20098.9 years and 27 control participants 29.8\u2009\u200910.3 years. Participants were prospectively recruited and received rsfMRI and neuropsychological assessments including the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ANAM at greater than 6 months post-injury. A subset of participants received a DKI scan. Results suggest that patients with sTBI performed worse than control participants on multiple subtests of the ANAM suggesting reduced cognitive performance. Reduced resting state functional connectivity between the IPS and cortical regions associated with multi-sensory processing and the dorsal attention network was observed in the patients with sTBI. The patients also showed reduced structural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus SLF a key white matter tract connecting the IPS to anterior frontal areas as measured by reduced mean kurtosis MK and fractional anisotropy FA and increased mean diffusivity MD. Further this reduced structural integrity of the SLF was associated with a reduction in overall cognitive performance. These findings suggest that disruptions in the structural and functional connectivity of the IPS may contribute to chronic cognitive deficits experienced by these patients.
