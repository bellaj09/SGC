Imaging of glioblastoma patients after maximal safe resection and chemoradiation commonly demonstrates new enhancements that raise concerns about tumor progression. However in 30% to 50% of patients these enhancements primarily represent the effects of treatment or pseudo-progression PsP. We hypothesize that quantitative machine learning analysis of clinically acquired multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging mpMRI can identify subvisual imaging characteristics to provide robust noninvasive imaging signatures that can distinguish true progression TP from PsP. Histopathology-validated machine learning radiographic biomarker for noninvasive discrimination between true progression and pseudo-progression in glioblastoma.
