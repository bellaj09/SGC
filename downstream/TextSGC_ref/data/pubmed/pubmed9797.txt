Automatically identifying semantic concepts from medical images provides multimodal insights for clinical research. To study the effectiveness of concept detection on large scale medical images we reconstructed over 230000 medical image-concepts pairs collected from the ImageCLEFcaption 2018 evaluation task. A transfer learning-based multi-label classification model was used to predict multiple high-frequency concepts for medical images. Semantically relevant concepts of visually similar medical images were identified by the image retrieval-based topic model. The results showed that the transfer learning method achieved F1 score of 0.1298 which was comparable with the state of art methods in the ImageCLEFcaption tasks. The image retrieval-based method contributed to the recall performance but reduced the overall F1 score since the retrieval results of the search engine introduced irrelevant concepts. Although our proposed method achieved second-best performance in the concept detection subtask of ImageCLEFcaption 2018 there will be plenty of further work to improve the concept detection with better understanding the medical images.
