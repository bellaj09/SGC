When an unexpected perturbation in the environment occurs the subsequent alertness state may cause a brain activation responding to that perturbation which can be detected and employed by a Brain-Computer Interface BCI. In this work the possibility of detecting a sudden obstacle appearance analyzing electroencephalographic EEG signals is assessed. For this purpose different features of EEG signals are evaluated during the appearance of sudden obstacles while a subject is walking on a treadmill. The future goal is to use this procedure to detect any obstacle appearance during walking when the user is wearing a lower limb exoskeleton in order to generate an emergency stop command for the exoskeleton. This would enhance the user-exoskeleton interaction improving the safety mechanisms of current exoskeletons. Analyzing EEG signals to detect unexpected obstacles during walking.
