"Deep learning methods have recently made notable advances in the tasks of classification and representation learning. These tasks are important for brain imaging and neuroscience discovery making the methods attractive for porting to a neuroimagers toolbox. Success of these methods is in part explained by the flexibility of deep learning models. However this flexibility makes the process of porting to new areas a difficult parameter optimization problem. In this work we demonstrate our results and feasible parameter ranges in application of deep learning methods to structural and functional brain imaging data. These methods include deep belief networks and their building block the restricted Boltzmann machine. We also describe a novel constraint-based approach to visualizing high dimensional data. We use it to analyze the effect of parameter choices on data transformations. Our results show that deep learning methods are able to learn physiologically important representations and detect latent relations in neuroimaging data."
