"Recent pilot clinical studies have demonstrated that subjects with severe disorders of movement and communication can exert direct neural control over assistive devices using invasive Brain-Machine Interface BMI technology also referred to as cortical neuroprosthetics. These important proof-of-principle studies have generated great interest among those with disability and clinicians who provide general medical neurological and/or rehabilitative care. Taking into account the perspective of providers who may be unfamiliar with the field we first review the clinical goals and fundamentals of invasive BMI technology and then briefly summarize the vast body of basic science research demonstrating its feasibility. We emphasize recent translational progress in the target clinical populations and discuss translational challenges and future directions." Cortical neuroprosthetics from a clinical perspective.
