Neurological tremor is the most common movement disorder affecting more than 4% of elderly people. Tremor is a non linear and non stationary phenomenon which is increasingly recognized. The issue of selection of sensors is central in the characterization of tremor. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art instrumentation and methods of signal processing for tremor occurring in humans. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly used sensors as well as the emerging wearable sensors being developed to assess tremor instantaneously. We discuss the current limitations and the future applications such as the integration of tremor sensors in BCIs brain-computer interfaces and the need for sensor fusion approaches for wearable solutions. Neurological tremor: sensors signal processing and emerging applications.
