"In current constructivist paradigms learners previous subject-matter knowledge or cognitive models provide the foundations for the construction of new knowledge. Learners cognitive models about learning also mediate students capacities to learn in their chosen topics of study. The diverse backgrounds of students entering medicine suggest that they might come to medical studies equipped with a wide variety of cognitive models about learning. Some current theories tend to reduce students cognitions about learning to parsimonious representations such as surface-deep approaches or mastery-performance goals. It is possible that such reduced representations underrepresent or misrepresent the complexity of students cognitive models about learning. Good quality teaching needs to take account of learners cognitive models not just about subject matter but also about learning. This study investigated the diversity and complexity of medical students cognitive models about learning." "Multi-dimensional profiling of medical students cognitive models about learning."
