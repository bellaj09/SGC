The high-pace rise in advanced computing and imaging systems has given rise to a new research dimension called computer-aided diagnosis CAD system for various biomedical purposes. CAD-based diabetic retinopathy DR can be of paramount significance to enable early disease detection and diagnosis decision. Considering the robustness of deep neural networks DNNs to solve highly intricate classification problems in this paper AlexNet DNN which functions on the basis of convolutional neural network CNN has been applied to enable an optimal DR CAD solution. The DR model applies a multilevel optimization measure that incorporates pre-processing adaptive-learning-based Gaussian mixture model GMM-based concept region segmentation connected component-analysis-based region of interest ROI localization AlexNet DNN-based highly dimensional feature extraction principle component analysis PCA- and linear discriminant analysis LDA-based feature selection and support-vector-machine-based classification to ensure optimal five-class DR classification. The simulation results with standard KAGGLE fundus datasets reveal that the proposed AlexNet DNN-based DR exhibits a better performance with LDA feature selection where it exhibits a DR classification accuracy of 97.93% with FC7 features whereas with PCA it shows 95.26% accuracy. Comparative analysis with spatial invariant feature transform SIFT technique accuracy-94.40% based DR feature extraction also confirms that AlexNet DNN-based DR outperforms SIFT-based DR.
