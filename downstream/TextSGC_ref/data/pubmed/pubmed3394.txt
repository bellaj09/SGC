"Emerging evidence demonstrates heterogeneity in clinical outcomes of prodromal psychosis that only a small percentage of at-risk individuals eventually progress to full-blown psychosis. To examine the neurobiological underpinnings of this heterogeneity from a network perspective we tested whether the early patterns of large-scale brain network topology were associated with risk of developing clinical psychosis. Task-free functional MRI data were acquired from subjects with At Risk Mental State ARMS for psychosis and healthy controls HC. All individuals had no history of drug abuse and were not on antipsychotics. We performed functional connectomics analysis to identify patterns of system-level functional brain dysconnectivity associated with ARMS individuals with different outcomes. In comparison to HC and ARMS who did not transition to psychosis at follow-up ARMS-NT ARMS individuals who did ARMS-T showed marked brain functional dysconnectivity characterized by loss of network segregation and disruption of network communities especially the salience default dorsal attention sensorimotor and limbic networks P < 0.05 FWE-corrected Cohens d > 1.00 and was associated with baseline symptom severity. In contrast we did not observe connectivity differences between ARMS-NT and HC individuals. Taken together these results suggest a possible large-scale functional brain network topology phenotype related to risk of psychosis transition in ARMS individuals."
