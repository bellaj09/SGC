"The mechanisms involved in the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency stimulation LFS have not been completely determined. However Gi-protein-coupled receptors including D2-like receptors may have a role in mediating these effects. In the present study the role of D2-like receptors in LFS anti-seizure action was investigated. Rats were kindled with semi-rapid 6 stimulations per day electrical stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 area. In LFS-treated groups subjects received four trials of LFS at 5\xa0min 6\xa0h 24\xa0h and 30\xa0h following the last kindling stimulation. Each LFS set occurred at 5\xa0min intervals and consisted of 4 trains. Each train contained 200 0/1 ms long monophasic square wave pulses at 1\xa0Hz. Haloperidol D2-like receptors antagonist 2\xa0m and/or bromocriptine D2-like receptors agonist 2\xa0g/lit were microinjected into the lateral ventricle immediately after the last kindling before applying LFS. Obtained results showed that applying LFS in fully-kindled subjects led to a depotentiation-like decrease in kindling-induced potentiation and reduced the amplitude and rise slope of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents in whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition LFS restored the kindling-induced spatial learning and memory impairments in the Barnes maze test. A D2-like receptor antagonist inhibited these effects of LFS while a D2-like receptor agonist mimicked these effects. In conclusion a depotentiation-like mechanism may be involved in restoring LFS effects on learning and memory and synaptic plasticity. These effects depend on D2-like receptors activity."
