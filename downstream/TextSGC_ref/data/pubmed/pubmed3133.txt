"Resting-state functional connectivity FC fMRI rs-fcMRI offers an appealing approach to mapping the brains intrinsic functional organization. Blood oxygen level dependent BOLD and arterial spin labeling ASL are the two main rs-fcMRI approaches to assess alterations in brain networks associated with individual differences behavior and psychopathology. While the BOLD signal is stronger with a higher temporal resolution ASL provides quantitative direct measures of the physiology and metabolism of specific networks. This study systematically investigated the similarity and reliability of resting brain networks RBNs in BOLD and ASL. A 2  2  2 factorial design was employed where each subject underwent repeated BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI scans on two occasions on two MRI scanners respectively. Both independent and joint FC analyses revealed common RBNs in ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI with a moderate to high level of spatial overlap verified by Dice Similarity Coefficients. Test-retest analyses indicated more reliable spatial network patterns in BOLD average modal Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 0.905  0.033 between-sessions; 0.885  0.052 between-scanners than ASL 0.545  0.048; 0.575  0.059. Nevertheless ASL provided highly reproducible 0.955  0.021; 0.970  0.011 network-specific CBF measurements. Moreover we observed positive correlations between regional CBF and FC in core areas of all RBNs indicating a relationship between network connectivity and its baseline metabolism. Taken together the combination of ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI provides a powerful tool for characterizing the spatiotemporal and quantitative properties of RBNs. These findings pave the way for future BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI studies in clinical populations that are carried out across time and scanners."
