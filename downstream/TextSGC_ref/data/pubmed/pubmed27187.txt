Scalability of implantable neural interface devices is a critical bottleneck in enhancing the performance of cortical Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs through access to high density and multi-areal cortical signals. This is challenging to achieve through current monolithic constructs with 100-200 channels often with bulky tethering and packaging and a spatially distributed sensor approach has recently been explored by a few groups including our laboratories 1. In this paper we describe a microscale 500 m programmable neural stimulator in the context of an epicortical wireless networked system of sub-mm "Neurograins" with wireless energy harvesting near 1 GHz and bidirectional telemetry. Stimulation neurograins are post-processed to integrate poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene polystyrene sulfonate PEDOT:PSS planar electrodes or intracortical penetrating microwires and ensembles of microdevices are hermetically encapsulated using liquid-crystal polymer LCP thermocompression for chronic implantability. Radio-frequency power and telecommunications management are handled by a wearable external "Epidermal Skinpatch" unit to cater to chronic clinical implant considerations. We describe the stimulation neurograin performance specifications and proof-of-concept in bench top and ex vivo rodent platforms.
