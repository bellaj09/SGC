Electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter DPAG and deep layers of the superior colliculus DLSC of the rat elicits anxiety-like reactions such as freezing and flight. The temporal course of the effects of the aversive electrical stimulation of the DPAG 5 15 and 30 min afterward and DLSC 5 10 and 15 min afterward on the defensive response of rats exposed to elevated T-maze were determined. The elevated T-maze generates two defensive behaviors inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape which have been related respectively to generalized anxiety and panic disorders. Prior electrical stimulation of the DPAG 15 min and DLSC 5 min enhanced inhibitory avoidance when compared to no-operated and sham animals although not affecting escape. Therefore stimulation of the DPAG and DLSC causes a heightened responsivity to anxiogenic stimulus but not to panicogenic stimulus inherent to elevated T-maze. These findings support the participation of the DPAG and DLSC in the elaboration of adaptive responses to stressful situations. Besides the data supports the view that prior electrical stimulation of DPAG and DLSC is selective in sensitizing rats to anxiety-like behaviors but not to panic-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze test. Prior electrical stimulation of dorsal periaqueductal grey matter or deep layers of the superior colliculus sensitizes rats to anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze test.
