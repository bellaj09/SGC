"Genetic and neurophysiological studies of electroencephalogram EEG have shown that an individuals brain activity during a given cognitive task is to some extent determined by their genes. In fact the field of biometrics has successfully used this property to build systems capable of identifying users from their neural activity. These studies have always been carried out in isolated conditions such as relaxing with eyes closed identifying visual targets or solving mathematical operations. Here we show for the first time that the neural signature extracted from the spectral shape of the EEG is to a large extent independent of the recorded cognitive task and experimental condition. In addition we propose to use this task-independent neural signature for more precise biometric identity verification. We present two systems: one based on real cepstrums and one based on linear predictive coefficients. We obtained verification accuracies above 89% on 4 of the 6 databases used. We anticipate this finding will create a new set of experimental possibilities within many brain research fields such as the study of neuroplasticity neurodegenerative diseases and brain machine interfaces as well as the mentioned genetic neurophysiological and biometric studies. Furthermore the proposed biometric approach represents an important advance towards real world deployments of this new technology."
