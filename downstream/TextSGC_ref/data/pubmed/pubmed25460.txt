"Our objective was to investigate the relationship between brain-computer interface BCI communication skill and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. We sought also to assess stability of BCI communication performance over time and whether it is related to the progression of neurological impairment before entering the locked-in state. A three years follow-up BCI evaluation in a group of ALS patients n = 24 was conducted. For a variety of reasons only three patients completed the three years follow-up. BCI communication skill and disability level using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised were assessed at admission and at each of the three follow-ups. Multiple non-parametric statistical methods were used to ensure reliability of the dependent variables: correlations paired test and factor analysis of variance. Results demonstrated no significant relationship between BCI communication skill BCI-CS and disease evolution. The patients who performed the follow-up evaluations preserved their BCI-CS over time. Patients age at admission correlated positively with the ability to achieve control over a BCI. In conclusion disease evolution in ALS does not affect the ability to control a BCI for communication. BCI performance can be maintained in the different stages of the illness." Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression and stability of brain-computer interface communication.
