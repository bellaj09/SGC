Molecular testing is increasingly important in cancer diagnosis. Targeted next generation sequencing NGS is widely accepted method but structural variation SV detection by targeted NGS remains challenging. In the brain tumor identification of molecular alterations including 1p/19q co-deletion is essential for accurate glial tumor classification. Hence we used targeted NGS to detect 1p/19q co-deletion using a newly developed deep learning DL model in 61 tumors including 19 oligodendroglial tumors. An ensemble 1-dimentional convolution neural network was developed and used to detect the 1p/19q co-deletion. External validation was performed using 427 low-grade glial tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA. Manual review of the copy number plot from the targeted NGS identified the 1p/19q co-deletion in all 19 oligodendroglial tumors. Our DL model also perfectly detected the 1p/19q co-deletion area under the curve AUC\u2009=\u20091 in the testing set and yielded reproducible results AUC\u2009=\u20090.9652 in the validation set n\u2009=\u2009427 although the validation data were generated on a completely different platform SNP Array 6.0 platform. In conclusion targeted NGS using a cancer gene panel is a promising approach for classifying glial tumors and DL can be successfully integrated for the SV detection in NGS data.
