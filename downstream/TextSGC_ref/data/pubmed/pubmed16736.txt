Most people are exposed to a violent or life-threatening situation during their lives but only a minority develops a stress-related disorder. To examine risk factors for the development of stress-related symptoms such as intrusions and avoidance analogue trauma studies are necessary. The often-used trauma film paradigm has proven to be valuable to examine intrusions but inherently to its technique is less suitable for assessing behavioral avoidance a core symptom of stress-related disorders. The aim of the present study was twofold first to further develop an analogue that explicitly addresses behavioral avoidance and second to link previously-established risk factors for the development of stress-related symptoms. A novel virtual reality paradigm: Predictors for stress-related intrusions and avoidance behavior.
