Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of game-based virtual reality movement therapy plus mental practice on upper extremity function in chronic stroke patients with hemiparesis. Subjects The subjects were chronic stroke patients with hemiparesis. Methods Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to either the control group or experimental group. All subjects received 20 sessions 5 days in a week of virtual reality movement therapy using the Nintendo Wii. In addition to Wii-based virtual reality movement therapy experimental group subjects performed mental practice consisting of 5 minutes of relaxation Wii games imagination and normalization phases before the beginning of Wii games. To compare the two groups the upper extremity subtest of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Box and Block Test and quality of movement subscale of the Motor Activity Log were performed. Results Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Box and Block Test and quality of the movement subscale of Motor Activity Log after the interventions. Also there were significant differences in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Box and Block Test and quality of movement subscale of the Motor Activity Log between the two groups. Conclusion Game-based virtual reality movement therapy alone may be helpful to improve functional recovery of the upper extremity but the addition of MP produces a lager improvement. The effects of game-based virtual reality movement therapy plus mental practice on upper extremity function in chronic stroke patients with hemiparesis: a randomized controlled trial.
