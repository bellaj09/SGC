Point cloud is a widely used 3D data form which can be produced by depth sensors such as Light Detection and Ranging LIDAR and RGB-D cameras. Being unordered and irregular many researchers focused on the feature engineering of the point cloud. Being able to learn complex hierarchical structures deep learning has achieved great success with images from cameras. Recently many researchers have adapted it into the applications of the point cloud. In this paper the recent existing point cloud feature learning methods are classified as point-based and tree-based. The former directly takes the raw point cloud as the input for deep learning. The latter first employs a k-dimensional tree Kd-tree structure to represent the point cloud with a regular representation and then feeds these representations into deep learning models. Their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. The applications related to point cloud feature learning including 3D object classification semantic segmentation and 3D object detection are introduced and the datasets and evaluation metrics are also collected. Finally the future research trend is predicted. Deep Learning on Point Clouds and Its Application: A Survey.
