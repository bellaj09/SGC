"A significant challenge in object detection is accurate identification of an objects position in image space whereas one algorithm with one set of parameters is usually not enough and the fusion of multiple algorithms and/or parameters can lead to more robust results. Herein a new computational intelligence fusion approach based on the dynamic analysis of agreement among object detection outputs is proposed. Furthermore we propose an online versus just in training image augmentation strategy. Experiments comparing the results both with and without fusion are presented. We demonstrate that the augmented and fused combination results are the best with respect to higher accuracy rates and reduction of outlier influences. The approach is demonstrated in the context of cone pedestrian and box detection for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ADAS applications."
