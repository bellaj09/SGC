Piwi-interacting RNAs piRNAs are the largest class of small non-coding RNAs discovered in germ cells. Identifying piRNAs from small RNA data is a challenging task due to the lack of conserved sequences and structural features of piRNAs. Many programs have been developed to identify piRNA from small RNA data. However these programs have limitations. They either rely on extracting complicated features or only demonstrate strong performance on transposon related piRNAs. Here we proposed a new program called piRNN for piRNA identification. For our software we applied a convolutional neural network classifier that was trained on the datasets from four different species Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila melanogaster rat and human. A matrix of k-mer frequency values was used to represent each sequence. piRNN has great usability and shows better performance in comparison with other programs.
