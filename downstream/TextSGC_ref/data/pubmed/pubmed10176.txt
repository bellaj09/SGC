Although traffic sign detection has been studied for years and great progress has been made with the rise of deep learning technique there are still many problems remaining to be addressed. For complicated real-world traffic scenes there are two main challenges. First traffic signs are usually small-sized objects which makes them more difficult to detect than large ones; second it is hard to distinguish false targets which resemble real traffic signs in complex street scenes without context information. To handle these problems we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning method for traffic sign detection in complex environments. Our contributions are as follows: 1 we propose a multi-resolution feature fusion network architecture which exploits densely connected deconvolution layers with skip connections and can learn more effective features for a small-size object and 2 we frame the traffic sign detection as a spatial sequence classification and regression task and propose a vertical spatial sequence attention module to gain more context information for better detection performance. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed method we experiment on several traffic sign datasets as well as the general object detection dataset and the results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.
