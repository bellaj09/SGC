Cancer genomic analysis requires accurate identification of somatic variants in sequencing data. Manual review to refine somatic variant calls is required as a final step after automated processing. However manual variant refinement is time-consuming costly poorly standardized and non-reproducible. Here we systematized and standardized somatic variant refinement using a machine learning approach. The final model incorporates 41000 variants from 440 sequencing cases. This model accurately recapitulated manual refinement labels for three independent testing sets 13579 variants and accurately predicted somatic variants confirmed by orthogonal validation sequencing data 212158 variants. The model improves on manual somatic refinement by reducing bias on calls otherwise subject to high inter-reviewer variability. A deep learning approach to automate refinement of somatic variant calling from cancer sequencing data.
