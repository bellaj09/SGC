"The control of ones own movements and\xa0of their impact on the external world generates a feeling of control referred to as Sense of Agency SoA. SoA is experienced when actions match predictions and is reduced by unpredicted events. The present study investigated the contribution of monitoring two fundamental components of action-movement execution and goal achievement-that have been most often explored separately in previous research. We have devised a new paradigm in which participants performed goal-directed actions while viewing an avatars hand in a mixed-reality scenario. The hand performed either the same action or a different one simultaneously or after various delays. Movement of the\xa0virtual finger and goal attainment were manipulated so that they could match or conflict with the participants expectations. We collected judgments of correspondence an explicit index of SoA that overcomes the tendency to over-attribute actions to oneself by asking participants if the observed action was synchronous or not with their action. In keeping with previous studies we found that monitoring both movement execution and goal attainment is relevant for SoA. Moreover we expanded previous findings by showing that movement information may be a more constant source of SoA modulation than goal information. Indeed an incongruent movement impaired SoA irrespective of delay duration while a missed goal did so only when delays were short.\xa0Our novel paradigm allowed us to simultaneously manipulate multiple action features a characteristic that makes\xa0it suitable for investigating the contribution of different sub-components of action in modulating SoA\xa0in healthy and clinical populations." Violation of expectations about movement and goal achievement leads to Sense of Agency reduction.
