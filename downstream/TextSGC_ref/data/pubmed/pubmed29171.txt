A canonical correlation analysis CCA is a state-of-the-art method for frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI systems. Various extended methods have been developed and among such methods a combination method of CCA and individual-template-based CCA has achieved the best performance. However the CCA requires the canonical vectors to be orthogonal which may not be a reasonable assumption for the EEG analysis. In this paper we propose using the correlated component analysis CORRCA rather than CCA to implement frequency recognition. CORRCA can relax the constraint of canonical vectors in CCA and generate the same projection vector for two multichannel EEG signals. Furthermore we propose a two-stage method based on the basic CORRCA method termed TSCORRCA. Evaluated on a benchmark data set of 35 subjects the experimental results demonstrate that CORRCA significantly outperformed CCA and TSCORRCA obtained the best performance among the compared methods. This paper demonstrates that CORRCA-based methods have a great potential for implementing high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems.
