Illusions of self-movement vection can be used in virtual reality VR and other applications to give users the embodied sensation that they are moving when physical movement is unfeasible or too costly. Whereas a large body of vection literature studied how various parameters of the presented visual stimulus affect vection little is known how different display types might affect vection. As a step toward addressing this gap we conducted three experiments to compare vection and usability parameters between commonly used VR displays ranging from stereoscopic projection and 3D TV to high-end head-mounted display HMD NVIS SX111 and recent low-cost HMD Oculus Rift. The last experiment also compared these two HMDs in their native full field of view FOV and a reduced matched FOV of 72  45. Participants moved along linear and curvilinear paths in the virtual environment reported vection onset time and rated vection intensity at the end of each trial. In addition user ratings on immersion motion sickness vection and overall preference were recorded retrospectively and compared between displays. Unexpectedly there were no significant effects of display on vection measures. Reducing the FOV for the HMDs from full to 72  45 decreased vection onset latencies but did not affect vection intensity. As predicted curvilinear paths yielded earlier and more intense vection. Although vection has often been proposed to predict or even cause motion sickness we observed no correlation for any of the displays studied. In conclusion perceived self-motion and other user experience measures proved surprisingly tolerant toward changes in display type as long as the FOV was roughly matched. This suggests that display choice for vection research and VR applications can be largely based on other considerations as long as the provided FOV is sufficiently large.
