Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI is a powerful research tool to understand the neural underpinnings of human memory. However as memory is known to be context-dependent differences in contexts between naturalistic settings and the MRI scanner environment may potentially confound neuroimaging findings. Virtual reality VR provides a unique opportunity to mitigate this issue by allowing memories to be formed and/or retrieved within immersive navigable visuospatial contexts. This can enhance the ecological validity of task paradigms while still ensuring that researchers maintain experimental control over critical aspects of the learning and testing experience. This mini-review surveys the growing body of fMRI studies that have incorporated VR to address critical questions about human memory. These studies have adopted a variety of approaches including presenting research participants with VR experiences in the scanner asking participants to retrieve information that they had previously acquired in a VR environment or identifying neural correlates of behavioral metrics obtained through VR-based tasks performed outside the scanner. Although most such studies to date have focused on spatial or navigational memory we also discuss the promise of VR in aiding other areas of memory research and facilitating research into clinical disorders.
