Most cognitive neuroscience theories have focused on the functions of individual brain regions but cognitive abilities depend also on functional interactions among multiple regions. Many recent studies on these interactions have examined large-scale resting-state networks but these networks are difficult to link to theories about specific cognitive processes. Cognitive theories are easier to link to the mini-networks we call process specific alliances PSAs. A PSA is a small team of brain regions that rapidly assemble to mediate a cognitive process in response to task demands but quickly disassemble when the process is no longer needed. We compare PSAs to resting-state networks and to other connectivity-based task-related networks and we characterize the advantages and disadvantages of each type of network.
