On March 14 2020 the Surgeon General of the United States urged a widespread cessation of all elective surgery across the country. The suddenness of this mandate and the concomitant spread of the COVID-19 virus left many hospital systems orthopaedic practices and patients with significant anxiety and confusion as to the near intermediate and long-term future of our healthcare system. As with most businesses in the United States during this time many orthopaedic practices have been emotionally and fiscally devastated as a result of this crisis. Furthermore this pandemic is occurring at a time where small and mid-sized orthopaedic groups are already struggling to cover practice overhead and to maintain autonomy from larger health systems. It is anticipated that many groups will experience financial demise leading to substantial global consolidation. As the authors represent some of the larger musculoskeletal multispecialty groups in the country we are uniquely positioned to provide a framework with recommendations to best weather the ensuing months. We believe these recommendations will allow providers and their staff to return to an infrastructure that can adjust immediately to the pent-up healthcare demand that may occur following the COVID-19 pandemic. In this editorial we address practice finances staffing telehealth operational plans following the crisis and ethical considerations. Practice Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
