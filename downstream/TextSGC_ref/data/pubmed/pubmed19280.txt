Objective assessment of psychomotor skills in surgery is now a priority; however this assessment is difficult to achieve because of measurement difficulties associated with the reliability and validity of assessing surgical skills in vivo and in the laboratory. In this study virtual reality VR was used to overcome these problems in the objective psychomotor assessment of senior junior and novice laparoscopists. Twelve experienced laparoscopic surgeons performed >50 Minimal Access Surgery MAS procedures 12 inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons <10 MAS procedures and 12 laparoscopic novices no MAS procedures participated in the study. Each subject completed all six tasks of the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer; Virtual Reality MIST VR. In comparison to the other groups experienced laparoscopic surgeons performed the tasks significantly p < 0.01 faster had a lower error rate were more economic in their movement of surgical instruments and in the use of diathermy. As a group they also showed greater consistency in their performance. MIST VR distinguished between the three groups of laparoscopists. VR provides a useful objective assessment tool for evaluating psychomotor skills for laparoscopic surgery. Objective psychomotor skills assessment of experienced junior and novice laparoscopists with virtual reality.
