"Models have been developed to predict stroke outcomes e.g. mortality in attempt to provide better guidance for stroke treatment. However there is little work in developing classification models for the problem of unknown time-since-stroke TSS which determines a patients treatment eligibility based on a clinical defined cutoff time point i.e. <4.5hrs. In this paper we construct and compare machine learning methods to classify TSS<4.5hrs using magnetic resonance MR imaging features. We also propose a deep learning model to extract hidden representations from the MR perfusion-weighted images and demonstrate classification improvement by incorporating these additional imaging features. Finally we discuss a strategy to visualize the learned features from the proposed deep learning model. The cross-validation results show that our best classifier achieved an area under the curve of 0.68 which improves significantly over current clinical methods 0.58 demonstrating the potential benefit of using advanced machine learning methods in TSS classification."
