"Working memory WM is a distributed cognitive process that employs communication between prefrontal cortex and posterior brain regions in the form of cross-frequency coupling between theta   and high-alpha  2 brain waves. A novel method for deriving causal interactions between brain waves of different frequencies is essential for a better understanding of the neural dynamics of such complex cognitive process. Here we proposed a novel method to estimate transfer entropy  TE through a symbolization scheme which is based on neural-gas algorithm NG and encodes a bivariate time series in the form of two symbolic sequences. Given the symbolic sequences the delay symbolic transfer entropy  dSTENG is defined. Our approach is akin to standard symbolic transfer entropy  STE that incorporates the ordinal pattern OP symbolization technique. We assessed the proposed method in a WM-invoked paradigm that included a mental arithmetic task at various levels of difficulty. Effective interactions between Frontal  F  and Formula: see text  PO2 brain waves were detected in multichannel EEG recordings from 16 subjects. Compared with conventional methods our technique was less sensitive to noise and demonstrated improved computational efficiency in quantifying the dominating direction of effective connectivity between brain waves of different spectral content. Moreover we discovered an efferent F connectivity pattern and an afferent PO2 one in all the levels of the task. Further statistical analysis revealed an increasing dSTENG strength following the tasks difficulty."
