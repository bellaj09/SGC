Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a tremendously promising tool for imaging tissue microstructure and for inferring large scale structural connectivity in vivo. However the sensitivity of the technique is highly dependent on methodological details. Acquisition parameters pre-processing steps reconstruction models and statistical analysis all affect the final sensitivity specificity and accuracy of a study. In the case of fiber pathway reconstruction in the central nervous system termed tractography false positive and false negative results abound and interpretation of results must take into account the potential shortcomings of the techniques used. This article will review the strengths and limitations of different types of diffusion MRI tractography analysis and highlight what one can realistically hope to learn from such imaging studies of the human brain. Potential and limitations of diffusion MRI tractography for the study of language.
