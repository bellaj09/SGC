This paper presents a hybrid brain-computer interface BCI that combines motor imagery MI and P300 potential for the asynchronous operation of a brain-controlled wheelchair whose design is based on a Mecanum wheel. This paradigm is completely user-centric. By sequentially performing MI tasks or paying attention to P300 flashing the user can use eleven functions to control the wheelchair: move forward/backward move left/right move left45/right45 accelerate/decelerate turn left/right and stop. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach were validated in eight subjects all of whom achieved good performance. The preliminary results indicated that the proposed hybrid BCI system with different mental strategies operating sequentially is feasible and has potential applications for practical self-paced control.
