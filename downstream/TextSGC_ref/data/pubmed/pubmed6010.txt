Radiomics artificial intelligence and deep learning figure amongst recent buzzwords in current medical imaging research and technological development. Analysis of medical big data in assessment and follow-up of personalised treatments has also become a major research topic in the area of precision medicine. In this review current research trends in radiomics are analysed from handcrafted radiomics feature extraction and statistical analysis to deep learning. Radiomics algorithms now include genomics and immunomics data to improve patient stratification and prediction of treatment response. Several applications have already shown conclusive results demonstrating the potential of including other "omics" data to existing imaging features. We also discuss further challenges of data harmonisation and management infrastructure to shed a light on the much-needed integration of radiomics and all other "omics" into clinical workflows. In particular we point to the emerging paradigm shift in the implementation of big data infrastructures to facilitate databanks growth data extraction and the development of expert software tools. Secured access sharing and integration of all health data called "holomics" will accelerate the revolution of personalised medicine and oncology as well as expand the role of imaging specialists. Integrating radiomics into holomics for personalised oncology: from algorithms to bedside.
