"Episodes of complete failure to respond during attentive tasks--lapses of responsiveness lapses--accompanied by behavioral signs of sleep such as slow-eye-closure are known as behavioral microsleeps BMs. The occurrence of BMs can have serious/fatal consequences particularly in the transport sectors and therefore further investigations on neurophysiological correlates of BMs are highly desirable. In this paper we propose a combination of High Resolution EEG techniques and an advanced method for time-varying functional connectivity estimation for reconstructing the temporal evolution of causal relations between cortical regions of BMs occurring during a visuomotor tracking task. The preliminary results highlight connectivity patterns involving parietal and fronto-parietal areas both preceding and following the onset of a BM." Time-varying functional connectivity for understanding the neural basis of behavioral microsleeps.
