"High-speed steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI has been demonstrated in several recent studies. This study aimed to investigate some issues regarding feasibility of learning to control an SSVEP-based BCI speller in nave subjects. An experiment with new BCI users was designed to answer the following questions: 1 How many people can use the SSVEP-BCI speller? 2 How much time is required to train the user? 3 Does continuous system use lead to user fatigue and deteriorated BCI performance? The experiment consisted of three tasks including a 40-class BCI spelling task a psychomotor vigilance test PVT task and a test of sleepiness scale. Subjects reaction time RT in the PVT task and the fatigue rank in the sleepiness scale test were used as objective and subjective parameters to evaluate subjects alertness level. Among 11 nave subjects 10 of them fulfilled the 9-block experiment. Four of them showed clear learning effects i.e. an increasing trend of classification accuracy and information transfer rate ITR over time. The remaining subjects showed stable BCI performance during the whole experiment. The results of RT and fatigue rank showed a gradually increasing trend which is not significant across blocks. In summary the results of this study suggest that controlling an SSVEP-based BCI speller is in general feasible to learn by nave subjects after a short training procedure showing no clear performance deterioration related to fatigue."
