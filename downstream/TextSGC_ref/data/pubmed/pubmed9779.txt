We expect novel pathogens to arise due to their fast-paced evolution and new species to be discovered thanks to advances in DNA sequencing and metagenomics. Moreover recent developments in synthetic biology raise concerns that some strains of bacteria could be modified for malicious purposes. Traditional approaches to open-view pathogen detection depend on databases of known organisms which limits their performance on unknown unrecognized and unmapped sequences. In contrast machine learning methods can infer pathogenic phenotypes from single NGS reads even though the biological context is unavailable.
