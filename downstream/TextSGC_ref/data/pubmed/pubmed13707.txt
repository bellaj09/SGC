The hardness recognition is of great significance to tactile sensing and robotic control. The hardness recognition methods based on deep learning have demonstrated a good performance however a huge amount of manually labeled samples which require lots of time and labor costs are necessary for the training of deep neural networks. In order to alleviate this problem a semi-supervised generative adversarial network GAN which requires less manually labeled samples is proposed in this paper. First of all a large number of unlabeled samples are made use of through the unsupervised training of GAN which is used to provide a good initial state to the following model. Afterwards the manually labeled samples corresponding to each hardness level are individually used to train the GAN of which the architecture and initial parameter values are inherited from the unsupervised GAN and augmented by the generator of trained GAN. Finally the hardness recognition network HRN of which the main architecture and initial parameter values are inherited from the discriminator of unsupervised GAN is pretrained by a large number of augmented labeled samples and fine-tuned by manually labeled samples. The hardness recognition result can be obtained online by importing the tactile data captured by the robotic forearm into the trained HRN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly save the manual labeling work while providing an excellent recognition precision for hardness recognition.
