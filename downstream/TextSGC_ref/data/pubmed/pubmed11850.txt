"Hubel and Wiesels study about low areas of the visual cortex VC inspired deep models for invariant pattern recognition. In such models simple and complex layers alternate local feature extraction with subsampling to add invariance to distortion or transformations. However it was shown that to tolerate large changes between examples of the same category the subsampling operation has to discard so much information that the model loses the capability to discriminate between categories. So in practice small changes are tolerated by these layers and afterwards a powerful classifier is introduced to do the rest. By incorporating insights from higher areas of the VC we add to the already used retinotopic step an object-centered step which increases invariance capabilities without losing so much information. By doing so we reduce the need for a powerful data hungry classification layer and thus are able to introduce a simple classification mechanism which is based on selective attention. The resulting model is tested with an invariant pattern recognition task in the MNIST and ETL-1 datasets. We verify that the model is able to achieve better accuracies with less training examples. More specifically on the MNIST test set the model achieves a 100% accuracy when trained with little more than 10% of the training set."
