The cervical spine is a highly flexible anatomy and therefore vulnerable to injuries. Unfortunately a large number of injuries in lateral cervical X-ray images remain undiagnosed due to human errors. Computer-aided injury detection has the potential to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Towards building an automatic injury detection system in this paper we propose a deep learning-based fully automatic framework for segmentation of cervical vertebrae in X-ray images. The framework first localizes the spinal region in the image using a deep fully convolutional neural network. Then vertebra centers are localized using a novel deep probabilistic spatial regression network. Finally a novel shape-aware deep segmentation network is used to segment the vertebrae in the image. The framework can take an X-ray image and produce a vertebrae segmentation result without any manual intervention. Each block of the fully automatic framework has been trained on a set of 124 X-ray images and tested on another 172 images all collected from real-life hospital emergency rooms. A Dice similarity coefficient of 0.84 and a shape error of 1.69\u202fmm have been achieved. Fully automatic cervical vertebrae segmentation framework for X-ray images.
