Background Intratumor heterogeneity in lung cancer may influence outcomes. CT radiomics seeks to assess tumor features to provide detailed imaging features. However CT radiomic features vary according to the reconstruction kernel used for image generation. Purpose To investigate the effect of different reconstruction kernels on radiomic features and assess whether image conversion using a convolutional neural network CNN could improve reproducibility of radiomic features between different kernels. Materials and Methods In this retrospective analysis patients underwent non-contrast material-enhanced and contrast material-enhanced axial chest CT with soft kernel B30f and sharp kernel B50f reconstruction using a single CT scanner from April to June 2017. To convert different kernels without sinogram the CNN model was developed using residual learning and an end-to-end way. Kernel-converted images were generated from B30f to B50f and from B50f to B30f. Pulmonary nodules or masses were semiautomatically segmented and 702 radiomic features tumor intensity texture and wavelet features were extracted. Measurement variability in radiomic features was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient CCC. Results A total of 104 patients were studied including 54 women and 50 men with pulmonary nodules or masses mean age 63.2 years  10.5. The CCC between two readers using the same kernel was 0.92 and 592 of 702 84.3% of the radiomic features were reproducible CCC  0.85; using different kernels the CCC was 0.38 and only 107 of 702 15.2% of the radiomic features were reliable. Texture features and wavelet features were predominantly affected by reconstruction kernel CCC from 0.88 to 0.61 for texture features and from 0.92 to 0.35 for wavelet features. After applying image conversion CCC improved to 0.84 and 403 of 702 57.4% radiomic features were reproducible CCC 0.85 for texture features and 0.84 for wavelet features. Conclusion Chest CT image conversion using a convolutional neural network effectively reduced the effect of two different reconstruction kernels and may improve the reproducibility of radiomic features in pulmonary nodules or masses. Deep Learning-based Image Conversion of CT Reconstruction Kernels Improves Radiomics Reproducibility for Pulmonary Nodules or Masses.
