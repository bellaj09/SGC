"Cognitive researchers assume that learning strategies are related to three types of learning processes: surface learning strategy learning and deep learning. A deep learning approach is widely accepted to be associated with long-term success in medical school contributing to the development of doctors who take desirable approaches to self-directed learning and studying in medical practice. Therefore this study measured how medical students learn and determined whether the use of learning strategies differs between high and low academic performers. In addition we compared medical college students with graduate medical school students with regard to the use of learning strategies." Relationship between Learning Strategies and Academic Achievement in Medical College and Graduate Medical School Students.
