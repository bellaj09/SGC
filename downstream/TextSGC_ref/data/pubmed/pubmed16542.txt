"Both achievement goals and study processing strategies theories have been shown to contribute to the prediction of students academic performance. Existing research studies Fenollar Romn & Cuestas 2007; Liem Lau & Nie 2008; Simons Dewitte & Lens 2004 amalgamating these two theoretical orientations in different causal models have reported their associations with other adaptive strategies and motivational constructs - for example effort expenditure. Despite this recognition there have been to date very few studies that explored the relations between achievement goals study processing strategies effort and academic performance over time."
