We propose a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm for improved estimation of white matter fiber parameters from compressed under-sampled q-space multi-shell diffusion MRI data. The multi-shell data is represented in a dictionary form using a non-monoexponential decay model of diffusion based on continuous gamma distribution of diffusivities. The fiber volume fractions with predefined orientations which are the unknown parameters form the dictionary weights. These unknown parameters are estimated with a linear un-mixing framework using a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. A localized learning of hyperparameters at each voxel and for each possible fiber orientations improves the parameter estimation. Our experiments using synthetic data from the ISBI 2012 HARDI reconstruction challenge and in-vivo data from the Human Connectome Project demonstrate the improvements.
