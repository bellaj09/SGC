"Neuroimaging-based personalized medicine is emerging to characterize brain disorders and their evolution at the patient level. In this chapter we present the most classic methods used to infer large-scale brain connectivity based on functional MRI. We adopt a modeling perspective where every connectivity measure is linked to a specific model that allows to interpret the connectivity estimate. This perspective allows to analyze the quality of retrieved connectivity profiles in terms of modeling error and estimation error. In the first part of the chapter we present undirected functional connectivity Pearsons correlation and MI and effective connectivity partial correlation as well as directed effective connectivity VAR MOU Granger causality DCM. In addition some of these measures correspond to fully connected graphs Pearsons correlation while others to sparse ones MOU DCM where the sparsity can come from the integration of functional and structural data. In the second part we claim that machine learning tools are better suited than null-hypothesis testing to link the estimated connectomes with diagnosis and prognosis of neuropsychiatric diseases. Finally we propose that linear models and features selection are preferable to more complex and nonlinear tools when prediction performance is on a par for building interpretable algorithms to predict clinical variables."
