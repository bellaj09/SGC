Lung cancer is one of the most deadly diseases around the world representing about 26% of all cancers in 2017. The five-year cure rate is only 18% despite great progress in recent diagnosis and treatment. Before diagnosis lung nodule classification is a key step especially since automatic classification can help clinicians by providing a valuable opinion. Modern computer vision and machine learning technologies allow very fast and reliable CT image classification. This research area has become very hot for its high efficiency and labor saving. The paper aims to draw a systematic review of the state of the art of automatic classification of lung nodules. This research paper covers published works selected from the Web of Science IEEEXplore and DBLP databases up to June 2018. Each paper is critically reviewed based on objective methodology research dataset and performance evaluation. Mainstream algorithms are conveyed and generic structures are summarized. Our work reveals that lung nodule classification based on deep learning becomes dominant for its excellent performance. It is concluded that the consistency of the research objective and integration of data deserves more attention. Moreover collaborative works among developers clinicians and other parties should be strengthened. An Appraisal of Lung Nodules Automatic Classification Algorithms for CT Images.
