A brain-computer interface BCI can be used to restore some communication as an alternative interface for patients suffering from locked-in syndrome. However most BCI systems are based on SSVEP P300 or motor imagery and a diversity of BCI protocols would be needed for various types of patients. In this paper we trained the choice saccade CS task in 2 non-human primate monkeys and recorded the brain signal using an epidural electrocorticogram eECoG to predict eye movement direction. We successfully predicted the direction of the upcoming eye movement using a support vector machine SVM with the brain signals after the directional cue onset and before the saccade execution. The mean accuracies were 80% for 2 directions and 43% for 4 directions. We also quantified the spatial-spectro-temporal contribution ratio using SVM recursive feature elimination RFE. The channels over the frontal eye field FEF supplementary eye field SEF and superior parietal lobule SPL area were dominantly used for classification. The -band in the spectral domain and the time bins just after the directional cue onset and just before the saccadic execution were mainly useful for prediction. A saccade based BCI paradigm can be projected in the 2D space and will hopefully provide an intuitive and convenient communication platform for users.
