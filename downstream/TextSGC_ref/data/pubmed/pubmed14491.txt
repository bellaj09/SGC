High-resolution HR magnetic resonance images MRI provide more detailed information for clinical application. However HR MRI is less available because of the longer scan time and lower signal-to-noise ratio. Spatial resolution is one of the key parameters of MRI. The image post-processing technique super-resolution SR is an alternative approach to improve the spatial resolution of MR images. Inspired by advanced deep learning based SR methods we propose an MRI SR model named progressive sub-band residual learning SR network PSR-SRN. The proposed model contains two parallel progressive learning streams where one stream learns on missed high-frequency residuals by sub-band residual learning unit ISRL and the other focuses on reconstructing refined MR image. These two streams complement each other and enable to learn complex mappings between "Low-" and "High-" resolution MR images. Besides we introduce brain-like mechanisms in-depth supervision and local feedback mechanism and progressive sub-band learning strategy to emphasize variant textures of MRI. Compared with traditional and deep learning MRI SR methods our PSR-SRN model shows superior performance. Progressive Sub-Band Residual-Learning Network for MR Image Super Resolution.
