Subject motion in MRI remains an unsolved problem; motion during image acquisition may cause blurring and artifacts that severely degrade image quality. In this work we approach motion correction as an image-to-image translation problem which refers to the approach of training a deep neural network to predict an image in 1 domain from an image in another domain. Specifically the purpose of this work was to develop and train a conditional generative adversarial network to predict artifact-free brain images from motion-corrupted data.
