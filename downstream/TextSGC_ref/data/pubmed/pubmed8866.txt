"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a new version of quantusFLM a software tool for prediction of neonatal respiratory morbidity NRM by ultrasound which incorporates a fully automated fetal lung delineation based on Deep Learning techniques. A set of 790 fetal lung ultrasound images obtained at 24\u2009+\u20090-38\u2009+\u20096 weeks gestation was evaluated. Perinatal outcomes and the occurrence of NRM were recorded. quantusFLM version 3.0 was applied to all images to automatically delineate the fetal lung and predict NRM risk. The test was compared with the same technology but using a manual delineation of the fetal lung and with a scenario where only gestational age was available. The software predicted NRM with a sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive value of 71.0% 94.7% 67.9% and 95.4% respectively with an accuracy of 91.5%. The accuracy for predicting NRM obtained with the same texture analysis but using a manual delineation of the lung was 90.3% and using only gestational age was 75.6%. To sum up automated and non-invasive software predicted NRM with a performance similar to that reported for tests based on amniotic fluid analysis and much greater than that of gestational age alone." Evaluation of an improved tool for non-invasive prediction of neonatal respiratory morbidity based on fully automated fetal lung ultrasound analysis.
