This study integrates visual stimulus presentation and near real-time data processing on a mobile device e.g. a Tablet or a cell-phone to implement a steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI. The goal of this study is to increase the practicability portability and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI for daily use. The accuracy of flickering frequencies on the mobile SSVEP BCI system was tested against that on a laptop/desktop used in our previous studies. This study then analyzed the power spectrum density of the electroencephalogram signals elicited by the visual stimuli rendered on the mobile BCIs. Finally this study performed an online test with the Tablet-based BCI system and obtained an averaged information transfer rate of 33.87 bits/min in three subjects. The current integration leads to a truly practical and ubiquitous SSVEP BCI on mobile devices for real-life applications. Developing stimulus presentation on mobile devices for a truly portable SSVEP-based BCI.
