Incorporation of prior knowledge about organ shape and location is key to improve performance of image analysis approaches. In particular priors can be useful in cases where images are corrupted and contain artefacts due to limitations in image acquisition. The highly constrained nature of anatomical objects can be well captured with learning-based techniques. However in most recent and promising techniques such as CNN-based segmentation it is not obvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge. State-of-the-art methods operate as pixel-wise classifiers where the training objectives do not incorporate the structure and inter-dependencies of the output. To overcome this limitation we propose a generic training strategy that incorporates anatomical prior knowledge into CNNs through a new regularisation model which is trained end-to-end. The new framework encourages models to follow the global anatomical properties of the underlying anatomy e.g. shape label structure via learnt non-linear representations of the shape. We show that the proposed approach can be easily adapted to different analysis tasks e.g. image enhancement segmentation and improve the prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art models. The applicability of our approach is shown on multi-modal cardiac data sets and public benchmarks. In addition we demonstrate how the learnt deep models of 3-D shapes can be interpreted and used as biomarkers for classification of cardiac pathologies.
