Individuals with intellectual disabilities ID such as those with Down syndrome DS sometimes get lost even when walking familiar routes. Among the spatial cognition models addressing the dynamic construction of spatial representations the theoretical framework of Siegel and White 1975 remains a reference. The aim of this work is to use virtual reality technology to a elucidate the spatial deficits associated with ID in reference to the Siegel and White framework and b to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 wayfinding assistive procedures signified landmarks arrows and elevated views. Wayfinding in a virtual environment and Down syndrome: The impact of navigational aids.
