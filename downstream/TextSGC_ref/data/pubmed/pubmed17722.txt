The striatum is a site of integration of neural pathways involved in reinforcement learning. Traditionally inputs from cerebral cortex are thought to be reinforced by dopaminergic afferents signaling the occurrence of biologically salient sensory events. Here we detail an alternative route for short-latency sensory-evoked input to the striatum requiring neither dopamine nor the cortex. Using intracellular recording techniques we measured subthreshold inputs to spiny projection neurons SPNs in urethane-anesthetized rats. Contralateral whole-field light flashes evoked weak membrane potential responses in approximately two-thirds of neurons. However after local disinhibitory injections of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline into the deep layers of the superior colliculus SC but not the overlying visual cortex strong light-evoked depolarizations to the up state emerged at short latency 115 +/- 14 ms in all neurons tested. Dopamine depletion using alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine had no detectable effect on striatal visual responses during SC disinhibition. In contrast local inhibitory injections of GABA agonists muscimol and baclofen into the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus blocked the early visual-evoked up-state transitions in SPNs. Comparable muscimol-induced inhibition of the visual cortex failed to suppress the visual responsiveness of SPNs induced by SC disinhibition. Together these results suggest that short-latency preattentive visual input can reach the striatum not only via the tecto-nigro-striatal route but also through tecto-thalamo-striatal projections. Thus after the onset of a biologically significant visual event closely timed short-latency thalamostriatal glutamate and nigrostriatal dopamine inputs are likely to converge on striatal SPNs providing depolarizing and neuromodulator signals necessary for synaptic plasticity mechanisms.
