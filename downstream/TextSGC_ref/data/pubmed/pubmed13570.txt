The flipped classroom is a student-centered approach to learning that increases active learning for the student compared to traditional classroom-based instruction. In the flipped classroom model students are first exposed to the learning material through didactics outside of the classroom usually in the form of written material voice-over lectures or videos. During the formal teaching time an instructor facilitates student-driven discussion of the material via case scenarios allowing for complex problem solving peer interaction and a deep understanding of the concepts. A successful flipped classroom should have three goals: 1 allow the students to become critical thinkers 2 fully engage students and instructors and 3 stimulate the development of a deep understanding of the material. The flipped classroom model includes teaching and learning methods that can appeal to all four generations in the academic environment. Using the Flipped Classroom to Bridge the Gap to Generation Y.
