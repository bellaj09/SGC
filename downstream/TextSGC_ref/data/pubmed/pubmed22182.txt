Modeling real-world scenes beyond diffuse objects plays an important role in computer graphics virtual reality and other commercial applications. One active approach is projecting binary patterns in order to obtain correspondence and reconstruct a densely sampled 3D model. In such structured-light systems determining whether a pixel is directly illuminated by the projector is essential to decoding the patterns. When a scene has abundant indirect light this process is especially difficult. In this paper we present a robust pixel classification algorithm for this purpose. Our method correctly establishes the lower and upper bounds of the possible intensity values of an illuminated pixel and of a non-illuminated pixel. Based on the two intervals our method classifies a pixel by determining whether its intensity is within one interval but not in the other. Our method performs better than standard method due to the fact that it avoids gross errors during decoding process caused by strong inter-reflections. For the remaining uncertain pixels we apply an iterative algorithm to reduce the inter-reflection within the scene. Thus more points can be decoded and reconstructed after each iteration. Moreover the iterative algorithm is carried out in an adaptive fashion for fast convergence. An adaptive correspondence algorithm for modeling scenes with strong interreflections.
