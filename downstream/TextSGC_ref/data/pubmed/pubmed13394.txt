The traditional taxi prediction methods model the taxi trajectory as a sequence of spatial points. It cannot represent two-dimensional spatial relationships between trajectory points. Therefore many methods transform the taxi GPS trajectory into a two-dimensional image and express the spatial correlations by trajectory image. However the trajectory image may have noise and sparsity according to trajectory data characteristics. So we import image frequency domain processing to taxi destination prediction to reduce noise and sparsity then propose multi-features taxi destination prediction with frequency domain processing MTDP-FD method. Firstly we transform the spatial domain trajectory image into frequency-domain representation by fast Fourier transform and reduce the noise of the trajectory images. Convolutional Neural Network CNN is adapted to extract the deep features from the processed trajectory image as CNN has a significant learning ability to images. Recurrent Neural Network RNN is adapted to predict the taxi destination as multiple hidden layers of RNN can store dependencies between input data to achieve better prediction. The deep features of the trajectory images are combined with trajectory metadata trajectory data to act as the input to RNN. The experiments based on the taxi trajectory dataset of Porto show that the average distance error of MTDP-FD is reduced by 0.14km compared with the existing methods and the GTOHL is the best combination of data and features to improve the prediction accuracy.
