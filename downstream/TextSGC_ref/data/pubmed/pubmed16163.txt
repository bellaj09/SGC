Tumors are continuously evolving biological systems and medical imaging is uniquely positioned to monitor changes throughout treatment. Although qualitatively tracking lesions over space and time may be trivial the development of clinically relevant automated radiomics methods that incorporate serial imaging data is far more challenging. In this study we evaluated deep learning networks for predicting clinical outcomes through analyzing time series CT images of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC.Experimental Design: Dataset A consists of 179 patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation with pretreatment and posttreatment CT images at 1 3 and 6 months follow-up 581 scans. Models were developed using transfer learning of convolutional neural networks CNN with recurrent neural networks RNN using single seed-point tumor localization. Pathologic response validation was performed on dataset B comprising 89 patients with NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgery 178 scans.
