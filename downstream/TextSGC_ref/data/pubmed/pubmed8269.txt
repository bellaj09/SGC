The emerging PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy provides an effective method for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate cancer. To optimize the therapeutic effect and maximize the theranostic benefit there is a need to identify and quantify target lesions prior to treatment. However this is extremely challenging considering that a high number of lesions of heterogeneous size and uptake may distribute in a variety of anatomical context with different backgrounds. This study proposes an end-to-end deep neural network to characterize the prostate cancer lesions on PSMA imaging automatically. A 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT image dataset including 71 patients with metastatic prostate cancer was collected from three medical centres for training and evaluating the proposed network. For proof-of-concept we focus on the detection of bone and lymph node lesions in the pelvic area suggestive for metastases of prostate cancer. The preliminary test on pelvic area confirms the potential of deep learning methods. Increasing the amount of training data may further enhance the performance of the proposed deep learning method.
