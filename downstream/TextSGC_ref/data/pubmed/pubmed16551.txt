Paced deep breathing practices a core component of a number of meditation programs have been shown to enhance a variety of cognitive functions. However their effects on complex processes such as memory and in particular formation and retention of motor memories remain unknown. Here we show that a 30-minute session of deep alternate-nostril breathing remarkably enhances retention of a newly learned motor skill. Healthy humans learned to accurately trace a given path within a fixed time duration. Following learning one group of subjects n\u2009=\u200916 underwent the 30-minute breathing practice while another control group n\u2009=\u200914 rested for the same duration. The breathing-practice group retained the motor skill strikingly better than controls both immediately after the breathing session and also at 24\u2009hours. These effects were confirmed in another group n\u2009=\u200910 that rested for 30\u2009minutes post-learning but practiced breathing after their first retention test; these subjects showed significantly better retention at 24\u2009hours but not 30\u2009minutes. Our results thus uncover for the first time the remarkable facilitatory effects of simple breathing practices on complex functions such as motor memory and have important implications for sports training and neuromotor rehabilitation in which better retention of learned motor skills is highly desirable.
