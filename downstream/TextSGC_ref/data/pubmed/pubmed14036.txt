"Computational protein structure prediction is very important for many applications in bioinformatics. In the process of predicting protein structures it is essential to accurately assess the quality of generated models. Although many single-model quality assessment QA methods have been developed their accuracy is not high enough for most real applications. In this paper a new approach based on C- atoms distance matrix and machine learning methods is proposed for single-model QA and the identification of native-like models. Different from existing energy/scoring functions and consensus approaches this new approach is purely geometry based. Furthermore a novel algorithm based on deep learning techniques called DL-Pro is proposed. For a protein model DL-Pro uses its distance matrix that contains pairwise distances between two residues C- atoms in the model which sometimes is also called contact map as an orientation-independent representation. From training examples of distance matrices corresponding to good and bad models DL-Pro learns a stacked autoencoder network as a classifier. In experiments on selected targets from the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction CASP competition DL-Pro obtained promising results outperforming state-of-the-art energy/scoring functions including OPUS-CA DOPE DFIRE and RW."
