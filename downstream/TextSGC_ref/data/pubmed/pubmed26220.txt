"It is commonly believed that brain has faster reaction speed and higher reaction accuracy on visual-auditory bimodal stimuli than single modal stimuli in current neuropsychological researches while visual-auditory bimodal stimuli VABS do not show corresponding superiority in BCI system. This paper aims at investigating whether semantically congruent stimuli could also get better performance than semantically incongruent stimuli in Brain Computer Interface BCI system. Two VABS based paradigms semantically congruent or incongruent were conducted in this study. 10 healthy subjects participated in the experiment in order to compare the two paradigms. The results indicated that the higher Event-related potential ERP amplitude of semantic incongruent paradigm were observed both in target and non-target stimuli. Nevertheless we didnt observe significant difference of classification accuracy between congruent and incongruent conditions. Most participants showed their preference on semantically congruent condition for less workload needed. This finding demonstrated that semantic congruency has positive effect on behavioral results less workload and insignificant effect on system efficiency." The effect of semantic congruence for visual-auditory bimodal stimuli.
