Impairment of hand function is prevalent among stroke survivors motivating the search for effective rehabilitation therapy. Recent studies have suggested that for upper extremity functional recovery repetitive training with virtual reality is helpful. Repetitive training can be facilitated with assistance from mechanical devices. Thus we have developed a training environment that integrates augmented reality AR with assistive devices for post-stroke hand rehabilitation. The AR element of our environment utilizes head mounted display and virtual objects for reach-and-grasp task training. The assistive device consists of either a body-powered orthosis BPO or a pneumatic-powered device PPD both of which are incorporated into gloves. This environment can be easily set up and calibrated is customizable for individual users and requires active user participation. Additionally it can be used with both real and virtual objects as desired. We are currently conducting pilot case studies to assess ease of use and efficacy. At present one stroke survivor from each of the three training conditions AR-with-BPO AR-with-PPD and AR-only acting as the control has completed the 6-week training paradigm. Preliminary findings suggest user acceptance of the technology and some potential for beneficial effects.
