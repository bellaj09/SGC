"Compared with the normal low dynamic range LDR images the high dynamic range HDR images provide more dynamic range and image details. Although the existing techniques for generating the HDR images have a good effect for static scenes they usually produce artifacts on the HDR images for dynamic scenes. In recent years some learning-based approaches are used to synthesize the HDR images and obtain good results. However there are also many problems including the deficiency of explaining and the time-consuming training process. In this article we propose a novel approach to synthesize multiview HDR images through fuzzy broad learning system FBLS. We use a set of multiview LDR images with different exposure as input and transfer corresponding Takagi-Sugeno TS fuzzy subsystems; then the structure is expanded in a wide sense in the ``enhancement groups which transfer from the TS fuzzy rules with nonlinear transformation. After integrating fuzzy subsystems and enhancement groups with the trained-well weight the HDR image is generated. In FBLS applying the incremental learning algorithm and the pseudoinverse method to compute the weights can greatly reduce the training time. In addition the fuzzy system has better interpretability. In the learning process IF-THEN fuzzy rules can effectively help the model to detect the artifacts and reject them in the final HDR result. These advantages solve the problem of existing deep-learning methods. Furthermore we set up a new dataset of multiview LDR images with corresponding HDR ground truth to train our system. Our experimental results show that our system can synthesize high-quality multiview HDR images which has a higher training speed than other learning methods."
