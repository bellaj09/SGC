"This study attempted to investigate the effects of the target shape and the movement direction on the pointing time using an eye-gaze input system and extend Fitts model so that these factors are incorporated into the model and the predictive power of Fitts model is enhanced. The target shape the target size the movement distance and the direction of target presentation were set as within-subject experimental variables. The target shape included: a circle and rectangles with an aspect ratio of 1:1 1:2 1:3 and 1:4. The movement direction included eight directions: upper lower left right upper left upper right lower left and lower right. On the basis of the data for identifying the effects of the target shape and the movement direction on the pointing time an attempt was made to develop a generalized and extended Fitts model that took into account the movement direction and the target shape. As a result the generalized and extended model was found to fit better to the experimental data and be more effective for predicting the pointing time for a variety of human-computer interaction HCI task using an eye-gaze input system."
