Mixed Reality MR technologies have recently been explored in many areas of Human-Machine Interface HMI such as medicine manufacturing entertainment and education. However MR sickness a kind of motion sickness is caused by sensory conflicts between the real world and virtual world. The purpose of this paper is to find out a new evaluation method of motion and MR sickness. This paper investigates a relationship between the whole-body vibration related to MR technologies and the motion aftereffect MAE phenomenon in the human visual system. This MR environment is modeled after advanced driver assistance systems in near-future vehicles. The seated subjects in the MR simulator were shaken in the pitch direction ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 Hz. Results show that MAE is useful for evaluation of MR sickness incidence. In addition a method to reduce the MR sickness by auditory stimulation is proposed. A preliminary study of MR sickness evaluation using visual motion aftereffect for advanced driver assistance systems.
