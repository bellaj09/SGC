This paper presents a pipeline VLSI design of fast singular value decomposition SVD processor for real-time electroencephalography EEG system based on on-line recursive independent component analysis ORICA. Since SVD is used frequently in computations of the real-time EEG system a low-latency and high-accuracy SVD processor is essential. During the EEG system process the proposed SVD processor aims to solve the diagonal inverse and inverse square root matrices of the target matrices in real time. Generally SVD requires a huge amount of computation in hardware implementation. Therefore this work proposes a novel design concept for data flow updating to assist the pipeline VLSI implementation. The SVD processor can greatly improve the feasibility of real-time EEG system applications such as brain computer interfaces BCIs. The proposed architecture is implemented using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The sample rate of EEG raw data adopts 128 Hz. The core size of the SVD processor is 580580 um2 and the speed of operation frequency is 20MHz. It consumes 0.774mW of power during the 8-channel EEG system per execution time.
