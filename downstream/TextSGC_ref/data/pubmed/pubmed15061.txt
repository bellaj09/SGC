Purpose This study was aimed at investigating the preliminary therapeutic efficacy and usefulness of canoe game-based virtual reality training for stroke patients. Subjects and Methods Ten stroke patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group EG; n=5 or a control group CG; n=5. Patients in both groups participated in a conventional rehabilitation program but those in the EG additionally participated in a 30-min canoe game-based virtual reality training program 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed based on trunk postural stability balance and upper limb motor function. In addition the usefulness of canoe game-based virtual reality training was assessed in the EG and therapist group TG; n=20 which consisted of physical and occupational therapists by using the System Usability Scale SUS. Results Improvements in trunk postural stability balance and upper limb motor function were observed in the EG and CG but were greater in the EG. The mean SUS scores in the EG and TG were 71  5.2 and 74.2  4.8 respectively. Conclusion Canoe game-based virtual reality training is an acceptable and effective intervention for improving trunk postural stability balance and upper limb motor function in stroke patients. Canoe game-based virtual reality training to improve trunk postural stability balance and upper limb motor function in subacute stroke patients: a randomized controlled pilot study.
