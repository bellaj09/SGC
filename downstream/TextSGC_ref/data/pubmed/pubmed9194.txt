"Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize hand-crafted e.g. voxel-based or region-based biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance MR images as feature representations. However these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest defined by experts. Also because of possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper we propose a landmark-based deep feature learning LDFL framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner and then propose a convolutional neural network for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets including the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative ADNI-1 ADNI-2 and the minimal interval resonance imaging in alzheimers disease MIRIAD dataset. Experimental results of both tasks of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval demonstrate that the proposed LDFL method improves the performance of disease classification and MR image retrieval."
