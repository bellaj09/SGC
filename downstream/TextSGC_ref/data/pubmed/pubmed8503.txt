Accurate identification and segmentation of choroidal neovascularization CNV is essential for the diagnosis and management of exudative age-related macular degeneration AMD. Projection-resolved optical coherence tomographic angiography PR-OCTA enables both cross-sectional and en face visualization of CNV. However CNV identification and segmentation remains difficult even with PR-OCTA due to the presence of residual artifacts. In this paper a fully automated CNV diagnosis and segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural networks CNNs is described. This study used a clinical dataset including both scans with and without CNV and scans of eyes with different pathologies. Furthermore no scans were excluded due to image quality. In testing all CNV cases were diagnosed from non-CNV controls with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The mean intersection over union of CNV membrane segmentation was as high as 0.88. By enabling fully automated categorization and segmentation the proposed algorithm should offer benefits for CNV diagnosis visualization monitoring.
