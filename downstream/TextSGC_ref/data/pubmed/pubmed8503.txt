Automatic and precise segmentation and classification of tumor area in medical images is still a challenging task in medical research. Most of the conventional neural network based models usefully connected or convolutional neural networks to perform segmentation and classification. In this research we present deep learning models using long short term memory LSTM and convolutional neural networks ConvNet for accurate brain tumor delineation from benchmark medical images. The two different models that is ConvNet and LSTM networks are trained using the same data set and combined to form an ensemble to improve the results. We used publicly available MICCAI BRATS 2015 brain cancer data set consisting of MRI images of four modalities T1 T2 T1c and FLAIR. To enhance the quality of input images multiple combinations of preprocessing methods such as noise removal histogram equalization and edge enhancement are formulated and best performer combination is applied. To cope with the class imbalance problem class weighting is used in proposed models. The trained models are tested on validation data set taken from the same image set and results obtained from each model are reported. The individual score accuracy of ConvNet is found 75% whereas for LSTM based network produced 80% and ensemble fusion produced 82.29% accuracy.
