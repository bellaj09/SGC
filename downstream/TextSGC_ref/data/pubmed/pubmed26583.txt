The classical ERP-based speller or P300 Speller is one of the most commonly used paradigms in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces BCI. Several alterations to the visual stimuli presentation system have been developed to avoid unfavorable effects elicited by adjacent stimuli. However there has been little if any regard to useful information contained in responses to adjacent stimuli about spatial location of target symbols. This paper aims to demonstrate that combining the classification of non-target adjacent stimuli with standard classification target versus non-target significantly improves classical ERP-based speller efficiency. Non-target adjacent stimuli classification improves performance of classical ERP-based brain computer interface.
