"Information processing in the brain is strongly constrained by anatomical connectivity. However the principles governing the organization of corticocortical connections remain elusive. Here we tested three models of relationships between the organization of cortical structure and features of connections linking 49 areas of the cat cerebral cortex. Factors taken into account were relative cytoarchitectonic differentiation structural model relative spatial position distance model or relative hierarchical position hierarchical model of the areas. Cytoarchitectonic differentiation and spatial distance themselves uncorrelated correlated strongly with the existence of inter-areal connections whereas no correlation was found with relative hierarchical position. Moreover a strong correlation was observed between patterns of laminar projection origin or termination and cytoarchitectonic differentiation. Additionally cytoarchitectonic differentiation correlated with the absolute number of corticocortical connections formed by areas and varied characteristically between different cortical subnetworks including a rich-club module of hub areas. Thus connections between areas of the cat cerebral cortex can to a large part be explained by the two independent factors of relative cytoarchitectonic differentiation and spatial distance of brain regions. As both the structural and distance model were originally formulated in the macaque monkey their applicability in another mammalian species suggests a general principle of global cortical organization."
