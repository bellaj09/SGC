"Cognitive dysfunction caused by brain injury often prevents a patient from achieving a healthy and high quality of life. By now each cognitive function is assessed precisely by neuropsychological tests. However it is also important to provide an overall assessment of the patients ability in their everyday life. We have developed a Virtual Shopping Test VST using virtual reality technology. The objective of this study was to clarify 1 the significance of VST by comparing VST with other conventional tests 2 the applicability of VST to brain-damaged patients and 3 the performance of VST in relation to age differences." A virtual shopping test for realistic assessment of cognitive function.
