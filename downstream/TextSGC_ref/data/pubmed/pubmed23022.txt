This study was an open-label single-group treatment-development project aimed at developing and testing a method for applying virtual reality exposure therapy VRET to active duty service members diagnosed with combat post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. Forty-two service members with PTSD were enrolled and 20 participants completed treatment. The PTSD Checklist-Military version Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used as outcome measures. Of those who completed post-treatment assessment 75% had experienced at least a 50% reduction in PTSD symptoms and no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD at post treatment. Average PSTD scores decreased by 50.4% depression scores by 46.6% and anxiety scores by 36%. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that statistically significant improvements in PTSD depression and anxiety occurred over the course of treatment and were maintained at follow up. There were no adverse events associated with VRET treatment. This study provides preliminary support for the use of VRET in combat-related PTSD. Further study will be needed to determine the wider utility of the method and to determine if it offers advantages over other established PTSD treatment modalities. Development and testing of virtual reality exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in active duty service members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
