In the field of health care knowledge and clinical reasoning are key with regard to quality and confidence in decision making. The development of knowledge and clinical reasoning is influenced not only by students\ intrinsic factors but also by extrinsic factors such as satisfaction with taught content pedagogic resources and pedagogic methods and the nature of the objectives and challenges proposed. Nowadays professors play the role of learning facilitators rather than simple "lecturers" and face students as active learners who are capable of attributing individual meanings to their personal goals challenges and experiences to build their own knowledge over time. Innovations in health simulation technologies have led to clinical virtual simulation. Clinical virtual simulation is the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen and involves real people operating simulated systems. It is a type of simulation that places people in a central role through their exercising of motor control skills decision skills and communication skills using virtual patients in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical virtual simulation can provide a pedagogical strategy and can act as a facilitator of knowledge retention clinical reasoning improved satisfaction with learning and finally improved self-efficacy. However little is known about its effectiveness with regard to satisfaction self-efficacy knowledge retention and clinical reasoning.
