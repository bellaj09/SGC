Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from common viruses. This poses a challenge for early detection during triage at the emergency department ED. Over a 3-month period our ED aimed to minimise nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment PPE for healthcare workers HCWs METHODS: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 was assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED based on high-risk "fever areas" and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. Containing COVID-19 in the emergency room: the role of improved case detection and segregation of suspect cases.
