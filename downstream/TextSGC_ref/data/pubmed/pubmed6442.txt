Physiological aging affects brain structure and function impacting morphology connectivity and performance. However whether some brain connectivity metrics might reflect the age of an individual is still unclear. Here we collected brain images from healthy participants N\u2009=\u2009155 ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional resting state and structural tractography connectivity matrices both data sets combined to obtain different connectivity features. We then calculated the brain connectome age-an age estimator resulting from a multi-scale methodology applied to the structure-function connectome and compared it to the chronological age ChA. Our results were twofold. First we found that aging widely affects the connectivity of multiple structures such as anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices basal ganglia thalamus insula cingulum hippocampus parahippocampus occipital cortex fusiform precuneus and temporal pole. Second we found that the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas also known as the fronto-striato-thalamic FST circuit makes the major contribution to age estimation. In conclusion our results highlight the key role played by the FST circuit in the process of healthy aging. Notably the same methodology can be generally applied to identify the structural-functional connectivity patterns correlating to other biomarkers than ChA. Structure-function multi-scale connectomics reveals a major role of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit in brain aging.
