We introduce a new method for computerized real-time evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement FAI. In contrast to previously presented stress analyses this method is based on two types of predictions of penetration depths for two rotating bodies: curvilinear and radial penetration depth. This intuitive method allows the analysis of both bony and soft tissue structures such as cartilage and acetabular labrum in real time. Characteristic penetration depth patterns were found for different subtypes of FAI such as cam and pincer pathologies. In addition correlation between the penetration depths estimated by applying this method and the existing contact stresses estimated by applying the finite element method of various hip morphologies were found. A strong correlation with predicted stress values existed with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.91 for the curvilinear and 0.80 for the radial penetration method. The results show that the penetration depth method is a promising fast and accurate method for quantification and diagnosis of FAI.
