Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery should be within the armamentarium of every thoracic surgeon today. Rapid expansion in this field has led to an unprecedented demand from practising surgeons to acquire the new skills. Five levels of training can be described: 1 didactic lectures; 2 demonstration of procedures; 3 practice on simulators; 4 animal surgery; 5 preceptorship. The first four are usually provided in training courses or workshops while the last requires proctering or attachment to a training centre. The ultimate goal is to integrate all these into the surgical residency programs. Developments in the virtual reality module may revolutionise training in the future.
