"Objective. Tactile P300 brain-computer interfaces BCIs can be manipulated by users who only need to focus their attention on a single-target stimulus within a stream of tactile stimuli. To date a multitude of tactile P300 BCIs have been proposed. In this study our main purpose is to explore and investigate the effects of visual attention on a tactile P300 BCI. Approach. We designed a conventional tactile P300 BCI where vibration stimuli were provided by five stimulators and two of them were fixed on target locations on the participants left and right wrists. Two conditions one condition with visual attention and the other condition without visual attention were tested by eleven healthy participants. Main Results. Our results showed that when participants visually attended to the location of target stimulus significantly higher classification accuracies and information transfer rates were obtained both for p < 0.05. Furthermore participants reported that visually attending to the stimulus made it easier to identify the target stimulus in random sequences of vibration stimuli. Significance. These findings suggest that visual attention has positive effects on both tactile P300 BCI performance and user-evaluation." Effects of Visual Attention on Tactile P300 BCI.
