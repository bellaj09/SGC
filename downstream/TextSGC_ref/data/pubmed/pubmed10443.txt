Automatic and accurate three-dimensional 3D segmentation of liver with severe diseases from computed tomography CT images is a challenging task. Fully convolutional networks FCNs have emerged as powerful tools for automatic semantic segmentation with multiple potential applications in medical imaging. However the use of a large receptive field and multiple pooling layers in the network leads to poor localization around object boundaries. The network usually makes pixel-wise prediction independently making it difficult to respect local label consistency and enforce the smoothness of the object boundary. Automatic liver segmentation by integrating fully convolutional networks into active contour models.
