"Deep brain stimulation DBS is currently being used as a treatment for symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD. Tracking symptom severity progression and deciding the optimal stimulation parameters for people with PD is extremely difficult. This study presents a sensor system that can quantify the three cardinal motor symptoms of PD - rigidity bradykinesia and tremor. The first phase of this study assesses whether data recorded from the system during physical examinations can be used to correlate to clinicians severity score using supervised machine learning ML models. The second phase concludes whether the sensor system can distinguish differences before and after DBS optimisation by a clinician when Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS scores did not change. An average accuracy of 90.9 % was achieved by the best ML models in the first phase when correlating sensor data to clinicians scores. Adding on to this in the second phase of the study the sensor system was able to pick up discernible differences before and after DBS optimisation sessions in instances where UPDRS scores did not change."
