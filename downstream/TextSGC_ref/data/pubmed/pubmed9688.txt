Ultrasound-based fetal biometric measurements such as head circumference HC and biparietal diameter BPD are frequently used to evaluate gestational age and diagnose fetal central nervous system pathology. Because manual measurements are operator-dependent and time-consuming much research is being actively conducted on automated methods. However the existing automated methods are still not satisfactory in terms of accuracy and reliability owing to difficulties dealing with various artefacts in ultrasound images. Automatic evaluation of fetal head biometry from ultrasound images using machine learning.
