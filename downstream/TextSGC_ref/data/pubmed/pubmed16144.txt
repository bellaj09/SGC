In Pavlovian eyelid conditioning and adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex cerebellar cortex lesions fail to completely abolish previously acquired learning indicating an additional site of plasticity in the deep cerebellar or vestibular nucleus. Three forms of plasticity are known to occur in the deep cerebellar nuclei: formation of new synapses plasticity at existing synapses and changes in intrinsic excitability. Only a cell-wide increase in excitability predicts that learning should generalize broadly from a training stimulus to other stimuli capable of supporting learning whereas the alternatives predict that learning should be relatively specific to the training stimulus. Here we show that deep nucleus plasticity as assessed by conditioned eyelid responses produced without input from the cerebellar cortex is relatively specific to the training conditioned stimulus CS. We trained rabbits to a tone or light CS with periorbital stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus US and pharmacologically disconnected the cerebellar cortex during a posttraining generalization test. The short-latency conditioned responses unmasked by this treatment showed strong decrement along the dimension of auditory frequency and did not generalize across stimulus modalities. These results cannot be explained solely by a cell-wide increase in the excitability of deep nucleus neurons and imply that an input-specific mechanism in the deep cerebellar nucleus operates as well.
