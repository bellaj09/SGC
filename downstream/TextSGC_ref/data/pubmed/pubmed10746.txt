Human age estimation is an important and difficult challenge. Different biomarkers and numerous approaches have been studied for biological age estimation each with its advantages and limitations. In this work we investigate whether physical activity can be exploited for biological age estimation for adult humans. We introduce an approach based on deep convolutional long short term memory ConvLSTM to predict biological age using human physical activity as recorded by a wearable device. We also demonstrate five deep biological age estimation models including the proposed approach and compare their performance on the NHANES physical activity dataset. Results on mortality hazard analysis using both the Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that the proposed method for estimating biological age outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. This work has significant implications in combining wearable sensors and deep learning techniques for improved health monitoring for instance in a mobile health environment. Mobile health mHealth applications provide patients caregivers and administrators continuous information about a patient even outside the hospital. Deep Learning using Convolutional LSTM estimates Biological Age from Physical Activity.
