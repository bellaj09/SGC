Neurological diseases causing motor/cognitive impairments are among the most common causes of adult-onset disability. More than one billion of people are affected worldwide and this number is expected to increase in upcoming years because of the rapidly aging population. The frequent lack of complete recovery makes it desirable to develop novel neurorehabilitative treatments suited to the patients and better targeting the specific disability. To date rehabilitation therapy can be aided by the technological support of robotic-based therapy non-invasive brain stimulation and neural interfaces. In this perspective we will review the above methods by referring to the most recent advances in each field. Then we propose and discuss current and future approaches based on the combination of the above. As pointed out in the recent literature by combining traditional rehabilitation techniques with neuromodulation biofeedback recordings and/or novel robotic and wearable assistive devices several studies have proven it is possible to sensibly improve the amount of recovery with respect to traditional treatments. We will then discuss the possible applied research directions to maximize the outcome of a neurorehabilitation therapy which should include the personalization of the therapy based on patient and clinician needs and preferences.
