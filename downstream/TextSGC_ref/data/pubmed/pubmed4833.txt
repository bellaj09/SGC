Understanding the topographical organization of the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry is of pivotal importance because of the spreading of techniques such as DBS and more recently MR-guided focused ultrasound for the treatment of movement disorders. A growing body of evidence has described both direct cortico- and dento-pallidal connections although the topographical organization in vivo of these pathways in the human brain has never been reported.
