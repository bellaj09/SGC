Any motor action is by nature potentially accompanied by human errors. In order to facilitate development of error-tailored Brain-Computer Interface BCI correction systems we focused on internal human-initiated errors and investigated EEG correlates of user outcome successes and errors during a continuous 3D virtual tennis game against a computer player. We used a multisensory 3D highly immersive environment. Missing and repelling the tennis ball were considered as \error\ miss and \success\ repel. Unlike most previous studies where the environment "encouraged" the participant to perform a mistake here errors happened naturally resulting from motor-perceptual-cognitive processes of incorrect estimation of the ball kinematics and can be regarded as user internal self-initiated errors. Results show distinct and well-defined Event-Related Potentials ERPs embedded in the ongoing EEG that differ across conditions by waveforms scalp signal distribution maps source estimation results sLORETA and time-frequency patterns establishing a series of typical features that allow valid discrimination between user internal outcome success and error. The significant delay in latency between positive peaks of error- and success-related ERPs suggests a cross-talk between top-down and bottom-up processing represented by an outcome recognition process in the context of the game world. Success-related ERPs had a central scalp distribution while error-related ERPs were centro-parietal. The unique characteristics and sharp differences between EEG correlates of error/success provide the crucial components for an improved BCI system. The features of the EEG waveform can be used to detect user action outcome to be fed into the BCI correction system.
