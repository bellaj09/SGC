"Promoting functional recovery after stroke requires collaborative and innovative approaches to neurorehabilitation research. Task-oriented training TOT approaches that include challenging adaptable and meaningful activities have led to successful outcomes in several large-scale multisite definitive trials. This along with recent technological advances of virtual reality and robotics provides a fertile environment for furthering clinical research in neurorehabilitation. Both virtual reality and robotics make use of multimodal sensory interfaces to affect human behavior. In the therapeutic setting these systems can be used to quantitatively monitor manipulate and augment the users interaction with their environment with the goal of promoting functional recovery. This article describes recent advances in virtual reality and robotics and the synergy with best clinical practice. Additionally we describe the promise shown for automated assessments and in-home activity-based interventions. Finally we propose a broader approach to ensuring that technology-based assessment and intervention complement evidence-based practice and maintain a patient-centered perspective." Virtual reality and robotics for stroke rehabilitation: where do we go from here?
