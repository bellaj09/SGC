Ultrasound-guided biopsy is one of the most fundamental but difficult skills to acquire in interventional radiology. Intensive training especially in the needle insertion is required for trainee radiologists to perform safe procedures. In this paper we propose a virtual reality simulation system to facilitate the training of radiologists and physicians in this procedures. Key issues addressed include a 3D anatomical model reconstruction data fusion of multiple ultrasound volumes and computed tomography CT realistic rendering interactive navigation and haptic feedbacks in six degrees of freedom DOF. Simulated ultrasound imagery based on real ultrasound data is presented to users in real-time while performing an examination on the needle placement into a virtual anatomical model. Our system delivers a realistic haptic feeling for trainees throughout the simulated needle insertion procedure permitting repeated practices with no danger to patients.
