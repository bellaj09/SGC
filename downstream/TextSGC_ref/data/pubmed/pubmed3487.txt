"Structural and functional connectivity methods are changing how researchers conceptualize and explore neuropsychiatric disease. Here we summarize emerging evidence of large-scale network dysfunction in Alzheimers disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia focusing on the divergent impact these disorders have on the default mode network and the salience network. We update a working model for understanding the functions of these networks within a broader anatomical context and highlight the relevance of this model for understanding psychiatric illness. Finally we look ahead to persistent challenges in the application of network-based imaging methods to patients with Alzheimers disease behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Recent advances and persistent needs are discussed with an eye toward anticipating the hurdles that must be overcome for a network-based framework to clarify the biology of psychiatric illness and aid in the drug discovery process."
