Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI-based functional connectivity networks are often constructed by thresholding a correlation matrix of nodal time courses. In a typical thresholding approach known as hard thresholding a single threshold is applied to the entire correlation matrix to identify edges representing superthreshold correlations. However hard thresholding is known to produce a network with uneven allocation of edges resulting in a fragmented network with a large number of disconnected nodes. It is suggested that an alternative network thresholding approach node-wise thresholding is able to overcome these problems. To examine this various network characteristics were compared between networks constructed by hard thresholding and node-wise thresholding with publicly available resting-state fMRI data from 123 healthy young subjects. It was found that networks constructed with hard thresholding included a large number of disconnected nodes while such network fragmentation was not observed in networks formed with node-wise thresholding. Moreover in hard thresholding networks fragmentized modular organization was observed characterized by a large number of small modules. On the contrary such modular fragmentation was not observed in node-wise thresholding networks producing modules that were robust at any threshold and highly consistent across subjects. These results indicate that node-wise thresholding may lead to less fragmented networks. Moreover node-wise thresholding enables robust characterization of network properties without much influence by the selection of a threshold.
