Computer-based simulation for medical procedures training has been gaining relevance as well the use of haptic devices for developing fine motor skills in such simulations. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the state-of-the-art in virtual needle insertion training simulation based on haptic interaction. A systematic review method was applied to gather documentation that enables a rigorous audit of the process stages and results. We established a classification system based on certain characteristics of the studies analyzed including: main procedures and target body regions in medical applications; ways to generate haptic feedback; devices; types of environment; and user validation. In addition the review aimed to identify challenges and trends in the field indicating research opportunities. Results showed the predominance of Virtual Reality and commercial haptic devices in simulations. Since most studies are based on subjective tests finding ways to objectively evaluate haptic interaction perception represents a promising research field. We also found that devices and ways to generate haptic feedback and to represent tissue and needle behavior pose limitations and challenges for computer simulation. Finally the realism provided is a constant concern in the validation process which brings another problem: defining and performing suitable user tests. Haptic interaction for needle insertion training in medical applications: The state-of-the-art.
