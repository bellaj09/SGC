Diffusion-weighted MRI DW-MRI the only non-invasive technique for probing human brain white matter structures in vivo has been widely used in both fundamental studies and clinical applications. Many studies have utilized diffusion tensor imaging DTI and tractography approaches to explore the topological properties of human brain anatomical networks by using the single tensor model the basic model to quantify DTI indices and tractography. However the conventional DTI technique does not take into account contamination by the cerebrospinal fluid CSF which has been known to affect the estimated DTI measures and tractography in the single tensor model. Previous studies have shown that the Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery FLAIR technique can suppress the contribution of the CSF to the DW-MRI signal. We acquired DTI datasets from twenty-two subjects using both FLAIR-DTI and conventional DTI non-FLAIR-DTI techniques constructed brain anatomical networks using deterministic tractography and compared the topological properties of the anatomical networks derived from the two types of DTI techniques. Although the brain anatomical networks derived from both types of DTI datasets showed small-world properties we found that the brain anatomical networks derived from the FLAIR-DTI showed significantly increased global and local network efficiency compared with those derived from the conventional DTI. The increases in the network regional topological properties derived from the FLAIR-DTI technique were observed in CSF-filled regions including the postcentral gyrus periventricular regions inferior frontal and temporal gyri and regions in the visual cortex. Because brain anatomical networks derived from conventional DTI datasets with tractography have been widely used in many studies our findings may have important implications for studying human brain anatomical networks derived from DW-MRI data and tractography. Increased global and local efficiency of human brain anatomical networks detected with FLAIR-DTI compared to non-FLAIR-DTI.
