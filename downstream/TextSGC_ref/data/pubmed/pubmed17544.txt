"Some research on literacy acquisition suggests that implicit learning processes may be related to reading and writing proficiency in English which is a deep orthography. However little research has been done to determine if the same is true in shallow orthographies. Here we investigated whether the implicit learning ability of third grade Spanish speaking children was related to their reading and writing abilities. Twenty eight children viewed pseudowords which all adhered to untaught graphotactic rules and were later assessed to determine their implicit learning of these rules. The childrens reading and writing abilities were also assessed using standardized tests. No correlations were found between the participants level of implicit learning and their performance on reading tasks or on a pseudoword writing task suggesting that implicit learning is not strongly related to the acquisition of phonological regularities in a shallow orthography. A correlation was found between recognition of previously seen exemplars and the ability to spell inconsistent words which require word specific knowledge to resolve the spelling inconsistencies. This result suggests that implicit learning mechanisms may play a role in the acquisition of lexical knowledge and thus in writing proficiency."
