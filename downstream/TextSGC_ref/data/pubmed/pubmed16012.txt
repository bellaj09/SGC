"In this paper we explore the application of artificial neural network deep learning methods to the problem of detecting chemical-protein interactions in PubMed abstracts. We present here a system using multiple Long Short Term Memory layers to analyse candidate interactions to determine whether there is a relation and which type. A particular feature of our system is the use of unlabelled data both to pre-train word embeddings and also pre-train LSTM layers in the neural network. On the BioCreative VI CHEMPROT test corpus our system achieves an F score of 61.51% 56.10% precision 67.84% recall."
