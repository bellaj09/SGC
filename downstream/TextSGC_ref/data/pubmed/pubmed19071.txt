Craniosynostosis is a premature cranial suture junction and requires a craniectomy to decrease cranial compression and remodel the affected areas of the skull. However mastering these neurosurgical procedures requires many years of supervised training. The use of surgical simulation can reduce the risk of intraoperative error. The authors propose a new instrument for neurosurgical education which mixes reality with virtual and realistic simulation for repair of craniosynostosis scaphocephaly type. Development and evaluation of a new pediatric mixed-reality model for neurosurgical training.
