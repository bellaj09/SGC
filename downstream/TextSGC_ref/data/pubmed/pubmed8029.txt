The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations in addition to distances and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction CASP13- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation CAMEO-derived sets the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the "ideality" of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems. Improved protein structure prediction using predicted interresidue orientations.
