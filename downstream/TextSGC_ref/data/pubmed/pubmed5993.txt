"Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that trait emotional intelligence TEI is associated with components of the neural network involved in social cognition SCN and somatic marker circuitry SMC. Our study is the first to investigate the association of TEI with resting-state functional connectivity RSFC between the key nodes of SCN and SMC medial prefromtal cortex mPFC and bilateral anterior insula AI respectively and other brain regions. We found that a the intrapersonal factor of TEI was negatively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the anterior part of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC b the TEI interpersonal factor score was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the lingual gyrus and c total TEI was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the precuneus as well as d between the left AI and the middle part of the right DLPFC. Taken together with previous study findings our findings can be comprehensively understood as neural mechanisms of SCN and SMC components are associated with TEI. In particular the fluent interaction between SCNs two key nodes mPFC and precuneus/PCC as well as between DMNs two key nodes is suggested to be crucial for total TEI. Our study also indicated that a a clear functional separation between the two key nodes of the two major intrinsic networks DMN and the task-positive network mPFC and DLPFC is important for higher intrapersonal TEI b brain interactions involving vision-related areas lingual gyrus and the key node of SCN mPFC are important for interpersonal TEI and c control of DLPFC over the key node of SMC AI is important for total TEI."
