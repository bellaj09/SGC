At medical checkups or mass screenings the fundus examination is effective for early detection of systemic hypertension arteriosclerosis diabetic retinopathy etc. In most cases ophthalmologists and physicians grade retinal images by the condition of the blood vessels lesions. However human observation does not provide quantitative results thus blood vessel analysis is an important process in determining hypertension and arteriosclerosis quantitatively. This chapter describes the latest automated blood vessel extraction using the deep convolution neural network DCNN. Diabetic retinopathy is a common cardiovascular disease and a major factor in blindness. Therefore early detection of diabetic retinopathy is very important to preventing blindness. A microaneurysm is an initial sign of diabetic retinopathy and much research has been conducted for microaneurysm detection. This chapter also describes diabetic retinopathy detection and automated microaneurysm detection using the DCNN. Retinopathy Analysis Based on Deep Convolution Neural Network.
