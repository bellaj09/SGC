Cannabinoid CB1 receptors CB1R are widely distributed in the brains of many vertebrates but whether their functions are conserved is unknown. The weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus Apt has been well studied for its brain structure behavior sensory processing and learning and memory. It therefore offers an attractive model for comparative studies of CB1R functions. We sequenced partial AptCB1R mRNAs and performed in situ hybridization to localize its expression. Partial AptCB1R protein sequence was highly conserved to zebrafish 90.7% and mouse 81.9% orthologs. AptCB1R mRNA was highly expressed in the telencephalon. Subpallial neurons dorsal central intermediate regions and part of the ventral region Vd/Vc/Vi and Vv expressed high levels of AptCB1R transcript. The central region of dorsocentral telencephalon DCcore  strongly expressed CB1R mRNA; cells in DCcore project to midbrain regions involved in electrosensory/visual function. The lateral and rostral regions of DC surrounding DCcore DCshell  lack AptCB1R mRNA. The rostral division of the dorsomedial telencephalon DM1 highly expresses AptCB1R mRNA. In dorsolateral division DL AptCB1R mRNA was expressed in a gradient that declined in a rostrocaudal manner. In diencephalon AptCB1R RNA probe weakly stained the central-posterior CP and prepacemaker PPn nuclei. In mesencephalon AptCB1R mRNA is expressed in deep layers of the dorsal electrosensory torus semicircularis TSd. In hindbrain AptCB1R RNA probe weakly labeled inhibitory interneurons in the electrosensory lateral line lobe ELL. Unlike mammals only few cerebellar granule cells expressed AptCB1R transcripts and these were located in the center of eminentia granularis pars posterior EGp a cerebellar region involved in feedback to ELL.
