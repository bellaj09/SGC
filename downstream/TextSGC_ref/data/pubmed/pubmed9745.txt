Video-based person re-identification re-ID refers to matching people across camera views from arbitrary unaligned video footages. Existing methods rely on supervision signals to optimise a projected space under which the distances between inter/intra-videos are maximised/minimised. However this demands exhaustively labelling people across camera views rendering them unable to be scaled in large networked cameras. Also it is noticed that learning effective video representations with view invariance is not explicitly addressed for which features exhibit different distributions otherwise. Thus matching videos for person re-ID demands flexible models to capture the dynamics in time-series observations and learn view-invariant representations with access to limited labeled training samples. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot deep learning approach to videobased person re-ID to learn comparable representations that are discriminative and view-invariant. The proposed method is developed on the variational recurrent neural networks VRNNs and trained adversarially to produce latent variables with temporal dependencies that are highly discriminative yet view-invariant in matching persons. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets we empirically show the capability of our method in creating view-invariant temporal features and state-of-the-art performance achieved by our method.
