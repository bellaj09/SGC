Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and is one of the causes of "neurophobia" whose main implication is a negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the last decades several educational strategies have been identified to improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January 2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students. Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long-term retention knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected studies 44.4% have used three-dimensional 3D teaching tools 16.6% near peer teaching tool 5.55% flipped classroom tool 5.55% applied neuroanatomy elective course 5.55% equivalence-based instruction-rote learning 5.55% mobile augmented reality 5.55% inquiry-based clinical case 5.55% cadaver dissection and 5.55% Twitter. The high in-between study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching neuroanatomy. "Neuroanatomy the Achilles Heel of Medical Students.
