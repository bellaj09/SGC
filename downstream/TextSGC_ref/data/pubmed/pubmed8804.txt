"Spectrum handoff is one of the key techniques in a cognitive radio system. In order to improve the agility and the reliability of spectrum handoffs as well as the system throughput in hybrid cognitive radio networks HCRNs combing interweave mode with underlay mode a predictive or proactive spectrum handoff scheme based on a deep Q-network DQN for HCRNs is proposed in this paper. In the proposed spectrum handoff approach spectrum handoff success rate is introduced into an optimal spectrum resource allocation model to ensure the reliability of spectrum handoff and the closed-form expression for the spectrum handoff success rate is obtained based on the Poisson distribution. Furthermore we exploit the transfer learning strategy to further improve the DQN learning process and finally achieve a priority sequence of target available channels for spectrum handoffs which can maximize the overall HCRNs throughput while satisfying constraints on secondary users interference with primary user limits on the spectrum handoff success rate and the secondary users performance requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed spectrum handoff scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art spectrum handoff algorithms based on predictive decision in terms of the convergence rate the handoff success rate and the system throughput."
