Character of clinical skills training is always influenced by technical improvement and cultural changes. Over the last years two trends have changed the way of traditional apprenticeship-style training in regional anaesthesia: firstly the development in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia and secondly the reduced acceptance of using patients as mannequins for invasive techniques. Against this background simulation techniques are explored ranging from simple low-fidelity part-task training models to train skills in needle application to highly sophisticated virtual reality models  the full range is covered. This review tries to discuss all available options with benefits and neglects. The task in clinical practice will be in choosing the right level of sophistication for the desired approach and trainee level. However the transfer of simulated skills to clinical practice has not been evaluated. It has to be proven whether simulation-trained skills could as a last consequence reduce the risk to patients. First of all: Do not harm! Use of simulation for the training of regional anaesthesia techniques: Which skills can be trained without the patient as substitute for a mannequin.
