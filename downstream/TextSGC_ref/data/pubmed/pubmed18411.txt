Virtual reality is recently finding its way in forensic work. The required 3D data is nowadays a standard dataset available in many cases from homicide to traffic collisions including not only data from the scene but also of weaponry and involved persons. Current investigations use these 3D data to replicated the incident and as discussion base for forensic personal. However modifying the scene on a 2D viewport is often cumbersome due to the loss of the third dimension. Also to perform the modifications on the scene a 3D operator is often required. Virtual reality might improve this step by its easy use and by visualising the third dimension. This publication presents a variety of tools which can be used in forensic investigations. Additionally to the tools examples of forensic use of these tools will be presented showing that already a small number of tools support a variety of forensic applications. A toolbox for the rapid prototyping of crime scene reconstructions in virtual reality.
