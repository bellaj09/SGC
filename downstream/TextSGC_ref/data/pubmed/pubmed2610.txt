"Many recent literature studies have revealed interesting dynamics patterns of functional brain networks derived from fMRI data. However it has been rarely explored how functional networks spatially overlap or interact and how such connectome-scale network interactions temporally evolve. To explore these unanswered questions this paper presents a novel framework for spatio-temporal modeling of connectome-scale functional brain network interactions via two main effective computational methodologies. First to integrate pool and compare brain networks across individuals and their cognitive states under task performances we designed a novel group-wise dictionary learning scheme to derive connectome-scale consistent brain network templates that can be used to define the common reference space of brain network interactions. Second the temporal dynamics of spatial network interactions is modeled by a weighted time-evolving graph and then a data-driven unsupervised learning algorithm based on the dynamic behavioral mixed-membership model DBMM is adopted to identify behavioral patterns of brain networks during the temporal evolution process of spatial overlaps/interactions. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project HCP task fMRI data showed that our methods can reveal meaningful diverse behavior patterns of connectome-scale network interactions. In particular those networks behavior patterns are distinct across HCP tasks such as motor working memory language and social tasks and their dynamics well correspond to the temporal changes of specific task designs. In general our framework offers a new approach to characterizing human brain function by quantitative description for the temporal evolution of spatial overlaps/interactions of connectome-scale brain networks in a standard reference space."
