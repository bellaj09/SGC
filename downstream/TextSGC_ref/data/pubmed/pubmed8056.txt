"Magnetic resonance imaging MRI modalities have achieved an increasingly important role in the clinical work-up of chronic kidney diseases CKD. This comprises among others assessment of hemodynamic parameters by arterial spin labeling ASL or dynamic contrast-enhanced DCE- MRI. Especially in the latter images or volumes of the kidney are acquired over time for up to several minutes. Therefore they are hampered by motion e.g. by pulsation peristaltic or breathing motion. This motion can hinder subsequent image analysis to estimate hemodynamic parameters like renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate GFR. To overcome motion artifacts in time-resolved renal MRI a wide range of strategies have been proposed. Renal image registration approaches could be grouped into 1 image acquisition techniques 2 post-processing methods or 3 a combination of image acquisition and post-processing approaches. Despite decades of progress the translation in clinical practice is still missing. The aim of the present article is to discuss the existing literature on renal image registration techniques and show todays limitations of the proposed techniques that hinder clinical translation. This paper includes transformation criterion function and search types as traditional components and emerging registration technologies based on deep learning. The current trend points towards faster registrations and more accurate results. However a standardized evaluation of image registration in renal MRI is still missing."
