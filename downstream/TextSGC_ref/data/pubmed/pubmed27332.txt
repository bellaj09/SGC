Nonvolatile flexible artificial synapses that can be used for brain-inspired computing are highly desirable for emerging applications such as human-machine interfaces soft robotics medical implants and biological studies. Printed devices based on organic materials are very promising for these applications due to their sensitivity to ion injection intrinsic printability biocompatibility and great potential for flexible/stretchable electronics. Herein we report the experimental realization of a nonvolatile artificial synapse using organic polymers in a scalable fabrication process. The three-terminal electrochemical neuromorphic device successfully emulates the key features of biological synapses: long-term potentiation/depression spike timing-dependent plasticity learning rule paired-pulse facilitation and ultralow energy consumption. The artificial synapse network exhibits an excellent endurance against bending tests and enables a direct emulation of logic gates which shows the feasibility of using them in futuristic hierarchical neural networks. Based on our demonstration of 100 distinct nonvolatile conductance states we achieved a high accuracy in pattern recognition and face classification neural network simulations.
