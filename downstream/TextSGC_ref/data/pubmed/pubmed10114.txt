Deep learning models and specifically Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs are becoming the leading approach in many computer vision tasks including medical image analysis. Nevertheless the CNN training usually requires large sets of supervised data which are often difficult and expensive to obtain in the medical field. To address the lack of annotated images image generation is a promising method which is becoming increasingly popular in the computer vision community. In this paper we present a new approach to the semantic segmentation of bacterial colonies in agar plate images based on deep learning and synthetic image generation to increase the training set size. Indeed semantic segmentation of bacterial colony is the basis for infection recognition and bacterial counting in Petri plate analysis. Image generation by GAN and style transfer for agar plate image segmentation.
