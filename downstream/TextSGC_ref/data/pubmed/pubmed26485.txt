To relax the presumption of strictly linear patterns in the common spatial patterns CSP we studied the kernel CSP KCSP. A new multi-class KCSP MKCSP approach was proposed in this paper which combines the kernel approach with multi-class CSP technique. In this approach we used kernel spatial patterns for each class against all others and extracted signal components specific to one condition from EEG data sets of multiple conditions. Then we performed classification using the Logistic linear classifier. Brain computer interface BCI competition III_3a was used in the experiment. Through the experiment it can be proved that this approach could decompose the raw EEG singles into spatial patterns extracted from multi-class of single trial EEG and could obtain good classification results. Research on the methods for multi-class kernel CSP-based feature extraction.
