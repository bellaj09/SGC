"Potentially suspicious breast neoplasms could be masked by high tissue density thus increasing the probability of a falsenegative diagnosis. Furthermore differentiating breast tissue type enables patient prescreening stratification and risk assessment. In this study we propose and evaluate advanced machine learning methodologies aiming at an objective and reliable method for breast density scoring from routine mammographic images. The proposed image analysis pipeline incorporates texture Gabor filters and local binary pattern LBP and gradientbased features histogram of oriented gradients HOG as well as speededup robust features SURF. Additionally transfer learning approaches with ImageNet trained weights were also used for comparison as well as a convolutional neural network CNN. The proposed CNN model was fully trained on two open mammography datasets and was found to be the optimal performing methodology AUC up to 87.3%. Thus the findings of this study indicate that automated density scoring in mammograms can aid clinical diagnosis by introducing artificial intelligencepowered decisionsupport systems and contribute to the democratization of healthcare by overcoming limitations such as the geographic location of patients or the lack of expert radiologists."
