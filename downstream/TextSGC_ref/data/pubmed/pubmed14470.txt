An understanding of the effects of corrective feedback on recognition memory can inform both recognition theory and memory training programs but few published studies have investigated the issue. Although the evidence to date suggests that feedback does not improve recognition accuracy few studies have directly examined its effect on sensitivity and fewer have created conditions that facilitate a feedback advantage by encouraging controlled processing at test. In Experiment 1 null effects of feedback were observed following both deep and shallow encoding of categorized study lists. In Experiment 2 feedback robustly influenced response bias by allowing participants to discern highly uneven base rates of old and new items but sensitivity remained unaffected. In Experiment 3 a false-memory procedure feedback failed to attenuate false recognition of critical lures. In Experiment 4 participants were unable to use feedback to learn a simple category rule separating old items from new items despite the fact that feedback was of substantial benefit in a nearly identical categorization task. The recognition system despite a documented ability to utilize controlled strategic or inferential decision-making processes appears largely impenetrable to a benefit of corrective feedback. Can corrective feedback improve recognition memory?
