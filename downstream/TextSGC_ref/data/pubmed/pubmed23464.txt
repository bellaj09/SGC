"The ongoing refinements in 3-dimensional 3D echocardiography technology continue to expand the scope of this imaging modality in clinical cardiology by offering new features that stem from the ability to image the heart in its complete dimensionality. Over the years countless publications have described these benefits and tested new frontiers where 3D echocardiographic imaging seemed to offer promising ways to improve patients care. These include improved techniques for chamber quantification and novel ways to visualize cardiac valves including 3D printing virtual reality and holography. The aims of this review article are to focus on the most important developments in the field in the recent years discuss the current utility of 3D echocardiography and highlight several interesting future directions." 3-Dimensional Echocardiography: Latest Developments and Future Directions.
