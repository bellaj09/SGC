We investigated how overt visual attention and oculomotor control influence successful use of a visual feedback brain-computer interface BCI for accessing augmentative and alternative communication AAC devices in a heterogeneous population of individuals with profound neuromotor impairments. BCIs are often tested within a single patient population limiting generalization of results. This study focuses on examining individual sensory abilities with an eye toward possible interface adaptations to improve device performance. Examining sensory ability feature matching and assessment-based adaptation for a brain-computer interface using the steady-state visually evoked potential.
