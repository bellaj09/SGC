Motor imagery EEG-based BCI has advantages in the assistance of human control of peripheral devices such as the mobile robot or wheelchair because the subject is not exposed to any stimulation and suffers no risk of fatigue. However the intensive training necessary to recognize the numerous classes of data makes it hard to control these nonholonomic mobile systems accurately and effectively. This paper proposes a new approach which combines motor imagery EEG with the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System. This approach fuses the intelligence of humans based on motor imagery EEG with the precise capabilities of a mobile system based on ANFIS. This approach realizes a multi-level control which makes the nonholonomic mobile system highly controllably without stopping or relying on sensor information. Also because the ANFIS controller can be trained while performing the control task control accuracy and efficiency is increased for the user. Experimental results of the nonholonomic mobile robot verify the effectiveness of this approach. Nonholonomic mobile system control by combining EEG-based BCI with ANFIS.
