In insects olfactory information received by peripheral olfactory receptor neurons ORNs is conveyed from the antennal lobes ALs to higher brain regions by olfactory projection neurons PNs. Despite the knowledge that multiple types of PNs exist little is known about how these different neuronal pathways work cooperatively. Here we studied the Drosophila GABAergic mediolateral antennocerebral tract PNs mlPNs which link ipsilateral AL and lateral horn LH in comparison with the cholinergic medial tract PNs mPNs. We examined the connectivity of mlPNs in ALs and found that most mlPNs received inputs from both ORNs and mPNs and participated in AL network function by forming gap junctions with other AL neurons. Meanwhile mlPNs might innervate LH neurons downstream of mPNs exerting a feedforward inhibition. Using dual-color calcium imaging which enables a simultaneous monitoring of neural activities in two groups of PNs we found that mlPNs exhibited robust odor responses overlapping with but broader than those of mPNs. Moreover preferentially down-regulation of GABA in most mlPNs caused abnormal courtship and aggressive behaviors in male flies. These findings demonstrate that in Drosophila olfactory information in opposite polarities are carried coordinately by two parallel and interacted pathways which could be essential for appropriate behaviors. Parallel pathways convey olfactory information with opposite polarities in Drosophila.
