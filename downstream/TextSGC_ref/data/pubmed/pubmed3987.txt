Graph-based analysis of fMRI data has recently emerged as a promising approach to study brain networks. Based on the assessment of synchronous fMRI activity at separate brain sites functional connectivity graphs are constructed and analyzed using graph-theoretical concepts. Most previous studies investigated region-level graphs which are computationally inexpensive but bring along the problem of choosing sensible regions and involve blurring of more detailed information. In contrast voxel-level graphs provide the finest granularity attainable from the data enabling analyses at superior spatial resolution. They are however associated with considerable computational demands which can render high-resolution analyses infeasible. In response many existing studies investigating functional connectivity at the voxel-level reduced the computational burden by sacrificing spatial resolution.
