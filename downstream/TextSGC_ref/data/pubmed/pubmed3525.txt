The efficient organization and communication of brain networks underlie cognitive processing and their disruption can lead to pathological behaviours. Few studies have focused on whole-brain networks in obesity and binge eating disorder BED. Here we used multi-echo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI along with a data-driven graph theory approach to assess brain network characteristics in obesity and BED. Disrupted resting-state brain network properties in obesity: decreased global and putaminal cortico-striatal network efficiency.
