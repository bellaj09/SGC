"The objective of this study was to evaluate usefulness of mandibular reconstructions using custom-made titanium mesh Ti-mesh tray and particulate cancellous bone and marrow PCBM. Consecutive 21 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction were enrolled in this study. They were 13 men and 8 women mean age 52.0 years. Virtual reality simulation was performed using computer software based on the preoperative computed tomography data. A 3-dimensional skull model was constructed using 3-dimensional printer. A tray was custom-made from Ti-mesh sheet bent to adapt to the model. After PCBM harvesting from posterior ilia and/or proximal tibia the tray was fixed to the host bone. New bone formation and configuration of the reconstructed mandible were assessed radiologically. Complications were recorded in each patient during the follow-up period. Patients satisfaction with postoperative facial contour was evaluated using visual analog scale VAS score range 0-100. In 16 of 21 patients excellent new bone formation was recognized and expected results were radiologically achieved. In 5 patients new bone formation was insufficient. Causes of insufficient bone formation included postoperative infection in 2 patients Ti-mesh tray fracture in 2 patients and local recurrence of lower gingival cancer in 1 patient. To prevent a tray fracture a double-layered Ti-mesh tray was useful. Mean VAS score on patients satisfaction was 77.1. Our results comprehensively suggest that mandibular reconstruction using custom-made Ti-mesh tray and PCBM is clinically useful."
