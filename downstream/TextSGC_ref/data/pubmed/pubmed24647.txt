Cognitive workload which is the level of mental effort required for a cognitive task can be assessed by monitoring the changes in neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalogram EEG. This study investigates the performance of an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI to discriminate different difficulty levels in performing a mental arithmetic task. EEG data from 10 subjects were collected while performing mental addition with 3 difficulty levels easy medium and hard. EEG features were then extracted using band power and Common Spatial Pattern features and subsequently features were selected using Fisher Ratio to train a Linear Discriminant Classifier. The results from 10-fold cross-validation yielded averaged accuracy of 90% for 2 classes easy versus hard tasks and 66% for 3 classes easy versus medium versus hard tasks. Hence the results showed the feasibility of using EEG-based BCI to measure cognitive workload in performing mental arithmetic. EEG-based discrimination of different cognitive workload levels from mental arithmetic.
