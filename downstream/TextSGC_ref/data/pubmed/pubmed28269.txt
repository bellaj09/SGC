Because recovery of upper extremity UE function to a practical level has been difficult in many stroke patients compensatory approaches have been emphasized. Based on researches indicating greater potential for brain plasticity newer approaches targeting at functional restoration have been attempted. However no intervention has been shown to be effective to improve hand function. We therefore devised a therapeutic approach to facilitate the use of the hemiparetic hand in daily life by combining EMG triggered electrical stimulation with a wrist splint called hybrid assistive neuromuscular dynamic stimulation HANDS. With HANDS we demonstrated improved motor function spasticity functional scores and neurophysiological parameters in chronic stroke. With a RCT we also demonstrated its effectiveness in subacute stroke. However to be its candidates electromyogram must be recorded from finger extensors and it cannot be applied to patients with complete paralysis. For them we recently developed a Brain Machine Interface BMI neurorehabilitation system. Based on analysis of volitionally decreased amplitudes of sensory motor rhythm during motor imagery involving extending the affected fingers real-time visual feedback is provided. In patients with severe hemiparesis we demonstrated its effectiveness with clinical scales neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. These newer interventions might offer useful neurorehabilitative tools for hemiparetic UE. Development of newer rehabilitative measures for hemiparetic upper limb after stroke.
