"Continuously growing patients demand technological innovation and surgical expertise have led to the widespread popularity of minimally invasive cardiac surgery MICS. Patients demand is being driven by less surgical trauma reduced scarring lesser pain substantially lesser duration of hospital stay and early return to normal activity. In addition MICS decreases the incidence of postoperative respiratory dysfunction chronic pain chest instability deep sternal wound infection bleeding and atrial fibrillation. Widespread media coverage competition among surgeons and hospitals and their associated brand values have further contributed in raising awareness among patients. In this process surgeons and anesthesiologist have moved from the comfort of traditional wide incision surgeries to more challenging and intensively skilled MICS. A wide variety of cardiac lesions techniques and approaches coupled with a significant learning curve have made the anesthesiologists job a challenging one. Anesthesiologists facilitate in providing optimal surgical settings beginning with lung isolation confirmation of diagnosis cannula placement and cardioplegia delivery. However the concern remains and it mainly relates to patient safety prolonged intraoperative duration and reduced surgical exposure leading to suboptimal treatment. The risk of neurological complications aortic injury phrenic nerve palsy and peripheral vascular thromboembolism can be reduced by proper preoperative evaluation and patient selection. Nevertheless advancement in surgical instruments perfusion practices increasing use of transesophageal echocardiography and accumulating experience of surgeons and anesthesiologist have somewhat helped in amelioration of these valid concerns. A patient-centric approach and clear communication between the surgeon anesthesiologist and perfusionist are vital for the success of MICS."
