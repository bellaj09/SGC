"Brain computer interfaces BCIs allow for controlling devices through modulation of sensorimotor rhythms SMR yet a profound number of users is unable to achieve sufficient accuracy. Here we investigated if visuo-motor coordination VMC training or Jacobsens progressive muscle relaxation PMR prior to BCI use would increase later performance compared to a control group who performed a reading task CG. Running the study in two different BCI-labs we achieved a joint sample size of N=154 nave participants. No significant effect of either intervention VMC PMR control was found on resulting BCI performance. Relaxation level and visuo-motor performance were associated with later BCI performance in one BCI-lab but not in the other. These mixed results do not indicate a strong potential of VMC or PMR for boosting performance. Yet further research with different training parameters or experimental designs is needed to complete the picture." Short progressive muscle relaxation or motor coordination training does not increase performance in a brain-computer interface based on sensorimotor rhythms SMR.
