Current computer-aided detection CADe systems for contrast-enhanced breast MRI rely on both spatial information obtained from the early-phase and temporal information obtained from the late-phase of the contrast enhancement. However late-phase information might not be available in a screening setting such as in abbreviated MRI protocols where acquisition is limited to early-phase scans. We used deep learning to develop a CADe system that exploits the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans. This system uses three-dimensional 3-D morphological information in the candidate locations and the symmetry information arising from the enhancement differences of the two breasts. We compared the proposed system to a previously developed system which uses the full dynamic breast MRI protocol. For training and testing we used 385 MRI scans containing 161 malignant lesions. Performance was measured by averaging the sensitivity values between 1/8-eight false positives. In our experiments the proposed system obtained a significantly Formula: see text higher average sensitivity Formula: see text compared with that of the previous CADe system Formula: see text. In conclusion we developed a CADe system that is able to exploit the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans and can be used in screening programs where abbreviated MRI protocols are used.
