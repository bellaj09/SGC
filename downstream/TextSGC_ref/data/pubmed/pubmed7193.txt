Ultrasound elastography is gaining traction as an accessible and useful diagnostic tool for things such as cancer detection and differentiation and thyroid disease diagnostics. Unfortunately state-of-the-art shear wave imaging techniques essential to promote this goal are limited to high-end ultrasound hardware due to high-power requirements and are extremely sensitive to patient and sonographer motion and generally suffer from low frame rates. Motivated by research and theory showing that longitudinal wave sound speed carries similar diagnostic abilities to shear wave imaging we present an alternative approach using single-sided pressure-wave sound speed measurements from channel data.
