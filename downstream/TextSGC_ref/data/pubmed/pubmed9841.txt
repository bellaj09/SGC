Over the past decade deep learning has demonstrated superior performances in solving many problems in various fields of medicine compared with other machine learning methods. To understand how deep learning has surpassed traditional machine learning techniques in this review we briefly explore the basic learning algorithms underlying deep learning. In addition the procedures for building deep learning-based classifiers for seizure electroencephalograms and gastric tissue slides are described as examples to demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of deep learning applications. Finally we review the clinical applications of deep learning in radiology pathology and drug discovery where deep learning has been actively adopted. Considering the great advantages of deep learning techniques deep learning will be increasingly and widely utilized in a wide variety of different areas in medicine in the coming decades. Applications of deep learning for the analysis of medical data.
