Maintaining stability especially in the mediolateral direction is important for successful walking. Navigating in the community however may require people to reduce stability to make quick lateral transitions creating a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability. Walking slower can improve stability during steady state walking but there remains a need to better understand how walking speed influences maneuverability. This study investigated how walking at different speeds influenced how individuals modulate both stability and maneuverability in a virtual obstacle course. Healthy individuals are more maneuverable when walking slower while navigating a virtual obstacle course.
