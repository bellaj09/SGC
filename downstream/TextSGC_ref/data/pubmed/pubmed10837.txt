License plate detection LPD is the first and key step in license plate recognition. State-of-the-art object-detection algorithms based on deep learning provide a promising form of LPD. However there still exist two main challenges. First existing methods often enclose objects with horizontal rectangles. However horizontal rectangles are not always suitable since license plates in images are multi-oriented reflected by rotation and perspective distortion. Second the scale of license plates often varies leading to the difficulty of multi-scale detection. To address the aforementioned problems we propose a novel method of multi-oriented and scale-invariant license plate detection MOSI-LPD based on convolutional neural networks. Our MOSI-LPD tightly encloses the multi-oriented license plates with bounding parallelograms regardless of the license plate scales. To obtain bounding parallelograms we first parameterize the edge points of license plates by relative positions. Next we design mapping functions between oriented regions and horizontal proposals. Then we enforce the symmetry constraints in the loss function and train the model with a multi-task loss. Finally we map region proposals to three edge points of a nearby license plate and infer the fourth point to form bounding parallelograms. To achieve scale invariance we first design anchor boxes based on inherent shapes of license plates. Next we search different layers to generate region proposals with multiple scales. Finally we up-sample the last layer and combine proposal features extracted from different layers to recognize true license plates. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of detecting license plates with different orientations and multiple scales.
