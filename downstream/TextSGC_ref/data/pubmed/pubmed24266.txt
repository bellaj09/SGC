"We are developing a new class of Brain-Computer Interface that we call a Brain-Muscle-Computer Interface in which surface electromyography sEMG recordings from a single muscle site are used to control the movement of a cursor. Previous work in our laboratory has established that subjects can learn to navigate a cursor to targets by manipulating the sEMG from a head muscle the Auricularis Superior. Subjects achieved two-dimensional control of the cursor by simultaneously regulating the power in two frequency bands that were chosen to suit the individuals. The purposes of the current pilot study were to investigate i subjects abilities to manipulate power in separate frequency bands in other muscles of the body and ii whether subjects can adapt to preselected frequency bands. We report pilot study data suggesting that subjects can learn to perform cursor-to-target tasks on a mobile phone by contracting the Extensor Pollicis Longus a muscle located on the wrist using frequency bands that are the same for every individual. After the completion of a short training protocol of less than 30 minutes three subjects achieved 83% 60% and 60% accuracies with mean time-to-targets of 3.4 s 1.4 s and 2.7 s respectively. All three subjects improved their performance and two subjects decreased their time-to-targets following training. These results suggest that subjects may be able to use the Extensor Pollicis Longus to control the BMCI and adapt to preselected frequency bands. Further testing will more conclusively investigate these preliminary findings." Pilot study for a Brain-Muscle-Computer Interface using the Extensor Pollicis Longus with preselected frequency bands.
