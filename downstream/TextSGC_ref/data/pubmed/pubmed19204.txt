This paper presents the development of a low-cost cataract surgery simulator for trainees to practise phacoemulsification procedures with computer-generated models in virtual environments. It focuses on the training of cornea incision capsulorrhexis and phaco-sculpting which are simulated interactively with computationally efficient algorithms developed for tissue deformation surface cutting and volume sculpting. Intuitive two-handed human-computer interactions are achieved with six degrees-of-freedom haptic devices. Performance of trainees on manual dexterity is recorded with quantifiable metrics. The proposed virtual-reality system has the potential to serve as an alternative training tool to supplement conventional cataract surgery education. A virtual training simulator for learning cataract surgery with phacoemulsification.
