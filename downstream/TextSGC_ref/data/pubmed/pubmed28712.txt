Implantable electrical probes have led to advances in neuroscience brain-machine interfaces and treatment of neurological diseases yet they remain limited in several key aspects. Ideally an electrical probe should be capable of recording from large numbers of neurons across multiple local circuits and importantly allow stable tracking of the evolution of these neurons over the entire course of study. Silicon probes based on microfabrication can yield large-scale high-density recording but face challenges of chronic gliosis and instability due to mechanical and structural mismatch with the brain. Ultraflexible mesh electronics on the other hand have demonstrated negligible chronic immune response and stable long-term brain monitoring at single-neuron level although to date it has been limited to 16 channels. Here we present a scalable scheme for highly multiplexed mesh electronics probes to bridge the gap between scalability and flexibility where 32 to 128 channels per probe were implemented while the crucial brain-like structure and mechanics were maintained. Combining this mesh design with multisite injection we demonstrate stable 128-channel local field potential and single-unit recordings from multiple brain regions in awake restrained mice over 4 mo. In addition the newly integrated mesh is used to validate stable chronic recordings in freely behaving mice. This scalable scheme for mesh electronics together with demonstrated long-term stability represent important progress toward the realization of ideal implantable electrical probes allowing for mapping and tracking single-neuron level circuit changes associated with learning aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
