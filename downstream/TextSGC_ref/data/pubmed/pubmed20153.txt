The underrepresentation of women in technical and STEM fields is a well-known problem and stereotype threatening situations have been linked to the inability to recruit and retain women into these fields. Virtual reality enables the unique ability to perform body-swap illusions and research has shown that these illusions can change participant behavior. Characteristically people take on the traits of the avatar they are embodying. We hypothesized that female participants embodying male avatars when a stereotype threat was made salient would demonstrate stereotype lift. We tested our hypothesis through a between-participants user study in an immersive virtual environment by measuring working memory. Our results support that stereotype threat can be induced in an immersive virtual environment and that stereotype lift is possible with fully-immersive body-swap illusions. Additionally our results suggest that participants in a gender-swapped avatar without an induced stereotype threat have significantly impaired working memory; however this impairment is lifted when a threat is made salient. We discuss possible theories as to why a body-swap illusion from a female participant into a male avatar would only increase working memory impairment when not under threat as well as applications and future research directions. Our results offer additional insight into understanding the cognitive effects of body-swap illusions and provide evidence that virtual reality may be an applicable tool for decreasing the gender gap in technology.
