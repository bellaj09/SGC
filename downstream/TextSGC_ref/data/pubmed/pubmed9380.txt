In laparoscopic cholecystectomy LC achievement of the Critical View of Safety CVS is commonly advocated to prevent bile duct injuries BDI. However BDI rates remain stable probably due to inconsistent application or a poor understanding of CVS as well as unreliable reporting. Objective video reporting could serve for quality auditing and help generate consistent datasets for deep learning models aimed at intraoperative assistance. In this study we develop and test a method to report CVS using videos. Formalizing video documentation of the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a step towards artificial intelligence assistance to improve surgical safety.
