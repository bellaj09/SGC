"The functional connectome derived from BOLD resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data represents meaningful functional organizations and a shift between distinct cognitive states. However the body of knowledge on how the long-term career experience affects the brains functional plasticity is still very limited. In this study we used a dynamic functional connectome characterization DBFCC model with the automatic target generation process K-Means clustering to explore the functional reorganization property of resting brain states driven by long-term career experience. Taking sailors as an example DBFCC generated seventeen reproducibly common atomic connectome patterns ACP and one reproducibly distinct ACP i.e. ACP14. The common ACPs indicating the same functional topology of the resting brain state transitions were shared by two control groups while the distinct ACP which mainly represented functional plasticity and only existed in the sailors showed close relationships with the long-term career experience of sailors. More specifically the distinct ACP14 of the sailors was made up of four specific sub-networks such as the auditory network visual network executive control network and vestibular function-related network which were most likely linked to sailing experience i.e. continuously suffering auditory noise maintaining balance locating ones position in three-dimensional space at sea obeying orders etc. Our results demonstrated DBFCCs effectiveness in revealing the specifically functional alterations modulated by sailing experience and particularly provided the evidence that functional plasticity was beneficial in reorganizing brains functional topology which could be driven by career experience."
