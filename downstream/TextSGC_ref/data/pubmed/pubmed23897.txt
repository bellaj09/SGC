Many intracardiac procedures can currently be performed on the heart only after it has been arrested and the patient has been placed on cardio-pulmonary bypass. We have developed a new method for operating on multiple targets inside the beating heart and describe a procedure for accessing them under virtual-reality VR-assisted image guidance that combines real-time ultrasound with a virtual model of tools and the surgical environment acquired from pre-operative images. This paper presents preliminary results aimed at assessing the operator\s ability to accurately position and staple an artificial valve to a "valve orifice" within a cardiac phantom when guidance is performed via ultrasound alone and with US augmented by the VR environment. 2D ultrasound augmented by virtual tools for guidance of interventional procedures.
