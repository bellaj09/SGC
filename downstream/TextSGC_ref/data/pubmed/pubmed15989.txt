"Existing computational approaches have not yet resulted in effective and efficient computer-aided tools that are used in pathologists daily practice. Focusing on a computer-based qualification for breast cancer diagnosis the present study proposes two deep learning architectures to efficiently and effectively detect and classify mitosis in a histopathological tissue sample. The first method consists of two parts entailing a preprocessing of the digital histological image and a free-handcrafted-feature Convolutional Neural Network CNN used for binary classification. Results show that the methodology proposed can achieve 95% accuracy in testing with an F1-score of 94.35%. This result is higher than the results using classical image processing techniques and also higher than the approaches combining CCNs with handcrafted features. The second approach is an end-to-end methodology using semantic segmentation. Results showed that this algorithm can achieve an accuracy higher than 95% in testing and an average Dice index of 0.6 higher than the existing results using CNNs 0.9 F1-score. Additionally due to the semantic properties of the deep learning approach an end-to-end deep learning framework is viable to perform both tasks: detection and classification of mitosis. The results show the potential of deep learning in the analysis of Whole Slide Images WSI and its integration to computer-aided systems. The extension of this work to whole slide images is also addressed in the last sections; as well as some computational key points that are useful when constructing a computer-aided-system inspired by the proposed technology."
