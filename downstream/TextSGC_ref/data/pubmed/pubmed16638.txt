From infancy we learn to comply with societal norms. However overt compliance is not necessarily accompanied by a change in internal beliefs. The neuromodulatory processes underlying these different phenomena are not yet understood. Here we test the role of oxytocin in controlling overt compliance versus internalization of information delivered by a social source. After intranasal oxytocin administration participants showed enhanced compliance to the erroneous opinion of others. However this expression was coupled with a decrease in the influence of others on long-term memories. Our data suggest that this dissociation may result from reduced conflict in the face of social pressure which increases immediate conforming behavior but reduces processing required for deep encoding. These findings reveal a neurobiological control system that oppositely affects internalization and overt compliance. Opposing effects of oxytocin on overt compliance and lasting changes to memory.
