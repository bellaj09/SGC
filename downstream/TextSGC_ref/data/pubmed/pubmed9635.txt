"Neuropathologists assess vast brain areas to identify diverse and subtly-differentiated morphologies. Standard semi-quantitative scoring approaches however are coarse-grained and lack precise neuroanatomic localization. We report a proof-of-concept deep learning pipeline that identifies specific neuropathologies-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-in immunohistochemically-stained archival slides. Using automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface we annotate\u2009>\u200970000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images WSIs to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieve strong plaque classification on a 10-WSI hold-out set 0.993 and 0.743 areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve respectively. Prediction confidence maps visualize morphology distributions at high resolution. Resulting network-derived amyloid beta A-burden scores correlate well with established semi-quantitative scores on a 30-WSI blinded hold-out. Finally saliency mapping demonstrates that networks learn patterns agreeing with accepted pathologic features. This scalable means to augment a neuropathologists ability suggests a route to neuropathologic deep phenotyping."
