The present era of precision medicine sees "cancer" as a consequence of molecular derangements occurring at the commencement of the disease process with morphological changes happening much later in the process of tumourigenesis. Conventional imaging techniques such as computed tomography CT ultrasound US and magnetic resonance imaging MRI play an integral role in the detection of disease at the macroscopic level. However molecular functional imaging MFI techniques entail the visualisation and quantification of biochemical and physiological processes occurring during tumourigenesis. MFI has the potential to play a key role in heralding the transition from the concept of "one-size-fits-all" treatment to "precision medicine". Integration of MFI with other fields of tumour biology such as genomics has spawned a novel concept called "radiogenomics" which could serve as an indispensable tool in translational cancer research. With recent advances in medical image processing such as texture analysis deep learning and artificial intelligence the future seems promising; however their clinical utility remains unproven at present. Despite the emergence of novel imaging biomarkers the majority of these require validation before clinical translation is possible. In this two part\xa0review we discuss the systematic collaboration across structural anatomical and molecular imaging techniques that constitute MFI. Part I reviews positron emission tomography radiogenomics AI and optical imaging while part II reviews MRI CT and ultrasound their current status and recent advances in the field of precision oncology.
