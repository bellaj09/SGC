This paper proposes a novel classification framework and a novel data reduction method to distinguish multiclass motor imagery MI electroencephalography EEG for brain computer interface BCI based on the manifold of covariance matrices in a Riemannian perspective. For method 1 a subject-specific decision tree SSDT framework with filter geodesic minimum distance to Riemannian mean FGMDRM is designed to identify MI tasks and reduce the classification error in the nonseparable region of FGMDRM. Method 2 includes a feature extraction algorithm and a classification algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm combines semisupervised joint mutual information semi-JMI with general discriminate analysis GDA namely SJGDA to reduce the dimension of vectors in the Riemannian tangent plane. And the classification algorithm replaces the FGMDRM in method 1 with k-nearest neighbor KNN named SSDT-KNN. By applying method 2 on BCI competition IV dataset 2a the kappa value has been improved from 0.57 to 0.607 compared to the winner of dataset 2a. And method 2 also obtains high recognition rate on the other two datasets. Motor Imagery EEG Classification Based on Decision Tree Framework and Riemannian Geometry.
