Virtual endoscopy has already proven its benefit for pre-operative planning of endoscopic pituitary surgery. The translation of such a system into the operating room is a logical consequence but only a few general intra-operative image guided systems providing virtual endoscopic images have been proposed so far. A discussion of related visualization and interaction problems occurring during sinus and pituitary surgery is still missing. Intra-operative virtual endoscopy for image guided endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.
