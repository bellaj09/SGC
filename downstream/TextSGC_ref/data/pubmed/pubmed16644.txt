Fluorescence microscopy is an essential technique for the basic sciences especially biomedical research. Since the invention of laser scanning confocal microscopy in the 1980s which enabled imaging both fixed and living biological tissue with 3D precision high-resolution fluorescence imaging has revolutionized biological research. Confocal microscopy by its very nature has one fundamental limitation. Due to the confocal pinhole deep tissue fluorescence imaging is not practical. In contrast no pun intended two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows in principle the collection of all emitted photons from fluorophores in the imaged voxel dramatically extending our ability to see deep into living tissue. Since the development of transgenic mice with genetically encoded fluorescent protein in neocortical cells in 2000 two-photon imaging has enabled the dynamics of individual synapses to be followed for up to 2 years. Since the initial landmark contributions to this field in 2002 the technique has been used to understand how neuronal structure are changed by experience learning and memory and various diseases. Here we provide a basic summary of the crucial elements that are required for such studies and discuss many applications of longitudinal two-photon fluorescence microscopy that have appeared since 2002.
