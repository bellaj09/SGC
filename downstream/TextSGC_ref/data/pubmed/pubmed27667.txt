Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of cortical involvement immediately before and during gait and during gait-related behaviors such as stepping in place or motor imagery of gait. Here we attempt to perform single-trial classification of gait intent from another movement plan point intent or from standing in place. Subjects walked naturally from a starting position to a designated ending position pointed at a designated position from the starting position or remained standing at the starting position. The 700 ms of recorded electroencephalography EEG before movement onset was used for single-trial classification of trials based on action type and direction left walk forward walk right walk left point right point and stand as well as action type regardless of direction stand walk point. Classification using regularized LDA was performed on a principal components analysis PCA reduced feature space composed of coefficients from levels 1 to 9 of a discrete wavelet decomposition using the Daubechies 4 wavelet. We achieved significant classification for all conditions with errors as low as 17% when averaged across nine subjects. LDA and PCA highly weighted frequency ranges that included movement related potentials MRPs with smaller contributions from frequency ranges that included mu and beta idle motor rhythms. Additionally error patterns suggested a spatial structure to the EEG signal. Future applications of the cortical gait intent signal may include an additional dimension of control for prosthetics preemptive corrective feedback for gait disturbances or human computer interfaces HCI.
