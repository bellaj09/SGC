Automated compound testing is currently the de facto standard method for drug screening but it has not brought the great increase in the number of new drugs that was expected. Computer- aided compounds search known as Virtual Screening has shown the benefits to this field as a complement or even alternative to the robotic drug discovery. There are different methods and approaches to address this problem and most of them are often included in one of the main screening strategies. Machine learning however has established itself as a virtual screening methodology in its own right and it may grow in popularity with the new trends on artificial intelligence. Virtual Screening Meets Deep Learning.
