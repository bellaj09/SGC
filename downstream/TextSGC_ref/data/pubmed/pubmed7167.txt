A biochemical reaction bio-event depicts the relationships between participating entities. Current text mining research has been focusing on identifying bio-events from scientific literature. However rare efforts have been dedicated to normalize bio-events extracted from scientific literature with the entries in the curated reaction databases which could disambiguate the events and further support interconnecting events into biologically meaningful and complete networks. BioNorm: deep learning-based event normalization for the curation of reaction databases.
