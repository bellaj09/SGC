The swimming tadpole larva of Ciona has one of the simplest central nervous systems CNSs known with only 177 neurons. Despite its simplicity the Ciona CNS has a common structure with the CNS of its close chordate relatives the vertebrates. The recent completion of a larval Ciona CNS connectome creates enormous potential for detailed understanding of chordate CNS function yet our understanding of Ciona larval behavior is incomplete. We show here that Ciona larvae have a surprisingly rich and dynamic set of visual responses including a looming-object escape behavior characterized by erratic circular swims as well as negative phototaxis characterized by sustained directional swims. Making use of mutant lines we show that these two behaviors are mediated by distinct groups of photoreceptors. The Ciona connectome predicts that these two behavioral responses should act through distinct but overlapping visuomotor pathways and that the escape behavior is likely to be integrated into a broader startle behavior. Photoreceptor specialization and the visuomotor repertoire of the primitive chordate Ciona.
