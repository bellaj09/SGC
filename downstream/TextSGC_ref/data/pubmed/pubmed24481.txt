Recently translating a steady-state visual-evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI from laboratory settings to real-life applications has gained increasing attention. This study systematically tests the signal quality of SSVEP acquired by a mobile electroencephalogram EEG system which features dry electrodes and wireless telemetry under challenging e.g. walking recording conditions. Empirical results of this study demonstrated the robustness of canonical correlation analysis CCA to movement artifacts for SSVEP detection. This demonstration considerably improves the practicality of real-life applications of mobile and wireless BCI systems for users actively behaving in and interacting with their environments. A mobile SSVEP-based brain-computer interface for freely moving humans: the robustness of canonical correlation analysis to motion artifacts.
