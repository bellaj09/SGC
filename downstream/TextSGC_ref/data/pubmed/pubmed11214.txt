Conventional Zero-shot Learning approaches often suffer from severe performance degradation in the Generalised Zero-shot Learning GZSL scenario i.e. to recognise test images that are from both seen and unseen classes. This paper studies the Class-level Over-fitting CO and empirically shows its effects to GZSL. We then address ZSL as a Triple Verification problem and propose a unified optimisation of regression and compatibility functions i.e. two main streams of existing ZSL approaches. The complementary losses mutually regularise the same model to mitigate the CO problem. Furthermore we implement a deep extension paradigm to linear models and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both GZSL and ZSL scenarios on the four standard benchmarks.
