"Essential tremor ET is a highly prevalent movement disorder. Patients with ET exhibit a complex progressive and disabling tremor and medical management often fails. Deep brain stimulation DBS has been successfully applied to this disorder however there has been no quantifiable way to measure tremor severity or treatment efficacy in this patient population. The quantified amelioration of kinetic tremor via DBS is herein demonstrated through the application of a smartphone iPhone as a wireless accelerometer platform. The recorded acceleration signal can be obtained at a setting of the subjects convenience and conveyed by wireless transmission through the Internet for post-processing anywhere in the world. Further post-processing of the acceleration signal can be classified through a machine learning application such as the support vector machine. Preliminary application of deep brain stimulation with a smartphone for acquisition of a feature set and machine learning for classification has been successfully applied. The support vector machine achieved 100% classification between deep brain stimulation in `on and `off mode based on the recording of an accelerometer signal through a smartphone as a wireless accelerometer platform." Implementation of a smartphone wireless accelerometer platform for establishing deep brain stimulation treatment efficacy of essential tremor with machine learning.
