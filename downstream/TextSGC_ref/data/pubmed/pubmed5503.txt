Developmental programs have the fidelity to form neural circuits with the same structure and function among individuals of the same species. It is less well understood however to what extent entire neural circuits of different individuals are similar. Previously we reported the neuronal connectome of the visual eye circuit from the head of a Platynereis dumerilii larva Randel et al. 2014. We now report a full-body serial section transmission electron microscopy ssTEM dataset of another larva of the same age for which we describe the connectome of the visual eyes and the larval eyespots. Anatomical comparisons and quantitative analyses of the two circuits reveal a high inter-individual stereotypy of the cell complement neuronal projections and synaptic connectivity including the left-right asymmetry in the connectivity of some neurons. Our work shows the extent to which the eye circuitry in Platynereis larvae is hard-wired. Inter-individual stereotypy of the Platynereis larval visual connectome.
