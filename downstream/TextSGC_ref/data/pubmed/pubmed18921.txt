CyberMed is a free framework GPL license for the development of medical applications for simulation based on virtual reality. The framework allows to decrease development time and offers complete synchronization among several functionalities that can be selected by the programmer as stereoscopic visualization haptics and deformation among others. An important feature of this framework is an online evaluation module that allows the classification of the user performance according to several simulation and interaction data. CyberMed can be used by programmers of any expertise level and offers high-level access for non-experts and low-level access for expert programmers. The low-level access allows the inclusion or extension of the framework functionalities. A framework for development of virtual reality-based training simulators.
