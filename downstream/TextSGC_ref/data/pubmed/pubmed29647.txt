Most investigators of brain-computer interface BCI research believe that BCI can be achieved through induced neuronal activity from the cortex but not by evoked neuronal activity. Motor imagery MI-based BCI is one of the standard concepts of BCI in that the user can generate induced activity by imagining motor movements. However variations in performance over sessions and subjects are too severe to overcome easily; therefore a basic understanding and investigation of BCI performance variation is necessary to find critical evidence of performance variation. Here we present not only EEG datasets for MI BCI from 52 subjects but also the results of a psychological and physiological questionnaire EMG datasets the locations of 3D EEG electrodes and EEGs for non-task-related states. EEG datasets for motor imagery brain-computer interface.
