Consciousness is not a process in the brain but a kind of behavior that of course is controlled by the brain like any other behavior. Human consciousness emerges on the interface between three components of animal behavior: communication play and the use of tools. These three components interact on the basis of anticipatory behavioral control which is common for all complex forms of animal life. All three do not exclusively distinguish our close relatives i.e. primates but are broadly presented among various species of mammals birds and even cephalopods; however their particular combination in humans is unique. The interaction between communication and play yields symbolic games most importantly language; the interaction between symbols and tools results in human praxis. Taken together this gives rise to a mechanism that allows a creature instead of performing controlling actions overtly to play forward the corresponding behavioral options in a "second reality" of objectively by means of tools grounded symbolic systems. The theory possesses the following properties: 1 It is anti-reductionist and anti-eliminativist and yet human consciousness is considered as a purely natural biological phenomenon. 2 It avoids epiphenomenalism and indicates in which conditions human consciousness has evolutionary advantages and in which it may even be disadvantageous. 3 It allows to easily explain the most typical features of consciousness such as objectivity seriality and limited resources the relationship between consciousness and explicit memory the feeling of conscious agency etc. Human Consciousness: Where Is It From and What Is It for.
