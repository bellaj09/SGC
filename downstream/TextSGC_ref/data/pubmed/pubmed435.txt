"An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan Peoples Republic of China in December 2019. The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19."
