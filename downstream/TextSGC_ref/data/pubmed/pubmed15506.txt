To produce a realistic augmentation in Augmented Reality the correct relative positions of real objects and virtual objects are very important. In this paper we propose a novel real-time occlusion handling method based on an object tracking approach. Our method is divided into three steps: selection of the occluding object object tracking and occlusion handling. The user selects the occluding object using an interactive segmentation method. The contour of the selected object is then tracked in the subsequent frames in real-time. In the occlusion handling step all the pixels on the tracked object are redrawn on the unprocessed augmented image to produce a new synthesized image in which the relative position between the real and virtual object is correct. The proposed method has several advantages. First it is robust and stable since it remains effective when the camera is moved through large changes of viewing angles and volumes or when the object and the background have similar colors. Second it is fast since the real object can be tracked in real-time. Last a smoothing technique provides seamless merging between the augmented and virtual object. Several experiments are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method. Real-time occlusion handling in augmented reality based on an object tracking approach.
