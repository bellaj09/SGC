In order to provide the seamless navigation and positioning services for indoor environments an indoor location based service LBS test bed is developed to integrate the indoor positioning system and the indoor three-dimensional 3D geographic information system GIS. A wireless sensor network WSN is used in the developed indoor positioning system. Considering the power consumption in this paper the ZigBee radio is used as the wireless protocol and the received signal strength RSS fingerprinting positioning method is applied as the primary indoor positioning algorithm. The matching processes of the user location include the nearest neighbor NN algorithm the K-weighted nearest neighbors KWNN algorithm and the probabilistic approach. To enhance the positioning accuracy for the dynamic user the particle filter is used to improve the positioning performance. As part of this research a 3D indoor GIS is developed to be used with the indoor positioning system. This involved using the computer-aided design CAD software and the virtual reality markup language VRML to implement a prototype indoor LBS test bed. Thus a rapid and practical procedure for constructing a 3D indoor GIS is proposed and this GIS is easy to update and maintenance for users. The building of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan is used as an example to assess the performance of various algorithms for the indoor positioning system. Development of an indoor location based service test bed and geographic information system with a wireless sensor network.
