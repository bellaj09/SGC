This paper presents a novel manifold learning algorithm for high-dimensional data sets. The scope of the application focuses on the problem of motion tracking in video sequences. The framework presented is twofold. First it is assumed that the samples are time ordered providing valuable information that is not presented in the current methodologies. Second the manifold topology comprises multiple charts which contrasts to the most current methods that assume one single chart being overly restrictive. The proposed algorithm Gaussian process multiple local models GP-MLM can deal with arbitrary manifold topology by decomposing the manifold into multiple local models that are probabilistic combined using Gaussian process regression. In addition the paper presents a multiple filter architecture where standard filtering techniques are integrated within the GP-MLM. The proposed approach exhibits comparable performance of state-of-the-art trackers namely multiple model data association and deep belief networks and compares favorably with Gaussian process latent variable models. Extensive experiments are presented using real video data including a publicly available database of lip sequences and left ventricle ultrasound images in which the GP-MLM achieves state of the art results.
