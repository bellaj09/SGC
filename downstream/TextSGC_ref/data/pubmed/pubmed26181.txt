"Brain-computer interfaces are commonly proposed to assist individuals with locked-in syndrome to interact with the world around them. In this paper we present a pipeline to move from recorded brain signals to real-time classification on a low-power platform such as IBMs TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System. Our results on a EEG-based hand squeeze task show that using a convolutional neural network and a time preserving signal representation strategy provides a good balance between high accuracy and feasibility in a real-time application. This pathway can be adapted to the management of a variety of conditions including spinal cord injury epilepsy and Parkinsons disease." TrueNorth-enabled real-time classification of EEG data for brain-computer interfacing.
