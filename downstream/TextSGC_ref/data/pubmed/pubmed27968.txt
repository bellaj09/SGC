BioSig is an open source software library for biomedical signal processing. The aim of the BioSig project is to foster research in biomedical signal processing by providing free and open source software tools for many different application areas. Some of the areas where BioSig can be employed are neuroinformatics brain-computer interfaces neurophysiology psychology cardiovascular systems and sleep research. Moreover the analysis of biosignals such as the electroencephalogram EEG electrocorticogram ECoG electrocardiogram ECG electrooculogram EOG electromyogram EMG or respiration signals is a very relevant element of the BioSig project. Specifically BioSig provides solutions for data acquisition artifact processing quality control feature extraction classification modeling and data visualization to name a few. In this paper we highlight several methods to help students and researchers to work more efficiently with biomedical signals.
