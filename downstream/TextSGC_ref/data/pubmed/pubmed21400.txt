Quaternions can be used as an alternative to model the fundamental patterns of electroencephalographic EEG signals in the time domain. Thus this article presents a new quaternion-based technique known as quaternion-based signal analysis QSA to represent EEG signals obtained using a brain-computer interface BCI device to detect and interpret cognitive activity. This quaternion-based signal analysis technique can extract features to represent brain activity related to motor imagery accurately in various mental states. Experimental tests in which users where shown visual graphical cues related to left and right movements were used to collect BCI-recorded signals. These signals were then classified using decision trees DT support vector machine SVM and k-nearest neighbor KNN techniques. The quantitative analysis of the classifiers demonstrates that this technique can be used as an alternative in the EEG-signal modeling phase to identify mental states.
