Individuals who smoke more cigarettes per day are at greater risk for developing smoking-related illness and have more difficulty quitting. Withdrawal-related negative mood is one factor thought to motivate drug use. However heavy smokers are generally more sensitive to negative affect not just negative emotion stemming from withdrawal. One possibility is that individual differences in how the brain processes negative stimuli may impact smoking use. Given the wealth of data implicating the insula in nicotine dependence and affective processing we hypothesize that the number of cigarettes an individual smokes per day will relate to insula reactivity to negative stimuli. Insula reactivity to negative stimuli is associated with daily cigarette use: A preliminary investigation using the Human Connectome Database.
