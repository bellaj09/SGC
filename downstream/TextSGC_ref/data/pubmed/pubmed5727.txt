"The success of human life in modern society is highly dependent on occupation. Therefore it is very important for people to identify and develop a career plan that best suits their aptitude. Traditional test batteries for vocational aptitudes are not oriented to measure developmental changes in job suitability because repeated measurements can introduce bias as the content of the test batteries is learned. In this study we attempted to objectively assess vocational aptitudes by measuring functional brain networks and identified functional brain networks that intrinsically represented vocational aptitudes for 19 job divisions in a General Aptitude Test Battery. In addition we derived classifiers based on these networks to predict the aptitudes of our test participants for each job division. Our results suggest that the measurement of brain function can indeed yield an objective evaluation of vocational aptitudes; this technique will enable a person to follow changes in ones job suitability with additional training or learning paving a new way to advise people on career development."
