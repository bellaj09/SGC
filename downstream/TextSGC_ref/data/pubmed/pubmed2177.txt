"Trust constitutes a fundamental basis of human society and plays a pivotal role in almost every aspect of human relationships. Although enormous interest exists in determining the neuropsychological underpinnings of a persons propensity to trust utilizing task-based fMRI; however little progress has been made in predicting its variations by task-free fMRI based on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity RSFC. Here we combined a one-shot trust game with a connectome-based predictive modeling approach to predict propensity to trust from whole-brain RSFC. We demonstrated that individual variations in the propensity to trust were primarily predicted by RSFC rooted in the functional integration of distributed key nodes-caudate amygdala lateral prefrontal cortex temporal-parietal junction and the temporal pole-which are part of domain-general large-scale networks essential for the motivational affective and cognitive aspects of trust. We showed further that the identified brain-behavior associations were only evident for trust but not altruistic preferences and that propensity to trust and its underlying neural underpinnings were modulated according to the extent to which a person emphasizes general social preferences i.e. horizontal collectivism rather than general risk preferences i.e. trait impulsiveness. In conclusion the employed data-driven approach enables to predict propensity to trust from RSFC and highlights its potential use as an objective neuromarker of trust impairment in mental disorders." Connectome-based model predicts individual differences in propensity to trust.
