The use of cognitive enhancers is gaining attention. Studies indicate that the theory of planned behavior TPB can model their use with attitudes a key variable. However the factors affecting attitude have been largely neglected. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between learning approaches and individual competitiveness and attitudes toward cognitive enhancers in students. UK university students N\xa0=\xa0179 completed an anonymous online survey assessing their attitudes toward cognitive enhancers as well as competitiveness and learning approaches using the revised Study Process Questionnaire. Academic performance data were also collected. The analysis revealed that being competitive or having surface motives i.e. wishing to work sufficiently to meet minimum requirements only was predictive of a more positive attitude toward the drugs whilst academic performance was a negative predictor. This research adds to previous work by demonstrating the importance of individual rather than just institutional competitiveness and identifying a role for learning approaches. Both offer avenues to target drug use because cooperation rather than competitiveness and deep rather than surface learning approaches can be driven from careful design of teaching and learning. This suggests that curriculum design could impact on attitudes toward cognitive enhancers which in turn may alter the use of these drugs.
