Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD are at a significantly higher risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms underlying this increased risk are not known. Studies have suggested that PTSD patients have an overactive sympathetic nervous system SNS that could contribute to cardiovascular risk; however sympathetic function has not previously been rigorously evaluated in PTSD patients. Using direct measurements of sympathetic nerve activity and pharmacological manipulation of blood pressure we show that veterans with PTSD have augmented SNS and haemodynamic reactivity during both combat-related and non-combat related mental stress impaired sympathetic and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and increased inflammation. Identifying the mechanisms contributing to increased cardiovascular CV risk in PTSD will pave the way for developing interventions to improve sympathetic function and reduce CV risk in these patients.
