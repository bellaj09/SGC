This paper presents a Transfer Learning approach for dealing with the statistical variability of electroencephalographic EEG signals recorded on different sessions and/or from different subjects. This is a common problem faced by brain-computer interfaces BCI and poses a challenge for systems that try to reuse data from previous recordings to avoid a calibration phase for new users or new sessions for the same user.
