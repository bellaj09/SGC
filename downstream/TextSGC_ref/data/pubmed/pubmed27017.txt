Brain-Machine Interfaces BMIs have shown great potential for generating prosthetic control signals. Translating BMIs into the clinic requires fully implantable wireless systems; however current solutions have high power requirements which limit their usability. Lowering this power consumption typically limits the system to a single neural modality or signal type and thus to a relatively small clinical market. Here we address both of these issues by investigating the use of signal power in a single narrow frequency band as a decoding feature for extracting information from electrocorticographic ECoG electromyographic EMG and intracortical neural data. We have designed and tested the Multi-modal Implantable Neural Interface MINI a wireless recording system which extracts and transmits signal power in a single configurable frequency band. In prerecorded datasets we used the MINI to explore low frequency signal features and any resulting tradeoff between power savings and decoding performance losses. When processing intracortical data the MINI achieved a power consumption 89.7% less than a more typical system designed to extract action potential waveforms. When processing ECoG and EMG data the MINI achieved similar power reductions of 62.7% and 78.8%. At the same time using the single signal feature extracted by the MINI we were able to decode all three modalities with less than a 9% drop in accuracy relative to using high-bandwidth modality-specific signal features. We believe this system architecture can be used to produce a viable cost-effective clinical BMI. Enabling Low-Power Multi-Modal Neural Interfaces Through a Common Low-Bandwidth Feature Space.
