The connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively studied and fully mapped allowing researchers to more confidently conclude on the impact of any change in neuronal circuits based on behavioral data. One of the more complex sensorimotor circuits in nematodes is the one that regulates the integration of feeding status with the subsequent behavioral responses that allow animals to adapt to environmental conditions. Here we have characterized a Caenorhabditis elegans knockout model of the egli-1 gene previously known as tag-175. This is an orthologue of the stasimon/tmem41b gene a downstream target of SMN the depleted protein in spinal muscular atrophy SMA which partially recapitulates the SMA phenotype in fly and zebrafish models when mutated. Surprisingly egli-1 mutants reveal no deficits in motor function. Instead they show functional impairment of a specific neuronal circuit leading to defects in the integration of sensorial information related to food abundance with consequences at the level of locomotion adaptation egg laying and the response to aversive chemical stimuli. This work has demonstrated for the first time the relevance of egli-1 in the nervous system as well as revealed a function for this gene which had remained elusive so far. Loss of egli-1 the Caenorhabditis elegans Orthologue of a Downstream Target of SMN Leads to Abnormalities in Sensorimotor Integration.
