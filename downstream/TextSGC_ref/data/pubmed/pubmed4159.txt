"Over the last decade we have observed a revolution in brain structural and functional Connectomics. On one hand we have an ever-more detailed characterization of the brains white matter structural connectome. On the other we have a repertoire of consistent functional networks that form and dissipate over time during rest. Despite the evident spatial similarities between structural and functional connectivity understanding how different time-evolving functional networks spontaneously emerge from a single structural network requires analyzing the problem from the perspective of complex network dynamics and dynamical systems theory. In that direction bottom-up computational models are useful tools to test theoretical scenarios and depict the mechanisms at the genesis of resting-state activity. Here we provide an overview of the different mechanistic scenarios proposed over the last decade via computational models. Importantly we highlight the need of incorporating additional model constraints considering the properties observed at finer temporal scales with MEG and the dynamical properties of FC in order to refresh the list of candidate scenarios."
