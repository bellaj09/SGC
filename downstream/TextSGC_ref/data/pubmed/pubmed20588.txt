A number of recent studies have put human subjects in true social interactions with the aim of better identifying the psychophysiological processes underlying social cognition. Interestingly this emerging Neuroscience of Social Interactions NSI field brings up challenges which resemble important ones in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI. Importantly these challenges go beyond common objectives such as the eventual use of BCI and NSI protocols in the clinical domain or common interests pertaining to the use of online neurophysiological techniques and algorithms. Common fundamental challenges are now apparent and one can argue that a crucial one is to develop computational models of brain processes relevant to human interactions with an adaptive agent whether human or artificial. Coupled with neuroimaging data such models have proved promising in revealing the neural basis and mental processes behind social interactions. Similar models could help BCI to move from well-performing but offline static machines to reliable online adaptive agents. This emphasizes a social perspective to BCI which is not limited to a computational challenge but extends to all questions that arise when studying the brain in interaction with its environment. Brain-computer interfaces: a neuroscience paradigm of social interaction? A matter of perspective.
