High-density channels are often used to acquire electroencephalogram EEG spatial information in different cortical regions of the brain in brain-computer interface BCI systems. However applying excessive channels is inconvenient for signal acquisition and it may bring artifacts. To avoid these defects the common spatial pattern CSP algorithm was used for channel selection and a selection criteria based on norm-2 is proposed in this paper. The channels with the highest M scores were selected for the purpose of using fewer channels to acquire similar rate with high density channels. The Dataset III a from BCI competition 2005 were used for comparing the classification accuracies of three motor imagery between whole channels and the selected channels with the present proposed method. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracies of three subjects using the 20 channels selected with the present method were all higher than the classification accuracies using all 60 channels which convinced that our method could be more effective and useful.
