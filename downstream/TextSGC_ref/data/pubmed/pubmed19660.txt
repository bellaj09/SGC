Minimally displaced radial head and neck fractures are common and the outcome with conservative treatment is generally excellent. A new protocol was introduced to manage patients with\xa0these suspected fractures at a major urban hospital. Simple undisplaced fractures without other associated injuries or instability were discharged with structured advice but no further face-to-face review. Patients with more complex injuries were reviewed at a "virtual clinic." The aim of this study was to examine the outcome of this process in terms of patient flow satisfaction reattendance and reintervention. A new "virtual" patient pathway for the management of radial head and neck fractures.
