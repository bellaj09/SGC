An important factor in the usability of a brain-computer interface BCI is the setup and calibration time required for the interface to perform accurately. Recently brain-switches based on the beta rebound following motor imagery of a single limb effector have been investigated as basic BCIs due to their good performance with limited electrodes and brief training session requirements. Here a BCI is proposed which expands the methodology of brain-switches to design an interface composed of multiple brain-controlled buttons. The algorithm is designed as a system paced interface which can recognise 2 intentional-control tasks and a no-control state based on the activity during and following motor imagery in only 3 electroencephalogram channels. An online experiment was performed over 6 subjects to validate the algorithm and the results show that a working BCI can be trained from a single calibration session and that the post motor imagery features are both informative and robust over multiple sessions. Combining ERD and ERS features to create a system-paced BCI.
