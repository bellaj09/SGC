Identification of functional dependence among neurons is a necessary component in both the rational design of neural prostheses as well as in the characterization of network physiology. The objective of this article is to provide a tutorial for neurosurgeons regarding information theory specifically time-delayed mutual information and to compare time-delayed mutual information an information theoretic quantity based on statistical dependence with cross-correlation a commonly used metric for this task in a preliminary analysis of rat hippocampal neurons. Determination of relevant neuron-neuron connections for neural prosthetics using time-delayed mutual information: tutorial and preliminary results.
