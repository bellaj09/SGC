The evaluation of changes in Intervertebral Discs IVDs with 3D Magnetic Resonance MR Imaging MRI can be of interest for many clinical applications. This paper presents the evaluation of both IVD localization and IVD segmentation methods submitted to the Automatic 3D MRI IVD Localization and Segmentation challenge held at the 2015 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention MICCAI2015 with an on-site competition. With the construction of a manually annotated reference data set composed of 25 3D T2-weighted MR images acquired from two different studies and the establishment of a standard validation framework quantitative evaluation was performed to compare the results of methods submitted to the challenge. Experimental results show that overall the best localization method achieves a mean localization distance of 0.8\xa0mm and the best segmentation method achieves a mean Dice of 91.8% a mean average absolute distance of 1.1\xa0mm and a mean Hausdorff distance of 4.3\xa0mm respectively. The strengths and drawbacks of each method are discussed which provides insights into the performance of different IVD localization and segmentation methods. Evaluation and comparison of 3D intervertebral disc localization and segmentation methods for 3D T2 MR data: A grand challenge.
