"Procedural sedation is a cost-effective method of providing sedation and analgesia for patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Sedation ranges on a continuum from minimal sedation to deep sedation so procedural sedation can pose many risks for patients eg compromised airway depressed respirations hypotension. The unique variables inherent in the pediatric population and the associated risks of procedural sedation make it imperative that RNs be knowledgeable and competent in monitoring and managing these patients. Through the use of a learning needs assessment perioperative resource nurses at a pediatric hospital in a large southeast metropolitan area identified practice concerns associated with staff RNs management of pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation. As a result of these findings the perioperative resource nurses are in the process of implementing annual sedation competency skills testing in a special procedures laboratory for all nurses who participate in sedation procedures." Using a learning needs assessment to identify knowledge deficits regarding procedural sedation for pediatric patients.
