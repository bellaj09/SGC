"Modelling crowd behavior is essential for the management of mass events and pedestrian traffic. Current microscopic approaches consider the individuals behavior to predict the effect of individual actions in local interactions on the collective scale of the crowd motion. Recent developments in the use of virtual reality as an experimental tool have offered an opportunity to extend the understanding of these interactions in controlled and repeatable settings. Nevertheless based on kinematics alone it remains difficult to tease out how these interactions unfold. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that gaze activity provides additional information about pedestrian interactions. Using an eye tracker we recorded the participants gaze behavior whilst navigating through a virtual crowd. Results revealed that gaze was consistently attracted to virtual walkers with the smallest values of distance at closest approach DCA and time to closest approach TtCA indicating a higher risk of collision. Moreover virtual walkers gazed upon before an avoidance maneuver was initiated had a high risk of collision and were typically avoided in the subsequent avoidance maneuver. We argue that humans navigate through crowds by selecting only few interactions and that gaze reveals how a walker prioritizes these interactions. Moreover we pose that combining kinematic and gaze data provides new opportunities for studying how interactions are selected by pedestrians walking through crowded dynamic environments." Guided by gaze: Prioritization strategy when navigating through a virtual crowd can be assessed through gaze activity.
