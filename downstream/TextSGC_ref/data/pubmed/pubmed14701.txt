The aim of the present research was to analyze the linear relationship between resilience meta-motivational variable learning approaches meta-cognitive variables strategies for coping with academic stress meta-emotional variable and academic achievement necessary in the context of university academic stress. A total of 656 students from a southern university in Spain completed different questionnaires: a resiliency scale a coping strategies scale and a study process questionnaire. Correlations and structural modeling were used for data analyses. There was a positive and significant linear association showing a relationship of association and prediction of resilience to the deep learning approach and problem-centered coping strategies. In a complementary way these variables positively and significantly predicted the academic achievement of university students. These results enabled a linear relationship of association and consistent and differential prediction to be established among the variables studied. Implications for future research are set out. Linear Relationship between Resilience Learning Approaches and Coping Strategies to Predict Achievement in Undergraduate Students.
