Successful open source software OSS projects comprise freely observable task-oriented social networks with hundreds or thousands of participants and large amounts of textual and technical discussion. The sheer volume of interactions and participants makes it challenging for participants to find relevant tasks discussions and people. Tagging e.g. @AmySmith is a socio-technical practice that enables more focused discussion. By tagging important and relevant people discussions can be advanced more effectively. However for all but a few insiders it can be difficult to identify important and/or relevant people. In this paper we study tagging in OSS projects from a socio-linguistics perspective. First we argue that textual content per se reveals a great deal about the status and identity of who is speaking and who is being addressed. Next we suggest that this phenomenon can be usefully modeled using modern deep-learning methods. Finally we illustrate the value of these approaches with tools that could assist people to find the important and relevant people for a discussion.
