Artificial intelligence AI and in particular deep learning as a subcategory of AI provides opportunities for the discovery and development of innovative drugs. Various machine learning approaches have recently reemerged some of which may be considered instances of domain-specific AI which have been successfully employed for drug discovery and design. This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles alongside some application notes of the various machine learning algorithms the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening de novo drug design physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction drug repurposing and related aspects. Finally several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design. Concepts of Artificial Intelligence for Computer-Assisted Drug Discovery.
