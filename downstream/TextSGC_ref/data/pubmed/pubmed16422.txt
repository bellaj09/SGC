Participants with PSA were randomly assigned to VRCBT 28 participants CBT 30 participants and wait list control WLC; 30 participants. VRCBT and CBT were significantly more effective than WLC in anxiety reduction on four of five anxiety measures and on subjects self-rating of anxiety during a behavioral task. No significant differences were found on observer ratings of the behavioral task. However twice as many participants dropped out from CBT than from VRCBT.
