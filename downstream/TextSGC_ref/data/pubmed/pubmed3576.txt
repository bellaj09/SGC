The corpus callosum is the commissural bridge of white-matter bundles important for the human brain functions. Previous studies have analyzed the structural links between cortical gray-matter networks and subregions of corpus callosum. While meaningful white-matter functional networks WM-FNs were recently reported how these networks functionally link with distinct subregions of corpus callosum remained unknown. The current study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of the Human Connectome Project test-retest data to identify 10 cerebral WM-FNs in 119 healthy subjects and then parcellated the corpus callosum into distinct subregions based on the functional connectivity between each callosal voxel and above networks. Our results demonstrated the reproducible identification of WM-FNs and their links with known gray-matter functional networks across two runs. Furthermore we identified reliably parcellated subregions of the corpus callosum which might be involved in primary and higher order functional systems by functionally connecting with WM-FNs. The current study extended our knowledge about the white-matter functional signals to the intrinsic functional organization of human corpus callosum which could help researchers understand the neural substrates underlying normal interhemispheric functional connectivity as well as dysfunctions in various mental disorders.
