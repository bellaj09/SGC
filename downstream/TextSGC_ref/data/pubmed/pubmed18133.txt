"Parkinsons disease PD characterized by the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease which produces bradykinesia rigidity tremor and postural instability. The dopamine precursor levodopa L-Dopa is the most effective treatment for the amelioration of PD signs and symptoms but long-term administration can lead to disabling motor fluctuations and L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias. In animal models of PD a form of plasticity called depotentiation or the reversal of previous potentiation is selectively lost after the development of dyskinetic movements following L-Dopa treatment. We investigated whether low frequency stimulation LFS in the globus pallidus internus GPi and substantia nigra pars reticulata SNr could induce depotentiation at synapses that had already undergone high frequency stimulation HFS-induced potentiation. To do so we measured the field potentials fEPs evoked by stimulation from a nearby microelectrode in 28 patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating DBS electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus STN or GPi. We found that GPi and SNr synapses in patients with less severe dyskinesia underwent greater depotentiation following LFS than in patients with more severe dyskinesia. This demonstration of impaired depotentiation in basal ganglia output nuclei in PD patients with dyskinesia is an important validation of animal models of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The ability of a synapse to reverse previous potentiation may be crucial to the normal function of the BG perhaps by preventing saturation of the storage capacity required in motor learning and optimal motor function. Loss of this ability at the output nuclei may underlie or contribute to the cellular basis of dyskinetic movements."
