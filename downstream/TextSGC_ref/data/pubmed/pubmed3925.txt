To elucidate the mechanisms of how snack foods may induce non-homeostatic food intake we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI as resting state networks can individually adapt to experience after short time exposures. In addition we used graph theoretical analysis together with machine learning techniques support vector machine to identifying biomarkers that can categorize between high-caloric potato chips vs. low-caloric zucchini food stimulation. Snack food as a modulator of human resting-state functional connectivity.
