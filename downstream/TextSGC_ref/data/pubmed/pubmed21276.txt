Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography M/EEG measure non-invasively the weak electromagnetic fields induced by post-synaptic neural currents. The estimation of the spatial covariance of the signals recorded on M/EEG sensors is a building block of modern data analysis pipelines. Such covariance estimates are used in brain-computer interfaces BCI systems in nearly all source localization methods for spatial whitening as well as for data covariance estimation in beamformers. The rationale for such models is that the signals can be modeled by a zero mean Gaussian distribution. While maximizing the Gaussian likelihood seems natural it leads to a covariance estimate known as empirical covariance EC. It turns out that the EC is a poor estimate of the true covariance when the number of samples is small. To address this issue the estimation needs to be regularized. The most common approach downweights off-diagonal coefficients while more advanced regularization methods are based on shrinkage techniques or generative models with low rank assumptions: probabilistic PCA PPCA and factor analysis FA. Using cross-validation all of these models can be tuned and compared based on Gaussian likelihood computed on unseen data. We investigated these models on simulations one electroencephalography EEG dataset as well as magnetoencephalography MEG datasets from the most common MEG systems. First our results demonstrate that different models can be the best depending on the number of samples heterogeneity of sensor types and noise properties. Second we show that the models tuned by cross-validation are superior to models with hand-selected regularization. Hence we propose an automated solution to the often overlooked problem of covariance estimation of M/EEG signals. The relevance of the procedure is demonstrated here for spatial whitening and source localization of MEG signals.
