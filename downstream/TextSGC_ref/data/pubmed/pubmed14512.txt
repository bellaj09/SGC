"Histology subtype prediction is a major task for grading non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC tumors. Invasive methods such as biopsy often lack in tumor sample and as a result radiologists or oncologists find it difficult to detect proper histology of NSCLC tumors. The non-invasive methods such as machine learning may play a useful role to predict NSCLC histology by using medical image biomarkers. Few attempts have so far been made to predict NSCLC histology by considering all the major subtypes. The present study aimed to develop a more accurate deep learning model by clubbing convolutional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks. The NSCLC Radiogenomics dataset having 211 subjects was used in the study. Ten best models found during experimentation were averaged to form an ensemble. The model ensemble was executed with 10-fold repeated stratified cross-validation and the results got were tested with metrics like accuracy recall precision F1-score Cohens kappa and ROC-AUC score. The accuracy of the ensemble model showed considerable improvement over the best model found with the single model. The proposed model may help significantly in the automated prognosis of NSCLC and other types of cancers."
