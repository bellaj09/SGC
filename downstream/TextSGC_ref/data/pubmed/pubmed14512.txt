Synthetic aperture radar SAR ship detection is a heated and challenging problem. Traditional methods are based on hand-crafted feature extraction or limited shallow-learning features representation. Recently with the excellent ability of feature representation deep neural networks such as faster region based convolution neural network FRCN have shown great performance in object detection tasks. However several challenges limit the applications of FRCN in SAR ship detection: 1 FRCN with a fixed receptive field cannot match the scale variability of multiscale SAR ship objects and the performance degrade when the objects are small; 2 as a two-stage detector FRCN performs an intensive computation and leads to low-speed detection; 3 when the background is complex the imbalance of easy and hard examples will lead to a high false detection. To tackle the above issues we design a multilayer fusion light-head detector MFLHD for SAR ship detection. Instead of using a single feature map shallow high-resolution and deep semantic feature are combined to produce region proposal. In detection subnetwork we propose a light-head detector with large-kernel separable convolution and position sensitive pooling to improve the detection speed. In addition we adapt focal loss to loss function and training more hard examples to reduce the false alarm. Extensive experiments on SAR ship detection dataset SSDD show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in SAR ship detection both in accuracy and speed.
