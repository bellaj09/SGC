Somatosensation is critical for effective object manipulation but current upper limb prostheses do not provide such feedback to the user. For individuals who require use of prosthetic limbs this lack of feedback transforms a mundane task into one that requires extreme concentration and effort. Although vibrotactile motors and sensory substitution devices can be used to convey gross sensations a direct neural interface is required to provide detailed and intuitive sensory feedback. The viability of intracortical microstimulation ICMS as a method to deliver feedback depends in part on the long-term reliability of implanted electrodes used to deliver the stimulation. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of chronic ICMS on the electrode-tissue interface. The effect of chronic intracortical microstimulation on the electrode-tissue interface.
