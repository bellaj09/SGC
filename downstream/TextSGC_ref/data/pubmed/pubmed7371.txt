Convolutional neural networks CNNs can not only classify images but can also generate key features e.g. the Google neural network that learned to identify cats by simply watching YouTube videos for the classification. In this paper crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets case 1 and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis case 2 or cool summer damage case 3. The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice which was implemented in the crop model simply by learning. Moreover CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning. Distillation of crop models to learn plant physiology theories using machine learning.
