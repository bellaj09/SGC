This work investigates the potential of a four-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface BCI using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. Four motor imagery tasks right hand left hand right foot and left foot tapping were executed while motor cortex activity was recorded via fNIRS. Preliminary results from three participants suggest that this could be a viable BCI interface with two subjects achieving 50% accuracy. fNIRS is a noninvasive safe portable and affordable optical brain imaging technique used to monitor cortical hemodynamic changes. Because of its portability and ease of use fNIRS is amenable to deployment in more natural settings. Electroencephalography EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI BCIs have already been used with up to four motor-imagery-based commands. While fNIRS-based BCIs are relatively new success with EEG and fMRI systems as well as signal characteristics similar to fMRI and complementary to EEG suggest that fNIRS could serve to build or augment future BCIs. Evaluating a four-class motor-imagery-based optical brain-computer interface.
