Several studies show the importance of periconceptional maternal dietary patterns on human embryonic growth. Healthy paternal nutrition has been associated with better semen quality and fecundability however evidence on the impact on pregnancy outcome is limited. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the association between preconception paternal dietary patterns and first trimester embryonic growth using the parameters longitudinal crown-rump length CRL and embryonic volume EV. No independent associations between preconception paternal dietary patterns and embryonic growth; the Predict Study.
