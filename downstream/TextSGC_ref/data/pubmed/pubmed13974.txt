The endocytoscopic system ECS helps in virtual realization of histology and can aid in confirming histological diagnosis in vivo. We propose replacing biopsy-based histology for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC by using the ECS. We applied deep-learning artificial intelligence AI to analyse ECS images of the esophagus to determine whether AI can support endoscopists for the replacement of biopsy-based histology. Diagnosis using deep-learning artificial intelligence based on the endocytoscopic observation of the esophagus.
