"Eating is a multimodal experience. When we eat we perceive not just the taste and aroma of foods but also their visual auditory and tactile properties as well as sensory input from our surroundings. Foods are commonly tested within a sensory booth designed specifically to limit such input. Foods are not commonly experienced in such isolation but alongside this context which can alter how a food is perceived. In this study we show that the sensory properties of food can be altered by changing the environment it is consumed in using virtual reality VR to provide an immersive dynamic context to the eating experience. The purpose of this project was to develop an affordable and easy-to-implement methodology for adapting VR technology to sensory evaluation without prohibitive amounts of expensive equipment or specialized programming knowledge. Virtual environments were formed by processing custom-recorded 360 degree videos and overlaying audio text sensory scales and images to simulate a typical sensory evaluation ballot within the VR headset. In a pilot test participants were asked to taste 3 identical blue cheese samples in 3 virtual contexts-a sensory booth a park bench and a cow barn. Respondents rated their liking of the sample as well as its saltiness and pungency attributes either reflective of one context pungency in the barn or presumably unrelated saltiness. Panelists duly rated the samples flavor as being more pungent when consumed in the barn context. These results provide proof of concept for VR in applied sensory studies providing an immersive context to a sensory test while remaining in place."
