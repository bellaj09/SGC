Brain computer interfaces BCIs have been applied to sensorimotor systems for many years. However BCI technology has broad potential beyond sensorimotor systems. The emerging field of cognitive prosthetics for example promises to improve learning and memory for patients with cognitive impairment. Unfortunately our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying these cognitive processes remains limited in part due to the extensive individual variability in neural coding and circuit function. As a consequence the development of methods to ascertain optimal control signals for cognitive decoding and restoration remains an active area of inquiry. To advance the field robust tools are required to quantify time-varying and task-dependent brain states predictive of cognitive performance. Here we suggest that network science is a natural language in which to formulate and apply such tools. In support of our argument we offer a simple demonstration of the feasibility of a network approach to BCI control signals which we refer to as network BCI nBCI. Finally in a single subject example we show that nBCI can reliably predict online cognitive performance and is superior to certain common spectral approaches currently used in BCIs. Our review of the literature and preliminary findings support the notion that nBCI could provide a powerful approach for future applications in cognitive prosthetics.
