A large body of evidence relates autism with abnormal structural and functional brain connectivity. Structural covariance magnetic resonance imaging scMRI is a technique that maps brain regions with covarying gray matter densities across subjects. It provides a way to probe the anatomical structure underlying intrinsic connectivity networks ICNs through analysis of gray matter signal covariance. In this article we apply topological data analysis in conjunction with scMRI to explore network-specific differences in the gray matter structure in subjects with autism versus age- gender- and IQ-matched controls. Specifically we investigate topological differences in gray matter structure captured by structural correlation graphs derived from three ICNs strongly implicated in autism namely the salience network default mode network and executive control network. By combining topological data analysis with statistical inference our results provide evidence of statistically significant network-specific structural abnormalities in autism.
