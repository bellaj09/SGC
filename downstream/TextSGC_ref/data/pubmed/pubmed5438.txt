Simultaneous multi-slice SMS echo-planar imaging has had a huge impact on the acceleration and routine use of diffusion-weighted MRI DWI in neuroimaging studies in particular the human connectome project; but also holds the potential to facilitate DWI of moving subjects as proposed by the new technique developed in this paper. We present a novel registration-based motion tracking technique that takes advantage of the multi-plane coverage of the anatomy by simultaneously acquired slices to enable robust reconstruction of neural microstructure from SMS DWI of moving subjects. Our technique constitutes three main components: 1 motion tracking and estimation using SMS registration 2 detection and rejection of intra-slice motion and 3 robust reconstruction. Quantitative results from 14 volunteer subject experiments and the analysis of motion-corrupted SMS DWI of 6 children indicate robust reconstruction in the presence of continuous motion and the potential to extend the use of SMS DWI in very challenging populations.
