Functional-effective connectivity and network topology are nowadays key issues for studying brain physiological functions and pathologies. Inferring neuronal connectivity from electrophysiological recordings presents open challenges and unsolved problems. In this work we present a cross-correlation based method for reliably estimating not only excitatory but also inhibitory links by analyzing multi-unit spike activity from large-scale neuronal networks. The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale i.e. 4096 electrodes microtransducer arrays coupled to in vitro neural populations are presented. Specifically we show that: i functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in in vitro cortical networks providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; ii small-world topology with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available. The method and procedure can be directly extended and applied to in vivo multi-units brain activity recordings.
