"Cochlear implants CIs use electrode arrays that are surgically inserted into the cochlea to treat patients with hearing loss. For CI recipients sound bypasses the natural transduction mechanism and directly stimulates the neural regions thus creating a sense of hearing. Post-operatively CIs need to be programmed. Traditionally this is done by an audiologist who is blind to the positions of the electrodes relative to the cochlea and only relies on the subjective response of the patient. Multiple programming sessions are usually needed which can take a frustratingly long time. We have developed an image-guided cochlear implant programming IGCIP system to facilitate the process. In IGCIP we segment the intra-cochlear anatomy and localize the electrode arrays in the patients head CT image. By utilizing their spatial relationship we can suggest programming settings that can significantly improve hearing outcomes. To segment the intra-cochlear anatomy we use an active shape model ASM-based method. Though it produces satisfactory results in most cases sub-optimal segmentation still happens. As an alternative herein we explore using a deep learning method to perform the segmentation task. Large image sets with accurate ground truth in our case manual delineation are typically needed to train a deep learning model for segmentation but such a dataset does not exist for our application. To tackle this problem we use segmentations generated by the ASM-based method to pre-train the model and fine-tune it on a small image set for which accurate manual delineation is available. Using this method we achieve better results than the ASM-based method."
