During the last 25 years uncemented hip stem revision relying on diaphyseal fixation has shown improving clinical results and stem survival. The purpose of this study was to present the long-term results of hip revision with the SOLUTION stem DePuy Warsaw Indiana.\u2029Ninety-three consecutive SOLUTION hip stem revisions in 84 patients with a mean age of 69 years range 33-86 years were reviewed. Of these clinical and radiographic follow-up examination by an independent observer was possible in 36 hips/29 patients after mean 14 years range 10-18 years. Stem re-revision was documented by our own files and by the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry. \u2029Stem re-revision had been performed in two hips for aseptic loosening one due to deep infection and in one patient due to stem fracture. The 18 years cumulative survival free of re-revision for any reason was calculated as 94.4% 88.9-99.8% and for aseptic loosening to 97.6% 94.3-100%. Intraoperative complications were frequent with incidence of shaft fractures 14/93 and perforations 9/93 showing a significant learning curve. Mean Harris Hip Score was 85 range 53-99. Osseointegration was seen in 34/36 stems with two stems fibrous fixated. Stress shielding was significant associated with stem diameters 15 mm. Severe preoperative bone deficiency had no negative bearing on stem survival and no significant influence on osseointegration of the stem or on Harris Hip Score. \u2029 Revision hip arthroplasty with an extensively \u2028porous-coated stem - excellent long-term \u2028results also in severe femoral bone stock loss.
