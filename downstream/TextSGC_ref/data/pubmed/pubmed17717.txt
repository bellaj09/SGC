Current training in minimally invasive surgery MIS is inadequate given the demands of patients on practitioners and the number of surgeons and residents who still need to be trained. The training that is provided is neither widespread nor is it standardized resulting in graduate surgeons with a wide range of competence. There is little guidance in what a training program needs to be effective. We provide a brief review of the state of the art of MIS training with some emphasis given to training methods including perceptual motor training MIS learning laboratories virtual reality evaluation and assessment cost simulation fidelity credentialing certification privileging and ergonomics. We conclude that the state of the art is left wanting. Training and educational approaches to minimally invasive surgery: state of the art.
