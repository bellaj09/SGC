"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the basal ganglia motor circuitry is a highly effective treatment for the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease PD. However recent findings have indicated promising potential for PD therapy with DBS in brain structures outside the basal ganglia. For example high frequency stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus PH can reverse haloperidol-induced akinesia in rats Jackson J Young CK Hu B Bland BH 2008 High frequency stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus restores movement and reinstates hippocampal-striatal theta coherence following haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Exp Neurol 213:210-219. In the current study we used the bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinsonian akinesia in male Long-Evans rats to further explore the efficacy of PH DBS. The application of PH DBS in lesioned animals reversed akinesia in an active avoidance paradigm with increased latency compared to pre-lesion performance. The dramatic reversal of akinesia in two models of rodent Parkinsonism by PH DBS warrants further exploration of its therapeutic potential." Deep brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus reverses akinesia in bilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats.
