Inspired by the popular deep learning architecture deep stacking network DSN a specific deep model for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar POLSAR image classification is proposed in this paper which is named Wishart DSN W-DSN. First of all a fast implementation of Wishart distance is achieved by a special linear transformation which speeds up the classification of POLSAR image and makes it possible to use this polarimetric information in the following neural network NN. Then a single-hidden-layer NN based on the fast Wishart distance is defined for POLSAR image classification which is named Wishart network WN and improves the classification accuracy. Finally a multi-layer NN is formed by stacking WNs which is in fact the proposed deep learning architecture W-DSN for POLSAR image classification and improves the classification accuracy further. In addition the structure of WN can be expanded in a straightforward way by adding hidden units if necessary as well as the structure of the W-DSN. As a preliminary exploration on formulating specific deep learning architecture for POLSAR image classification the proposed methods may establish a simple but clever connection between POLSAR image interpretation and deep learning. The experiment results tested on real POLSAR image show that the fast implementation of Wishart distance is very efficient a POLSAR image with 768 000 pixels can be classified in 0.53 s and both the single-hidden-layer architecture WN and the deep learning architecture W-DSN for POLSAR image classification perform well and work efficiently.
