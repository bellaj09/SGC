Excisional surgical debridement SD is still the gold standard in the treatment of deeply burned hands though the intricate anatomy is easily damaged. Previous studies demonstrated that enzymatic debridement with the bromelain debriding agent NexoBrid EDNX is more selective and thus can preserve viable tissue with excellent outcome results. So far no method paper has been published presenting different treatment algorithms in this new field. Therefore our aim was to close this gap by presenting our detailed learning curve in EDNX of deeply burned hands. Our initial learning curve in the enzymatic debridement of severely burned hands-Management and pit falls of initial treatments and our development of a post debridement wound treatment algorithm.
