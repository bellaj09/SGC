Cardiopulmonary bypass CPB and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest DHCA enable surgical repair of cardiovascular defects. However neurological complications can result after both CPB and DHCA. We sought to investigate if 75 min of CPB or DHCA caused motor cognitive or histological deficits in rats. Three groups were studied: DHCA CPB and sham. Rats in the DHCA group were subjected to 75 min DHCA at 15 degrees C with a total CPB duration of 75 min. Rats in the CPB group were subjected to 75 min of normothermic CPB. Shams received the same anesthesia cannulations and infusions. Motor function was assessed using beam testing on days 3-13. Cognitive performance was evaluated using Morris water maze tasks on days 7-13. Overall Performance Category OPC and Neurologic Deficit Score NDS were assessed daily. Histological Damage Score HDS was assessed in survivors on day 14. Sustained deficits on beam testing were seen only in the CPB group. Rats in the CPB and DHCA groups exhibited similar cognitive performance vs. sham. There were no differences in OPC or NDS between groups. Neuronal degeneration was present only in small foci in rats after DHCA n=4/7. However HDS was not different in individual brain regions or viscera between DHCA or CPB vs. sham. Surprisingly CPB but not DHCA was associated with motor deficits vs. sham and no cognitive deficits were seen in either group vs. sham. Future studies with longer DHCA duration will be necessary to provide targets to assess novel preservation strategies. Prolonged deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in rats can be achieved without cognitive deficits.
