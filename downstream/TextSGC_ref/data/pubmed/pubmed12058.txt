Previous studies have suggested that distinct and homogenous sub-groups of gait patterns exist among runners with patellofemoral pain PFP based on gait analysis. However acquisition of 3D kinematic data using optical systems is time consuming and prone to marker placement errors. In contrast axial segment acceleration data can represent an overall running pattern being easy to acquire and not influenced by marker placement error. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine if pelvic acceleration patterns during running could be used to classify PFP patients into homogeneous sub-groups. A secondary purpose was to analyze lower limb kinematic data to investigate the practical implications of clustering these subjects based on 3D pelvic acceleration data. Runners with patellofemoral pain demonstrate sub-groups of pelvic acceleration profiles using hierarchical cluster analysis: an exploratory cross-sectional study.
