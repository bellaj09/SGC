Depression has been shown to be related to a variety of aberrant brain functions and structures. Particularly the investigation of alterations in functional connectivity FC in major depressive disorder MDD has been a promising endeavor since a better understanding of pathological brain networks may foster our understanding of the disease. However the underling mechanisms of aberrant FC in MDD are largely unclear. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS we investigated FC in the cortical parts of the default mode network DMN during resting-state in patients with current MDD. Additionally we used qualitative and quantitative measures of psychological processes e.g. state/trait rumination mind-wandering to investigate their contribution to differences in FC between depressed and non-depressed subjects. Our results indicate that 40% of the patients report spontaneous rumination during resting-state. Depressed subjects showed reduced FC in parts of the DMN compared to healthy controls. This finding was linked to the process of state/trait rumination. While rumination was negatively correlated with FC in the cortical parts of the DMN mind-wandering showed positive associations. Aberrant functional connectivity in depression as an index of state and trait rumination.
