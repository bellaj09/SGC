We present a mobile brain-body imaging MoBI dataset acquired during treadmill walking in a brain-computer interface BCI task. The data were collected from eight healthy subjects each having three identical trials. Each trial consisted of three conditions: standing treadmill walking and treadmill walking with a closed-loop BCI. During the BCI condition subjects used their brain activity to control a virtual avatar on a screen to walk in real-time. Robust procedures were designed to record lower limb joint angles bilateral hip knee and ankle using goniometers synchronized with 60-channel scalp electroencephalography EEG. Additionally electrooculogram EOG EEG electrodes impedance and digitized EEG channel locations were acquired to aid artifact removal and EEG dipole-source localization. This dataset is unique in that it is the first published MoBI dataset recorded during walking. It is useful in addressing several important open research questions such as how EEG is coupled with gait cycle during closed-loop BCI how BCI influences neural activity during walking and how a BCI decoder may be optimized.
