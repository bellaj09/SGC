"A novel decoding scheme for motor imagery MI brain computer interfaces BCIs is introduced based on the GFT concept. It considers the recorded EEG activity as a signal defined over the graph of the sensor array. A graph encapsulating the functional covariations emerging during the execution of a specific imagined movement is first defined from a small training set of relevant trials. The ensemble of graphs signals corresponding to a multi-trial training dataset is then analyzed using a graph-guided decomposition and based on discriminative Lasso dLasso an information-rich GFT subspace is defined. After training only simple matrix operations are required for transforming the multichannel signal into features to be fed into a classifier that decides whether brain activity conforms with the graph structure associated with the targeted movement. The proposed decoding scheme is evaluated based on two different datasets and found to compare favorably against popular alternatives in the field."
