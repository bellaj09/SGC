"Action capability may be one of the factors that can influence our percept of the world. A distinction can be made between momentary action capability action capability at that particular moment and inherent action capability representing a stable action capability. In the current study we investigated whether there was a biasing effect of these two forms of action capability on visual perception of location. In a virtual reality room subjects had to stop a moving ball from hitting a pillar. On some trials the ball disappeared automatically during its motion. Subjects had to estimate the location of the balls disappearance in these trials. We expected that if action is necessary but action capability inherent or momentary is limiting performance the location of approaching objects with respect to the observer is underestimated. By judging the objects to be nearer than they really are the need to select and execute the appropriate action increases thereby facilitating quick action Cole et al. in Psychol Sci 241:34-40 2013. doi: 10.1177/0956797612446953 . As a manipulation of inherent action capability in a virtual environment two groups of participants video game players vs. non-video game players were entered into the study high and low action capability. Momentary action capability was manipulated by using two difficulty levels in the experiment Easy vs. Difficult. Results indicated that inherent and momentary action capabilities interacted together to influence online location judgments: Non-players underestimated locations when the task was Difficult. Taken together our data suggest that both inherent and momentary action capabilities influence location judgments." "Location estimation of approaching objects is modulated by the observers inherent and momentary action capabilities."
