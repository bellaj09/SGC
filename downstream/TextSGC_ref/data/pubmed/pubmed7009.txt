Understanding brain organization of speech production has been a principal goal of neuroscience. Historically brain speech production has been associated with so-called Brocas area Brodmann area BA- 44 and 45 however modern neuroimaging developments suggest speech production is associated with networks rather than with areas. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the connectivity of BA47  pars orbitalis in relation to language . "Should Brocas area include Brodmann area 47?"
