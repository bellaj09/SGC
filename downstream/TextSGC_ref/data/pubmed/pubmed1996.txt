"Misfolded proteins MP are a key component in aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. For example misfolded Amyloid- A and tau proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimers disease. Mechanisms underlying intra-brain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially uncharacterized. Here is introduced an epidemic spreading model ESM for MP dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the brains clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces advanced A deposition patterns in the human brain explaining 4656% of the variance in regional A loads in 733 subjects from the ADNI database. Furthermore this model strongly supports a the leading role of A clearance deficiency and early A onset age during Alzheimers disease progression b that effective anatomical distance from A outbreak region explains regional A arrival time and A deposition likelihood c the multi-factorial impact of APOE e4 genotype gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain A propagation and d the modulatory impact of A propagation history on tau proteins concentrations supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway between A pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge the ESM is the first computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain networks production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated intercellular transfer mechanisms individual genetic/demographic properties and clinical states in health and disease. In sum the proposed ESM constitutes a promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders."
