Traumatic brain injury survivors often experience cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms. However the neurobiological mechanisms underlying specific impairments are not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI have given us new insights on structural and functional connectivity patterns of the human brain in both health and disease. The connectome derived from connectivity maps reflects the entire constellation of distributed brain networks. Using these powerful neuroimaging approaches changes at the microstructural level can be detected through regional and global properties of neuronal networks. Here we will review recent developments in the study of brain network abnormalities in traumatic brain injury mainly focusing on structural and functional connectivity. Some connectomic studies have provided interesting insights into the neurological dysfunction that occurs following traumatic brain injury. These techniques could eventually be helpful in developing imaging biomarkers of cognitive and neurobehavioral sequelae as well as predicting outcome and prognosis.
