Entropy images representing the complexity of original fundus photographs may strengthen the contrast between diabetic retinopathy DR lesions and unaffected areas. The aim of this study is to compare the detection performance for severe DR between original fundus photographs and entropy images by deep learning. A sample of 21123 interpretable fundus photographs obtained from a publicly available data set was expanded to 33000 images by rotating and flipping. All photographs were transformed into entropy images using block size 9 and downsized to a standard resolution of 100\u2009\u2009100 pixels. The stages of DR are classified into 5 grades based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale: Grade 0 no DR Grade 1 mild nonproliferative DR Grade 2 moderate nonproliferative DR Grade 3 severe nonproliferative DR and Grade 4 proliferative DR. Of these 33000 photographs 30000 images were randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 3000 images were used as the testing set. Both the original fundus photographs and the entropy images were used as the inputs of convolutional neural network CNN and the results of detecting referable DR Grades 2-4 as the outputs from the two data sets were compared. The detection accuracy sensitivity and specificity of using the original fundus photographs data set were 81.80% 68.36% 89.87% respectively for the entropy images data set and the figures significantly increased to 86.10% 73.24% and 93.81% respectively all p values <0.001. The entropy image quantifies the amount of information in the fundus photograph and efficiently accelerates the generating of feature maps in the CNN. The research results draw the conclusion that transformed entropy imaging of fundus photographs can increase the machinery detection accuracy sensitivity and specificity of referable DR for the deep learning-based system.
