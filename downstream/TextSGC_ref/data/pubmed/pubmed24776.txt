Depression is the leading cause of disability in youth with a global economic burden of US >$210 billion annually. However up to 70% of youth with depression do not receive services. Even among those who do access treatment 30% to 65% fail to respond and many dropout prematurely demonstrating a need for more potent accessible interventions. In a previous trial a single-session Web-based growth mindset GM intervention significantly reduced depressive symptoms in high-symptom adolescents; however this intervention did not benefit adolescents uniformly. For instance the intervention reduced depression in adolescents who reported post intervention increases in perceived control but it did not lead to significant depression reductions in adolescents who reported no significant post intervention increases in perceived control.
