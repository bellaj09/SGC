Forty-five participants who refused to fly during a screening test and who also met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for specific phobia agoraphobia or panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomly assigned to 5 sessions of either virtual reality exposure VRE or attention-placebo group treatment GT. At posttreatment 65% of VRE participants and 57% of GT participants flew during a test flight. Both groups showed significant improvement following treatment on standardized self-report measures of flight anxiety with a better outcome for the VRE group on 4 of 5 of these measures. At 6-month follow-up however most group differences had disappeared; VRE resulted in a better outcome on only 1 of 5 standardized flight anxiety measures.
