"The book Jerome S. Bruner beyond 100: Cultivating Possibilities immerses the reader in an epistemic historical and affective portrait delivered by authors from various fields and distinct perspectives on Bruners work in celebration of his hundredth birthday. If on the one hand it is possible to say that Bruners life story intertwines with the history of Psychology itself on the other hand it is possible to recognise the author as a great ironist according to Rortys perspective in his way of approaching the transformation process in psychological science. The present paper constructs a pragmatics dialogue with Bruners Cultural Psychology discussing contemporary Western society in its way of understanding cultural diversity and communality citizenship. In times of media customisation and the fluid and agile environment of virtual communities bubbles have become arenas for the reification of beliefs and meanings based on validation by peers and not by the dialectical transformative tension towards their possible opposites. The present discussion builds up a reflection concerning possible affective-semiotics process in contemporary culture highlighting Bruners grammar on intersubjectivity and narrative interpretation of reality on the basis of Rortys pragmatics-ethical philosophy."
