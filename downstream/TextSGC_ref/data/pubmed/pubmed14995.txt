An experiment was conducted to determine how orthographic and conceptual information are integrated during incidental and intentional retrieval. Subjects studied word lists with either a shallow counting vowels or deep rating pleasantness processing task then received either an implicit or explicit word fragment completion WFC test. At test word fragments contained 0 1 2 or 4 letters and were accompanied by 0 1 2 or 3 semantically related words. On both the implicit and explicit tests performance improved with increases in the numbers of letters and words. When semantic cues were presented with the word fragments the implicit test became more conceptually drive. Still conceptual processing had a larger effect in intentional than in incidental retrieval. The Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception FLMP provided a good description of how orthographic semantic and episodic information were combined during retrieval. Integration of orthographic conceptual and episodic information on implicit and explicit tests.
