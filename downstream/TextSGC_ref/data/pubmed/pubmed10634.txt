This study proposes and evaluates five deep fully convolutional networks FCNs for the semantic segmentation of a single tree species: SegNet U-Net FC-DenseNet and two DeepLabv3+ variants. The performance of the FCN designs is evaluated experimentally in terms of classification accuracy and computational load. We also verify the benefits of fully connected conditional random fields CRFs as a post-processing step to improve the segmentation maps. The analysis is conducted on a set of images captured by an RGB camera aboard a UAV flying over an urban area. The dataset also contains a mask that indicates the occurrence of an endangered species called Dipteryx alata Vogel also known as cumbaru taken as the species to be identified. The experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of each design and reports average overall accuracy ranging from 88.9% to 96.7% an F1-score between 87.0% and 96.1% and IoU from 77.1% to 92.5%. We also realize that CRF consistently improves the performance but at a high computational cost.
