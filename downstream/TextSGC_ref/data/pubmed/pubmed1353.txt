Modern medicine has known its success thanks to traditional medicine the effectiveness of which derives from medicinal plants.The objective of this study is to determine if the components of natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking which used to find an interaction between the molecules studied and the protein in our case we based on the inhibitor Coronavirus nCoV-2019 spike protein.The results of molecular docking showed that among 67 molecules of natural origin three molecules Crocin Digitoxigenin and -Eudesmol which are proposed as inhibitors against the coronavirus based on the energy of interaction between these molecules and studied protein.
