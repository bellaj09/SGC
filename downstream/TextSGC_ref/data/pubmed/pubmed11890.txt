The complexes formed by binding of proteins to RNAs play key roles in many biological processes such as splicing gene expression regulation translation and viral replication. Understanding protein-RNA binding may thus provide important insights to the functionality and dynamics of many cellular processes. This has sparked substantial interest in exploring protein-RNA binding experimentally and predicting it computationally. The key computational challenge is to efficiently and accurately infer protein-RNA binding models that will enable prediction of novel protein-RNA interactions to additional transcripts of interest.
