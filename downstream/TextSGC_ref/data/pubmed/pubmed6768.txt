Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to bioimaging problems; however these methods are highly data demanding. An approach to deal with the lack of data and avoid overfitting is the application of data augmentation a technique that generates new training samples from the original dataset by applying different kinds of transformations. Several tools exist to apply data augmentation in the context of image classification but it does not exist a similar tool for the problems of localization detection semantic segmentation or instance segmentation that works not only with 2 dimensional images but also with multi-dimensional images such as stacks or videos.
