The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis prediction and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform data nonlinearly thus revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data and signal and imaging modalities from cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general while proposing certain directions as the most viable for clinical use.
