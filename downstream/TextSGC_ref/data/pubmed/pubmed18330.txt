Deterioration of physical and psychological health is an important issue in older adults aged 65 years or more. This study aimed to determine whether a virtual kayak paddling VKP exercise could improve postural balance muscle performance and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to the VKP n\u2009=\u200930 or control group n\u2009=\u200930. Participants in the VKP group performed the paddling exercise in a virtual environment for 60\xa0min twice a week for 6 weeks whereas those in the control group performed home exercises. Postural balance p\u2009<\u2009.05 muscle performance p\u2009<\u2009.05 and cognitive function p\u2009<\u2009.05 were significantly improved in the VKP group and were superior to those in the control group p\u2009<\u2009.05. Thus the findings indicate that VKP exercise improves postural balance muscle performance and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
