"In children the pain and anxiety associated with acute burn dressing changes can be severe with drug treatment alone frequently proving to be inadequate. Virtual reality VR systems have been successfully trialled in limited numbers of adult and paediatric burn patients. Augmented reality AR differs from VR in that it overlays virtual images onto the physical world instead of creating a complete virtual world. This prospective randomised controlled trial investigated the use of AR as an adjunct to analgesia and sedation in children with acute burns. Forty-two children 30 male and 12 female with an age range of 3-14 years median age 9 years and a total burn surface area ranging from 1 to 16% were randomised into a treatment AR arm and a control basic cognitive therapy arm after administration of analgesia and/or sedation. Pain scores pulse rates PR respiratory rates RR and oxygen saturations SaO2 were recorded pre-procedurally at 10 min intervals and post-procedurally. Parents were also asked to grade their childs overall pain score for the dressing change. Mean pain scores were significantly lower p=0.0060 in the AR group compared to the control group as were parental pain assessment scores p=0.015. Respiratory and pulse rates showed significant changes over time within groups however these were not significantly different between the two study groups. Oxygen saturation did not differ significantly over time or between the two study groups. This trial shows that augmented reality is a useful adjunct to pharmacological analgesia."
