Resting-state fMRI rs-fMRI has emerged as a prominent tool for the study of functional connectivity. The identification of the regions associated with the different brain functions has received significant interest. However most of the studies conducted so far have focused on the definition of a common set of regions valid for an entire population. The variation of the functional regions within a population has rarely been accounted for. sGraSP: A graph-based method for the derivation of subject-specific functional parcellations of the brain.
