The brain-computer interface BCI devices are of prime important for study of nervous system as well as diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. To meet the needs of the BCI devices in high-density integration and multi-functionalization 3-dimensional 3D drivable optrode array with laser diodes LDs coupled waveguides was developed. The unique device realizes the 3D integration of the optrodes and avoids fiber tangle and tissue heating by adopting LD coupled waveguide structure. Besides the postoperative position adjustment of the optrode array was achieved by integrating with a 3D printed micro-drive. Most importantly high-resolution neural stimulations and recordings were achieved for study of working memory related neural circuits in four brain regions of mice including prelimbic cortex PrL mediodorsal thalamic nucleus MD dorsal medial caudate nucleus dmCP and posterior motor cortex 2 pM2. The results indicate that this novel device is promising for the research of complex neural networks.
