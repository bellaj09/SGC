"A virtual reality surgical simulator ideally allows seamless transition between the real and virtual world. In that respect all of a surgeons motions and tools must be simulated. Until now researchers have been limited to using a pen-like tool in six degrees-of-freedom. This paper presents the addition of haptically enabled scissors to the end effector of a 6-DOF haptic device the Freedom 6S. The scissors are capable of pinching a maximum torque of 460 mN.m with low inertia and low back-drive friction. The device is a balanced design so that the user feels like they are holding no more than actual scissors although with some added inertia on the load end. The system is interchangeable between the 6-DOF and 7-DOF configurations to allow switching tools quickly." Surgical scissors extension adds the 7th axis of force feedback to the Freedom 6S.
