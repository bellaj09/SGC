Recently molecular fingerprints extracted from three-dimensional 3D structures using advanced mathematics such as algebraic topology differential geometry and graph theory have been paired with efficient machine learning especially deep learning algorithms to outperform other methods in drug discovery applications and competitions. This raises the question of whether classical 2D fingerprints are still valuable in computer-aided drug discovery. This work considers 23 datasets associated with four typical problems namely protein-ligand binding toxicity solubility and partition coefficient to assess the performance of eight 2D fingerprints. Advanced machine learning algorithms including random forest gradient boosted decision tree single-task deep neural network and multitask deep neural network are employed to construct efficient 2D-fingerprint based models. Additionally appropriate consensus models are built to further enhance the performance of 2D-fingerprint-based methods. It is demonstrated that 2D-fingerprint-based models perform as well as the state-of-the-art 3D structure-based models for the predictions of toxicity solubility partition coefficient and protein-ligand binding affinity based on only ligand information. However 3D structure-based models outperform 2D fingerprint-based methods in complex-based protein-ligand binding affinity predictions. Are 2D fingerprints still valuable for drug discovery?
