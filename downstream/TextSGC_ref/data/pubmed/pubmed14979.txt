Peaches are susceptible to infection from several postharvest diseases. In order to control disease and avoid potential health risks it is important to identify suitable treatments for each disease type. In this study the spectral and imaging information from hyperspectral reflectance 400~1000 nm was used to evaluate and classify three kinds of common peach disease. To reduce the large dimensionality of the hyperspectral imaging principal component analysis PCA was applied to analyse each wavelength image as a whole and the first principal component was selected to extract the imaging features. A total of 54 parameters were extracted as imaging features for one sample. Three decayed stages slight moderate and severe decayed peaches were considered for classification by deep belief network DBN and partial least squares discriminant analysis PLSDA in this study. The results showed that the DBN model has better classification results than the classification accuracy of the PLSDA model. The DBN model based on integrated information 494 features showed the highest classification results for the three diseases with accuracies of 82.5% 92.5% and 100% for slightly-decayed moderately-decayed and severely-decayed samples respectively. The successive projections algorithm SPA was used to select the optimal features from the integrated information; then six optimal features were selected from a total of 494 features to establish the simple model. The SPA-PLSDA model showed better results which were more feasible for industrial application. The results showed that the hyperspectral reflectance imaging technique is feasible for detecting different kinds of diseased peaches especially at the moderately- and severely-decayed levels.
