The Protein Data Bank PDB the ultimate source for data in structural biology is inherently imbalanced. To alleviate biases virtually all structural biology studies use non-redundant subsets of the PDB which include only a fraction of the available data. An alternative approach dubbed redundancy-weighting down-weights redundant entries rather than discarding them. This approach may be particularly helpful for Machine Learning ML methods that use the PDB as their source for data.Methods for Secondary Structure Prediction SSP have greatly improved over the years with recent studies achieving above 70% accuracy for 8-class DSSP prediction. As these methods typically incorporate machine learning techniques training on redundancy-weighted datasets might improve accuracy as well as pave the way toward larger and more informative secondary structure alphabets.
