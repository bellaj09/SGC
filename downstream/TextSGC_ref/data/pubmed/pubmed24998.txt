We independently explored the use of the Sony PlayStation II EyeToy Sony Corporation Foster City CA as a tool for use in the rehabilitation of patients with severe burns. Intensive occupational and physical therapy is crucial in minimizing and preventing long-term disability for the burn patient; however the therapist faces a difficult challenge combating the agonizing pain experienced by the patient during therapy. The Sony PlayStation II EyeToy is a projected video-capture system that although initially developed as a gaming environment for children may be a useful application in a rehabilitative context. As compared with other virtual reality systems the EyeToy is an efficient rehabilitation tool that is sold commercially at a relatively low cost. This report presents the potential advantages for use of the EyeToy as an innovative rehabilitative tool with mitigating effects on pain in burn rehabilitation. This new technology represents a challenging and motivating way for the patient to immerse himself or herself in an alternate reality while undergoing treatment thereby reducing the pain and discomfort he or she experiences. This simple affordable technique may prove to heighten the level of patient cooperation and therefore speed the process of rehabilitation and return of functional ability. The use of video capture virtual reality in burn rehabilitation: the possibilities.
