An invasive brain-computer interface BCI is a promising neurorehabilitation device for severely disabled patients. Although some systems have been shown to work well in restricted laboratory settings their utility must be tested in less controlled real-time environments. Our objective was to investigate whether a specific motor task could be reliably detected from multiunit intracortical signals from freely moving animals in a simulated real-time setting.
