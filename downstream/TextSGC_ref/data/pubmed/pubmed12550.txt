Motor fluctuations between "OFF" state with no benefit from medication and " ON" state with optimum benefit from medication are a major focus of clinical managements in individuals with mid-stage and advance Parkinson\s disease PD. In this work an automated algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory LSTM as a deep learning method is developed to identify motor fluctuations in individuals with PD using wearable sensors during a variety of daily living activities. This network was evaluated on two datasets i.e. Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 that included recordings of 19 individuals with PD using subject-based leave-one-out cross-validation. The designed LSTM network yielded promising results using only one ankle sensor with an average classification rate of 73% and 77% for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively.
