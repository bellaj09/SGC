Intracortical electrodes record neural signals directly from local populations of neurons in the brain and conduct them to external electronics that control prosthetics. However the relationship between electrode design defined by shape size and tethering; and long-term chronic stability of the neuron-electrode interface is poorly understood. Here we studied the effects of various commercially available intracortical electrode designs that vary in shape cylindrical planar size 15 m 50 m and 75 m and tethering electrode connections to connector with tethered and without tethering cable untethered using histological transcriptomic and electrophysiological analyses over acute 3 day and chronic 12 week timepoints. Quantitative analysis of histological sections indicated that Michigan 50 m M50 and Michigan tethered MT electrodes induced significantly p < 0.01 higher glial scarring and lesser survival of neurons in regions of blood-brain barrier BBB breach when compared to microwire MW and Michigan 15 m M15 electrodes acutely and chronically. Gene expression analysis of the neurotoxic cytokines interleukin Il1 Il1 Il1 Il6 Il17 Il17a Il17b Il17f and tumor necrosis factor alpha Tnf indicated that MW electrodes induced significantly p < 0.05 reduced expression of these transcripts when compared to M15 M50 and FMAA electrodes chronically. Finally electrophysiological assessment of electrode function indicated that MW electrodes performed significantly p < 0.05 better than all other electrodes over a period of 12 weeks. These studies reveal that intracortical electrodes with smaller size cylindrical shape and without tethering cables produce significantly diminished inflammatory responses when compared to large planar and tethered electrodes. These studies provide a platform for the rational design and assessment of chronically functional intracortical electrode implants in the future.
