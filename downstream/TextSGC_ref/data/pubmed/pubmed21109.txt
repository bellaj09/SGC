In perforator flap transplantation dissection of the perforator is an important but difficult procedure because of the high variability in vascular anatomy. Preoperative imaging techniques could provide substantial information about vascular anatomy; however it cannot provide direct guidance for surgeons during the operation. In this study a navigation system NS was established to overlie a vascular map on surgical sites to further provide a direct guide for perforator flap transplantation.
