This project aimed to construct an operating room to implement high dimensional 3D 4D medical imaging and medical virtual reality techniques that would enable clinical tests for new surgical procedures. We designed and constructed such an operating room at Dai-san Hospital the Jikei Univ. School of Medicine Tokyo Japan. The room was equipped with various facilities for image-guided robot and tele- surgery. In this report we describe an outline of our "high-tech operating room" and future plans. Construction of a high-tech operating room for image-guided surgery using VR.
