The hippocampal formation is a brain system that is implicated in learning and memory. The major input to the hippocampus arrives from the entorhinal cortex EC to the dentate gyrus DG through the perforant path. In the present work we have investigated the functional properties of this connection by concomitantly applying electrophysiological techniques deep-brain electric microstimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging in anesthetized rats. We systematically delivered different current intensities at diverse stimulation frequencies to the perforant path while recording electrophysiological and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent BOLD signals. We observed a linear relationship between the current intensity used to stimulate the hippocampal formation and the amplitude and extension of the induced BOLD response. In addition we found a frequency-dependent spatial pattern of activation. With stimulation protocols and train frequencies used for kindling the activity strongly spreads ipsilaterally through the hippocampus DG subiculum and EC.
