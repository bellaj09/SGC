Common spatial pattern CSP is a popular algorithm for classifying electroencephalogram EEG signals in the context of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. This paper presents a regularization and aggregation technique for CSP in a small-sample setting SSS. Conventional CSP is based on a sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence its performance in EEG classification deteriorates if the number of training samples is small. To address this concern a regularized CSP R-CSP algorithm is proposed where the covariance-matrix estimation is regularized by two parameters to lower the estimation variance while reducing the estimation bias. To tackle the problem of regularization parameter determination R-CSP with aggregation R-CSP-A is further proposed where a number of R-CSPs are aggregated to give an ensemble-based solution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on data set IVa of BCI Competition III against four other competing algorithms. Experiments show that R-CSP-A significantly outperforms the other methods in average classification performance in three sets of experiments across various testing scenarios with particular superiority in SSS.
