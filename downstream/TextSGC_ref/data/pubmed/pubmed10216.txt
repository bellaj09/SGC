The aim of this research was to determine the satisfaction of medical students with problem-based learning PBL and their approaches to learning to investigate the effect of learning approaches on their levels of satisfaction. The study group was composed of medical students from three different universities which apply PBL at different levels in their curricula. The revised two-factor study process survey was applied to the study group to determine their approaches to learning as "deep" or "surface" learning. In addition another survey of 20 questions was used to determine satisfaction levels of students with PBL and other variables. Of the study group 64.6% were found to adopt a deep approach to learning and we confirmed that these students were reasonably more satisfied with PBL. Do learning approaches of medical students affect their satisfaction with problem-based learning?
