This study investigated the benefits of using a virtual nature environment to administer immersive heart rate variability biofeedback HRV-BF based on slow-paced breathing. We compared the virtual reality VR-based HRV-BF with a standard implementation in a randomized controlled experiment with 60 healthy employees. After a cognitive stress induction the participants performed a single-session of HRV-BF before repeating the cognitive stressor task. VR-based versus standard HRV-BF was comparable in terms of biofeedback performance cardiac coherence and cardiac vagal tone. However the VR-based implementation buffered perceived stress in the subsequent stressor task increased relaxation self-efficacy more reduced mind wandering helped participants focus on the present moment and helped preserve attentional resources. Potential long-term effects and generalizability need to be assessed in future research. Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Based on Slow-Paced Breathing With Immersive Virtual Reality Nature Scenery.
