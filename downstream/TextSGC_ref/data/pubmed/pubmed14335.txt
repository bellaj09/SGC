Neuromodulation of neural networks whereby a selected circuit is regulated by a particular modulator plays a critical role in learning and memory. Among neuromodulators acetylcholine ACh plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent memory and has been shown to modulate neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. However it has remained unknown how ACh modulates hippocampal output. Here using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that ACh by activating oriens lacunosum moleculare OLM interneurons and therefore augmenting the negative-feedback regulation to the CA1 pyramidal neurons suppresses the circuit from the hippocampal area CA1 to the deep-layer entorhinal cortex EC. We also demonstrate using mouse behavior studies that the ablation of OLM interneurons specifically impairs hippocampus-dependent but not hippocampus-independent learning. These data suggest that ACh plays an important role in regulating hippocampal output to the EC by activating OLM interneurons which is critical for the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory. Septal cholinergic neurons gate hippocampal output to entorhinal cortex via oriens lacunosum moleculare interneurons.
