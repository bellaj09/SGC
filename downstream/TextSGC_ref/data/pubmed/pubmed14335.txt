Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence AI that imitates the neural network in the brain. We generated an AI to diagnose Helicobacter pylori H. pylori infection using blue laser imaging BLI-bright and linked color imaging LCI. The aim of this pilot study was to establish an AI diagnosing system that predicts H. pylori infection status using endoscopic images to improve the accuracy and productivity of endoscopic examination. Artificial intelligence diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection using blue laser imaging-bright and linked color imaging: a single-center prospective study.
