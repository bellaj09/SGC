Biomedical named-entity recognition BioNER is widely modeled with conditional random fields CRF by regarding it as a sequence labeling problem. The CRF-based methods yield structured outputs of labels by imposing connectivity between the labels. Recent studies for BioNER have reported state-of-the-art performance by combining deep learning-based models e.g. bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and CRF. The deep learning-based models in the CRF-based methods are dedicated to estimating individual labels whereas the relationships between connected labels are described as static numbers; thereby it is not allowed to timely reflect the context in generating the most plausible label-label transitions for a given input sentence. Regardless correctly segmenting entity mentions in biomedical texts is challenging because the biomedical terms are often descriptive and long compared with general terms. Therefore limiting the label-label transitions as static numbers is a bottleneck in the performance improvement of BioNER.
