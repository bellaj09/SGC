Electrophysiologic abnormalities of the globus pallidus externus have been shown in several disease processes including Parkinson disease dystonia and Huntington disease. However the connectivity nuclear structure and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution multishell data.
