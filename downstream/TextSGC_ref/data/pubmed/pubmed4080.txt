"An infants ability to perceive emotional facial expressions is critical for developing social skills. Infants are tuned to faces from early in life however the functional organization of the brain that supports the processing of emotional faces in infants is still not well understood. We recorded electroencephalography EEG brain responses in 8-10 month old infants and adults and applied graph theory analysis on the functional connections to compare the network organization at the global and the regional levels underlying the perception of negative and positive dynamic facial expressions happiness and sadness. We first show that processing of dynamic emotional faces occurs across multiple brain regions in both infants and adults. Across all brain regions at the global level network density was higher in the infant group in comparison with adults suggesting that the overall brain organization in relation to emotion perception is still immature in infancy. In contrast at the regional levels the functional characteristics of the frontal and parietal nodes were similar between infants and adults suggesting that functional regional specialization for emotion perception is already established at this age. In addition in both groups the occipital parietal and temporal nodes appear to have the strongest influence on information flow within the network. These results suggest that while the global organization for the emotion perception of sad and happy emotions is still under development the basic functional network organization at the regional level is already in place early in infancy." Infants and adults have similar regional functional brain organization for the perception of emotions.
