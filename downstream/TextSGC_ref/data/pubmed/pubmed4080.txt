NMDARs play a major role in patterning of topographic sensory maps in the brain. Genetic knock-out of the essential subunit of NMDARs in excitatory cortical neurons prevents whisker-specific neural pattern formation in the barrel cortex. To determine the role of NMDARs en route to the cortex we generated sensory thalamus-specific NR1 Grin1-null mice ThNR1KO. A multipronged approach using histology electrophysiology optical imaging and behavioral testing revealed that in these mice whisker patterns develop in the trigeminal brainstem but do not develop in the somatosensory thalamus. Subsequently there is no barrel formation in the neocortex yet a partial afferent patterning develops. Whisker stimulation evokes weak cortical activity and presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability is also affected. We found several behavioral deficits in tasks ranging from sensorimotor to social and cognitive. Collectively these results show that thalamic NMDARs play a critical role in the patterning of the somatosensory thalamic and cortical maps and their impairment may lead to pronounced behavioral defects. Thalamic NMDA receptor function is necessary for patterning of the thalamocortical somatosensory map and for sensorimotor behaviors.
