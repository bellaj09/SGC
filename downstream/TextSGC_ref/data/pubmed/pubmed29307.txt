Functional connectivity fcMRI analyses of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data revealed substantial differences between states of consciousness. The underlying cause-effect linkage however remains unknown to the present day. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between fcMRI measures and Disorders of Consciousness DOC in resting state and under adequate stimulation. Spatial characteristics of spontaneous and stimulus-induced individual functional connectivity networks in severe disorders of consciousness.
