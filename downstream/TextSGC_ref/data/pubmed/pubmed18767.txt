The development and implementation of personalized medicine is paramount to improving the efficiency and efficacy of patient care. In the respiratory system function is largely dictated by the choreographed movement of air and blood to the gas exchange surface. The passage of air begins in the upper airways either via the mouth or nose and terminates at the alveolar interface while blood flows from the heart to the alveoli and back again. Computational fluid dynamics CFD is a well-established tool for predicting fluid flows and pressure distributions within complex systems. Traditionally CFD has been used to aid in the effective or improved design of a system or device; however it has become increasingly exploited in biological and medical-based applications further broadening the scope of this computational technique. In this review we discuss the advancement in application of CFD to the respiratory system and the contributions CFD is currently making toward improving precision medicine. The key areas CFD has been applied to in the pulmonary system are in predicting fluid transport and aerosol distribution within the airways. Here we focus our discussion on fluid flows and in particular on image-based clinically focused CFD in the ventilatory system. We discuss studies spanning from the paranasal sinuses through the conducting airways down to the level of the alveolar airways. The combination of imaging and CFD is enabling improved device design in aerosol transport improved biomarkers of lung function in clinical trials and improved predictions and assessment of surgical interventions in the nasal sinuses.
