"Posteromedial cortex PMC is a highly segregated and dynamic core which appears to play a critical role in internally/externally directed cognitive processes including conscious awareness. Nevertheless neuroimaging studies on acquired disorders of consciousness have traditionally explored PMC as a homogenous and indivisible structure. We suggest that a fine-grained description of intrinsic PMC topology during coma could expand our understanding about how this cortical hub contributes to consciousness generation and maintain and could permit the identification of specific markers related to brain injury mechanism and useful for neurological prognostication. To explore this we used a recently developed voxel-based unbiased approach named functional connectivity density CD. We compared 27 comatose patients 15 traumatic and 12 anoxic to 14 age-matched healthy controls. The patients outcome was assessed 3\xa0months later using Coma Recovery Scale-Revised CRS-R. A complex pattern of decreased and increased connections was observed suggesting a network imbalance between internal/external processing systems within PMC during coma. The number of PMC voxels with hypo-CD positive correlation showed a significant negative association with the CRS-R score notwithstanding aetiology. Traumatic injury specifically appeared to be associated with a greater prevalence of hyper-connected negative correlation voxels which was inversely associated with patient neurological outcome. A logistic regression model using the number of hypo-CD positive and hyper-CD negative correlations accurately permitted patients outcome prediction AUC\xa0=\xa00.906 95%IC\xa0=\xa00.795-1. These points might reflect adaptive plasticity mechanism and pave the way for innovative prognosis and therapeutics methods."
