"Wearable sensors have successfully been used in recent studies to monitor cigarette smoking events and analyze peoples smoking behavior. Respiratory inductive plethysmography RIP has been employed to track breathing and to identify characteristic breathing pattern specific to smoking. Pattern recognition algorithms such as Support Vector Machine SVM Hidden Markov Model Decision tree or ensemble approaches have been used to identify smoke inhalations. However no deep learning approaches which have been proved effective to many time series datasets have ever been tested yet. Hence a Convolutional Neural Network CNN and Long Term Short Memory LSTM based approach is presented in this paper to detect smoke inhalations in the breathing signal. To illustrate the effectiveness of this deep learning approach a traditional machine learning SVM based approach was used for comparison. On the validation dataset of 120 smoking sessions performed in a laboratory setting by 30 moderate-to-heavy smokers the CNN-LSTM approach achieved an F1-score of 72% in leave-one-subject-out LOSO cross-validation method whereas the classical SVM approach scored 63%. These results suggest that deep learning-based approaches might provide a better analytical method for detection of smoke inhalations than more conventional machine learning approaches."
