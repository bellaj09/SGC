In the dental implant surgery there are inevitable risks due to the anatomically complex operation in the cranio-maxillofacial region. Therefore there is a trend to use computer-aided technology to simulate the process of the implant surgery. In this study we present a haptic simulator for trainees to study and rehearse the drilling performance of dental implant surgery. A patient-specific haptic drilling simulator based on virtual reality for dental implant surgery.
