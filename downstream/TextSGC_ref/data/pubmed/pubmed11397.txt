A preventive measure for debonding has not been established and is highly desirable to improve the survival rate of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing CAD/CAM composite resin CR crowns. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of deep learning with a convolution neural network CNN method to predict the debonding probability of CAD/CAM CR crowns from 2-dimensional images captured from 3-dimensional 3D stereolithography models of a die scanned by a 3D oral scanner. All cases of CAD/CAM CR crowns were manufactured from April 2014 to November 2015 at the Division of Prosthodontics Osaka University Dental Hospital Ethical Review Board at Osaka University approval H27-E11. The data set consisted of a total of 24 cases: 12 trouble-free and 12 debonding as known labels. A total of 8640 images were randomly divided into 6480 training and validation images and 2160 test images. Deep learning with a CNN method was conducted to develop a learning model to predict the debonding probability. The prediction accuracy precision recall F-measure receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve of the learning model were assessed for the test images. Also the mean calculation time was measured during the prediction for the test images. The prediction accuracy precision recall and F-measure values of deep learning with a CNN method for the prediction of the debonding probability were 98.5% 97.0% 100% and 0.985 respectively. The mean calculation time was 2 ms/step for 2160 test images. The area under the curve was 0.998. Artificial intelligence AI technology-that is the deep learning with a CNN method established in this study-demonstrated considerably good performance in terms of predicting the debonding probability of a CAD/CAM CR crown with 3D stereolithography models of a die scanned from patients.
