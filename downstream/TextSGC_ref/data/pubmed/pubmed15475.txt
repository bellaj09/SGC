Spiral enteroscopy is the newest of the deep enteroscopy techniques. The current technique employs an overtube with a raised spiral at the distal end to pleat the small intestine and achieve deep small bowel intubation. Although spiral enteroscopy is a novel technique the learning curve is comparable to the balloon enteroscopy techniques. There is some evidence of improved speed of spiral enteroscopy procedures with superior control compared to the balloon endoscopy technologies. Altered surgical anatomy deep enteroscopy has been shown to have similar safety and efficacy to competitive technologies particularly in cases of Roux-en-Y ERCP cases. Spiral enterosopy is safe and effective for deep small bowel enteroscopy and diagnostic yield and therapeutic yields are similar to alternate technologies. There are bright future applications of the technology with enteroscopes and an integrated spiral. Spiral enteroscopy is an advanced technique that can be performed by any skilled endoscopist. Spiral enteroscopy: prime time or for the happy few?
