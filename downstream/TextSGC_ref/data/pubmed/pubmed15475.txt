Novel treatment options for eating disorders EDs are critically needed to enhance treatment outcomes and reduce the rates of treatment dropouts. On average only 50% of individuals receiving evidence-based care remit whereas 24% drop out before treatment completion. One particularly promising direction involves integrating virtual reality VR with existing evidence-based treatments EBTs such as cue exposure therapy CET. Across psychiatric disorders VR-based interventions are demonstrating at least preliminary efficacy and noninferiority to traditional treatments. Furthermore VR technology has become increasingly portable resulting in improved acceptance increased access and reductions in cost. However more efficient research processes may be needed to uncover the potential benefits of these rapid technological advances. This viewpoint paper reviews existing empirical support for integrating VR with EBTs with a focus on its use with EDs and proposes key next steps to more rapidly bring this innovative technology-based intervention into real-world clinic settings as warranted. VR-CET for EDs is used to illustrate a suggested process for developing such treatment enhancements. We recommend following a deployment-focused model of intervention development and testing to enable rapid implementation of robust practice-ready treatments. In addition our review highlights the need for a comprehensive clinical protocol that supports clinicians and researchers in the implementation and testing of VR-CET and identifies key missing protocol components with rationale for their inclusion. Ultimately this work may lead to a more complete understanding of the full potential of the applications and integrations of VR into mental health care globally.
