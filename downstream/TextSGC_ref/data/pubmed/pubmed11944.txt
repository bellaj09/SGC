In this paper two novel deep learning methods are proposed for displacement estimation in ultrasound elastography. Although Convolutional Neural Networks CNN have been very successful for displacement estimation in computer vision they have been rarely used for ultrasound elastography. One of the main limitations is that the Radio Frequency RF ultrasound data which is crucial for precise displacement estimation has vastly different frequency characteristics compared to images in computer vision. Top-rank CNN methods used in computer vision applications are mostly based on a multi-level strategy which estimates finer resolution based on coarser ones. This strategy does not work well for RF data due to its large high frequency content. To mitigate the problem we propose Modified Pyramid Warping and Cost volume Network MPWC-Net and RFMPWC-Net both based on PWC-Net to exploit information in RF data by employing two different strategies. We obtained promising results using networks trained only on computer vision images. In the next step we constructed a large ultrasound simulation database and proposed a new loss function to fine-tune the network to improve its performance. The proposed networks and well-known optical flow networks as well as state-of-the-art elastography methods are evaluated using simulation phantom and in vivo data. Our two proposed networks substantially outperform current deep learning methods in terms of Contrast to Noise Ratio CNR and Strain Ratio SR. Also the proposed methods perform similar to the state-of-the-art elastography methods in terms of CNR and have better SR by substantially reducing the underestimation bias.
