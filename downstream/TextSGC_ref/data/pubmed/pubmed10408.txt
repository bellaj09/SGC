"Deep learning using convolutional neural networks represents a form of artificial intelligence where computers recognise patterns and make predictions based upon provided datasets. This study aimed to determine if a convolutional neural network could be trained to differentiate the location of the anterior ethmoidal artery as either adhered to the skull base or within a bone mesentery on sinus computed tomography scans." An artificial intelligence algorithm that differentiates anterior ethmoidal artery location on sinus computed tomography scans.
