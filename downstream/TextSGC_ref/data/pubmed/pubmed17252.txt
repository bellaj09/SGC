"The inability to complete instrumental activities of daily living IADL is a precursor to various neuropsychological diseases. Questionnaire-based assessments of IADL are easy to use but prone to subjective bias. Here we describe a novel virtual reality VR test to assess two complex IADL tasks: handling financial transactions and using public transportation. While a participant performs the tasks in a VR setting a motion capture system traces the position and orientation of the dominant hand and head in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Kinematic raw data are collected and converted into kinematic performance measures i.e. motion trajectory moving distance and time to completion. Motion trajectory is the path of a particular body part e.g. dominant hand or head in space. Moving distance refers to the total distance of the trajectory and time to completion is how long it took to complete an IADL task. These kinematic measures could discriminate patients with cognitive impairment from healthy controls. The development of this kinematic measuring protocol allows detection of early IADL-related cognitive impairments."
