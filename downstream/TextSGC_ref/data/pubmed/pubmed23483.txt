CT colography CTC is a powerful new approach to imaging the colorectum and a promising screening tool for the detection of colorectal neoplasia. From data generated by a helical CT scan CTC uses virtual reality technology to produce highly discriminant two- and three-dimensional images that permit a thorough and minimally invasive evaluation of the entire colorectum. A dynamic CTC display technique from the endoluminal perspective called cf2virtual colonoscopycf1 simulates colonoscopy by "flying" through the three-dimensional colon image. CTC offers potential advantages in diagnostic performance safety and patient acceptance over current screening approaches. Although early data suggest excellent colorectal polyp detection rates this nascent technology will require rigorous clinical investigation and further refinements to assess adequately its place in the endoscopist\s armamentarium.
