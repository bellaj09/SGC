In the presence of metal implants metal artifacts are introduced to x-ray computed tomography CT images. Although a large number of metal artifact reduction MAR methods have been proposed in the past decades MAR is still one of the major problems in clinical x-ray CT. In this paper we develop a convolutional neural network CNN-based open MAR framework which fuses the information from the original and corrected images to suppress artifacts. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the CNN training phase we build a database consisting of metal-free metal-inserted and pre-corrected CT images and image patches are extracted and used for CNN training. In the MAR phase the uncorrected and pre-corrected images are used as the input of the trained CNN to generate a CNN image with reduced artifacts. To further reduce the remaining artifacts water equivalent tissues in a CNN image are set to a uniform value to yield a CNN prior whose forward projections are used to replace the metal-affected projections followed by the FBP reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both simulated and real data. Experimental results demonstrate the superior MAR capability of the proposed method to its competitors in terms of artifact suppression and preservation of anatomical structures in the vicinity of metal implants.
