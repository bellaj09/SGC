Extracting relations between important clinical entities is critical but very challenging for natural language processing NLP in the medical domain. Researchers have applied deep learning-based approaches to clinical relation extraction; but most of them consider sentence sequence only without modeling syntactic structures. The aim of this study was to utilize a deep neural network to capture the syntactic features and further improve the performances of relation extraction in clinical notes. Integrating shortest dependency path and sentence sequence into a deep learning framework for relation extraction in clinical text.
