In this paper a novel classification technique for large data set of mammograms using a deep learning method is proposed. The proposed model targets a three-class classification study normal malignant and benign cases. In our model we have presented two methods namely convolutional neural network-discrete wavelet CNN-DW and convolutional neural network-curvelet transform CNN-CT. An augmented data set is generated by using mammogram patches. To enhance the contrast of mammogram images the data set is filtered by contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization CLAHE. In the CNN-DW method enhanced mammogram images are decomposed as its four subbands by means of two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform 2D-DWT while in the second method discrete curvelet transform DCT is used. In both methods dense scale invariant feature DSIFT for all subbands is extracted. Input data matrix containing these subband features of all the mammogram patches is created that is processed as input to convolutional neural network CNN. Softmax layer and support vector machine SVM layer are used to train CNN for classification. Proposed methods have been compared with existing methods in terms of accuracy rate error rate and various validation assessment measures. CNN-DW and CNN-CT have achieved accuracy rate of 81.83% and 83.74% respectively. Simulation results clearly validate the significance and impact of our proposed model as compared to other well-known existing techniques.
