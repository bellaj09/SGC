"The steady state motion visual evoked potential SSMVEP-based brain computer interface BCI which incorporates the motion perception capabilities of the human visual system to alleviate the negative effects caused by strong visual stimulation from steady-state VEP has attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper we design a SSMVEP-based experiment by Newtons ring paradigm. Then we use the canonical correlation analysis and Support Vector Machines to classify SSMVEP signals for the SSMVEP-based electroencephalography EEG signal detection. We find that the classification accuracy of different subjects under fatigue state is much lower than that in the normal state. To probe into this we develop a multiplex limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph method which enables to infer a brain network from 62-channel EEG signals. Subsequently we analyze the variation of the average weighted clustering coefficient and the weighted global efficiency corresponding to these two brain states and find that both network measures are lower under fatigue state. The results suggest that the associations and information transfer efficiency among different brain regions become weaker when the brain state changes from normal to fatigue which provide new insights into the explanations for the reduced classification accuracy. The promising classification results and the findings render the proposed methods particularly useful for analyzing EEG recordings from SSMVEP-based BCI system."
