Electrocorticography ECoG offers a powerful and versatile platform for developing brain-computer interfaces; it avoids the risks of brain-invasive methods such as intracortical implants while providing significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography. The authors demonstrate that both contra- and ipsilateral finger movements can be discriminated from ECoG signals recorded from a single brain hemisphere. The ECoG activation patterns over sensorimotor areas for contra- and ipsilateral movements were found to overlap to a large degree in the recorded hemisphere. Ipsilateral movements however produced less pronounced activity compared with contralateral movements. The authors also found that single-trial classification of movements could be improved by selecting patient-specific frequency components in high-frequency bands > 50 Hz. Their discovery that ipsilateral hand movements can be discriminated from ECoG signals from a single hemisphere has important implications for neurorehabilitation suggesting in particular the possibility of regaining ipsilateral movement control using signals from an intact hemisphere after damage to the other hemisphere.
