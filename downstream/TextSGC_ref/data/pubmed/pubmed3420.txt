Acute stress triggers a broad psychophysiological response that is adaptive if rapidly activated and terminated. While the brain controls the stress response it is strongly affected by it. Previous research of stress effects on brain activation and connectivity has mainly focused on pre-defined brain regions or networks potentially missing changes in the rest of the brain. We here investigated how both stress reactivity and stress recovery are reflected in whole-brain network topology and how changes in functional connectivity relate to other stress measures. Healthy young males n\u202f=\u202f67 completed the Trier Social Stress Test or a control task. From 60\u202fmin before until 105\u202fmin after stress onset blocks of resting-state fMRI were acquired. Subjective autonomic and endocrine measures of the stress response were assessed throughout the experiment. Whole-brain network topology was quantified using Eigenvector centrality EC mapping which detects central hubs of a network. Stress influenced subjective affect autonomic activity and endocrine measures. EC differences between groups as well as before and after stress exposure were found in the thalamus due to widespread connectivity changes in the brain. Stress-driven EC increases in the thalamus were significantly correlated with subjective stress ratings and showed non-significant trends for a correlation with heart rate variability and saliva cortisol. Furthermore increases in thalamic EC and in saliva cortisol persisted until 105\u202fmin after stress onset. We conclude that thalamic areas are central for information processing after stress exposure and may provide an interface for the stress response in the rest of the body and in the mind. Acute psychosocial stress alters thalamic network centrality.
