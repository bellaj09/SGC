Intraoperative rupture can transform an arteriovenous malformation AVM resection. Blood suffuses the field and visualization is lost; suction must clear the field and the hand holding the suction device is immobilized; the resection stalls while hemostasis is being reestablished; the cause and site of the bleeding may be unclear; bleeding may force technical errors and morbidity from chasing the source into eloquent white matter; and AVM bleeding can be so brisk that it overwhelms the neurosurgeon. The authors reviewed their experience with this dangerous complication to examine its causes management and outcomes. Intraoperative arteriovenous malformation rupture: causes management techniques outcomes and the effect of neurosurgeon experience.
