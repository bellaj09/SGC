\u3000Literary English is different from science English SE and pharmaceutical science English PSE. Therefore a totally new approach was adopted for students to learn PSE at Kyoto Pharmaceutical University KPU. In 2012 a 4-year program for teaching PSE was proposed and a stepwise-stepup tertiary science English education SSTSEE system was introduced at KPU. The system provides a novel form of PSE teaching that stretches from year 1 to 4 where the PSE level progresses to higher levels of learning with each passing academic year. With the launch of the SSTSEE system relevant science-educated staff were provided with training and were also requested to study the syllabi of the respective academic years to write textbooks with the appropriate PSE content for their respective levels. From 2012 to 2015 textbooks and curricula for 4 year academic levels were developed and published to meet the needs for PSE learning at each academic level. Based on results of the SSTSEE system year 1 students acquired the SE basics and year 2 students applied the SE basics acquired. In years 3 and 4 students further pursued and developed their PSE ability. Additionally students participated actively in developing skills in the reading listening writing and speaking of SE/PSE. Active-plus-deep learning prompted students in developing those skills using illustrations posters and power-point slideshow presentations. By year 4 average achievers had established an independent level of competency in reading listening speaking and writing PSE. Moreover the SSTSEE system accommodated students timely in developing communication skills for practical fieldwork clerkships at pharmacies/hospitals in year 5 and for their future endeavors.
