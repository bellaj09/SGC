"Falls are the main cause of death and injury for older adults in the UK. Many of these falls occur within the home as a result of extrinsic falls risk factors such as poor lighting loose/uneven flooring and clutter. Falls education plays an important role in self-management education about extrinsic hazards and is typically delivered via information leaflets falls apps and educational booklets. Serious games have the potential of delivering an engaging and informative alternative to traditional methods but almost exclusively these are currently delivered as exergaming applications that focus solely on intrinsic falls risk factors. This study presents Falls Sensei a first-person 3D exploration game that aims to educate older adults about extrinsic falls risk factors within the home environment. After presenting Falls Sensei game usability and older adults perceptions and attitudes towards using the game in practice are explored." Falls Sensei: a serious 3D exploration game to enable the detection of extrinsic home fall hazards for older adults.
