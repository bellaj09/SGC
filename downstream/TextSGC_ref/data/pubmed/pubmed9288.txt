"The ability to visualize and interpret high dimensional time-series data will be critical as wearable and other sensors are adopted in rehabilitation protocols. This study proposes a latent space representation of high dimensional time-series data for data visualization. For that purpose a deep learning model called Adversarial AutoEncoder AAE is proposed to perform efficient data dimensionality reduction by considering unsupervised and semi-supervised adversarial training. Eighteen subjects were recruited for the experiment and performed two sets of exercises upper and lower body on the Wii Balance Board. Then the accuracy of the latent space representation is evaluated on both sets of exercises separately. Data dimensionality reduction with conventional Machine Learning ML and supervised Deep Learning DL classification are also performed to compare the efficiency of AAE approaches. The results showed that AAE can outperform conventional ML approaches while providing close results to DL supervised classification. AAE approaches for data visualization are a promising approach to monitor the subjects movements and detect adverse events or similarity with previous data providing an intuitive way to monitor the patients progress and provide potential information for rehabilitation tracking."
