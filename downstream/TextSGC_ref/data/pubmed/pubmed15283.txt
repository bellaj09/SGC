We implemented Machine Learning ML techniques to advance the study of sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus bioacoustics. This entailed employing Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs to construct an echolocation click detector designed to classify spectrograms generated from sperm whale acoustic data according to the presence or absence of a click. The click detector achieved 99.5% accuracy in classifying 650 spectrograms. The successful application of CNNs to clicks reveals the potential of future studies to train CNN-based architectures to extract finer-scale details from cetacean spectrograms. Long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit recurrent neural networks were trained to perform classification tasks including 1 "coda type classification" where we obtained 97.5% accuracy in categorizing 23 coda types from a Dominica dataset containing 8719 codas and 93.6% accuracy in categorizing 43 coda types from an Eastern Tropical Pacific ETP dataset with 16995 codas; 2 "vocal clan classification" where we obtained 95.3% accuracy for two clan classes from Dominica and 93.1% for four ETP clan types; and 3 "individual whale identification" where we obtained 99.4% accuracy using two Dominica sperm whales. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML to sperm whale bioacoustics and establish the validity of constructing neural networks to learn meaningful representations of whale vocalizations.
