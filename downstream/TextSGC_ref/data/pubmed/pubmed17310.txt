"Flying phobia FP is a common and disabling mental disorder. Although in vivo exposure is the treatment of choice it is linked to a number of limitations in its implementation. Particularly important is the limited access to the feared stimulus i.e. plane. Moreover the economic cost of in vivo exposure should be specially considered as well as the difficulty of applying the exposure technique in an appropriate way; controlling important variables such as the duration of the exposure or the number of sessions. ICTs could help to reduce these limitations. Computer-assisted treatments have remarkable advantages in treating FP. Furthermore they can be delivered through the Internet increasing their advantages and reaching more people in need. The Internet has been established as an effective way to treat a wide range of mental disorders. However as far as we know no controlled studies exist on FP treatment via the Internet. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based treatment for FP NO-FEAR Airlines versus a waiting list control group. Secondary objectives will be to explore two ways of delivering NO-FEAR Airlines with or without therapist guidance and study the patients acceptance of the program. This paper presents the study protocol." An Internet-based treatment for flying phobia NO-FEAR Airlines: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
