Scanning electron microscopy equipped with a focused ion beam FIB-SEM is a promising three-dimensional 3D imaging technique for nano- and meso-scale morphologies. In FIB-SEM the specimen surface is stripped by an ion beam and imaged by an SEM installed orthogonally to the FIB. The lateral resolution is governed by the SEM while the depth resolution i.e. the FIB milling direction is determined by the thickness of the stripped thin layer. In most cases the lateral resolution is superior to the depth resolution; hence asymmetric resolution is generated in the 3D image. Here we propose a new approach based on an image-processing or deep-learning-based method for super-resolution of 3D images with such asymmetric resolution so as to restore the depth resolution to achieve symmetric resolution. The deep-learning-based method learns from high-resolution sub-images obtained via SEM and recovers low-resolution sub-images parallel to the FIB milling direction. The 3D morphologies of polymeric nano-composites are used as test images which are subjected to the deep-learning-based method as well as conventional methods. We find that the former yields superior restoration particularly as the asymmetric resolution is increased. Our super-resolution approach for images having asymmetric resolution enables observation time reduction. Super-resolution for asymmetric resolution of FIB-SEM 3D imaging using AI with deep learning.
