"This study investigated changes in motor and cognitive skills anxiety levels and quality of life perception among patients with Parkinsons Disease PD following training with different commercial gaming devices-Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect. We used a quasi-experimental simple blinded clinical trial dividing 27 patients with PD into three equal groups of nine members: a Nintendo Wii b Xbox Kinect and c control group. After pretests experimental group participants spent 10 sessions playing four games of the selected gaming device while control group participants received no intervention. Only those engaged with the Nintendo Wii significantly improved their performance on single and dual task gait tests decreased anxiety levels and improved memory attention and reversibility. The control group showed no changes on any measures." "Nintendo Wii Versus Xbox Kinect for Assisting People With Parkinsons Disease."
