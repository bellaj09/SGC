Clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment is highly variable yet prognostic biomarkers are lacking. The authors recently demonstrated that successful antipsychotic drug treatment alters resting-state functional connectivity of the striatum. The goal of the present study was to test whether intrinsic striatal connectivity patterns provide prognostic information and can serve as a potential biomarker of treatment response to antipsychotic drugs. Baseline Striatal Functional Connectivity as a Predictor of Response to Antipsychotic Drug Treatment.
