Rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide has necessitated the implementation of population-based diabetic retinopathy DR screening programs that can perform retinal imaging and interpretation for extremely large patient cohorts in a rapid and sensitive manner while minimizing inappropriate referrals to retina specialists. While most current screening programs employ mydriatic or nonmydriatic color fundus photography and trained image graders to identify referable DR new imaging modalities offer significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy throughput and affordability. Smartphone-based fundus photography macular optical coherence tomography ultrawide-field imaging and artificial intelligence-based image reading address limitations of current approaches and will likely become necessary as DR becomes more prevalent. Here we review current trends in imaging for DR screening and emerging technologies that show potential for improving upon current screening approaches.
