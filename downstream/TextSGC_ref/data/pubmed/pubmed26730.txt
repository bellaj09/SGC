This paper presents a review of the state of the art regarding wheelchairs driven by a brain-computer interface. Using a brain-controlled wheelchair BCW disabled users could handle a wheelchair through their brain activity granting autonomy to move through an experimental environment. A classification is established based on the characteristics of the BCW such as the type of electroencephalographic signal used the navigation system employed by the wheelchair the task for the participants or the metrics used to evaluate the performance. Furthermore these factors are compared according to the type of signal used in order to clarify the differences among them. Finally the trend of current research in this field is discussed as well as the challenges that should be solved in the future. Review of real brain-controlled wheelchairs.
