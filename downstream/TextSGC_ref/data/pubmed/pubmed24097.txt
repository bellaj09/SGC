Previous studies have tried to relieve deafferentation pain DP by using virtual reality rehabilitation systems. However the effectiveness of multimodal sensory feedback was not validated. The objective of this study is to relieve DP by neurorehabilitation using a virtual reality system with multimodal sensory feedback and to validate the efficacy of tactile feedback on immediate pain reduction. Tactile feedback for relief of deafferentation pain using virtual reality system: a pilot study.
