In this study we investigated neural responses during resting-state and reward-task-based fMRI and how these related to individual differences in self-reported reward sensitivity. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 191 college students and 60 of these individuals further finished a reward-related fMRI task. Self-reported reward-approach tendencies were assessed using the behavioral activation scale. Behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with brain activations in the striatum bilaterally during reward processing. During rest behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with functional connectivity between the left and right striatum and with functional connectivity between the right striatum and right middle frontal gyrus. Positive correlations were found between task-based striatal activations and the functional connectivity between the left and right striatum at rest. These results suggest a relationship between striatal task-based reward-related activations and resting connectivity strengths that relate to individual differences in reward-approach tendencies. Individual differences in self-reported reward-approach tendencies relate to resting-state and reward-task-based fMRI measures.
