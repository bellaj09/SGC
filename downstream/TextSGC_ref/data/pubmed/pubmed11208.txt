"Alzheimers disease AD is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Although many researchers have attempted to explain the origins of AD developing an effective strategy in AD clinical therapy is difficult. Recent studies have revealed a potential link between AD and circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks. However few genome-wide studies have identified the potential circRNA-associated-ceRNA pairs involved in AD. In this study we systematically explored the circRNA-associated-ceRNA mechanism in a 7-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 SAMP8 model brain through deep RNA sequencing. We obtained 235 significantly dysregulated circRNA transcripts 30 significantly dysregulated miRNAs and 1202 significantly dysregulated mRNAs. We then constructed the most comprehensive circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks in SAMP8 brain. GO analysis revealed that these networks were involved in regulating the development of AD from various angles for instance axon terminus GO: 0043679 and synapse GO: 0045202. Following rigorous selection we discovered that the circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks in this AD mouse model were mainly involved in the regulation of A clearance Hmgb2 and myelin function Dio2. This research is the first to provide a systematic dissection of circRNA-associated-ceRNA profiling in SAMP8 mouse brain. The selected circRNA-associated-ceRNA networks can profoundly affect the diagnosis and therapy of AD in the future."
