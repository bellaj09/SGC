"Electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been used in various applications including human-computer interfaces diagnosis of brain diseases and measurement of cognitive status. However EEG signals can be contaminated with noise caused by users head movements. Therefore we propose a new method that combines an EEG acquisition device and a frontal viewing camera to isolate and exclude the sections of EEG data containing these noises. This method is novel in the following three ways. First we compare the accuracies of detecting head movements based on the features of EEG signals in the frequency and time domains and on the motion features of images captured by the frontal viewing camera. Second the features of EEG signals in the frequency domain and the motion features captured by the frontal viewing camera are selected as optimal ones. The dimension reduction of the features and feature selection are performed using linear discriminant analysis. Third the combined features are used as inputs to support vector machine SVM which improves the accuracy in detecting head movements. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect head movements with an average error rate of approximately 3.22% which is smaller than that of other methods."
