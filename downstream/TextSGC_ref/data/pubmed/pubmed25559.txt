The present study investigates the influence of depth on pseudoneglect in healthy young participants n=18 within three-dimensional virtual space by presenting a variation of the greyscales task and a landmark task which were specifically matched for stimulus-response compatibility as well as perceptual factors within and across the tasks. Tasks were presented in different depth locations peripersonal extrapersonal and different orientations horizontal vertical within three-dimensional virtual space using virtual reality technique. A horizontal leftward bias pseudoneglect for both tasks was found which was stronger in peripersonal than in extrapersonal space. For the vertical condition an upward bias was observed in the greyscales task but not in the landmark task. These results support the hypotheses of right hemispheric dominance for visual spatial attention and our study is the first to examine horizontal and vertical orienting biases with the greyscales task in peri- and extrapersonal space. Furthermore the differences in attentional asymmetries with respect to depth suggest dissociable neural mechanisms for visual attentional processing in near and far space and the lack of significant correlations implies independence of horizontal and vertical stimulus processing.
