Ecological assessment and training of real-life cognitive functions such as visual-spatial abilities in patients with epilepsy remain challenging. Some studies have applied virtual reality VR paradigms but external validity of VR programs has not sufficiently been proven. Patients with focal epilepsy EG n=14 accomplished an 8-day program in a VR supermarket which consisted of learning and buying items on a shopping list. Performance of the EG was compared with that of healthy controls HCG n=19. A comprehensive neuropsychological examination was administered. Real-life performance was investigated in a real supermarket. Learning in the VR supermarket was significantly impaired in the EG on different VR measures. Delayed free recall of products did not differ between the EG and the HCG. Virtual reality scores were correlated with neuropsychological measures of visual-spatial cognition subjective estimates of memory and performance in the real supermarket. The data indicate that our VR approach allows for the assessment of real-life visual-spatial memory and cognition in patients with focal epilepsy. The multimodal active and complex VR paradigm may particularly enhance visual-spatial cognitive resources.
