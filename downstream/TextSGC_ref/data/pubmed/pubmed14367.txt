Automated segmentation of breast and fibroglandular tissue FGT is required for various computer-aided applications of breast MRI. Traditional image analysis and computer vision techniques such atlas template matching or edge and surface detection have been applied to solve this task. However applicability of these methods is usually limited by the characteristics of the images used in the study datasets while breast MRI varies with respect to the different MRI protocols used in addition to the variability in breast shapes. All this variability in addition to various MRI artifacts makes it a challenging task to develop a robust breast and FGT segmentation method using traditional approaches. Therefore in this study we investigated the use of a deep-learning approach known as "U-net." Using deep learning to segment breast and fibroglandular tissue in MRI volumes.
