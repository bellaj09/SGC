Machine learning algorithms hold the promise to effectively automate the analysis of histopathological images that are routinely generated in clinical practice. Any machine learning method used in the clinical diagnostic process has to be extremely accurate and ideally provide a measure of uncertainty for its predictions. Such accurate and reliable classifiers need enough labelled data for training which requires time-consuming and costly manual annotation by pathologists. Thus it is critical to minimise the amount of data needed to reach the desired accuracy by maximising the efficiency of training. We propose an accurate reliable and active ARA image classification framework and introduce a new Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network ARA-CNN for classifying histopathological images of colorectal cancer. The model achieves exceptional classification accuracy outperforming other models trained on the same dataset. The network outputs an uncertainty measurement for each tested image. We show that uncertainty measures can be used to detect mislabelled training samples and can be employed in an efficient active learning workflow. Using a variational dropout-based entropy measure of uncertainty in the workflow speeds up the learning process by roughly 45%. Finally we utilise our model to segment whole-slide images of colorectal tissue and compute segmentation-based spatial statistics.
