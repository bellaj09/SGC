"The aim of this study was to assess after one year the impact of faculty development in teaching and learning skills focused on a learner-centered approach on faculty members perceptions of and approaches to teaching and on their students learning experiences and approaches. Before training 2014 all 176 faculty members at a dental school in Chile were invited to complete the Approaches to Teaching Inventory ATI to assess their teaching approaches student- vs. teacher-focused. In 2015 all 496 students were invited to complete the Study Process Questionnaire R-SPQ-2F to assess their learning approaches deep or surface and the Course Experience Questionnaire CEQ to measure their teaching quality perceptions. Subsequently faculty development workshops on student-centered teaching methodologies were delivered followed by peer observation. In March 2016 all 176 faculty members and 491 students were invited to complete a second ATI faculty and R-SPQ-2 and CEQ students. Before 2014 and after 2016 the training 114 65% and 116 66% faculty members completed the ATI respectively and 89 49% of the then-181 faculty members completed the perceptions of skills development questionnaire in September 2016. In 2015 373 students 75% completed the R-SPQ-2F and CEQ; 412 83% completed both questionnaires in 2016. In 2014 the faculty results showed that student-focused teaching was significantly higher in preclinical and clinical courses than in the basic sciences. In 2016 teacher-focused teaching fell significantly; basic science teaching improved the most. Students in both the 2015 and 2016 cohorts had lower mean scores for deep learning approaches from year 1 on while they increased their scores for surface learning. The students perceptions of faculty members good teaching appropriate assessment clear goals and e-learning improved significantly but perception of appropriate workload did not. Teaching and learning skills development produced significant gains in student-centered teaching for these faculty members and in some students perceptions of teaching quality. However student workload needs to be considered to support deep learning."
