Neglect patients often show deficits in responding to targets in the contra-lesional side of space. Past studies were able to ameliorate these deficits through manipulation of visual input. Here the neural bases of the recovery of space following virtual reality VR training in neglect patients were investigated. Neglect patients were trained to respond to targets in the left side of space that appeared in the central or in the right side of space in a VR system. It was found that only patients with lesions that spared the inferior parietal/superior temporal regions were able to benefit from the VR training. It was concluded that these regions play a crucial role in the recovery of space that underlies the improvement of neglect patients when trained with VR. The implications of these results for determining the neural bases of a higher order attentional and/or spatial representation and for treating patients with unilateral neglect are discussed.
