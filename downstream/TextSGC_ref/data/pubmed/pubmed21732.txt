Prolonged exposure PE is an evidence-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD but there is limited research with active-duty military populations. Virtual reality exposure VRE has shown promise but randomized trials are needed to evaluate efficacy relative to existing standards of care. This study evaluated the efficacy of VRE and PE for active duty soldiers with PTSD from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Randomized controlled trial of prolonged exposure using imaginal exposure vs. virtual reality exposure in active duty soldiers with deployment-related posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD.
