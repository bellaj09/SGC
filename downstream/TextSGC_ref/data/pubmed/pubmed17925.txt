"The dissemination of laparoscopic colorectal surgery LCS has been slow despite increasing evidence for the clinical benefits with a prolonged learning curve being one of the main restrictions for a prompt uptake. Performing advanced laparoscopic procedures requires dedicated surgical skills and new simulation methods designed precisely for LCS have been established: These include virtual reality simulators box trainers animal and human tissue and synthetic materials. Studies have even demonstrated an improvement in trainees laparoscopic skills in the actual operating room and a staged approach to surgical simulation with a combination of various training methods should be mandatory in every colorectal training program. The learning curve for LCS could be reduced through practice and skills development in a riskfree setting." Need for simulation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery training.
