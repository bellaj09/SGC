"The purpose of this review is to analyze the current knowledge about the higher integrative level of the physiological system of orientation of animals in space. The significance of the study of this level caused by the fact that its disruption can cause deterioration of the capacity for spatial orientation spatial agnosia which is an important sign of some diseases of the brain and in particular Alzheimers disease. In recent decades the main functional components of integration of information on space position of animals were discovered. The significance of these discoveries was reflected in a number of prestigious awards and honors including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2014." THE INTEGRATIVE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM OF SPATIAL ORIENTATION OF ANIMALS.
