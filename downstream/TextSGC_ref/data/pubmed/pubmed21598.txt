Panic disorder PD is a common persistent and disabling mental disorder. It is often associated with agoraphobia. The present article reviews the current status of pharmacotherapy for PD with or without agoraphobia as well as the current status of treatments combing pharmacotherapy with cognitive behavior therapy CBT. The review has been written with a focus on randomized controlled trials meta-analyses and reviews that have been published over the past few years. Effective pharmacological treatments include tricyclic antidepressants monoamine oxidase inhibitors selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and various benzodiazepines. Treatment results obtained with CBT compare well with pharmacotherapy with evidence that CBT is at least as effective as pharmacotherapy. Combining pharmacotherapy with CBT has been found to be superior to antidepressant pharmacotherapy or CBT alone but only in the acute-phase treatment. Long term studies on treatments combining pharmacotherapy and CBT for PD with or without agoraphobia have found little benefit however for combination therapies versus monotherapies. New investigations explore the potential additional value of sequential versus concomitant treatments of cognitive enhancers and virtual reality exposure therapy and of education self management and Internet-based interventions.
