We re-designed the outpatient management of trauma at our institution to eliminate appointments if there would be no change in management or information provision. All cases referred by the Emergency Department ED were reviewed at a Virtual Fracture Clinic VFC by an orthopaedic consultant and telephoned afterwards by a senior nurse. If face-to-face review was required it was arranged at a specialist shoulder clinic. The virtual fracture clinic: Reducing unnecessary review of clavicle fractures.
