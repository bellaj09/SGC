Thirty participants who had been treated for aviophobia with virtual reality graded exposure therapy with physiological monitoring and visual feedback VRGETpm virtual reality graded exposure therapy with physiological monitoring only VRGETno or imaginal exposure therapy visualization with physiological monitoring only IET between January 1998 and January 1999 were contacted in January 2002 for a 3-year posttreatment follow-up assessment. Of the participants in the VRGETpm group who had flown successfully by the end of treatment all had maintained their ability to fly at follow-up. Of the participants in the VRGETno group who had flown successfully by the end of treatment two were no longer able to fly. Of the participants in the IET group who had flown successfully all were still able to fly. It appears that the addition of teaching self-control via visual feedback of physiological signals may serve to maintain treatment gains in long-term follow-up. Three-year follow-up for virtual reality exposure for fear of flying.
