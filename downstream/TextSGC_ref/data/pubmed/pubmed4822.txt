Advanced diffusion weighted MR imaging allows non-invasive study on the structural connectivity of human brains. Fiber orientation distributions FODs reconstructed from diffusion data are a popular model to represent crossing fibers. For this sophisticated image representation of connectivity classical image operations such as smoothing must be redefined. In this paper we propose a novel rotation-induced Riemannian metric for FODs and introduce a weighted diffusion process for FODs regarding this Riemannian manifold. We show how this Riemannian manifold can be used for smoothing interpolation and building image-pyramids yielding more accurate or intuitively more reasonable results than the linear or the unit hyper-sphere manifold.
