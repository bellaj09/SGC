Human communication entirely depends on the functional integrity of the neuromuscular system. This is devastatingly illustrated in clinical conditions such as the so-called locked-in syndrome LIS in which severely motor-disabled patients become incapable to communicate naturally--while being fully conscious and awake. For the last 20 years research on motor-independent communication has focused on developing brain-computer interfaces BCIs implementing neuroelectric signals for communication e.g. 2-7 and BCIs based on electroencephalography EEG have already been applied successfully to concerned patients. However not all patients achieve proficiency in EEG-based BCI control. Thus more recently hemodynamic brain signals have also been explored for BCI purposes. Here we introduce the first spelling device based on fMRI. By exploiting spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses evoked by performing differently timed mental imagery tasks our novel letter encoding technique allows translating any freely chosen answer letter-by-letter into reliable and differentiable single-trial fMRI signals. Most importantly automated letter decoding in real time enables back-and-forth communication within a single scanning session. Because the suggested spelling device requires only little effort and pretraining it is immediately operational and possesses high potential for clinical applications both in terms of diagnostics and establishing short-term communication with nonresponsive and severely motor-impaired patients.
