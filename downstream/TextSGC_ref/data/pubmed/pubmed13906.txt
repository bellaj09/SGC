Finding peptides with high binding affinity to Class I major histocompatibility complex MHC-I attracts intensive research and it serves a crucial part of developing a better vaccine for precision medicine. Traditional methods cost highly for designing such peptides. The advancement of computational approaches reduces the cost of new drug discovery dramatically. Compared with flourishing computational drug discovery area the immunology area lacks tools focused on in silico design for the peptides with high binding affinity. Attributed to the ever-expanding amount of MHC-peptides binding data it enables the tremendous influx of deep learning techniques for modeling MHC-peptides binding. To leverage the availability of these data it is of great significance to find MHC-peptides binding specificities. The binding motifs are one of the key components to decide the MHC-peptides combination which generally refer to a combination of some certain amino acids at certain sites which highly contribute to the binding affinity.
