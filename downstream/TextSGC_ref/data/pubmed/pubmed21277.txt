"The authors aim was to examine whether short-term kinesthetic training affects the level of sensorimotor rhythm SMR in different frequency band: alpha 8-12 Hz lower beta 12.5-16 Hz and beta 16.5-20 Hz during the execution of a motor imagery task of closing and opening the right and the left hand by experts jugglers practicing similar exercises on an everyday basis and amateurs individuals not practicing any sports. It was found that the performance of short kinesthetic training increases the power of alpha rhythm when executing imagery tasks only in the group of amateurs. Therefore kinesthetic training may be successfully used as a method increasing the vividness of motor imagery for example in tasks involving the control of brain-computer interfaces based on SMR." Short-term kinesthetic training for sensorimotor rhythms: effects in experts and amateurs.
