Negative symptoms are highly relevant in the long-term course of schizophrenia and are an important target domain for the development of novel interventions. Recently transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS of the prefrontal cortex has been investigated as a treatment option in schizophrenia. In this proof-of-concept study 20 schizophrenia patients with predominantly negative symptoms were randomized to either 10 sessions of add-on active 2 mA 20min or sham tDCS anode: left DLPFC/F3; cathode: right supraorbital/F4. Primary outcome measure was the change in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms SANS sum score; secondary outcomes included reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale PANSS scores and improvement of depressive symptoms cognitive processing speed and executive functioning. Sixteen patients underwent 4 functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging fcMRI scans pre and post 1st and pre and post 10th tDCS to investigate changes in resting state network connectivity after tDCS. Per-protocol analysis showed a significantly greater decrease in SANS score after active -36.1% than after sham tDCS -0.7%. PANSS sum scores decreased significantly more with active -23.4% than with sham stimulation -2.2%. Explorative analysis of fcMRI data indicated changes in subgenual cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC connectivity within frontal-thalamic-temporo-parietal networks. The results of this first proof-of-concept study indicate that prefrontal tDCS may be a promising intervention for treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms. Large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed to further establish prefrontal tDCS as novel treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia.
