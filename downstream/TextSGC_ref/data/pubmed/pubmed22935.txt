Electroencephalographic neurofeedback EEG-NFB represents a broadly used method that involves a real-time EEG signal measurement immediate data processing with the extraction of the parameters of interest and feedback to the individual in a real-time. Using such a feedback loop the individual may gain better control over the neurophysiological parameters by inducing changes in brain functioning and consequently behavior. It is used as a complementary treatment for a variety of neuropsychological disorders and improvement of cognitive capabilities creativity or relaxation in healthy subjects. In this review various types of EEG-NFB training are described including training of slow cortical potentials SCPs and frequency and coherence training with their main results and potential limitations. Furthermore some general concerns about EEG-NFB methodology are presented which still need to be addressed by the NFB community. Due to the heterogeneity of research designs in EEG-NFB protocols clear conclusions on the effectiveness of this method are difficult to draw. Despite that there seems to be a well-defined path for the EEG-NFB research in the future opening up possibilities for improvement.
