"To investigate everyday memory more and more studies rely on virtual-reality applications to bridge the gap between in situ approaches and laboratory settings. In this vein the present study was designed to assess everyday-like memory from the virtual reality-based Human Object Memory for Everyday Scenes HOMES test Sauzon et al.  Exp. Psychol. 59 99 in ageing and in Alzheimers disease AD. Two aims motivated this study: the first was to assess multiple processes of episodic memory EM functioning embedded within contexts closely related to real life in ageing and AD using the multi-trial free-recall paradigm and the second aim was to evaluate the mediating effects of executive functioning EF EM and subjective memory complaints SMCs on age differences in the HOMES measures and in AD. To this end the HOMES test and neurocognitive tests of EF and EM were administered to 23 younger adults 23 older adults and 16 patients with AD. The results were: firstly compared to young adults elderly adults presented only free-recall decline that almost disappeared in recognition condition whereas AD patients exhibited a poor clustering learning and recognition performance and also a high amount of false recognition; secondly age differences as well as AD related deficits on the HOMES test were mediated by both memory and EF measure while those observed on false memory indices were only mediated by EM measure; thirdly the HOMES indices are related to SMCs even when episodic or EF measures are controlled. Overall the results supported the fact that the VR-based memory test is an appropriate device to capture age-related differences as well as the AD effect with respect to both in situ and laboratory settings."
