"Quality of neurosurgical care and patient outcomes are inextricably linked to surgical and technical proficiency and a thorough working knowledge of microsurgical anatomy. Neurosurgical laboratory-based cadaveric training is essential for the development and refinement of technical skills before their use on a living patient. Recent biotechnological advances including 3-dimensional 3D microscopy and endoscopy 3D printing virtual reality surgical simulation surgical robotics and advanced neuroimaging have proved to reduce the learning curve improve conceptual understanding of complex anatomy and enhance visuospatial skills in neurosurgical training. Until recently few means have allowed surgeons to obtain integrated surgical and technological training in an operating room setting. We report on a new model currently in use at our institution for technologically integrated surgical training and innovation using a next-generation microneurosurgery skull base laboratory designed to recreate the setting of a working operating room. Each workstation is equipped with a 3D surgical microscope 3D endoscope surgical drills operating table with a Mayfield head holder and a complete set of microsurgical tools. The laboratory also houses a neuronavigation system a surgical robotic a surgical planning system 3D visualization virtual reality and computerized simulation for training of surgical procedures and visuospatial skills. In addition the laboratory is equipped with neurophysiological monitoring equipment in order to conduct research into human factors in surgery and the respective roles of workload and fatigue on surgeons performance."
