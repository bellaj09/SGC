In this study we propose Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neural Networks HRBFNNs realized with the aid of fuzzy clustering method Fuzzy C-Means FCM and polynomial neural networks. Fuzzy clustering used to form information granulation is employed to overcome a possible curse of dimensionality while the polynomial neural network is utilized to build local models. Furthermore genetic algorithm GA is exploited here to optimize the essential design parameters of the model including fuzzification coefficient the number of input polynomial fuzzy neurons PFNs and a collection of the specific subset of input PFNs of the network. To reduce dimensionality of the input space principal component analysis PCA is considered as a sound preprocessing vehicle. The performance of the HRBFNNs is quantified through a series of experiments in which we use several modeling benchmarks of different levels of complexity different number of input variables and the number of available data. A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed HRBFNNs exhibit higher accuracy in comparison to the accuracy produced by some models reported previously in the literature.
