"The human eye is a vital sensory organ that provides us with visual information about the world around us. It can also convey such information as our emotional state to people with whom we interact. In technology eye tracking has become a hot research topic recently and a growing number of eye-tracking devices have been widely applied in fields such as psychology medicine education and virtual reality. However most commercially available eye trackers are prohibitively expensive and require that the users head remain completely stationary in order to accurately estimate the direction of their gaze. To address these drawbacks this paper proposes an inner corner-pupil center vector ICPCV eye-tracking system based on a deep neural network which does not require that the users head remain stationary or expensive hardware to operate. The performance of the proposed system is compared with those of other currently available eye-tracking estimation algorithms and the results show that it outperforms these systems."
