The central complex is a highly conserved insect brain region composed of morphologically stereotyped neurons that arborize in distinctively shaped substructures. The region is implicated in a wide range of behaviors and several modeling studies have explored its circuit computations. Most studies have relied on assumptions about connectivity between neurons based on their overlap in light microscopy images. Here we present an extensive functional connectome of Drosophila melanogaster\s central complex at cell-type resolution. Using simultaneous optogenetic stimulation calcium imaging and pharmacology we tested the connectivity between 70 presynaptic-to-postsynaptic cell-type pairs. We identified numerous inputs to the central complex but only a small number of output channels. Additionally the connectivity of this highly recurrent circuit appears to be sparser than anticipated from light microscopy images. Finally the connectivity matrix highlights the potentially critical role of a class of bottleneck interneurons.
