"Recently high-frequency oscillations HFOs of range 80-500 Hz in electroencephalogram EEG recordings of epilepsy patients are considered as a reliable marker of epileptic seizure. In the present work an automatic detection of HFOs represents an isolated peak an `island in a time-frequency plot based on convolutional neural network CNN was proposed. Initially three patients with medically intractable epilepsy were recruited. They underwent a presurgical monitoring individually with around 54-90 channels of intracranial electroencephalograph iEEG. Then a specific CNN with five layers was developed with a total of 18400 time-frequency island pictures marked with a label of either a real HFO or a false HFO. They are in the range of 80-500 Hz in the recorded iEEGs of 312 hours. Besides over 7940 pictures including 3970 real HFO events and 3970 false HFO events except the training set were used to evaluate the performance of the current proposed method. As a result the obtained precision of HFO events the value of the recall and the F1 score of the proposed CNN were found to be 94.19% 89.37% and 91.71% respectively. Additionally the automatic detection time of each HFO event is limited within 1-3 seconds. In summary the proposed HFOs detector with deep learning would be more efficient and useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy as compared with the current manual determination of each HFOs from a long-term multichannel iEEGs recordings."
