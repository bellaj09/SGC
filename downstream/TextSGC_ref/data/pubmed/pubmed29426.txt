Electroencephalography EEG is a non-linear and non-stationary process as a result its features are unstable and often vary in quality across trials which poses significant challenges to brain-computer interfaces BCIs. One remedy to this problem is to adaptively collect sufficient EEG evidence using dynamic stopping DS strategies. The high-speed steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCI has experienced tremendous progress in recent years. This study aims to further improve the high-speed SSVEP-based BCI by incorporating the DS strategy. Incorporation of dynamic stopping strategy into the high-speed SSVEP-based BCIs.
