"The cerebral nuclei form the ventral division of the cerebral hemisphere and are thought to play an important role in neural systems controlling somatic movement and motivation. Network analysis was used to define global architectural features of intrinsic cerebral nuclei circuitry in one hemisphere association connections and between hemispheres commissural connections. The analysis was based on more than 4000 reports of histologically defined axonal connections involving all 45 gray matter regions of the rat cerebral nuclei and revealed the existence of four asymmetrically interconnected modules. The modules form four topographically distinct longitudinal columns that only partly correspond to previous interpretations of cerebral nuclei structure-function organization. The network of connections within and between modules in one hemisphere or the other is quite dense about 40% of all possible connections whereas the network of connections between hemispheres is weak and sparse only about 5% of all possible connections. Particularly highly interconnected regions rich club and hubs within it form a topologically continuous band extending through two of the modules. Connection path lengths among numerous pairs of regions and among some of the networks modules are relatively long thus accounting for low global efficiency in network communication. These results provide a starting point for reexamining the connectional organization of the cerebral hemispheres as a whole right and left cerebral cortex and cerebral nuclei together and their relation to the rest of the nervous system."
