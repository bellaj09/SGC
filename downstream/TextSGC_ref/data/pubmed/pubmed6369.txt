This study aims to detect the neural substrate underlying the language impairment in children with developmental language disorder DLD using diffusion tensor imaging DTI tractography. Deterministic DTI tractography was performed in a group of right-handed children with DLD N\u2009=\u200917; mean age 10;07\u2009\u20092;01\xa0years and a typically developing control group matched for age gender and handedness N\u2009=\u200922; mean age 11;00\u2009\u20091;11\xa0years to bilaterally identify the superior longitudinal fascicle arcuate fascicle anterior lateral segment and posterior lateral segment also called dorsal language network and the middle and inferior longitudinal fascicle extreme capsule fiber system and uncinate fascicle also called ventral language network. Language skills were assessed using an extensive standardized test battery. Differences in language performance white matter organization and structural lateralization of the language network were statistically analyzed. Children with DLD showed a higher overall volume and higher ADC values for the left-hemispheric language related WM tracts. In addition in children with DLD the majority 88%; 7/8 of the studied language related WM tracts did not show a significant left or right lateralization pattern. These structural alterations might underlie the language impairment in children with DLD.
