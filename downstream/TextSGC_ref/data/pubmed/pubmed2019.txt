With the global spread of COVID-19 there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of contracting disease. Occupational characteristics such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers not only put workers at high risk for disease but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace and understanding which occupational groups they represent can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.
