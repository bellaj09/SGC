Computer applications based on Virtual Reality VR has been outstanding in training and teaching in the medical filed due to their ability to simulate realistic in which users can practice skills and decision making in different situations. But was realized in these frameworks a hard interaction of non-programmers users. Based on this problematic will be shown the CyberMedVPS a graphical module which implement Visual Programming concepts to solve an interaction trouble. Frameworks to develop such simulators are available but their use demands knowledge of programming. Based on this problematic will be shown the CyberMedVPS a graphical module for the CyberMed framework which implements Visual Programming concepts to allow the development of simulators by non-programmers professionals of the medical field. CyberMedVPS: visual programming for development of simulators.
