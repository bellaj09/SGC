In this paper we introduce a Mixed Reality Triage and Evacuation game MiRTE that is used in the development testing and training of Mass Casualty Incident MCI information systems for first responders. Using the Source game engine from Valve software MiRTE creates immersive virtual environments to simulate various incident scenarios and enables interactions between multiple players/first responders. What distinguishes it from a pure computer simulation game is that it can interface with external mass casualty incident management systems such as DIORAMA. The game will enable system developers to specify technical requirements of underlying technology and test different alternatives of design. After the information system hardware and software are completed the game can simulate various algorithms such as localization technologies and interface with an actual user interface on PCs and Smartphones. We implemented and tested the game with the DIORAMA system. MiRTE: Mixed Reality Triage and Evacuation game for Mass Casualty information systems design testing and training.
