The virtual reality arthroscopic knee simulator VR-AKS consists of a computer platform a video display and two force-feedback haptic interfaces known as "PHANToMs" that also monitor the position of the instruments in the user\s hands. The forces that the user would normally apply to the lower limb during arthroscopy are directed through an instrumented surrogate leg. Proprietary software provides the mathematical representation of the physical world and replicates the visual mechanical and behavioral aspects of the knee. This includes moderating the haptic interface and simultaneously executing a collision-detection algorithm that prevents the instruments from moving through "solid" surfaces. Modeling software interacts with this algorithm to send the appropriate images to the video display including knee pathology such as meniscal tears and chondral defects as well as normal anatomy. Task-oriented programs monitor specific performance such as executing a proper examination of the knee or shaving a torn meniscus. Virtual reality simulation of arthroscopy of the knee.
