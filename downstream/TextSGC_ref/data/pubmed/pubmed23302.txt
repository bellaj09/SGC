"Many researchers and clinicians have proposed using virtual reality VR in adjunct to in vivo exposure therapy to provide an innovative form of exposure to patients suffering from different psychological disorders. The rationale behind the virtual approach is that real and virtual exposures elicit a comparable emotional reaction in subjects even if to date there are no experimental data that directly compare these two conditions. To test whether virtual stimuli are as effective as real stimuli and more effective than photographs in the anxiety induction process we tested the emotional reactions to real food RF virtual reality VR food and photographs PH of food in two samples of patients affected respectively by anorexia AN and bulimia nervosa BN compared to a group of healthy subjects. The two main hypotheses were the following: a the virtual exposure elicits emotional responses comparable to those produced by the real exposure; b the sense of presence induced by the VR immersion makes the virtual experience more ecological and consequently more effective than static pictures in producing emotional responses in humans."
