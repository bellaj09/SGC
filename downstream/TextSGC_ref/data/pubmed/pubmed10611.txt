Advances in image reconstruction are necessary to decrease radiation exposure from coronary CT angiography CCTA further but iterative reconstruction has been shown to degrade image quality at high levels. Deep-learning image reconstruction DLIR offers unique opportunities to overcome these limitations. The present study compared the impact of DLIR and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo ASiR-V on quantitative and qualitative image parameters and the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA using invasive coronary angiography ICA as the standard of reference. Validation of deep-learning image reconstruction for coronary computed tomography angiography: Impact on noise image quality and diagnostic accuracy.
