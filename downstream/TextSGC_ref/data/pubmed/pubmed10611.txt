Heartbeat classification is a crucial step for arrhythmia diagnosis during electrocardiographic ECG analysis. The new scenario of wireless body sensor network- WBSN- enabled ECG monitoring puts forward a higher-level demand for this traditional ECG analysis task. Previously reported methods mainly addressed this requirement with the applications of a shallow structured classifier and expert-designed features. In this study modified frequency slice wavelet transform MFSWT was firstly employed to produce the time-frequency image for heartbeat signal. Then the deep learning DL method was performed for the heartbeat classification. Here we proposed a novel model incorporating automatic feature abstraction and a deep neural network DNN classifier. Features were automatically abstracted by the stacked denoising auto-encoder SDA from the transferred time-frequency image. DNN classifier was constructed by an encoder layer of SDA and a softmax layer. In addition a deterministic patient-specific heartbeat classifier was achieved by fine-tuning on heartbeat samples which included a small subset of individual samples. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results showed that an overall accuracy of 97.5% was achieved using the proposed model confirming that the proposed DNN model is a powerful tool for heartbeat pattern recognition.
