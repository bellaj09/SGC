The sustainable management of agricultural resources requires the integration of cutting-edge science with the observation and identification of crops. This assists experts to make correct decisions. The aim of this study is to assess the robustness of a commonly used deep learning tool VGG16 in improving the categorization of wheat kernels. Two fusion methodologies were considered simultaneously. We performed experiments on visible light RGB short wave infrared SWIR and visible-near infrared VNIR datasets including 40\u2009classes with 200 samples in each class giving 8000 samples in total. Identification of wheat kernels by fusion of RGB SWIR and VNIR samples.
