The nucleus accumbens is critical for reward-guided learning and decision-making. It is thought to "gate" the flow of a diverse range of information e.g. rewarding aversive and novel events from limbic afferents to basal ganglia outputs. Gating and information encoding may be achieved via cross-frequency coupling in which bursts of high-frequency activity occur preferentially during specific phases of slower oscillations. We examined whether the human nucleus accumbens engages such a mechanism by recording electrophysiological activity directly from the accumbens of human patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Oscillatory activity in the gamma 40-80 Hz frequency range was synchronized with the phase of simultaneous alpha 8-12 Hz waves. Further losing and winning small amounts of money elicited relatively increased gamma oscillation power prior to and following alpha troughs respectively. Gamma-alpha synchronization may reflect an electrophysiological gating mechanism in the human nucleus accumbens and the phase differences in gamma-alpha coupling may reflect a reward information coding scheme similar to phase coding.
