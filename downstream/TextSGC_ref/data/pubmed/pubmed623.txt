Singapores health ministry has responded with enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 for all suspected pneumonia cases further increasing the volume of testing via real-time reverse transcription PCR as well as samples necessitating stringent infectious control.

The aim of this article is to present our tertiary institutions early experience with managing this emerging crisis and offer practical considerations for the preanalytical analytical and postanalytical phases of laboratory testing in this cohort of patients."
