This study examined the reliability/validity of power output measured using the Fortius Virtual Reality cycle trainer. 10 cyclists age: 286 years; VO 2max: 60.97.2\u2009ml  kg -1  min -1; peak power: 39382\u2009W completed three 20\u2009km time trials on a Fortius cycle trainer. During each time trial power output was measured at 1\u2009Hz using the Fortius internal software and a PowerTap power monitor. Validity calculated for the Fortius trainer; Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99; p<0.01 and typical error of estimate 3.5%; 95% CI: 3.2-3.9% was similar to other established laboratory ergometers. No differences F 216=0.32; p=0.73 in mean 20\u2009km power were observed between trial 1 25346\u2009W 2 25849\u2009W or 3 25550\u2009W. Test-retest reliability intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and coefficient of variation CV was better between trial 2 and 3 ICC=1.00 CI: 0.98-1.00; CV: 1.6% CI: 1.1-3.3% compared with trial 1 and 2 ICC=0.98 CI: 0.91-1.00; CV: 3.3% CI: 2.2-6.4%. The Fortius cycle trainer is a valid and reliable device for the measurement of power output in cyclists thus providing an alternative to larger more expensive laboratory ergometers. Reliability/Validity of the fortius trainer.
