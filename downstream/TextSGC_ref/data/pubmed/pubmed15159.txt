"Multiple sclerosis MS is a demyelinating disease of autoimmune originate. A large proportion of patient present with cognitive deficits that negatively affect their quality of life thus a proper cognitive rehabilitation is mandatory. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of semi-immersive virtual reality training sVRT on neuropsychological and motor recovery individuals suffering from MS. We enrolled 60\u2009MS patients randomized into either the control group CG: 30 undergoing a conventional cognitive training or the experimental group EG: 30 which performed sVRT. Cognitive and motor outcomes were investigated through clinical and neuropsychological scales before T0 and at the end T1 of each different training. Only in the EG we observed a significant improvement in cognitive parameters and motor scores. Our data demonstrate that VR cognitive training could potentiate MS patients rehabilitation outcome with positive results on both motor and cognitive performance."
