Virtual reality VR technology may provide an effective means to integrate cognitive and functional approaches to TBI rehabilitation. However little is known about the effectiveness of VR rehabilitation for TBI-related cognitive deficits. In response to these clinical and research gaps we developed Neurocognitive Driving Rehabilitation in Virtual Environments NeuroDRIVE an intervention designed to improve cognitive performance driving safety and neurobehavioral symptoms. Neurocognitive Driving Rehabilitation in Virtual Environments NeuroDRIVE: A pilot clinical trial for chronic traumatic brain injury.
