The amygdala plays a critical role in emotion. Its functional coupling with the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex extending to a portion of the anterior cingulate cortex ACC is implicated in anxiogenesis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA system regulation. However it remains unclear how amygdala-centred functional connectivity FC affects anxiety and cortisol concentrations in everyday life. Here we investigate the relationship between daily cortisol concentrations dCOR and amygdala-centred FC during emotional processing in forty-one healthy humans. FC analyses revealed that higher dCOR predicted strengthened amygdala-centred FC with the hippocampus and cerebellum but inhibited FC with the supramarginal gyrus and a perigenual part of the ACC pgACC when processing fearful faces vs. neutral faces. Notably the strength of amygdala-hippocampus FC mediated the positive relationship between cortisol and anxiety specifically when the effect of amygdala-pgACC FC a presumptive neural indicator of emotional control was taken into account. Individuals with diminished connectivity between the amygdala and pgACC during fear-related processing might be more vulnerable to anxiogenesis as it pertains to greater circulating cortisol levels in everyday life. Individual functional patterns of amygdala-hippocampal-pgACC connectivity might provide a key to understand the complicate link between cortisol and anxiety-related behaviors. Amygdala-centred functional connectivity affects daily cortisol concentrations: a putative link with anxiety.
