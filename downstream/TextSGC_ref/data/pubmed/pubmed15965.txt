The success of recent deep convolutional neural networks CNNs depends on learning hidden representations that can summarize the important factors of variation behind the data. In this work we describe Network Dissection a method that interprets networks by providing meaningful labels to their individual units. The proposed method quantifies the interpretability of CNN representations by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and visual semantic concepts. By identifying the best alignments units are given interpretable labels ranging from colors materials textures parts objects and scenes. The method reveals that deep representations are more transparent and interpretable than they would be under a random equivalently powerful basis. We apply our approach to interpret and compare the latent representations of several network architectures trained to solve a wide range of supervised and self-supervised tasks. We then examine factors affecting the network interpretability such as the number of the training iterations regularizations different initialization parameters as well as networks depth and width. Finally we show that the interpreted units can be used to provide explicit explanations of a given CNN prediction for an image. Our results highlight that interpretability is an important property of deep neural networks that provides new insights into what hierarchical structures can learn.
