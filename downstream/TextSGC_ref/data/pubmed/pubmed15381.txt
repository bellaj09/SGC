"The cerebral cortex predicts visual motion to adapt human behavior to surrounding objects moving in real time. Although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown predictive coding is one of the leading theories. Predictive coding assumes that the brains internal models which are acquired through learning predict the visual world at all times and that errors between the prediction and the actual sensory input further refine the internal models. In the past year deep neural networks based on predictive coding were reported for a video prediction machine called PredNet. If the theory substantially reproduces the visual information processing of the cerebral cortex then PredNet can be expected to represent the human visual perception of motion. In this study PredNet was trained with natural scene videos of the self-motion of the viewer and the motion prediction ability of the obtained computer model was verified using unlearned videos. We found that the computer model accurately predicted the magnitude and direction of motion of a rotating propeller in unlearned videos. Surprisingly it also represented the rotational motion for illusion images that were not moving physically much like human visual perception. While the trained network accurately reproduced the direction of illusory rotation it did not detect motion components in negative control pictures wherein people do not perceive illusory motion. This research supports the exciting idea that the mechanism assumed by the predictive coding theory is one of basis of motion illusion generation. Using sensory illusions as indicators of human perception deep neural networks are expected to contribute significantly to the development of brain research."
