EEG is a non-invasive tool for neuro-developmental disorder diagnosis and treatment. However EEG signal is mixed with other biological signals including Ocular and Muscular artifacts making it difficult to extract the diagnostic features. Therefore the contaminated EEG channels are often discarded by the medical practitioners which may result in less accurate diagnosis. Many existing methods require reference electrodes which will create discomfort to the patient/children and cause hindrance to the diagnosis of the neuro-developmental disorder and Brain Computer Interface in the pervasive environment. Therefore it would be ideal if these artifacts can be removed real time on the hardware platform in an automated fashion and then the denoised EEG can be used for online diagnosis in a pervasive personalized healthcare environment without the need of any reference electrode. Low-complexity hardware design methodology for reliable and automated removal of ocular and muscular artifact from EEG.
