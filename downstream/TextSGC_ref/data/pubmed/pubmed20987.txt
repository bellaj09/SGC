We introduce an optical design and a rendering pipeline for a full-color volumetric near-eye display which simultaneously presents imagery with near-accurate per-pixel focus across an extended volume ranging from 15cm 6.7 diopters to 4M 0.25 diopters allowing the viewer to accommodate freely across this entire depth range. This is achieved using a focus-tunable lens that continuously sweeps a sequence of 280 synchronized binary images from a high-speed Digital Micromirror Device DMD projector and a high-speed high dynamic range HDR light source that illuminates the DMD images with a distinct color and brightness at each binary frame. Our rendering pipeline converts 3-D scene information into a 2-D surface of color voxels which are decomposed into 280 binary images in a voxel-oriented manner such that 280 distinct depth positions for full-color voxels can be displayed.
