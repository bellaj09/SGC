"Neuronal mechanism underlying dystonia is poorly understood. Dystonia can be treated with botulinum toxin injections or deep brain stimulation but these methods are not available for every patient therefore we need to consider other methods Our study aimed to develop a novel rehabilitation training using brain-computer interface system that decreases neural overexcitation in the sensorimotor cortex by bypassing brain and external world without the normal neuromuscular pathway. To achieve this purpose we recorded electroencephalograms 10 channels and forearm electromyograms 3 channels from 2 patients with the diagnosis of writers cramp and healthy control participants as a preliminary experiment. The patients were trained to control amplitude of their electroencephalographic signal using feedback from the brain-computer interface for 1 hour a day and then continued the training twice a month. After the 5-month training a patient clearly showed reduction of dystonic movement during writing."
