Noninvasive functional imaging holds great promise for serving as a translational bridge between human and animal models of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However despite a depth of knowledge of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of atypical processes in mouse models little is known about the large-scale functional architecture measured by functional brain imaging limiting translation to human conditions. Here we provide a robust processing pipeline to generate high-resolution whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity MRI rs-fcMRI images in the mouse. Using a mesoscale structural connectome i.e. an anterograde tracer mapping of axonal projections across the mouse CNS we show that rs-fcMRI in the mouse has strong structural underpinnings validating our procedures. We next directly show that large-scale network properties previously identified in primates are present in rodents although they differ in several ways. Last we examine the existence of the so-called default mode network DMN--a distributed functional brain system identified in primates as being highly important for social cognition and overall brain function and atypically functionally connected across a multitude of disorders. We show the presence of a potential DMN in the mouse brain both structurally and functionally. Together these studies confirm the presence of basic network properties and functional networks of high translational importance in structural and functional systems in the mouse brain. This work clears the way for an important bridge measurement between human and rodent models enabling us to make stronger conclusions about how regionally specific cellular and molecular manipulations in mice relate back to humans.
