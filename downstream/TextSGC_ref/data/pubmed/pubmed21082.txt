Medical education has witnessed recently an accelerated and worldwide trend of change. The race is on for curricula that are relevant appropriate and accountable. One of the consequences of this is the need for a drastic reassessment of how we devise curricula and of what models approaches and strategies to adopt. Outcomes-based education is currently offered as an alternative to the content-based approach which has been criticized by many educational experts in the past. Although this new approach has its detractors it holds some promise of being able to improve on a current situation that is in deadlock with itself. There has been a great deal of interest in educational strategies in the last decade. This has been associated with the development of new concepts such as "problem-based learning" "student-centered learning" and "integrated teaching". Each school has to assess each of these strategies and adopt what ever will serve the aims of the curriculum. Similarly the considerable progress that has taken place in the design and development of instructional materials and instructional technology should be appreciated. This includes development in computer assisted learning virtual reality the use of simulated subjects e learning and the new concept of Reusable Learning Objects RLO\s. Finally it was realized with the rapid development in medical education that medical education requires professional training. The assumption that any good medical practitioner has the ability to teach no longer holds and professional training is required. Current issues in medical education.
