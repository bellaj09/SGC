"An asynchronous brain computer interface A-BCI determines whether or not a subject is on control state and produces control commands only in case of subjects being on control state. In this study we propose a novel P300-based A-BCI algorithm that distinguishes control state and noncontrol state of users. Furthermore A-BCI algorithm combined with a dynamic stopping function that enables users to select control command independent from a fixed number of intensification sequence. The proposed P300-based A-BCI algorithm uses classification patterns to determine control state and uses optimal operating point of receiver operating characteristics curve for dynamic stopping function. The proposed A-BCI algorithm is also combined with region-based paradigm RBP based stimulus interface. The A-BCI algorithm is tested on an internet-based environmental control system. A total of ten nondisabled subjects were participated voluntarily in the experiments. Two-level approach of the RBP-based stimulus interface improves noncontrol state detection accuracy up to 100%. Besides ratio of incorrect command selection at control state is reduced significantly. At control state ratio of correct selections incorrect selections and missed selections are 93.27% 1.09% and 5.63% respectively. On the other hand dynamic stopping function enables command selections at least two intensifications. Mean number of intensification sequences to complete the given tasks is 3.15. Thanks to dynamic stopping function it provides a significant improvement on information transfer rate. The proposed A-BCI algorithm is important in terms of practical BCI systems."
