The use of virtual reality VR programs in behavioral science research has been gaining prominence over the past several years. In the field of substance abuse VR cue reactivity programs have been successfully tested for feasibility in nicotine and cocaine dependent samples. Seeking to expand VR applications in alcohol cue research a novel VR alcohol cue reactivity assessment system incorporating visual auditory and olfactory stimuli was developed and tested. In a controlled trial 40 non-treatment-seeking drinkers with alcohol use disorders were exposed to VR alcohol cue environments. Subjective craving attention to alcohol cues and level of presence realism of experience in VR were assessed across the environments. Overall subjective craving for alcohol increased across the VR alcohol-related cue environments versus VR neutral cue environments. Participants reported high levels of presence in VR indicating that the environments were perceived as realistic and compelling. These initial findings support the use of VR based cue reactivity environments for use in alcohol cue-based treatment and research. Assessing reactivity to virtual reality alcohol based cues.
