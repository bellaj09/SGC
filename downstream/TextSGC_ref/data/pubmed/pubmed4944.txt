"Individuals are unique in terms of brain and behavior. Some are very sensitive to pain while others have a high tolerance. However how inter-individual intrinsic differences in the brain are related to pain is unknown. Here we performed longitudinal test-retest analyses to investigate pain threshold variability among individuals using a resting-state fMRI brain connectome. Twenty-four healthy subjects who received four MRI sessions separated by at least 7 days were included in the data analysis. Subjects pain thresholds were measured using two modalities of experimental pain heat and pressure on two different locations heat pain: leg and arm; pressure pain: leg and thumbnail. Behavioral results showed strong inter-individual variability and strong within-individual stability in pain threshold. Resting state fMRI data analyses showed that functional connectivity profiles can accurately identify subjects across four sessions indicating that an individuals connectivity profile may be intrinsic and unique. By using multivariate pattern analyses we found that connectivity profiles could be used to predict an individuals pain threshold at both within-session and between-session levels with the most predictive contribution from medial-frontal and frontal-parietal networks. These results demonstrate the potential of using a resting-state fMRI brain connectome to build a neural trait for characterizing an individuals pain-related behavior and such a neural trait may eventually be used to personalize clinical assessments."
