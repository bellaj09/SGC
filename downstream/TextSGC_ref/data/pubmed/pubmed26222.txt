"A major limitation of current Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI based on Motor Imagery MI is that they are subject-specific BCI which require data recording and system training for each new user. This process is time consuming and inconvenient especially for casual users or portable BCI with limited computational resources. In this paper we explore the design of a Subject-Independent SI MI-based BCI i.e. a BCI that can be used immediately by any new user without training the BCI with the users data. This is achieved by training the BCI on data acquired from several other subjects. In order to assess the possibility to build such a BCI we compared several designs based on different features and classifiers on data from 9 subjects. Our results suggested that linear classifiers were the most appropriate for the design of MI-based SI-BCI. We also proposed a filter bank common spatial patterns feature extraction method based on a multi-resolution frequency decomposition which achieved the highest accuracy."
