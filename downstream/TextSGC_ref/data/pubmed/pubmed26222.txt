We demonstrate the feasibility of virtual reality scenarios to reduce discomfort in patients during ambulatory and obstetric surgeries and patients hospitalized in postoperative care units from Cardiac nephrology and neonatology unirs. 27 patients have been participated in this preliminary reports from 3 public hospitals from Mexico city in 2006. The VR scenarios were developed in the Virtual Reality Medical Center of San Diego CA USA and the HMD is from the Southern University of los Angeles CA USA. The majority of patients demonstrated comfort with virtual scenarios during surgical procedures or hospitalization. In ambulatory surgeries the reduction of medication dosage was real. We present the first applications in surgery obstetrics and care units. The preliminary results must be supported in the future with more number of cases and statistical results; however we can predict the usefulness because we have found reduction of medication in ambulatory surgeries. Explore new applications in different areas in medicine is a challenge of Virtual Reality. Cybertherapy--new applications for discomfort reductions.
