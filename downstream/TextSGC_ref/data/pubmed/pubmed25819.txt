Brain damage constitutes a major problem for those affected for their families and friends and for society as a whole. The need for effective rehabilitation strategies is clear. Yet until the early 1960s the brain was generally considered to be a somewhat fixed and inflexible organ. In consequence the impairments associated with brain damage were generally regarded as "incurable". Since that time neuroscientists have had reason to change their views dramatically. However much remains to be done. Progress depends upon a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach within which assistive technology will be a key player. Within the area of assistive technology one of the developments which holds particular promise for the field of neurological rehabilitation is the computer technology underlying virtual environments commonly known as virtual reality. In this chapter we describe the new opportunities offered by virtual reality to pursue several aspects of the rehabilitation process. The value of the technology of virtual environments in this context is that it allows us to immerse people with brain damage in relatively realistic interactive environments which because of their patterns of impairment would otherwise be unavailable to them. Virtual environments in neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation.
