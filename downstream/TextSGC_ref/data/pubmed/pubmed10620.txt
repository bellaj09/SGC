"This paper reviews some of the challenges posed by the huge growth of experimental data generated by the new generation of large-scale experiments at UK national facilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory RAL site at Harwell near Oxford. Such Big Scientific Data comes from the Diamond Light Source and Electron Microscopy Facilities the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility and the UKs Central Laser Facility. Increasingly scientists are now required to use advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of the data pipeline and to help find new scientific discoveries in the analysis of their data. For commercially important applications such as object recognition natural language processing and automatic translation deep learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Googles DeepMind has now used the deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions for protein folding. Remarkably it has been able to achieve some spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of some initial applications of machine learning at the RAL we focus on challenges and opportunities for AI in advancing materials science. Finally we discuss the importance of developing some realistic machine learning benchmarks using Big Scientific Data coming from several different scientific domains. We conclude with some initial examples of our scientific machine learning benchmark suite and of the research challenges these benchmarks will enable. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Numerical algorithms for high-performance computational science." Machine learning and big scientific data.
