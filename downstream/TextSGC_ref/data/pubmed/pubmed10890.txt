Timely and accurate auxiliary diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm can help radiologist make treatment plans quickly saving lives and cutting costs at the same time. At present Digital Subtraction Angiography DSA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm but as radiologists interpret those imaging sequences frame by frame misdiagnosis might occur. The utilization of computer-aided diagnosis CAD can ease the burdens of radiologists and improve the detection accuracy of aneurysms. In this article a deep learning method is applied to detect the intracranial aneurysm in 3D Rotational Angiography 3D-RA based on a spatial information fusion SIF method and instead of a 3D vascular model 2D image sequences are used. Given the intracranial aneurysm and vascular overlap having similar feature in the most time rather than focusing on distinguishing them in one frame the morphological differences between frames are considered as major feature. In the training data consecutive frames of every imaging time series are extracted and concatenated in a specific way so that the spatial contextual information could be embedded into a single two-dimensional image. This method enables the time series with obvious correlation between frames be directly trained on 2D convolutional neural network CNN instead of 3D-CNN with huge computational cost. Finally we got an accuracy of 98.89% with sensitivity and specificity of 99.38% and 98.19% respectively which proves the feasibility and availability of the SIF feature.
