Medical entity recognition is a key technology that supports the development of smart medicine. Existing methods on English medical entity recognition have undergone great development but their progress in the Chinese language has been slow. Because of limitations due to the complexity of the Chinese language and annotated corpora these methods are based on simple neural networks which cannot effectively extract the deep semantic representations of electronic medical records EMRs and be used on the scarce medical corpora. We thus developed a new Chinese EMR CEMR dataset with six types of entities and proposed a multi-level representation learning model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers BERT for Chinese medical entity recognition.
