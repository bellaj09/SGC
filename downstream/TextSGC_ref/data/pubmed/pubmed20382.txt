This review aimed to systematically evaluate the rehabilitatitive effect of Virtual Reality Games VRGs for gross motor skills of children with cerebral palsy CP and to give scientific grounds for the formulation of rehabilitation therapy for these children. To this end the literature in Chinese databases CNKI and Wanfang Data as well as the databases of other countries Web of Science PubMed EBSCOhost Informit Scopus Science Direct and ProQuest from the establishment dates of these databases to June 3rd 2019 was retrieved in order to collect randomized controlled trials with regard to the intervention effect of VRGs and traditional therapy on gross motor skills of children with CP and the literature was screened as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. The PEDro scale was then used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included literature and the software Review Manager 5.3 was employed to analyze the combined effect size. As a result 7 randomized controlled trials and 234 children with CP were included. Meta-analysis showed that VRGs could improve gross motor skills of children with CP. Combined effect size of gross motor skills SMD = 0.37 95% CI = 0.06 0.68 p = 0.02. In conclusion the VRG intervention program can enhance gross motor skills of children with CP to some extent. In view of the limitations regarding methodologies and the quality and quantity of the literature in this research more quality randomized controlled trials are needed so as to draw convincing conclusions of effect of VRG intervention on gross motor skill development of children with CP in future studies.
