In this paper we propose a new deep hashing DH approach to learn compact binary codes for scalable image search. Unlike most existing binary codes learning methods which usually seek a single linear projection to map each sample into a binary feature vector we develop a deep neural network to seek multiple hierarchical non-linear transformations to learn these binary codes so that the non-linear relationship of samples can be well exploited. Our model is learned under three constraints at the top layer of the developed deep network: 1 the loss between the compact real-valued code and the learned binary vector is minimized 2 the binary codes distribute evenly on each bit and 3 different bits are as independent as possible. To further improve the discriminative power of the learned binary codes we extend DH into supervised DH SDH and multi-label SDH by including a discriminative term into the objective function of DH which simultaneously maximizes the inter-class variations and minimizes the intra-class variations of the learned binary codes with the single-label and multi-label settings respectively. Extensive experimental results on eight widely used image search data sets show that our proposed methods achieve very competitive results with the state-of-the-arts.
