"To explore the link between Sense of Embodiment SoE over a virtual hand and physiological regulation of skin temperature 24 healthy participants were immersed in virtual reality through a Head Mounted Display and had their real limb temperature recorded by means of a high-sensitivity infrared camera. Participants observed a virtual right upper limb appearing either normally or with the hand detached from the forearm or limb-shaped non-corporeal control objects continuous or discontinuous wooden blocks from a first-person perspective. Subjective ratings of SoE were collected in each observation condition as well as temperatures of the right and left hand wrist and forearm. The observation of these complex body and body-related virtual scenes resulted in increased real hand temperature when compared to a baseline condition in which a 3d virtual ball was presented. Crucially observation of non-natural appearances of the virtual limb discontinuous limb and limb-shaped non-corporeal objects elicited high increase in real hand temperature and low SoE. In contrast observation of the full virtual limb caused high SoE and low temperature changes in the real hand with respect to the other conditions. Interestingly the temperature difference across the different conditions occurred according to a topographic rule that included both hands. Our study sheds new light on the role of an external hands visual appearance and suggests a tight link between higher-order bodily self-representations and topographic regulation of skin temperature." Visual appearance of a virtual upper limb modulates the temperature of the real hand: a thermal imaging study in Immersive Virtual Reality.
