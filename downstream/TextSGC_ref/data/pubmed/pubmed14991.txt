Behavioral tests have been extensively used to measure the visual function of mice. To determine how precisely mice perceive certain visual cues it is necessary to have a quantifiable measurement of their behavioral responses. Recently virtual reality tests have been utilized for a variety of purposes from analyzing hippocampal cell functionality to identifying visual acuity. Despite the widespread use of these tests the training requirement for the recognition of a variety of different visual targets and the performance of the behavioral tests has not been thoroughly characterized. We have developed a virtual reality behavior testing approach that can essay a variety of different aspects of visual perception including color/luminance and motion detection. When tested for the ability to detect a color/luminance target or a moving target mice were able to discern the designated target after 9 days of continuous training. However the quality of their performance is significantly affected by the complexity of the visual target and their ability to navigate on a spherical treadmill. Importantly mice retained memory of their visual recognition for at least three weeks after the end of their behavioral training. Virtual reality method to analyze visual recognition in mice.
