"Subjective well-being is a comprehensive psychological indicator for measuring quality of life. Studies have found that emotional measurement methods and measurement accuracy are important for well-being-related research. Academic emotion is an emotion description in the field of education. The subjective well-being of learners in an online learning environment can be studied by analyzing academic emotions. However in a large-scale online learning environment it is extremely challenging to classify learners academic emotions quickly and accurately for specific comment aspects. This study used literature analysis and data pre-analysis to build a dimensional classification system of academic emotion aspects for students comments in an online learning environment as well as to develop an aspect-oriented academic emotion automatic recognition method including an aspect-oriented convolutional neural network A-CNN and an academic emotion classification algorithm based on the long short-term memory with attention mechanism LSTM-ATT and the attention mechanism. The experiments showed that this model can provide quick and effective identification. The A-CNN model accuracy on the test set was 89% and the LSTM-ATT model accuracy on the test set was 71%. This research provides a new method for the measurement of large-scale online academic emotions as well as support for research related to students well-being in online learning environments."
