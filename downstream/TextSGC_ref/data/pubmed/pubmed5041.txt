High-grade glioma HGG is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accurate preoperative overall survival OS time prediction for HGG patients is crucial for treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS prediction studies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on the magnetic resonance images MRI. However the highly complex lesion MRI appearance may have large individual variability which could impede accurate individualized OS prediction. In this paper we propose a novel concept namely brain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-state functional MRI rs-fMRI and the non-local large-scale brain functional networks where the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesion appearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics features could capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated with prognosis. We construct both low-order by means of sparse representation with regional rs-fMRI signals and high-order functional connectivity FC networks characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamics FC time courses. Then we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networks for a jointly machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on a preliminary dataset N\u2009=\u200934 with bad OS mean OS ~400\xa0days; N\u2009=\u200934 with good OS mean OS ~1030\xa0days we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy 86.8% on separating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However if using only conventionally derived descriptive features e.g. age and tumor characteristics the accuracy is low 63.2%. Our study highlights the importance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatment planning.
