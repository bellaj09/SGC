The ability to sustain attention differs across people and changes within a single person over time. Although recent work has demonstrated that patterns of functional brain connectivity predict individual differences in sustained attention whether these same patterns capture fluctuations in attention within individuals remains unclear. Here across five independent studies we demonstrate that the sustained attention connectome-based predictive model CPM a validated model of sustained attention function generalizes to predict attentional state from data collected across minutes days weeks and months. Furthermore the sustained attention CPM is sensitive to within-subject state changes induced by propofol as well as sevoflurane such that individuals show functional connectivity signatures of stronger attentional states when awake than when under deep sedation and light anesthesia. Together these results demonstrate that fluctuations in attentional state reflect variability in the same functional connectivity patterns that predict individual differences in sustained attention. Functional connectivity predicts changes in attention observed across minutes days and months.
