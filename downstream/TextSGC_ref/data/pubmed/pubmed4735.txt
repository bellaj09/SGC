"Hippocampal development is coordinated by both extracellular factors like GABA neurotransmission and intracellular components like DISC1. We previously reported that SLC12A2-dependent GABA depolarization and DISC1 coregulate hippocampal neuronal development and 2 SNPs in these genes linked to mRNA expression interactively increase schizophrenia risk. Using functional MRI we now confirm this biological interaction in vivo by showing in 2 independent samples of healthy individuals total N = 349 that subjects homozygous for both risk alleles evince dramatically decreased hippocampal area activation Cohens d = 0.78and connectivity d = 0.57 during a recognition memory task. These data highlight the importance of epistatic models in understanding genetic association with complex brain phenotypes." DISC1 and SLC12A2 interaction affects human hippocampal function and connectivity.
