"The objective of this paper is to outline the project that eventually seeks to visualize clinical knowledge found within the record; the immediate task being to create a model that can be deployed for therapeutic purposes. How therapies for a certain type of chronically ill patient can benefit from Virtual Reality VR tools is investigated. Ankylosing Spondylitis AS is selected as a test condition. VR is expected to provide a novel treatment environment for AS sufferers in which they can relax manage their pain and take part in the routine exercise more effectively and efficiently by using the VR tools. An integral part of this models construction will be to elicit evaluative detail from the literature and the patients perspective. The purpose is to understand the inevitable challenges facing this proposed intervention if the design prototype is to successfully move from the research domain and become an integral part of established therapeutic practice." Virtual reality: towards a novel treatment environment for ankylosing spondylitis.
