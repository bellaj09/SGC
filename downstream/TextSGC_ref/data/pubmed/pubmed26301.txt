"In this chapter we give an overview of the Graz-BCI research from the classic motor imagery detection to complex movement intentions decoding. We start by describing the classic motor imagery approach its application in tetraplegic end users and the significant improvements achieved using coadaptive brain-computer interfaces BCIs. These strategies have the drawback of not mirroring the way one plans a movement. To achieve a more natural control-and to reduce the training time-the movements decoded by the BCI need to be closely related to the users intention. Within this natural control we focus on the kinematic level where movement direction and hand position or velocity can be decoded from noninvasive recordings. First we review movement execution decoding studies where we describe the decoding algorithms their performance and associated features. Second we describe the major findings in movement imagination decoding where we emphasize the importance of estimating the sources of the discriminative features. Third we introduce movement target decoding which could allow the determination of the target without knowing the exact movement-by-movement details. Aside from the kinematic level we also address the goal level which contains relevant information on the upcoming action. Focusing on hand-object interaction and action context dependency we discuss the possible impact of some recent neurophysiological findings in the future of BCI control. Ideally the goal and the kinematic decoding would allow an appropriate matching of the BCI to the end users needs overcoming the limitations of the classic motor imagery approach."
