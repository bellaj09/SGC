"Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict chronological age in healthy people. Deviations from healthy brain ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to further establish the credentials of brain-predicted age as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning and specifically convolutional neural networks CNN and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data. Firstly we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age using a large dataset of healthy adults N\xa0=\xa02001. Next we sought to establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic female twins N\xa0=\xa062. Thirdly we examined the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples within-scanner N\xa0=\xa020; between-scanner N\xa0=\xa011. CNN brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression GPR approach on all datasets. Input data were grey matter GM or white matter WM volumetric maps generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM or raw data. CNN accurately predicted chronological age using GM correlation between brain-predicted age and chronological age r\xa0=\xa00.96 mean absolute error MAE\xa0=\xa04.16 years and raw r\xa0=\xa00.94 MAE\xa0=\xa04.65 years data. This was comparable to GPR brain-predicted age using GM data r\xa0=\xa00.95 MAE\xa0=\xa04.66 years. Brain-predicted age was a heritable phenotype for all models and input data h2\xa0\xa00.5. Brain-predicted age showed high test-retest reliability intraclass correlation coefficient ICC\xa0=\xa00.90-0.99. Multi-centre reliability was more variable within high ICCs for GM 0.83-0.96 and poor-moderate levels for WM and raw data 0.51-0.77. Brain-predicted age represents an accurate highly reliable and genetically-influenced phenotype that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover age predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data substantially reducing computation time for novel data bringing the process closer to giving real-time information on brain health in clinical settings." Predicting brain age with deep learning from raw imaging data results in a reliable and heritable biomarker.
