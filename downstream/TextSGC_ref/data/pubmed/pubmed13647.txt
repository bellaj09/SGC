In this Letter for the first time to the best of our knowledge we propose a digital holographic reconstruction method with a one-to-two deep learning framework Y-Net. Perfectly fitting the holographic reconstruction process the Y-Net can simultaneously reconstruct intensity and phase information from a single digital hologram. As a result this compact network with reduced parameters brings higher performance than typical network variants. The experimental results of the mouse phagocytes demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Y-Net. Y-Net: a one-to-two deep learning framework for digital holographic reconstruction.
