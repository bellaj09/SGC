In this work two methods based on statistical models that take into account the temporal changes in the electroencephalographic EEG signal are proposed for asynchronous brain-computer interfaces BCI based on imaginary motor tasks. Unlike the current approaches to asynchronous BCI systems that make use of windowed versions of the EEG data combined with static classifiers the methods proposed here are based on discriminative models that allow sequential labeling of data. In particular the two methods we propose for asynchronous BCI are based on conditional random fields CRFs and latent dynamic CRFs LDCRFs respectively. We describe how the asynchronous BCI problem can be posed as a classification problem based on CRFs or LDCRFs by defining appropriate random variables and their relationships. CRF allows modeling the extrinsic dynamics of data making it possible to model the transitions between classes which in this context correspond to distinct tasks in an asynchronous BCI system. On the other hand LDCRF goes beyond this approach by incorporating latent variables that permit modeling the intrinsic structure for each class and at the same time allows modeling extrinsic dynamics. We apply our proposed methods on the publicly available BCI competition III dataset V as well as a data set recorded in our laboratory. Results obtained are compared to the top algorithm in the BCI competition as well as to methods based on hierarchical hidden Markov models HHMMs hierarchical hidden CRF HHCRF neural networks based on particle swarm optimization IPSONN and to a recently proposed approach based on neural networks and fuzzy theory the S-dFasArt. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the improvements provided by our proposed methods in terms of classification accuracy.
