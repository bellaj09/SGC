"Alzheimers disease AD is the most common form of progressive and irreversible dementia and accurate diagnosis of AD at its prodromal stage is clinically important. Currently computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment MCI using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography 18F-FDG PET imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features or deep learning methods which have difficulties in achieving sufficient classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics to improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can reveal pathological information."
