Brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on motor control have been suggested as tools for stroke rehabilitation. Some initial successes have been achieved with this approach however the mechanism by which they work is not yet fully understood. One possible part of this mechanism is a previously suggested relationship between the strength of the event-related desynchronization ERD a neural correlate of motor imagination and execution and corticospinal excitability. Additionally a key component of BCIs used in neurorehabilitation is the provision of visual feedback to positively reinforce attempts at motor control. However the ability of visual feedback of the ERD to modulate the activity in the motor system has not been fully explored. Cortical excitability correlates with the event-related desynchronization during brain-computer interface control.
