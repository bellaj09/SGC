This paper presents a novel automatic facial expressions recognition system AFERS using the deep network framework. The proposed AFERS consists of four steps: 1 geometric features extraction; 2 regional local binary pattern LBP features extraction; 3 fusion of both the features using autoencoders; and 4 classification using Kohonen self-organizing map SOM-based classifier. This paper makes three distinct contributions. The proposed deep network consisting of autoencoders and the SOM-based classifier is computationally more efficient and performance wise more accurate. The fusion of geometric features with LBP features using autoencoders provides better representation of facial expression. The SOM-based classifier proposed in this paper has been improved by making use of a soft-threshold logic and a better learning algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on two widely used databases DBs: 1 MMI and 2 extended Cohn-Kanade CK+. An average recognition accuracy of 97.55% in MMI DB and 98.95% in CK+ DB are obtained using the proposed algorithm. The recognition results obtained from fused features are found to be distinctly superior to both recognition using individual features as well as recognition with a direct concatenation of the individual feature vectors. Simulation results validate that the proposed AFERS is more efficient as compared to the existing approaches. Automatic Facial Expression Recognition System Using Deep Network-Based Data Fusion.
