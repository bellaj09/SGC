With the advent of brain computer interfaces based on real-time fMRI rtfMRI-BCI the possibility of performing neurofeedback based on brain hemodynamics has become a reality. In the early stage of the development of this field studies have focused on the volitional control of activity in circumscribed brain regions. However based on the understanding that the brain functions by coordinated activity of spatially distributed regions there have recently been further developments to incorporate real-time feedback of functional connectivity and spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity. The present article reviews the principles of rtfMRI neurofeedback its applications benefits and limitations. A special emphasis is given to the discussion of novel developments that have enabled the use of this methodology to achieve self-regulation of the functional connectivity between different brain areas and of distributed brain networks anticipating new and exciting applications for cognitive neuroscience and for the potential alleviation of neuropsychiatric disorders.
