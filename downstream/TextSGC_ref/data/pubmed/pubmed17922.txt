"Body image disturbances BIDs have been widely studied using virtual reality VR devices that induce a full body illusion FBI and allow manipulation of the individuals perceptual and affective experiences of the body. This study aimed to assess whether the induction of the FBI over a virtual body would produce changes in body-related anxiety and BIDs using a new whole-body visuo-tactile stimulation procedure. Fifty non-clinical participants were randomly assigned to synchronous or asynchronous visuo-tactile groups. During the pre-assessment all participants filled in BIDs and body-anxiety questionnaires. Then they were embodied into two virtual bodies VBs: firstly with their real measurements and secondly with a larger-size body. Body image disturbances body anxiety fear of gaining weight and FBI levels were assessed after exposure to each avatar. All participants in both conditions showed higher levels of BIDs and body anxiety after owning the larger-size VB than after owning the real-size VB p < 0.05. The synchronous visuo-tactile group had higher scores although the differences did not reach statistical significance. This study provides evidence of the usefulness of this new embodiment-based technique to induce changes in BIDs or body anxiety in a non-clinical sample being suitable for use in future body image interventions."
