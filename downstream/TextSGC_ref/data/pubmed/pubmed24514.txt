In this paper we discuss findings from a study that used panoramic video-based virtual environments PVVEs to induce self-reported anger. The study assessed "immersiveness" and physiological correlates of anger arousal i.e. heart rate blood pressure galvanic skin response GSR respiration and skin temperature. Results indicate that over time panoramic video-based virtual scenarios can be at the very least physiologically arousing. Further it can be affirmed from the results that hypnotizability as defined by the applied measures interacts with group on physiological arousal measures. Hence physiological arousal appeared to be moderated by participant hypnotizability and absorption levels. Immersiveness and physiological arousal within panoramic video-based virtual reality.
