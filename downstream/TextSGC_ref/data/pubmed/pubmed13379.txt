The prognostic value of mitotic count for invasive breast cancer is firmly established. As yet however limited studies have been aimed at assessing mitotic counts as a prognostic factor for triple negative breast cancers TNBC. Here we assessed the prognostic value of absolute mitotic counts for TNBC using both deep learning and manual procedures. Deep learning and manual assessment show that the absolute mitotic count does not contain prognostic information in triple negative breast cancer.
