Deep learning has started to revolutionize several different industries and the applications of these methods in medicine are now becoming more commonplace. This study focuses on investigating the feasibility of tracking patients and clinical staff wearing Bluetooth Low Energy BLE tags in a radiation oncology clinic using artificial neural networks ANNs and convolutional neural networks CNNs. The performance of these networks was compared to relative received signal strength indicator RSSI thresholding and triangulation. By utilizing temporal information a combined CNN+ANN network was capable of correctly identifying the location of the BLE tag with an accuracy of 99.9%. It outperformed a CNN model accuracy = 94% a thresholding model employing majority voting accuracy = 95% and a triangulation classifier utilizing majority voting accuracy = 95%. Future studies will seek to deploy this affordable real time location system in hospitals to improve clinical workflow efficiency and patient safety. Accurate real time localization tracking in a clinical environment using Bluetooth Low Energy and deep learning.
