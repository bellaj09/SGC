Patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy CAA show loss of white matter connectivity and cortical thinning on MRI primarily in posterior brain regions. Here we examined whether a potential causal relationship exists between these markers of subcortical and cortical brain injury by examining whether changes in cortical thickness progress in tandem with changes in their underlying connections. Thirty-one patients with probable CAA with brain MRI at two time points were included follow-up time: 1.3\u2009\u20090.4 years. Brain networks were reconstructed using diffusion MRI-based fiber tractography. Of each network node we calculated the change in fractional anisotropy-weighted connectivity strength over time and the change in cortical thickness. The association between change in connectivity strength and cortical thickness was assessed with hierarchical linear regression models. Our results showed that decline in posterior network connectivity over time was strongly related to thinning of the occipital cortex \u2009=\u20090.65 0.35-0.94 P\u2009<\u20090.001 but not to thinning of the other posterior or frontal cortices. However at the level of individual network nodes we found no association between connectivity strength and cortical thinning of the corresponding node \u2009=\u20090.009\u2009\u20090.04 P\u2009=\u20090.80. Associations were independent of age sex and other brain MRI markers of CAA. To conclude CAA patients with greater progressive loss of posterior white matter connectivity also have greater progression of occipital cortical thinning but our results do not support a direct causal relationship between them. The association can be better explained by a shared underlying mechanism which may form a potential target for future treatments. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3723-3731 2017.
