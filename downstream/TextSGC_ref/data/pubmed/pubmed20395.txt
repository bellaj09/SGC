Repeated combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are resulting in increased rates of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD among military personnel. Although exposure therapy is an effective treatment for this disorder some personnel do not significantly respond to treatment possibly due to poor activation of the trauma memory or a lack of emotional engagement during therapy. In addition some service members do not seek mental healthcare due to treatment stigma. Researchers recently developed a virtual reality VR Iraq to attempt to improve activation of the traumatic memory during exposure therapy and to provide a treatment approach that may be more appealing to some service members relative to traditional face-to-face talk therapy. Initial validation of the application requires an assessment of how well it represents the experiences of previously deployed service members. This study evaluated the realism of the VR Iraq application according to the subjective evaluation of 93 U.S. Army soldiers who returned from Iraq in the last year. Those screening negative for PTSD used and evaluated a VR tactical convoy and a VR dismounted patrol in a simulated Middle Eastern city. Results indicated that 86% of soldiers rated the overall realism of the VR convoy as ranging from adequate to excellent. Eighty-two percent of soldiers reported adequate-to-excellent overall realism of the city environment. Results provide evidence that the VR Iraq presents a realistic context in which VR exposure therapy can be conducted. However clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of VR exposure therapy for Iraq veterans with PTSD. Soldier evaluation of the virtual reality Iraq.
