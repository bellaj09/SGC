Humans possess mechanisms to suppress distracting early sound reflections summarized as the precedence effect. Recent work shows that precedence is affected by visual stimulation. This paper investigates possible effects of visual stimulation on the perception of later reflections i.e. reverberation. In a highly immersive audio-visual virtual reality environment subjects were asked to quantify reverberation in conditions where simultaneously presented auditory and visual stimuli either match in room identity sound source azimuth and sound source distance or diverge in one of these aspects. While subjects reliably judged reverberation across acoustic environments the visual room impression did not affect reverberation estimates. The percept of reverberation is not affected by visual room impression in virtual environments.
