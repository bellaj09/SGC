Cardiovascular disease CVD is a chronic dysfunction caused by deterioration in cardiac physiology. It results in about 31% of mortality worldwide. Among CVDs myocardial ischemia MI leads to restriction in blood supply to heart tissues. There is a need to develop an effective computer aided detection CAD system to reduce the fatality. In this work an attempt is made to perform mass screening of myocardial ischemic subjects and left ventricle LV volume estimation from cardiac magnetic resonance CMR images using deep convolutional neural network CNN with Levenberg-Marquardt LM learning. LV volume measurement is an important predictor of myocardial ischemia. The CMR samples used in this analysis are obtained from Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention MICCAI 2009 database. The results of the proposed model are compared with deep CNN based on gradient descent GD learning algorithm. The results show that deep CNN architecture with LM learning classifies ischemic subjects with high accuracy 86.39% and sensitivity 90%. The LM learning based method gives an AUC of 0.93. The estimated LV volumes obtained from the trained network gives high correlation with the ground truth. Thus the results support that proposed framework of deep CNN architecture with LM learning can be used as an effective CAD system for diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders.
