"This research aims to evaluate the effect of virtual reality VR games on balance recovery of children with cerebral palsy CP by quantitatively synthesizing the existing literature and to further determine the impact of VR game intervention the duration of each intervention intervention frequency intervention cycle and total intervention time on the balance recovery of children with CP. To this end relevant literature up until 3 August 2019 was retrieved from Chinese databases CNKI and Wanfang Data and the databases in other languages Web of Science Pubmed EBSCOhost Informit Scopus Science Direct and ProQuest and bias analysis was conducted with the PEDro scale in this research. Randomized controlled trials RCTs were selected and underwent meta-analysis and combined effect size was calculated with a random effects model. The results showed that VR games may improve the balance of children with CP Hedges g = 0.29; 95% CI 0.10-0.48 and no significant influence of the intervention on balance of children with CP was shown in the subgroup analysis. In conclusion VR games played a positive role in the improvement of balance of children with CP but these results should be viewed with caution owing to current methodological defects difference in measurement heterogeneity of control groups intervention combined with other treatments etc.."
