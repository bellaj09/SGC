"Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients covariates e.g. clinical and genetic features and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods such as neural networks and survival forests can inherently model these high-level interaction terms they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems."
