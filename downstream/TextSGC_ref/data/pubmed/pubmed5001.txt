The trigeminal nerve TGN is the largest cranial nerve and can be involved in multiple inflammatory compressive ischemic or other pathologies. Currently imaging-based approaches to identify the TGN mostly rely on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging MRI which provides localization of the cisternal portion of the TGN where the contrast between nerve and cerebrospinal fluid CSF is high enough to allow differentiation. The course of the TGN within the brainstem as well as anterior to the cisternal portion however is more difficult to display on traditional imaging sequences. An advanced imaging technique diffusion MRI dMRI enables tracking of the trajectory of TGN fibers and has the potential to visualize anatomical regions of the TGN not seen on T2-weighted imaging. This may allow a more comprehensive assessment of the nerve in the context of pathology. To date most work in TGN tracking has used clinical dMRI acquisitions with a b-value of 1000\xa0s/mm2 and conventional diffusion tensor MRI DTI tractography methods. Though higher b-value acquisitions and multi-tensor tractography methods are known to be beneficial for tracking brain white matter fiber tracts there have been no studies conducted to evaluate the performance of these advanced approaches on nerve tracking of the TGN in particular on tracking different anatomical regions of the TGN.
