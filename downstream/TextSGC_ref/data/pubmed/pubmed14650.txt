The oral route is the most convenient way of administrating drugs. Therefore accurate determination of oral bioavailability is paramount during drug discovery and development. Quantitative structure-property relationship QSPR rule-of-thumb RoT and physiologically based-pharmacokinetic PBPK approaches are promising alternatives to the early oral bioavailability prediction. Areas covered: The authors give insight into the factors affecting bioavailability the fundamental theoretical framework and the practical aspects of computational methods for predicting this property. They also give their perspectives on future computational models for estimating oral bioavailability. Expert opinion: Oral bioavailability is a multi-factorial pharmacokinetic property with its accurate prediction challenging. For RoT and QSPR modeling the reliability of datasets the significance of molecular descriptor families and the diversity of chemometric tools used are important factors that define model predictability and interpretability. Likewise for PBPK modeling the integrity of the pharmacokinetic data the number of input parameters the complexity of statistical analysis and the software packages used are relevant factors in bioavailability prediction. Although these approaches have been utilized independently the tendency to use hybrid QSPR-PBPK approaches together with the exploration of ensemble and deep-learning systems for QSPR modeling of oral bioavailability has opened new avenues for development promising tools for oral bioavailability prediction. Computational modeling of human oral bioavailability: what will be next?
