Studies of functional connectivity suggest that the default mode network DMN might be relevant for cognitive functions. Here we examined metabolic and structural connectivity between major DMN nodes the posterior cingulate PCC and medial prefrontal cortex MPFC in relation to normal working memory WM. DMN was captured using independent component analysis of 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG-PET data from 35 young healthy adults 27.1  5.1 years. Metabolic connectivity a correlation between FDG uptake in PCC and MPFC was examined in groups of subjects with relative to median low n=18 and high n=17 performance on digit span backward test as an index of verbal WM. In addition fiber tractography based on PCC and MPFC nodes as way points was performed in a subset of subjects. FDG uptake in the DMN nodes did not differ between high and low performers. However significantly p=0.01 lower metabolic connectivity was found in the group of low performers. Furthermore as compared to high performers low performers showed lower density of the left superior cingulate bundle. Verbal WM performance is related to metabolic and structural connectivity within the DMN in young healthy adults. Metabolic connectivity as quantified with FDG-PET might be a sensitive marker of the normal variability in some cognitive functions. Metabolic and structural connectivity within the default mode network relates to working memory performance in young healthy adults.
