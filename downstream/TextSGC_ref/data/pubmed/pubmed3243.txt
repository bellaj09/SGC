Dexamphetamine dAMPH is not only used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD but also as a recreational drug. Acutely dAMPH induces release of predominantly dopamine DA in the striatum and in the cortex both DA and noradrenaline. Recent animal studies have shown that chronic dAMPH administration can induce changes in the DA system following long-term exposure as evidenced by reductions in DA transporters D2/3 receptors and endogenous DA levels. However only a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of dAMPH in the human brain. We used a combination of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI and 123IIBZM single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT to assess baseline D2/3 receptor binding and DA release in 15 recreational AMPH users and 20 matched healthy controls to investigate the short- and long-term effects of AMPH before and after an acute intravenous challenge with dAMPH. We found that acute dAMPH administration reduced functional connectivity in the cortico-striatal-thalamic network. dAMPH-induced DA release but not DA D2/3 receptor binding was positively associated with connectivity changes in this network. In addition acute dAMPH reduced connectivity in default mode networks and salience-executive-networks networks in both groups. In contrast to our hypothesis no significant group differences were found in any of the rs-fMRI networks investigated possibly due to lack of sensitivity or compensatory mechanisms. Our findings thus support the use of ICA-based resting-state functional connectivity as a tool to investigate acute but not chronic alterations induced by dAMPH on dopaminergic processing in the striatum.
