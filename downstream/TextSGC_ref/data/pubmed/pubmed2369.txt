Resurgent interest in synaptic circuitry and plasticity has emphasized the importance of 3D reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy 3DEM. Three volumes of hippocampal CA1 neuropil from adult rat were imaged at X-Y resolution of ~2\u2009nm on serial sections of ~50-60\u2009nm thickness. These are the first densely reconstructed hippocampal volumes. All axons dendrites glia and synapses were reconstructed in a cube ~10\u2009m3 surrounding a large dendritic spine a cylinder ~43\u2009m3 surrounding an oblique dendritic segment 3.4\u2009m long and a parallelepiped ~178\u2009m3 surrounding an apical dendritic segment 4.9\u2009m long. The data provide standards for identifying ultrastructural objects in 3DEM realistic reconstructions for modeling biophysical properties of synaptic transmission and a test bed for enhancing reconstruction tools. Representative synapses are quantified from varying section planes and microtubules polyribosomes smooth endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes are identified and reconstructed in a subset of dendrites.
