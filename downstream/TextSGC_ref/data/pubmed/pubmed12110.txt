Recently developed methods for rapid continuous volumetric two-photon microscopy facilitate the observation of neuronal activity in hundreds of individual neurons and changes in blood flow in adjacent blood vessels across a large volume of living brain at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. However the high imaging rate necessitates fully automated image analysis whereas tissue turbidity and photo-toxicity limitations lead to extremely sparse and noisy imagery. In this work we extend a recently proposed deep learning volumetric blood vessel segmentation network such that it supports temporal analysis. With this technology we are able to track changes in cerebral blood volume over time and identify spontaneous arterial dilations that propagate towards the pial surface. This new capability is a promising step towards characterizing the hemodynamic response function upon which functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI is based.
