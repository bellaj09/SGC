P300 is a positive event-related potential used by P300-brain computer interfaces BCIs as a means of communication with external devices. One of the main requirements of any P300-based BCI is accuracy and time efficiency for P300 extraction and detection. Among many attempted techniques independent component analysis ICA is currently the most popular P300 extraction technique. However since ICA extracts multiple independent components ICs its use requires careful selection of ICs containing P300 responses which limits the number of channels available for computational efficiency. Here we propose a novel procedure for P300 extraction and detection using constrained independent component analysis cICA through which we can directly extract only P300-relevant ICs. We tested our procedure on two standard datasets collected from healthy and disabled subjects. We tested our procedure on these datasets and compared their respective performances with a conventional ICA-based procedure. Our results demonstrate that the cICA-based method was more reliable and less computationally expensive and was able to achieve 97 and 91.6% accuracy in P300 detection from healthy and disabled subjects respectively. In recognizing target characters and images our approach achieved 95 and 90.25% success in healthy and disabled individuals whereas use of ICA only achieved 83 and 72.25% respectively. In terms of information transfer rate our results indicate that the ICA-based procedure optimally performs with a limited number of channels typically three but with a higher number of available channels >3 its performance deteriorates and the cICA-based one performs better.
