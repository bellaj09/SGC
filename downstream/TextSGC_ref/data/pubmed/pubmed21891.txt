Aim: This report explores the process of weight-related genomic information provision considering patient race as an important potential moderator of patient response. Methods: Health beliefs and perceived stigma were assessed following provision of genomic versus behavioral information by a virtual reality-based physician using either a supportive or directive communication style. Participants included 168 women with overweight. Results: Genomic explanations combined with supportive communication resulted in some improved health behavior-related and interpersonal outcomes for white patients but not black participants. Black participants on average did not have diminished outcomes when provided with genomic information. Conclusion: Genomic communications may elicit more positive interpersonal responses than behavioral explanations among both majority and minority populations but these effects may be moderated by patient race. Weight-related genomic information and provider communication approach: looking through the lens of patient race.
