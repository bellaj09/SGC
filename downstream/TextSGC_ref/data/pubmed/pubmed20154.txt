Understanding how people explore immersive virtual environments is crucial for many applications such as designing virtual reality VR content developing new compression algorithms or learning computational models of saliency or visual attention. Whereas a body of recent work has focused on modeling saliency in desktop viewing conditions VR is very different from these conditions in that viewing behavior is governed by stereoscopic vision and by the complex interaction of head orientation gaze and other kinematic constraints. To further our understanding of viewing behavior and saliency in VR we capture and analyze gaze and head orientation data of 169 users exploring stereoscopic static omni-directional panoramas for a total of 1980 head and gaze trajectories for three different viewing conditions. We provide a thorough analysis of our data which leads to several important insights such as the existence of a particular fixation bias which we then use to adapt existing saliency predictors to immersive VR conditions. In addition we explore other applications of our data and analysis including automatic alignment of VR video cuts panorama thumbnails panorama video synopsis and saliency-basedcompression.
