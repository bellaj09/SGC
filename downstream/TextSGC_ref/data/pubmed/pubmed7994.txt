Left ventricular noncompaction LVNC is a distinct cardiomyopathy that is morphologically characterized by a two-layered myocardium numerous prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses communicating with the left ventricular cavity. We present a case report regarding the identification of a new mutation in TNNI3 in a patient with LVNC using next-generation sequencing. A 13-year-old girl who had no family history of cardiac disease was hospitalized with dyspnea after exercise and electrocardiographic abnormalities during a school screening. Based on her clinical features she was diagnosed with LVNC. Via genetic analysis a TNNI3 heterozygous missense variant was identified in the proband. Although mutations in TNNI3 have been reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy this is the first report of a mutation in this gene in a patient with LVNC. <Learning objective: We identified a variant in TNNI3 in a patient with isolated left ventricular noncompaction using next-generation sequencing NGS. Mutations in TNNI3 have been reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The use of NGS also results in the identification of multiple genetic variants of unknown significance to the investigated disease.>.
