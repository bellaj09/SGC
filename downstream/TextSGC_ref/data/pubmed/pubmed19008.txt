"The development of internet technology and the popularity of smartphones has been gradually affecting peoples daily lives thus causing subtle changes to their health. Manufacturing companies are increasingly establishing virtual communities to motivate customers to participate in new product development. However the reasons that customers participate in the innovation process and the timing of participation remain under-researched. Hence using data on 517 customers of 14 manufacturing enterprises we investigate the reasons behind such participation and the moderating role of perceived ease of use and perceived control based on the social exchange theory. Results show that learning benefits integrative benefits and hedonic benefits have positive effects on participation. Perceived ease of use strengthens the positive relationship between integrative benefits and customer participation. Perceived control strengthens the positive relationship between hedonic benefits and customer participation. Theoretical implications and managerial practices are also discussed."
