"A growing body of literature documents how exposure to another persons fear-related body odorants can increase ones own anxiety and interfere with processing of social information such as facial expression and impression formation. Building on these results we aimed to 1 test the hypothesis that exposure to fear-related odorant would affect impression formation through fear contagion and 2 verify whether these effects can be observed in an ecologically valid i.e. virtual environment. We proposed that exposure to fear-related odorant would cause receivers to feel more anxious which in turn would lead them to report less trust toward an unknown virtual character. This study had 2 distinct phases. First we collected perspiration odorants from the armpits of 12 male senders i.e. the source of the odorant during the viewing of either fear or joy inducing film clips. In the second phase 53 women receivers were exposed to either a fear joy or neutral odorant i.e. between-subjects design by breathing through a gauze attached to a disposable respirator mask while immersed in a virtual bar. As expected receivers exposed to fear odorants felt significantly more stressed. Mediation analysis also revealed an indirect effect of exposure on trust through anxiety. More specifically the more anxious the receiver felt the less she trusted the virtual character. Our results show for the first time that the impact of exposure to fear-related body odorants on negative interpersonal impression formation is mediated by the anxiety induced in the receiver."
