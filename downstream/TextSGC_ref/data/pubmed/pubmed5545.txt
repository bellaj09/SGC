Graph theory has been extensively applied to investigate complex brain networks in current neuroscience research. Many metrics derived from graph theory such as local and global efficiencies are based on the path length between nodes. These approaches are commonly used in analyses of brain networks assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging although relying on the strong assumption that information flow throughout the network is restricted to the shortest paths. In this study we propose the utilization of commute time as a tool to investigate regional centrality on the functional connectome. Our initial hypothesis was that an alternative approach that considers alternative routes such as commute time could provide further information into the organization of functional networks. However our empirical findings on the ADHD-200 database suggest that at the group level the commute time and shortest path are highly correlated. In contrast at the subject level we discovered that commute time is much less susceptible to head motion artifacts when compared with metrics based on shortest paths. Given the overall similarity between the measures we argue that commute time might be advantageous particularly for connectomic studies in populations where motion artifacts are a major issue.
