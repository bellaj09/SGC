While psychotic-like experiences PLEs including persecutory ideation and auditory or visual hallucinations are common in PTSD questions remain about their relationships to core PTSD symptoms and responsiveness to treatment. This study examined data from a waitlist WL controlled clinical study of the effect of virtual reality VR and prolonged exposure PE in a sample of active-duty service members with deployment-related trauma n\u202f=\u202f161. PLEs were assessed and examined with regard to their responsiveness to trauma focused treatment combining conditions relative to the WL as well as their relationships to PTSD symptoms. Persecutory ideation symptoms which were most closely related to PTSD Cluster C avoidance and numbing symptoms were reduced post-treatment in the trauma-focused condition relative to WL. Auditory and visual hallucinations-which were most closely associated with PTSD re-experiencing-decreased from baseline to post-treatment assessments for WL and exposure therapy participants. The presence of PLEs at baseline did not predict a reduced PTSD symptom response to treatment. Trauma-focused treatments appear effective in addressing psychotic-like experiences that can emerge in individuals with PTSD. Reductions in reported persecutory ideation and psychotic-like experiences during exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.
