The goal of this study is to investigate the performance merits and limitations of source imaging using intracranial EEG iEEG recordings and to compare its accuracy to the results of EEG source imaging. Accuracy in this study is measured both by determining the location and inter-nodal connectivity of underlying brain networks. Electromagnetic source imaging using simultaneous scalp EEG and intracranial EEG: An emerging tool for interacting with pathological brain networks.
