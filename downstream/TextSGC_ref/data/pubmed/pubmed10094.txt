Frequently the vineyards in the Douro Region present multiple grape varieties per parcel and even per row. An automatic algorithm for grape variety identification as an integrated software component was proposed that can be applied for example to a robotic harvesting system. However some issues and constraints in its development were highlighted namely the images captured in natural environment low volume of images high similarity of the images among different grape varieties leaf senescence and significant changes on the grapevine leaf and bunch images in the harvest seasons mainly due to adverse climatic conditions diseases and the presence of pesticides. In this paper the performance of the transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques based on AlexNet architecture were evaluated when applied to the identification of grape varieties. Two natural vineyard image datasets were captured in different geographical locations and harvest seasons. To generate different datasets for training and classification some image processing methods including a proposed four-corners-in-one image warping algorithm were used. The experimental results obtained from the application of an AlexNet-based transfer learning scheme and trained on the image dataset pre-processed through the four-corners-in-one method achieved a test accuracy score of 77.30%. Applying this classifier model an accuracy of 89.75% on the popular Flavia leaf dataset was reached. The results obtained by the proposed approach are promising and encouraging in helping Douro wine growers in the automatic task of identifying grape varieties.
