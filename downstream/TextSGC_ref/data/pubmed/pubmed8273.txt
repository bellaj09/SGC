Deep learning techniques have recently been successful in the classification of brain evoked responses for multiple applications including brain-machine interface. Single-trial detection in the electroencephalogram EEG of brain evoked responses like event-related potentials ERPs requires multiple processing stages in the spatial and temporal domains to extract high level features. Convolutional neural networks as a type of deep learning method have been used for EEG signal detection as the underlying structure of the EEG signal can be included in such system facilitating the learning step. The EEG signal is typically decomposed into 2 main dimensions: space and time. However the spatial dimension can be decomposed into 2 dimensions that better represent the relationships between the sensors that are involved in the classification. We propose to analyze the performance of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for the classification of ERPs with a dataset based on 64 EEG channels. We propose and compare 6 conv net architectures: 4 using 3D convolutions that vary in relation to the number of layers and feature maps and 2 using 2D convolutions. The results support the conclusion that 3D convolutions provide better performance than 2D convolutions for the binary classification of ERPs. 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Event-Related Potential detection.
