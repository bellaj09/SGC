The etiology of bulimic-type eating BTE disorders such as binge eating disorder BED and bulimia nervosa BN is still largely unknown. Brain networks subserving the processing of rewards emotions and cognitive control seem to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders. Therefore further investigations into the neurobiological underpinnings are needed to discern abnormal connectivity patterns in BTE disorders.
