The detection and removal of precancerous polyps via colonoscopy is the gold standard for the prevention of colon cancer. However the detection rate of adenomatous polyps can vary significantly among endoscopists. Here we show that a machine-learning algorithm can detect polyps in clinical colonoscopies in real time and with high sensitivity and specificity. We developed the deep-learning algorithm by using data from 1290 patients and validated it on newly collected 27113 colonoscopy images from 1138 patients with at least one detected polyp per-image-sensitivity 94.38%; per-image-specificity 95.92%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.984 on a public database of 612 polyp-containing images per-image-sensitivity 88.24% on 138 colonoscopy videos with histologically confirmed polyps per-image-sensitivity of 91.64%; per-polyp-sensitivity 100% and on 54 unaltered full-range colonoscopy videos without polyps per-image-specificity 95.40%. By using a multi-threaded processing system the algorithm can process at least 25 frames per second with a latency of 76.80\u2009\u20095.60\u2009ms in real-time video analysis. The software may aid endoscopists while performing colonoscopies and help assess differences in polyp and adenoma detection performance among endoscopists.
