"The aim of this review was to outline current forms of surgical simulation and methods of assessing technical skills using these forms of simulation. To review this subject a literature search was done using key words assessment simulation surgery technical skills and virtual reality. Simulation in surgery has several forms inorganic synthetic & computer and organic animal or cadaver. Surgical simulation is a mode of training which is promising and may be effective. Technical errors in the simulated environment do not have clinical consequences and does not have a morbidity or mortality. We must ensure that the competent skills learnt in the simulation environment are translated to the real environment. This can be achieved if the same assessment tools are used in both environments. Surgical training is entering a new era with increased scrutiny and an evolving work and training environment. We as surgical teachers must ensure that the surgeons of the future are as competent as or better than their predecessors using these new modes of training which we have access to."
