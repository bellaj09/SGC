"The results of medical procedures can often be difficult to translate into comprehensible and engaging information for patients. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the satisfaction and perceived value of a technology called HealthVoyager which creates a personalized virtual reality VR experience of a patients endoscopy or colonoscopy findings in comparison to the standard practice ie reviewing printed reports. The platform allows gastroenterologists to create a customized VR patient report to help translate medical knowledge and procedural information to the patient. Forty-one patients 17 HealthVoyager test; 24 standard practice control completed a self-report survey assessing their experience for receiving medical information. Results demonstrated that patients were significantly more satisfied in learning about their gastrointestinal condition and procedural results using HealthVoyager rather than with the standard of care. These results have implications for improving the knowledge translation of medical findings between healthcare providers and patients in various disease states and patient populations."
