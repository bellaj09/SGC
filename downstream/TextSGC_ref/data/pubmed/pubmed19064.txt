The brain injury that results in cerebral palsy CP may adversely affect fine motor control of the hand. The degradation of manual dexterity in the fingers profoundly impacts overall functionality of the upper limb yet research efforts to facilitate rehabilitation of finger individuation in children with CP have been limited. This study describes the development of an integrated hardware and software platform for training and evaluating finger individuation. A pneumatically actuated glove provides extension assistance or flexion resistance independently to each digit in concert with playing a virtual reality keyboard. This setup enables intensive and efficient practice of fine motor control of either or both hands. Bimanual training options range from mirror movements to fully independent motions and rhythms in each hand thereby enabling maintenance of the proper level of challenge. Additionally an instrument was created to provide assessment of individuated fingertip force generation in order to evaluate effectiveness of the training. Preliminary data were obtained from children both with and without CP using this tool. A Platform for Rehabilitation of Finger Individuation in Children with Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy.
