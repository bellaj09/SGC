Realistic rendering techniques of outdoor Augmented Reality AR has been an attractive topic since the last two decades considering the sizeable amount of publications in computer graphics. Realistic virtual objects in outdoor rendering AR systems require sophisticated effects such as: shadows daylight and interactions between sky colours and virtual as well as real objects. A few realistic rendering techniques have been designed to overcome this obstacle most of which are related to non real-time rendering. However the problem still remains especially in outdoor rendering. This paper proposed a much newer unique technique to achieve realistic real-time outdoor rendering while taking into account the interaction between sky colours and objects in AR systems with respect to shadows in any specific location date and time. This approach involves three main phases which cover different outdoor AR rendering requirements. Firstly sky colour was generated with respect to the position of the sun. Second step involves the shadow generation algorithm Z-Partitioning: Gaussian and Fog Shadow Maps Z-GaF Shadow Maps. Lastly a technique to integrate sky colours and shadows through its effects on virtual objects in the AR system is introduced. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique has significantly improved the realism of real-time outdoor AR rendering thus solving the problem of realistic AR systems.
