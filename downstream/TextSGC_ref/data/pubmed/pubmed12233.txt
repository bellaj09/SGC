Intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during cancer surgery1. The existing workflow for intraoperative diagnosis based on hematoxylin and eosin staining of processed tissue is time resource and labor intensive23. Moreover interpretation of intraoperative histologic images is dependent on a contracting unevenly distributed pathology workforce4. In the present study we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology SRH5-7 a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks CNNs to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically our CNNs trained on over 2.5 million SRH images predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150\u2009s an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques for example 20-30\u2009min2. In a multicenter prospective clinical trial n\u2009=\u2009278 we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images overall accuracy 94.6% versus 93.9%. Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images. These results demonstrate how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory.
