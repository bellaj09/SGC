The study of dental morphology is essential in terms of phylogeny. Advances in three-dimensional 3D measurement devices have enabled us to make 3D images of teeth without destruction of samples. However raw fundamental data on tooth shape requires complex equipment and techniques. An online database of 3D teeth models is therefore indispensable. We aimed to explore the basic methodology for constructing 3D teeth models with application for data sharing. Geometric information on the human permanent upper left incisor was obtained using micro-computed tomography micro-CT. Enamel dentine and pulp were segmented by thresholding of different gray-scale intensities. Segmented data were separately exported in STereo-Lithography Interface Format STL. STL data were converted to Wavefront OBJ OBJect as many 3D computer graphics programs support the Wavefront OBJ format. Data were also applied to Quick Time Virtual Reality QTVR format which allows the image to be viewed from any direction. In addition to Wavefront OBJ and QTVR data the original CT series were provided as 16-bit Tag Image File Format TIFF images on the website. In conclusion 3D teeth models were constructed in general-purpose data formats using micro-CT and commercially available programs. Teeth models that can be used widely would benefit all those who study dental morphology. Construction of three-dimensional tooth model by micro-computed tomography and application for data sharing.
