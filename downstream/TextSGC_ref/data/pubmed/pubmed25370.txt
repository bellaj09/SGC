"The potential benefit of technology to enhance recovery after central nervous system injuries is an area of increasing interest and exploration. The primary emphasis to date has been motor recovery/augmentation and communication. This paper introduces two original studies to demonstrate how advanced technology may be integrated into subacute rehabilitation. The first study addresses the feasibility of brain computer interface with patients on an inpatient spinal cord injury unit. The second study explores the validity of two virtual environments with acquired brain injury as part of an intensive outpatient neurorehabilitation program. These preliminary studies support the feasibility of advanced technologies in the subacute stage of neurorehabilitation. These modalities were well tolerated by participants and could be incorporated into patients inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation regimens without schedule disruptions. This paper expands the limited literature base regarding the use of advanced technologies in the early stages of recovery for neurorehabilitation populations and speaks favorably to the potential integration of brain computer interface and virtual reality technologies as part of a multidisciplinary treatment program."
