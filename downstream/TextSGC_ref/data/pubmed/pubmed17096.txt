Chronic kidney disease CKD is common. A small proportion of patients with CKD progress to require interventions which may include dialysis. Monitoring patients with CKD is supported by national guidelines. Monitoring systems to plan management of CKD vary in form. A novel monitoring system the virtual CKD clinic VC was introduced at our hospital. The VC is a non-face-to-face results review of patients with CKD. We found that the VC was an effective monitoring system. None of the patients from the VC required emergency dialysis suggesting robust surveillance. Survival was similar to patients with CKD discharged to primary care. A virtual clinic to improve long-term outcomes in chronic kidney disease.
