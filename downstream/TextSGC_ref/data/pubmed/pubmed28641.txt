Intracortical microelectrodes have shown great success in enabling locked-in patients to interact with computers robotic limbs and their own electrically driven limbs. The recent advances have inspired world-wide enthusiasm resulting in billions of dollars invested in federal and industrial sponsorships to understanding the brain for rehabilitative applications. Additionally private philanthropists have also demonstrated excitement in the field by investing in the use of brain interfacing technologies as a means to human augmentation. While the promise of incredible technologies is real caution must be taken as implications regarding optimal performance and unforeseen side effects following device implantation into the brain are not fully characterized. The current study is aimed to quantify any motor deficit caused by microelectrode implantation in the motor cortex of healthy rats compared to non-implanted controls. Following electrode insertion rats were tested on an open-field grid test to study gross motor function and a ladder test to study fine motor function. It was discovered that rats with chronically indwelling intracortical microelectrodes exhibited up to an incredible 527% increase in time to complete the fine motor task. This initial study defines the need for further and more robust behavioral testing of potential unintentional harm caused by microelectrode implantation.
