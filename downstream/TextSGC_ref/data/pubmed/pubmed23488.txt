Different imaging techniques can bring different information which will contribute to the final diagnosis and further management of the patients. Even from the time of Hippocrates palpation has been used in order to detect and characterize a body mass. The so-called virtual palpation has now become a reality due to elastography which is a recently developed technique. Elastography has already been proving its added value as a complementary imaging method helpful to better characterize and differentiate between benign and malignant masses. The current applications of elastography in lymph nodes LNs assessment by endoscopic ultrasonography will be further discussed in this paper with a review of the literature and future perspectives.
