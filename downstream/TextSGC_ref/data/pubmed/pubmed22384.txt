Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs serve as an integration tool between acquired brain signals and external devices. Precise classification of the acquired brain signals with the least misclassification error is an arduous task. Existing techniques for classification of multi-class motor imagery electroencephalogram EEG have low accuracy and are computationally inefficient. This paper introduces a classification algorithm which uses two frequency ranges mu and beta rythms for feature extraction using common spatial pattern CSP along with support vector machine SVM for classification. The technique uses only four frequency bands with no feature reduction and consequently less computational cost. The implementation of this algorithm on BCI competition III dataset IIIa resulted in the highest classification accuracy in comparison to existing algorithms. A mean accuracy of 85.5 for offline classification has been achieved using this technique. Classification of multi-class motor imagery EEG using four band common spatial pattern.
