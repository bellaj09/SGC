Cigarette smokers when confronted with cues associated with smoking evidence strong reactions including increased craving. These reactions have not been extensively studied in young adult smokers a group that research suggests may respond differently than adults or adolescent smokers. We used virtual reality which presents a complex array of smoking cues that may be particularly salient to young adult smokers and measured self-report of craving. Young adult smokers responded strongly to these cues and unlike adults did not return to a baseline of craving following cue exposure suggesting young adult smokers differ from other smokers in terms of cue responses. Assessing craving in young adult smokers using virtual reality.
