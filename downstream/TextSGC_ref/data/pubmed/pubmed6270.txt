The enteric nervous system has been studied thus far as an isolated unit. As researchers probe deeper into the function of this system it is evident that the neural network stretches beyond enteric neurons. It is formed by both intrinsic and extrinsic neurons innervating the gut enteric glia and innervated sensory epithelial cells such as enteroendocrine cells. This Review series summarizes recent knowledge on function and disease of nerves glia and sensory epithelial cells of the gut in eight distinctive articles. The timing and growing knowledge for each individual field calls for an appropriate term encompassing the entire system. We call this neuronal ensemble the "gut connectome" and summarize the work from a food sensory perspective. The gut connectome: making sense of what you eat.
