The objective of this study was to assess the outcome of operations on acetabular fractures from a developing country in the presence of locally available facilities. Sixty-three acetabular fractures were assessed at an average follow up of 52.94 months after operation. Twenty-six patients operated upon in the first three years and 37 operated thereafter were separately studied to discover the effect of the learning curve. Regarding the fractures 47 of 63 74.6% had excellent/good results Harris Hip Score>80. The complications included broken drill bit in eight patients 12.69% deep infection and heterotopic ossification in five patients 7.93% avascular necrosis and sciatic nerve palsy in two patients 3.17% and implant failure in one patient 1.58%. The results collected during the learning curve were inferior in the complex fractures p value<0.001. Complications were common in patients opting for local implants and in those operated after over 2 weeks delay.
