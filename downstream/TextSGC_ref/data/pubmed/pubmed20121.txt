Simulation-based training has been considered as the most promising curriculum for neurosurgical education to finally improve surgical skills with the greatest efficiency and safety. However most of the simulators including physical models and virtual reality systems are relatively expensive which limits their promotion. In this study the authors tried to develop a realistic low-cost and reusable simulator for endoscopic third ventriculostomy ETV and evaluate its validity. Design and validation of a 3D-printed simulator for endoscopic third ventriculostomy.
