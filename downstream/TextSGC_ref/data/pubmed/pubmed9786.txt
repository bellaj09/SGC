"Wilsons disease WD is an autosomal recessive disorder which is caused by poor excretion of copper in mammalian cells. In this review various issues such as effective characterization of ATP7B genes scope of gene network topology in genetic analysis pattern recognition using different computing approaches and fusion possibilities in imaging and genetic dataset are discussed vividly. We categorized this study into three major sections: A WD genetics B diagnosis guidelines and 3 treatment possibilities. We addressed the scope of advanced mathematical modelling paradigms for understanding common genetic sequences and dominating WD imaging biomarkers. We have also discussed current state-of-the-art software models for genetic sequencing. Further we hypothesized that involvement of machine and deep learning techniques in the context of WD genetics and image processing for precise classification of WD. These computing procedures signify changing roles of various data transformation techniques with respect to supervised and unsupervised learning models."
