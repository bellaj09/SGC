"Fear of flying FOF affects an estimated 10-25% of the population. Patients with FOF N = 49 were randomly assigned to virtual reality exposure VRE therapy standard exposure SE therapy or a wait-list WL control. Treatment consisted of 8 sessions over 6 weeks with 4 sessions of anxiety management training followed by either exposure to a virtual airplane VRE or exposure to an actual airplane at the airport SE. A posttreatment flight on a commercial airline measured participants willingness to fly and anxiety during flight immediately after treatment. The results indicated that VRE and SE were both superior to WL with no differences between VRE and SE. The gains observed in treatment were maintained at a 6-month follow up. By 6 months posttreatment 93% of VRE participants and 93% of SE participants had flown. VRE therapy and SE therapy for treatment of FOF were unequivocally supported in this controlled study." A controlled study of virtual reality exposure therapy for the fear of flying.
