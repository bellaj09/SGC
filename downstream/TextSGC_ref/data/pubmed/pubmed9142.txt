"In the treatment planning process of intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT a human planner operates the treatment planning system TPS to adjust treatment planning parameters for example dose volume histogram DVH constraints locations and weights to achieve a satisfactory plan for each patient. This process is usually time-consuming and the plan quality depends on planers experience and available planning time. In this study we proposed to model the behaviors of human planners in treatment planning by a deep reinforcement learning DRL-based virtual treatment planner network VTPN such that it can operate the TPS in a human-like manner for treatment planning."
