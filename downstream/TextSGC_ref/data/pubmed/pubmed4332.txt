Investigating functional brain networks and patterns using sparse representation of fMRI data has received significant interests in the neuroimaging community. It has been reported that sparse representation is effective in reconstructing concurrent and interactive functional brain networks. To date most of data-driven network reconstruction approaches rarely take consideration of anatomical structures which are the substrate of brain function. Furthermore it has been rarely explored whether structured sparse representation with anatomical guidance could facilitate functional networks reconstruction. To address this problem in this paper we propose to reconstruct brain networks utilizing the structure guided group sparse regression S2GSR in which 116 anatomical regions from the AAL template as prior knowledge are employed to guide the network reconstruction when performing sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI data. Specifically we extract fMRI signals from standard space aligned with the AAL template. Then by learning a global over-complete dictionary with the learned dictionary as a set of features regressors the group structured regression employs anatomical structures as group information to regress whole brain signals. Finally the decomposition coefficients matrix is mapped back to the brain volume to represent functional brain networks and patterns. We use the publicly available Human Connectome Project HCP Q1 dataset as the test bed and the experimental results indicate that the proposed anatomically guided structure sparse representation is effective in reconstructing concurrent functional brain networks.
