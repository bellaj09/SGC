"This paper presents the use of rendered visual cues as drop shadows and their impact on overall usability and accuracy of grasping interactions for monitor-based exocentric Augmented Reality AR. We report on two conditions; grasping with drop shadows and without drop shadows and analyse a total of 1620 grasps of two virtual object types cubes and spheres. We report on the accuracy of one grasp type the Medium Wrap grasp against Grasp Aperture GAp Grasp Displacement GDisp completion time and usability metrics from 30 participants. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the results is presented giving comparisons of the inclusion of drop shadows in AR grasping. Findings showed that the use of drop shadows increases usability of AR grasping while significantly decreasing task completion times. Furthermore drop shadows also significantly improve users depth estimation of AR object position. However this study also shows that using drop shadows does not improve users object size estimation which remains as a problematic element in grasping AR interaction literature."
