"Serious games and immersive virtual reality promote emotional engagement during learning tasks mostly by providing 1 skill-adapted challenges with performance feedback for trial and error learning and 2 enhanced presence further reactions to multimodal stimuli respectively. However it is still unclear how each of these two strategies independently influence emotional states to engage subjects to a task. This study assessed the dimensions of emotion valencearousal- dominance of 87 healthy subjects in a virtual game assigned to 2 groups that were exposed to a different set of 5 trials: Group A experienced game variations by virtual factors affecting users presence whereas group B experienced levels of difficulty affecting challenge. Emotional reports and 26 features extracted from physiological signals were statistically analyzed. Results showed that presence-based experimental conditions were able to modify the sense of arousal whereas valence and dominance responded to challenge variation i.e. were positively correlated with game score. Arousal is likely to increase with low sense of coexistence social presence and decrease with low scenario realism physical presence. Faster breathing and higher skin conductance SC were detected at high challenge whereas heart rate variability and SC increased with higher arousal. The evidence from this study suggests that both strategies can be used to separately influence dimensions of emotion pointing out the customization of presence-based factors as a promising method to adjust emotional engagement by impacting arousal. Further research should be undertaken to identify the independent effect of single presence factors on emotional states."
