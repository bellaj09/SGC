"The treatment of non union can be challenging with a variety of surgical options available to achieve bone consolidation. Robert Judet first described a method of osteo-periosteal decortication in 1963. He stated that by elevating cortical chips that remain attached to the periosteum and overlying soft tissues surrounding the site of non-union combined with mechanical support the bone consolidated. Despite excellent results presented in 2008 of 99% union rates with a mean delay of 8 months the technique has not yet become popularised. We aim to show that Judets method of decortication can achieve good results in the management of failure of union in a hospital other than Judets."
