Current EEG based brain computer interface BCI systems have achieved successful control in up to 3 dimensions; however the current paradigm may be unnatural for many rehabilitative and recreational applications. Therefore there is a great need to find motor imagination MI tasks that are realistic for output device control. In this paper we present our results on classifying hand gesture MI tasks including right hand flexion extension supination and pronation using a novel EEG inverse imaging approach. By using both temporal and spatial specificity in the source domain we were able to separate MI tasks with up to 95% accuracy for binary classification of any two tasks compared to a maximum of only 79% in the sensor domain. Discriminating hand gesture motor imagery tasks using cortical current density estimation.
