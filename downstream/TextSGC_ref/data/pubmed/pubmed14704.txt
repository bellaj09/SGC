Egocentric distance perception refers to the perception of distance from a target to a perceiver which is an important component of visual space perception. It is important to activities in virtual environments and influenced by several factors such as action capacities and visual cues. However few studies have investigated such aspects. Hence Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the effect of using experience and visual cues respectively of virtual arms on egocentric distance perception in near and far spaces at equal prolonged and shortened lengths of a virtual arm. Results revealed that using experience and visual cues of the virtual arm had a significant effect on egocentric distance perception when the length of virtual arm was equal to the real arm and prolonged but not when shortened. The egocentric distance perception on the conditions of having using experience and virtual arm was most precise. The findings provide implications for the design and implementation of virtual body self-representation in virtual environments. Influences of Experience and Visual Cues of Virtual Arm on Distance Perception.
