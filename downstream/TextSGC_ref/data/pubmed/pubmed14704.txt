Ensuring a healthier working environment is of utmost importance for companies and global health organizations. In manufacturing plants the ergonomic assessment of adopted working postures is indispensable to avoid risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This process receives high research interest and requires extracting plausible postural information as a preliminary step. This paper presents a semi-automated end-to-end ergonomic assessment system of adopted working postures. The proposed system analyzes the human posture holistically does not rely on any attached markers uses low cost depth technologies and leverages the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular we train a deep convolutional neural network to analyze the articulated posture and predict body joint angles from a single depth image. The proposed method relies on learning from synthetic training images to allow simulating several physical tasks different body shapes and rendering parameters and obtaining a highly generalizable model. The corresponding ground truth joint angles have been generated using a novel inverse kinematics modeling stage. We validated the proposed system in real environments and achieved a joint angle mean absolute error MAE of 3.191.57 and a rapid upper limb assessment RULA grand score prediction accuracy of 89% with Kappa index of 0.71 which means substantial agreement with reference scores. This work facilities evaluating several ergonomic assessment metrics as it provides direct access to necessary postural information overcoming the need for computationally expensive post-processing operations.
