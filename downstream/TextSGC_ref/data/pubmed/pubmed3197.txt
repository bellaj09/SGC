"Left-right asymmetries in brains are usually minor or cryptic. We report brain asymmetries in the tiny dorsal tubular nervous system of the ascidian tadpole larva Ciona intestinalis. Chordate in body plan and development the larva provides an outstanding example of brain asymmetry. Although early neural development is well studied detailed cellular organization of the swimming larvas CNS remains unreported. Using serial-section EM we document the synaptic connectome of the larvas 177 CNS neurons. These formed 6618 synapses including 1772 neuromuscular junctions augmented by 1206 gap junctions. Neurons are unipolar with at most a single dendrite and few synapses. Some synapses are unpolarised others form reciprocal or serial motifs; 922 were polyadic. Axo-axonal synapses predominate. Most neurons have ciliary organelles and many features lack structural specialization. Despite equal cell numbers on both sides neuron identities and pathways differ left/right. Brain vesicle asymmetries include a right ocellus and left coronet cells." The CNS connectome of a tadpole larva of Ciona intestinalis L. highlights sidedness in the brain of a chordate sibling.
