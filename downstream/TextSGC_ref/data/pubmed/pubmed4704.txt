"There is substantial interest in developing machine-based methods that reliably distinguish patients from healthy controls using high dimensional correlation maps known as functional connectomes FCs generated from resting state fMRI. To address the dimensionality of FCs the current body of work relies on feature selection techniques that are blind to the spatial structure of the data. In this paper we propose to use the fused Lasso regularized support vector machine to explicitly account for the 6-D structure of the FC defined by pairs of points in 3-D brain space. In order to solve the resulting nonsmooth and large-scale optimization problem we introduce a novel and scalable algorithm based on the alternating direction method. Experiments on real resting state scans show that our approach can recover results that are more neuroscientifically informative than previous methods."
