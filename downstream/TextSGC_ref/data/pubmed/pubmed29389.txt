Spatial organization of teta alfa beta-1 beta-2 in EEG potentials in humans who quickly an with a high accuracy performed task to learn and reproduce on PC monitor a definite sequence o accuracy performed task to learn and reproduce on PC monitor a definite sequence of circles wer studied. It was found that geometric images of coherent interrelations of teta alfa beta-1 beta-2 in EEG potentials were dynamically changed on the different stages of goal-directed the humans activity. The studies give the grounds to consider dynamically changed geometrical images of coherent links of different EEG potentials as an objective index of external projection of intracerebral processes of system architectonics of goal-directed behavior on brain cortex. Geometrical images of coherent interrelations of biopotentials of EEG different frequency ranges in dynamics of humans goal-directed behavior.
