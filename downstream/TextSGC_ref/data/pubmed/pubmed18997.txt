Virtual reality VR games has the potential to improve patient outcomes in stroke rehabilitation. However there is limited information on VR games as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy in improving upper limb function. This study involved 36 participants in both experimental n = 18 and control n = 18 groups with a mean age SD of 57 8.20 and 63 10.54 years respectively. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremities FMA-UE Wolf motor function test WMFT intrinsic motivation inventory IMI Lawton of instrumental activities of daily living IADL and stroke impact scale SIS assessed at pre-post intervention. The experimental group had 0.5 h of upper limb UL VR games with 1.5 h of standard physiotherapy and the control group received 2 h of standard physiotherapy. The intervention for both groups was performed once a week for eight consecutive weeks. The results showed a significant time-group interaction effect for IMI p = 0.001 Lawton IADL p = 0.01 and SIS domain of communication p = 0.03. A significant time effect was found in FMA-UE p = 0.001 WMFT p = 0.001 Lawton IADL p = 0.01 and SIS domains; strength ADL and stroke recovery p < 0.05. These results indicated an improvement in UL motor ability sensory function instrumental ADL and quality of life in both groups after eight weeks of intervention. However no significant p > 0.05 group effect on all the outcome measures was demonstrated. Thus replacing a portion of standard physiotherapy time with VR games was equally effective in improving UL function and general health compared to receiving only standard physiotherapy among stroke survivors.
