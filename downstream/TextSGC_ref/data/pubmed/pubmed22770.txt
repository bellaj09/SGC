A large body of research in the field of virtual reality is focused on making user interfaces more natural and intuitive by leveraging natural body movements to explore a virtual environment. For example head-tracked user interfaces allow users to naturally look around a virtual space by moving their head. However such approaches may not be appropriate for users with temporary or permanent limitations of their head movement. Augmented rotations in virtual reality for users with a reduced range of head movement.
