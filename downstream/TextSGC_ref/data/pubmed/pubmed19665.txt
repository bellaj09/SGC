In drug discovery structural knowledge of a target enables structure-based design approaches and thereby reduces the time and labor required to develop a therapy. Whilst molecular graphics frameworks coupled with computational analysis are now ubiquitous tools for the structural and computational biologist sharing the detailed visualization and derived structural information with non-expert users still presents a challenge. Here we describe an intuitive virtual world for viewing manipulating and modifying chemical and macromolecular structures in a fully immersive and collaborative 3D environment. By reducing the barriers to viewing and interacting with structural data structural analysis can be democratized to a general scientist which in turn fosters novel collaboration ideas and findings in structural biology and structure-based drug discovery. Development of a virtual reality platform for effective communication of structural data in drug discovery.
