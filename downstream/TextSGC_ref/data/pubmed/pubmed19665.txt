The multimedia and virtual reality projects performed at our laboratory during the last ten years can be grouped into the following groups: 1 tutorial and entertainment programs for handicapped children 2 rehabilitation programs for stroke patients and patients with phobias. We have developed multimedia software for handicapped children with various impairments: partial vision hearing difficulties locomotive difficulties mental retardation dyslexia etc. In the present paper we show the advantages of using multimedia software to develop mental skills in handicapped people and deal with the special needs of handicapped children. For the rehabilitation of stroke patients we have developed a computer-controlled method which enables - contrary to methods used internationally - not only the establishment of a diagnosis but also measurement of therapy effectiveness: 1 it enables us to produce a database of patients which contains not only their personal data but also test results their drawings and audio recordings 2 it is in itself an intensive therapeutic test and contains tutorial programs. We are currently collecting test results. We have also developed some virtual worlds for treating phobias: a virtual balcony and a ten-story building with an external glass elevator as well as an internal glass elevator in the virtual Atrium Hyatt hotel. We have developed a virtual environment for treating claustrophobia too: a closed lift and a room where the walls can move. For specific phobias fear of travelling we have modelled the underground railway system in Budapest. For autistic children we have developed virtual shopping software too. In this paper we present the advantages of virtual reality in the investigation evaluation and treatment of perception behaviour and neuropsychological disorders. Developing multimedia software and virtual reality worlds and their use in rehabilitation and psychology.
