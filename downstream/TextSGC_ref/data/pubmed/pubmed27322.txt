P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP approaches have been widely used for brain-computer interface BCI systems. However neither of these approaches can work for all subjects. Some groups have reported that a hybrid BCI that combines two or more approaches might provide BCI functionality to more users. Hybrid P300/SSVEP BCIs have only recently been developed and validated and very few avenues to improve performance have been explored. A new hybrid BCI paradigm based on P300 and SSVEP.
