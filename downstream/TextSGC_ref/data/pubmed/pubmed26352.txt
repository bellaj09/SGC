"A novel artefact removal algorithm is proposed for a self-paced hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system. This hybrid system combines a self-paced BCI with an eye-tracker to operate a virtual keyboard. To select a letter the user must gaze at the target for at least a specific period of time dwell time and then activate the BCI by performing a mental task. Unfortunately electroencephalogram EEG signals are often contaminated with artefacts. Artefacts change the quality of EEG signals and subsequently degrade the BCIs performance."
