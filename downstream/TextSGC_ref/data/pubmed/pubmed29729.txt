Asynchronous brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on electroencephalography EEG generally suffer from poor performance in terms of classification accuracy and false-positive rate FPR. Thus BCI toggle switches based on electrooculogram EOG signals were developed to toggle on/off synchronous BCI systems. The conventional BCI toggle switches exhibit fast responses with high accuracy; however they have a high FPR or cannot be applied to patients with oculomotor impairments. To circumvent these issues we developed a novel BCI toggle switch that users can employ to toggle on or off synchronous BCIs by holding their breath for a few seconds. Two states-normal breath and breath holding-were classified using a linear discriminant analysis with features extracted from the respiration-modulated photoplethysmography PPG signals. A real-time BCI toggle switch was implemented with calibration data trained with only 1-min PPG data. We evaluated the performance of our PPG switch by combining it with a steady-state visual evoked potential-based BCI system that was designed to control four external devices with regard to the true-positive rate and FPR. The parameters of the PPG switch were optimized through an offline experiment with five subjects and the performance of the switch system was evaluated in an online experiment with seven subjects. All the participants successfully turned on the BCI by holding their breath for approximately 10 s 100% accuracy and the switch system exhibited a very low FPR of 0.02 false operations per minute which is the lowest FPR reported thus far. All participants could successfully control external devices in the synchronous BCI mode. Our results demonstrated that the proposed PPG-based BCI toggle switch can be used to implement practical BCIs.
