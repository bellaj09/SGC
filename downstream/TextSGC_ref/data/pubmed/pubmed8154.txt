"Unmanaged long-term mental stress in the workplace can lead to serious health problems and reduced productivity. To prevent this it is important to recognize and relieve mental stress in a timely manner. Here we propose a novel stress detection algorithm based on end-to-end deep learning using multiple physiological signals such as electrocardiogram ECG and respiration RESP signal. To mimic workplace stress in our experiments we used Stroop and math tasks as stressors with each stressor being followed by a relaxation task. Herein we recruited 18 subjects and measured both ECG and RESP signals using Zephyr BioHarness 3.0. After five-fold cross validation the proposed network performed well with an average accuracy of 83.9% an average F1 score of 0.81 and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve AUC of 0.92 demonstrating its superiority over conventional machine learning models. Furthermore by visualizing the activation of the trained networks neurons we found that they were activated by specific ECG and RESP patterns. In conclusion we successfully validated the feasibility of end-to-end deep learning using multiple physiological signals for recognition of mental stress in the workplace. We believe that this is a promising approach that will help to improve the quality of life of people suffering from long-term work-related mental stress."
