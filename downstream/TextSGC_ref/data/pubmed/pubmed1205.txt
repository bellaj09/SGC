The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between dynamic changes in the nasopharyngeal viral load of patients infected with the new coronavirus causing pneumonia and lymphocyte count disease severity. Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab sample CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts coagulation system factor levels myocardial injury indexes and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups p\u2009<\u20090.001 as did differences in interleukin IL-2R IL-6 and IL-8 levels p\u2009=\u20090.022 0.026 and 0.012 respectively. Moreover there were significant differences in prothrombin time D-dimer and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group p\u2009=\u20090.029 0.006 and <0.001 respectively and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.007 respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count CD4+ T lymphocyte count and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated p\u2009<\u20090.001. SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R prothrombin time lactate dehydrogenase and hypersensitive troponin T p\u2009=\u20090.002 p\u2009=\u20090.009 and p\u2009<\u20090.001 respectively. In addition the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group Z\u2009=\u2009-6.713 p\u2009<\u20090.001. In conclusion relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher the lymphocyte count was lower organ damage was greater and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.
