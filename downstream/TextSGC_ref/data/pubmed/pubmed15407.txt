Artificial intelligence is likely to perform several roles currently performed by humans and the adoption of artificial intelligence-based medicine in gastroenterology practice is expected in the near future. Medical image-based diagnoses such as pathology radiology and endoscopy are expected to be the first in the medical field to be affected by artificial intelligence. A convolutional neural network a kind of deep-learning method with multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal preprocessing was recently reported as being highly beneficial in the field of endoscopy including esophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy. A convolutional neural network-based diagnostic program was challenged to recognize anatomical locations in esophagogastroduodenoscopy images Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer for esophagogastroduodenoscopy; to detect and classify colorectal polyps; to recognize celiac disease and hookworm; and to perform small intestine motility characterization of capsule endoscopy images. Artificial intelligence is expected to help endoscopists provide a more accurate diagnosis by automatically detecting and classifying lesions; therefore it is essential that endoscopists focus on this novel technology. In this review we describe the effects of artificial intelligence on gastroenterology with a special focus on automatic diagnosis based on endoscopic findings. Overview of Deep Learning in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
