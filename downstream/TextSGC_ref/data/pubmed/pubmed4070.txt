"Because of the unique position of the topologically central role of densely interconnected brain hubs our study aimed to investigate whether these regions and their related connections would be particularly vulnerable to migraine. In our study we explored the rich club structure and its role in global functional dynamics in 30 patients with migraine without aura and 30 healthy controls. DTI and resting fMRI were used to construct structural connectivity SC and functional connectivity FC networks. An independent replication data set of 26 patients and 26 controls was included to replicate and validate significant findings. As compared with the controls the structural networks of patients exhibited altered rich club organization with higher level of feeder connection density abnormal small-world organization with increased global efficiency and decreased strength of SC-FC coupling. As these abnormal topological properties and headache attack duration exhibited a significant association with increased density of feeder connections our results indicated that migraine may be characterized by a selective alteration of the structural connectivity of the rich club regions tending to have higher bridgeness with non-rich club regions which may increase the integration among pain-related brain circuits with more excitability but less inhibition for the modulation of migraine." Abnormal rich club organization and impaired correlation between structural and functional connectivity in migraine sufferers.
