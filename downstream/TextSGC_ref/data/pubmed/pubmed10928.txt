In most patients presenting with respiratory symptoms the findings of chest radiography play a key role in the diagnosis management and follow-up of the disease. Consolidation is a common term in radiology which indicates focally increased lung density. When the alveolar structures become filled with pus fluid blood cells or protein subsequent to a pulmonary pathological process it may result in different types of lung opacity in chest radiograph. This study aims at detecting consolidations in chest x-ray radiographs with a certain precision using artificial intelligence and especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to assist radiologist for better diagnosis. Deep learning reusable and problem-based architectures for detection of consolidation on chest X-ray images.
