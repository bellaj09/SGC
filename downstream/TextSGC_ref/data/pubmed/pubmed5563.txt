Recently effort has been made to apply deep learning to the detection of mesh saliency. However one major barrier is to collect a large amount of vertex-level annotation as saliency ground truth for training the neural networks. Quite a few pilot studies showed that this task is quite difficult. In this work we solve this problem by developing a novel network trained in a weakly supervised manner. The training is end-to-end and does not require any saliency ground truth but only the class membership of meshes. Our Classification-for-Saliency CNN CfS-CNN employs a multi-view setup and contains a newly designed two-channel structure which integrates view-based features of both classification and saliency. It essentially transfers knowledge from 3D object classification to mesh saliency. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods according to extensive experimental results. Also the CfS-CNN can be directly used for scene saliency. We showcase two novel applications based on scene saliency to demonstrate its utility. Mesh Saliency via Weakly Supervised Classification-for-Saliency CNN.
