Driving while under the influence of alcohol is a major public health problem whose neural basis is not well understood. In a recently published functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study Meda et al. 2009 our group identified 5 independent critical driving-associated brain circuits whose inter-regional connectivity was disrupted by alcohol intoxication. However the functional connectivity between these circuits has not yet been explored in order to determine how these networks communicate with each other during sober and alcohol-intoxicated states. Disruptions in functional network connectivity during alcohol intoxicated driving.
