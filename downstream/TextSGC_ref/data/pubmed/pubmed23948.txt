Telesurgery systems have long been suffering variable and unpredictable Internet commutation time delay operation fatigue and other drawbacks. Based on virtual reality technology a teleprogramming scheme combined with semi-autonomous control is introduced to guarantee the robustness and efficiency of teleoperation of HIT-RAOS a robot-assisted orthopedic surgery system. In this system without considering time delay the operator can just interact with virtual environment which provides real-time 3D vision stereophonic sound and tactile and force feedback imitated by a parallel master manipulator. And several tasks can be managed simultaneously via semi-autonomous control. Finally the method is experimentally demonstrated on an experiment of locking of intramedullary nails and is shown to effectively provide stability and performances.
