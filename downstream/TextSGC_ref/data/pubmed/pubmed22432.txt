"Gravity plays a role in many different levels of human motor behavior. It dictates the laws of motion of our body and limbs as well as of the objects in the external world with which we wish to interact. The dynamic interaction of our body with the world is molded within gravitys constraints. The role played by gravity in the perception of visual stimuli and the elaboration of human movement is an active research theme in the field of Neurophysiology. Conditions of microgravity coupled with techniques from the world of virtual reality provide a unique opportunity to address these questions concerning the function of the human sensorimotor system. The ability to measure movements of the head and to update in real time the visual scene presented to the subject based on these measurements is a key element in producing a realistic virtual environment. A variety of head-tracking hardware exists on the market today but none seem particularly well suited to the constraints of working with a space station environment. Nor can any of the existing commercial systems meet the more stringent requirements for physiological experimentation high accuracy high resolution low jitter low lag in a wireless configuration. To this end we have developed and tested a hybrid opto-inertial 6 degree-of-freedom tracker based on existing inertial technology. To confirm that the inertial components and algorithms will function properly this system was tested in the microgravity conditions of parabolic flight. Here we present the design goals of this tracker the system configuration and the results of 0g and 1g testing." A 6 D.O.F. opto-inertial tracker for virtual reality experiments in microgravity.
