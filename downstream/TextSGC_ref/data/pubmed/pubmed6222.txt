Information visualization has great potential to make sense of the increasing amount of data generated by complex machine-learning algorithms. We design a set of visualizations for a new deep-learning algorithm called FaceLift goodcitylife.org/facelift. This algorithm is able to generate a beautified version of a given urban image such as from Google Street View and our visualizations compare pairs of original and beautified images. With those visualizations we aim at helping practitioners understand what happened during the algorithmic beautification without requiring them to be machine-learning experts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our visualizations to do just that with a survey among practitioners. From the survey results we derive general design guidelines on how information visualization makes complex machine-learning algorithms more understandable to a general audience.
