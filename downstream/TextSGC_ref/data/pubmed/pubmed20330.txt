The introduction of virtual reality techniques in medicine opens up new possibilities for the planning of interventions. The presented software system for virtual operation planning in orthopaedic surgery VIRTOPS enables the virtual preoperative 3D planning and simulation of pelvis and hip operations. It is used to plan operations of bone tumours with endoprosthetic reconstruction of the hip based on multimodal image information. The operation and the endosprothetic reconstruction of the pelvis are simulated using virtual reality techniques. Stereoscopic visualisation techniques and 3D input devices support the 3D interaction with the virtual 3D models. The main task of the preoperative planning process is the individual design of an anatomically adaptable modular prosthesis. The placement and the design of the endoprosthesis are supported by different functions and visualisation techniques. The resulting 3D images and movies can be used for the documentation of the operation planning procedure as well as for the preoperative information of the patient.
