"The aim of the study was to develop and assess the performance of a video-based augmented reality system combining preoperative computed tomography CT and real-time microscopic video as the first crucial step to keyhole middle ear procedures through a tympanic membrane puncture. Six different artificial human temporal bones were included in this prospective study. Six stainless steel fiducial markers were glued on the periphery of the eardrum and a high-resolution CT-scan of the temporal bone was obtained. Virtual endoscopy of the middle ear based on this CT-scan was conducted on Osirix software. Virtual endoscopy image was registered to the microscope-based video of the intact tympanic membrane based on fiducial markers and a homography transformation was applied during microscope movements. These movements were tracked using Speeded-Up Robust Features SURF method. Simultaneously a micro-surgical instrument was identified and tracked using a Kalman filter. The 3D position of the instrument was extracted by solving a three-point perspective framework. For evaluation the instrument was introduced through the tympanic membrane and ink droplets were injected on three middle ear structures. An average initial registration accuracy of 0.21\u2009\u20090.10\u2009mm n\u2009=\u20093 was achieved with a slow propagation error during tracking 0.04\u2009\u20090.07\u2009mm. The estimated surgical instrument tip position error was 0.33\u2009\u20090.22\u2009mm. The target structures localization accuracy was 0.52\u2009\u20090.15\u2009mm. The submillimetric accuracy of our system without tracker is compatible with ear surgery."
