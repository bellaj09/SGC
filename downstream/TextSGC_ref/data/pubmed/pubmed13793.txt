In the Weaver mutant mouse wv/wv an animal model for hereditary cerebellar ataxia electrophysiological experiments have revealed a disorganized output of cerebellar Purkinje cells the latter using GABA as an inhibitory transmitter which by a cascade of mechanisms was thought to be the cause of the poor motor abilities. In Purkinje cell degeneration mice pcd/pcd lacking nearly all Purkinje cells and displaying milder motor deficiencies than wv in comparison to wild-type mice a strong increase in parvalbumin- and co-localized with parvalbumin glycine-immunopositive somata in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei has recently been found. It was therefore intriguing to investigate whether motor performance in weaver mutants could be ameliorated by applying cerebellar lesions to eliminate the faulty output and to look for a change in transmitter weighting indicated by a strong increase in parvalbumin-positive somata in areas the respective target areas which were formerly devoid of it. Ten Weaver mutants were subjected to cerebellar lesions. After removal of the vermis a total abolition of tremor a definite improvement in the balance of affected body parts an increase in locomotor activity when tested in an open-field matrix and a strong increase in parvalbumin expression in Weaver mutant deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei in comparison to wild-types have indeed been found. Increase in motor activity or explorative behaviour has been placed in relation to learning mechanisms. The increase in parvalbumin expression and the observed improvement in motor abilities and mechanisms probably related to learning underline the hypothesis that any change in the physiological equilibrium of the brain function by removal of input or output related to an assembly of nerve cells leads to a cascade of changes at the transmitter and neuronal level in near or distant connected brain structures.
