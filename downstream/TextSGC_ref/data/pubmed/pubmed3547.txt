Attention allows our brain to focus its limited resources on a given task. It does so by selective modulation of neural activity and of functional connectivity FC across brain-wide networks. While there is extensive literature on activity changes surprisingly few studies examined brain-wide FC modulations that can be cleanly attributed to attention compared to matched visual processing. In contrast to prior approaches we used an ultra-long trial design that avoided transients from trial onsets included slow fluctuations <0.1Hz that carry important information on FC and allowed for frequency-segregated analyses. We found that FC derived from long blocks had a nearly two-fold higher gain compared to FC derived from traditional short block designs. Second attention enhanced intrinsic negative or positive correlations across networks such as between the default-mode network DMN the dorsal attention network DAN and the visual system VIS. In contrast attention de-correlated the intrinsically correlated visual regions. Third the de-correlation within VIS was driven primarily by high frequencies whereas the increase in DAN-VIS predominantly by low frequencies. These results pinpoint two fundamentally distinct effects of attention on connectivity. Information flow increases between distinct large-scale networks and de-correlation within sensory cortex indicates decreased redundancy. Attention reorganizes connectivity across networks in a frequency specific manner.
