Deep hypothermia cryoanesthesia is often used as general anesthesia during surgery in neonatal rodents. Neonatal cryoanesthesia has been used recently to generate somatic brain transgenic SBT mouse models via intracerebral ventricular injection of rAAV vectors into both non-transgenic mice and numerous transgenic mouse models. Since the evaluation of cognition is one of the main experimental endpoints in many of these studies we examined the consequences of brief neonatal cryoanesthesia on the physical development and mnemonic function of adult mice. Two groups of 129FVBF1 pups from reciprocal breeding crosses underwent cryoanesthesia for 6 min Cryo6 or 12 min Cryo12 respectively within the first hours <12h of postnatal life. A group of pups separated from the nest and kept in ambient temperature of 33 C for 6 min served as a control. Our results revealed that lowering the temperature of pups to ~8 C Cryo6 or ~5 C Cryo12 did not affect their body weight at pre-weaning stage and in the adulthood. The evaluation of cognitive function in adult mice revealed strong and comparable to control spatial reference and context and tone fear memories of neonatally cryoanesthetized mice. Also the experimental and control groups had comparable brain weight at the end of the study. Our results demonstrate that neonatal cryoanesthesia lasting up to 12 min has no adverse effects on the body weight of mice during development and on their cognition in the adulthood.
