"The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of Internet users of a physics virtual laboratory Demolab in Taiwan. Learners perceptions of Internet-based learning environments were explored and the role of gender was examined by using preferred and actual forms of a revised Constructivist Internet-based Learning Environment Survey CILES. The students expressed a clear gap between ideal and reality and they showed higher preferences for many features of constructivist Internet-based learning environments than for features they had actually learned in Demolab. The results further suggested that male users prefer to be involved in the process of discussion and to show critical judgments. In addition male users indicated they enjoyed the process of negotiation and discussion with others and were able to engage in reflective thoughts while learning in Demolab. In light of these findings male users seemed to demonstrate better adaptability to the constructivist Internet-based learning approach than female users did. Although this study indicated certain differences between males and females in their responses to Internet-based learning environments they also shared numerous similarities. A well-established constructivist Internet-based learning environment may encourage more female learners to participate in the science community."
