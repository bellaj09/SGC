Plane Wave Imaging is a fast imaging method used in ultrasound which allows a high frame rate but with compromised image quality when a single wave is used. In this work a learning-based approach was used to obtain improved image quality. The entire process of beamforming and speckle reduction was embedded in a single deep convolutional network and trained with two types of simulated data. The network architecture was designed based on traditional physical considerations of the ultrasonic image formation pipe. As such it includes beamforming with spatial matched filters envelope detection and a speckle reduction stage done in log-signal representation with all stages containing trainable parameters. The approach was tested on the publicly available PICMUS datasets achieving axial and lateral full-width-half-maximum FWHM resolution values of 0.22\xa0mm and 0.35\xa0mm respectively and a Contrast to Noise Ratio CNR metric of 16.75 on the experimental datasets.
