Here the authors summarize the current and swiftly changing state of digital mental health. Specifically they highlight the current unmet needs that emerging technologies may be able to address; summarize what digital health can offer for assessment treatment and care integration; and describe some of the challenges and some new directions for innovations in this field. The review concludes with guidance for clinicians to integrate digital technologies into their work and to provide responsible and useful advice to their patients.
