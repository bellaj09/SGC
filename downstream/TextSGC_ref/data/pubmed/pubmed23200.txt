Clinical procedures have traditionally been taught at the bedside in the morgue and in the animal lab. Augmented Reality AR technology the merging of virtual reality and real objects or patients provides a new method for teaching clinical and surgical procedures. Improved patient safety is a major advantage. We describe a system which employs AR technology to teach endotracheal intubation using the Visible Human datasets as well as MR images from live patient volunteers. Augmented Reality for teaching endotracheal intubation: MR imaging to create anatomically correct models.
