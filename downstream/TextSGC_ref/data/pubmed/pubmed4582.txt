Motor function and recovery after stroke likely rely directly on the residual anatomical connections in the brain and its resting-state functional connectivity. Both structural and functional properties of cortical networks after stroke are revealed using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging MRI. Specifically functional connectivity MRI fcMRI can extract functional networks of the brain at rest while structural connectivity can be estimated from white matter fiber orientations measured with high angular-resolution diffusion imaging HARDI. A model that marries these two techniques may be the key to understanding functional recovery after stroke. In this study a novel set of voxel-level measures of structurofunctional correlations SFC was developed and tested in a group of chronic stroke subjects. Structurofunctional resting-state networks correlate with motor function in chronic stroke.
