Understanding the fundamental alterations in brain functioning that lead to psychotic disorders remains a major challenge in clinical neuroscience. In particular it is unknown whether any state-independent biomarkers can potentially predict the onset of psychosis and distinguish patients from healthy controls regardless of paradigm. Here using multi-paradigm fMRI data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study consortium we show that individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis display an intrinsic "trait-like" abnormality in brain architecture characterized as increased connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuitry a pattern that is significantly more pronounced among converters compared with non-converters. This alteration is significantly correlated with disorganization symptoms and predictive of time to conversion to psychosis. Moreover using an independent clinical sample we demonstrate that this hyperconnectivity pattern is reliably detected and specifically present in patients with schizophrenia. These findings implicate cerebello-thalamo-cortical hyperconnectivity as a robust state-independent neural signature for psychosis prediction and characterization.
