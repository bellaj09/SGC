Brain computer interface systems BCI translate the intentions of patients affected with locked-in syndrome through the EEG signal characteristics which are converted into commands used to control external devices. One of the strategies used is to decode the motor imagery of the subject which can modify the neuronal activity in the sensory-motor areas in a similar way to which it is observed in real movement. The present study shows the activation patterns that are registered in motor and motor imagery tasks of right and left hand movement in a sample of young healthy subjects of Mexican nationality. By means of frequency analysis it was possible to determine the difference conditions of motor imagery and movement. Using U Mann- Whitney tests differences with statistical significance p < 0.05 where obtained in the EEG channels C3 Cz C4 T3 and P3 in the mu and beta rhythms for subjects with similar characteristics age gender and education. With these results it would be possible to define a classifier or decoder by gender that improves the performance rate and diminishes the training time with the goal of designing a functional BCI system that can be transferred from the laboratory to the clinical application in patients with motor disabilities. Characterization of electrical brain activity related to hand motor imagery in healthy subjects.
