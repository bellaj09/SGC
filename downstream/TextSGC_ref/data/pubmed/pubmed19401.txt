In this paper a photosensor-based latency measurement system for head-mounted displays HMDs is proposed. The motion-to-photon latency is the greatest reason for motion sickness and dizziness felt by users when wearing an HMD system. Therefore a measurement system is required to accurately measure and analyze the latency to reduce these problems. The existing measurement system does not consider the actual physical movement in humans and its accuracy is also very low. However the proposed system considers the physical head movement and is highly accurate. Specifically it consists of a head position model-based rotary platform pixel luminance change detector and signal analysis and calculation modules. Using these modules the proposed system can exactly measure the latency which is the time difference between the physical movement for a user and the luminance change of an output image. In the experiment using a commercial HMD the latency was measured to be up to 47.05 ms. In addition the measured latency increased up to 381.17 ms when increasing the rendering workload in the HMD.
