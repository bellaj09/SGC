The goal of a Brain-Computer Interface BCI is to control a computer by pure brain activity. Recently BCIs based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials c-VEPs have shown great potential to establish high-performance communication. In this paper we present a c-VEP BCI that uses online adaptation of the classifier to reduce calibration time and increase performance. We compare two different approaches for online adaptation of the system: an unsupervised method and a method that uses the detection of error-related potentials. Both approaches were tested in an online study in which an average accuracy of 96% was achieved with adaptation based on error-related potentials. This accuracy corresponds to an average information transfer rate of 144 bit/min which is the highest bitrate reported so far for a non-invasive BCI. In a free-spelling mode the subjects were able to write with an average of 21.3 error-free letters per minute which shows the feasibility of the BCI system in a normal-use scenario. In addition we show that a calibration of the BCI system solely based on the detection of error-related potentials is possible without knowing the true class labels.
