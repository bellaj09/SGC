Theory suggests that information processing during joint attention may be atypical in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD. This hypothesis was tested in a study of school-aged children with higher functioning ASD and groups of children with symptoms of ADHD or typical development. The results indicated that the control groups displayed significantly better recognition memory for pictures studied in an initiating joint attention IJA rather than responding to joint attention RJA condition. This effect was not evident in the ASD group. The ASD group also recognized fewer pictures from the IJA condition than controls but not the RJA condition. Atypical information processing may be a marker of the continued effects of joint attention disturbance in school aged children with ASD.
