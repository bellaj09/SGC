Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are on the horizon for clinical neurosurgery. Electrocorticography-based platforms are less invasive than implanted microelectrodes however the latter are unmatched in their ability to achieve fine motor control of a robotic prosthesis capable of natural human behaviors. These technologies will be crucial to restoring neural function to a large population of patients with severe neurologic impairment - including those with spinal cord injury stroke limb amputation and disabling neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On the opposite end of the spectrum are neural enhancement technologies for specialized applications such as combat. An ongoing ethical dialogue is imminent as we prepare for BMI platforms to enter the neurosurgical realm of clinical management. Neurosurgery and the dawning age of Brain-Machine Interfaces.
