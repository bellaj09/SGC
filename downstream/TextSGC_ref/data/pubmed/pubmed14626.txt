Human embryology is a core subject for medicine and current research. While animal models of development now have significant online resources available the vast majority of human embryonic material is locked up in historic collections. When accessed today these collections are still contributing to our understanding of human development. This paper describes two online resources for studying human development that are unlocking these invaluable collections and providing related human developmental resources. The first of these is the online Embryology website http://tiny.cc/Embryo that links the human developmental timeline to historic and current research findings. Secondly is the Digital Embryology Consortium https://human-embryology.org an international research partnership to digitise preserve and make the major embryology histological collections available for researchers. By making this histological material more widely available to researchers with new methods of analysis a better understanding of human development can be reached. This also opens the opportunity for new 3D reconstruction and virtual reality representation of these embryos. Two Web Resources Linking Major Human Embryology Collections Worldwide.
