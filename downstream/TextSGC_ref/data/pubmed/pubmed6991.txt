SNP-SNP interactions have been receiving increasing attention in understanding the mechanism underlying susceptibility to complex diseases. Though many works have been done for the detection of SNP-SNP interactions the algorithmic development is still ongoing. In this study an improved opposition-based learning particle swarm optimization IOBLPSO is proposed for the detection of SNP-SNP interactions. Highlights of IOBLPSO are the introduction of three strategies namely opposition-based learning dynamic inertia weight and a postprocedure. Opposition-based learning not only enhances the global explorative ability but also avoids premature convergence. Dynamic inertia weight allows particles to cover a wider search space when the considered SNP is likely to be a random one and converges on promising regions of the search space while capturing a highly suspected SNP. The postprocedure is used to carry out a deep search in highly suspected SNP sets. Experiments of IOBLPSO are performed on both simulation data sets and a real data set of age-related macular degeneration results of which demonstrate that IOBLPSO is promising in detecting SNP-SNP interactions. IOBLPSO might be an alternative to existing methods for detecting SNP-SNP interactions. An Improved Opposition-Based Learning Particle Swarm Optimization for the Detection of SNP-SNP Interactions.
