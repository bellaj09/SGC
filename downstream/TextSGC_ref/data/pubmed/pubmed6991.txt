Deep Reinforcement Learning RL demonstrates excellent performance on tasks that can be solved by trained policy. It plays a dominant role among cutting-edge machine learning approaches using multi-layer Neural networks NNs. At the same time Deep RL suffers from high sensitivity to noisy incomplete and misleading input data. Following biological intuition we involve Spiking Neural Networks SNNs to address some deficiencies of deep RL solutions. Previous studies in image classification domain demonstrated that standard NNs with ReLU nonlinearity trained using supervised learning can be converted to SNNs with negligible deterioration in performance. In this paper we extend those conversion results to the domain of Q-Learning NNs trained using RL. We provide a proof of principle of the conversion of standard NN to SNN. In addition we show that the SNN has improved robustness to occlusion in the input image. Finally we introduce results with converting full-scale Deep Q-network to SNN paving the way for future research to robust Deep RL applications.
