"Animal models of Alzheimers disease AD are essential to understanding the disease progression and to development of early biomarkers. Because AD has been described as a disconnection syndrome magnetic resonance imaging MRI-based connectomics provides a highly translational approach to characterizing the disruption in connectivity associated with the disease. In this study a transgenic rat model of AD TgF344-AD was analyzed to describe both cognitive performance and brain connectivity at an early stage 5\xa0months of age before a significant concentration of -amyloid plaques is present."
