Simulation has a long history in medical and health science training and education. The literature describing this history is extensive. The role simulation plays in many health disciplines has evolved as has the focus of the literature around it. The Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training VERT system is a relative newcomer to radiation therapy education and similar to the literature around radiation therapy RT education is still in its infancy. This narrative review sets the scene of simulation-based education within the health sciences and considers the lessons learned from published work on VERT to date. The evidence suggests that future inquiry involving VERT should explore different ways in which VERT can be used to contribute to the skillset required by the radiation therapist of tomorrow. Simulation-based education: A narrative review of the use of VERT in radiation therapy education.
