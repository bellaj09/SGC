"The superior soft-tissue contrast achieved using magnetic resonance imaging MRI compared to x-ray computed tomography CT has led to the popularization of MRI-guided radiation therapy MR-IGRT especially in recent years with the advent of first and second generation MRI-based therapy delivery systems for MR-IGRT. The expanding use of these systems is driving interest in MRI-only RT workflows in which MRI is the sole imaging modality used for treatment planning and dose calculations. To enable such a workflow synthetic CT sCT data must be generated based on a patients MRI data so that dose calculations may be performed using the electron density information derived from CT images. In this study we propose a novel deep spatial pyramid convolutional framework for the MRI-to-CT image-to-image translation task and compare its performance to the well established U-Net architecture in a generative adversarial network GAN framework."
