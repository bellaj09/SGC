Eye motion-based human-machine interfaces are used to provide a means of communication for those who can move nothing but their eyes because of injury or disease. To detect eye motions electrooculography EOG is used. For efficient communication the input speed is critical. However it is difficult for conventional EOG recognition methods to accurately recognize fast sequentially input eye motions because adjacent eye motions influence each other. In this paper we propose a context-dependent hidden Markov model- HMM- based EOG modeling approach that uses separate models for identical eye motions with different contexts. Because the influence of adjacent eye motions is explicitly modeled higher recognition accuracy is achieved. Additionally we propose a method of user adaptation based on a user-independent EOG model to investigate the trade-off between recognition accuracy and the amount of user-dependent data required for HMM training. Experimental results show that when the proposed context-dependent HMMs are used the character error rate CER is significantly reduced compared with the conventional baseline under user-dependent conditions from 36.0 to 1.3%. Although the CER increases again to 17.3% when the context-dependent but user-independent HMMs are used it can be reduced to 7.3% by applying the proposed user adaptation method.
