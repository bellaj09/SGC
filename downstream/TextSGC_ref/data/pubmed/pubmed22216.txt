Acquired brain injury ABI is associated with significant cognitive behavioural psychological and physical impairment. Hence it has been important to leverage assessment approaches in rehabilitation by using current and emerging technologies including virtual reality VR. A number of VR rehabilitation programmes have been designed in recent years mainly to improve upper limb function. However before this technology gains widespread use evaluation of the scientific evidence supporting VR-assisted rehabilitation is needed. The present review aimed to assess the rationale design and methodology of research investigating the clinical impact of VR on ABI upper-limb rehabilitation. Virtual reality in acquired brain injury upper limb rehabilitation: evidence-based evaluation of clinical research.
