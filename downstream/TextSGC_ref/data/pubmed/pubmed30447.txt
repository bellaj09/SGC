In this study we present an innovative electrode system for many different applications in the field of cardiovascular diseases. It is a combination of intelligent communicating dry-surface electrodes which are able to interact with different sensors especially with an invasive ultra flexible electrode-system. Dry and smart surface electrodes which can be integrated in textiles and therefore such electrode are almost "invisible" for patients are used for ECG acquisition and can be integrated in a communication network. In combination with a pulse oximeter or impedance spectroscopy the pulse transit time PTT can be calculated. Additionally with invasive electrodes the nervous vagus can be stimulated and therefore cardiovascular functions can be controlled. The association of an implanted stimulator with an interacting and smart monitoring system results into a cardiovascular controlling. In this work we will focus on the feasibility suitability fabrication and characterization of invasive and dry-surface electrode systems as a basic element and foundation for cardiovascular regulation in a closed loop. Electrode structures for acquisition and neural stimulation controlling the cardiovascular system.
