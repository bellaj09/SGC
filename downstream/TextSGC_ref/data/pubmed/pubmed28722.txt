The nonstationarity of neural signal is still an unresolved issue despite the rapid progress made in brain-machine interface BMI. This paper investigates how to utilize the rich information and dynamics in multi-day data to address the variability in day-to-day signal quality and neural tuning properties. For this purpose we propose a classifier-level fusion technique to build a robust decoding model by jointly considering the classifier outputs from multiple base-training models using multi-day data collected prior to test day. The data set used in this study consisted of recordings of 8 days from a non-human primate NHP during control of a mobile robot using a joystick. Offline analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method which results in 4.4% and 13.10% improvements in decoding significant by one-way ANOVA and post hoc t-test compared with the two baseline methods: 1 concatenating data from multiple days based on common effective channels and 2 averaging accuracies across all base-training models. These results further validate the effectiveness of proposed method without recalibration of the model.
