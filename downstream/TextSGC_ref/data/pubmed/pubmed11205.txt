Magnetic resonance imaging MRI-guided radiation therapy RT treatment planning is limited by the fact that the electron density distribution required for dose calculation is not readily provided by MR imaging. We compare a selection of novel synthetic CT generation algorithms recently reported in the literature including segmentation-based atlas-based and machine learning techniques using the same cohort of patients and quantitative evaluation metrics.
