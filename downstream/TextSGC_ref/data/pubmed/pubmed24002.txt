Clinical processing of event-related potentials ERPs requires a precise synchrony between the stimulation and the acquisition units that are guaranteed by means of a physical link between them. This precise synchrony is needed since temporal misalignments during trial averaging can lead to high deviations of peak times thus causing error in diagnosis or inefficiency in classification in brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Out of the laboratory mobile EEG systems and BCI headsets are not provided with the physical link thus being inadequate for acquisition of ERPs. In this study we propose a method for the asynchronous detection of trials onset from raw EEG without physical links. We validate it with a BCI application based on the dichotic listening task. The user goal was to attend the cued auditory message and to report three keywords contained in it while ignoring the other message. The BCI goal was to detect the attended message from the analysis of auditory ERPs. The rate of successful onset detection in both synchronous using the real onset and asynchronous blind detection of trial onset from raw EEG was 73% with a synchronization error of less than 1Formula: see textms. The level of synchronization provided by this proposal would allow home-based acquisition of ERPs with low cost BCI headsets and any media player unit without physical links between them.
