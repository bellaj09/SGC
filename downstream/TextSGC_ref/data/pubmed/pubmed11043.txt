Whole-brain radiotherapy WBRT in patients with brain metastases BM is associated with neurocognitive decline. Given its crucial role in learning and memory efforts to mitigate this toxicity have mostly focused on sparing radiation to the hippocampus. We hypothesized that BM are not evenly distributed across the brain and that several additional areas may be avoided in WBRT based on a low risk of developing BM. A low percentage of metastases in deep brain and temporal lobe structures.
