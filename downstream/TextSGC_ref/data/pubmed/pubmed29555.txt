Our daily life consists of a continuous interplay between incoming sensory information and outgoing motor plans. Particularly during goal-directed behavior and active exploration of the sensory environment brain circuits are merging sensory and motor signals. This is referred to as sensorimotor integration and is relevant for locomotion vision or tactile exploration. The somatosensory tactile system is an attractive modality to study sensorimotor integration in health and disease motivated by the need for revolutionary technology that builds upon conceptual understanding of sensorimotor integration such as brain-machine-interfaces and neuro-prosthetics. In this perspective we focus on the rat whisker system and put forward the posterior parietal cortex as a potential circuit where sensorimotor integration could occur during active somatosensation. The posterior parietal cortex as integrative hub for whisker sensorimotor information.
