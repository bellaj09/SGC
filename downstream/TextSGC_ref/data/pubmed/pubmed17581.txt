High-cost situations need to be avoided. However occasionally cost may only be learned by experience. Here we tested whether an artificially induced unstable and invisible high-cost region a "limit-push" force field might reshape people\s motion distributions. Healthy and neurologically impaired chronic stroke populations attempted 600 interceptions of a projectile while holding a robot handle that could render forces to the hand. The "limit-push" in the middle of the study pushed the hand outward unless the hand stayed within a box-shaped region. Both healthy and some stroke survivors adapted through selection of safer actions avoiding the high-cost regions outside the box; they stayed more inside and even kept a greater distance from the box\s boundaries. This was supported by other measures that showed subjects distributed their hand movements within the box more uniformly. These effects lasted a very short time after returning to the no-force condition. Although most robotic teaching approaches focus on shifting the mean this limit-push treatment demonstrates how both mean and variance might be reshaped in motor training and neurorehabilitation.
