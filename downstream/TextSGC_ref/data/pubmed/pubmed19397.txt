In typical infants the achievement of independent locomotion has a positive impact on the development of both small-scale and large-scale spatial cognition. Here we investigated whether this association between the motor and spatial domain: 1 persists into childhood and 2 is detrimental to the development of spatial cognition in individuals with motor deficits namely individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and individuals with Williams syndrome WS. Despite evidence of a co-occurring motor impairment in many individuals with ADHD little is known about the developmental consequences of this impairment. Individuals with WS demonstrate impaired motor and spatial competence yet the relationship between these two impairments is unknown. Typically developing TD children N = 71 individuals with ADHD N = 51 and individuals with WS N = 20 completed a battery of motor tasks a measure of independent exploration and a virtual reality spatial navigation task. Retrospective motor milestone data were collected for the ADHD and WS groups. Results demonstrated a relationship between fine motor ability and spatial navigation in the TD group which could reflect the developmental impact of the ability to manually manipulate objects on spatial knowledge. In contrast no relationships between the motor and spatial domains were observed for the ADHD or WS groups. Indeed while there was evidence of motor impairment in both groups only the WS group demonstrated an impairment in large-scale spatial navigation. The motor-spatial relationship in the TD but not the ADHD and WS groups suggests that aspects of spatial cognition can develop via a developmental pathway which bypasses input from the motor domain.
