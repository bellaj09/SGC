In the case of space-based space surveillance SBSS images of the target space objects captured by space-based imaging sensors usually suffer from low spatial resolution due to the extremely long distance between the target and the imaging sensor. Image super-resolution is an effective data processing operation to get informative high resolution images. In this paper we comparably study four recent popular models for single image super-resolution based on convolutional neural networks CNNs with the purpose of space applications. We specially fine-tune the super-resolution models designed for natural images using simulated images of space objects and test the performance of different CNN-based models in different conditions that are mainly considered for SBSS. Experimental results show the advantages and drawbacks of these models which could be helpful for the choice of proper CNN-based super-resolution method to deal with image data of space objects.
