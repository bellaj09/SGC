"In this paper a preliminary baseball player behavior classification system is proposed. By using multiple IoT sensors and cameras the proposed method accurately recognizes many of baseball players behaviors by analyzing signals from heterogeneous sensors. The contribution of this paper is threefold: i signals from a depth camera and from multiple inertial sensors are obtained and segmented ii the time-variant skeleton vector projection from the depth camera and the statistical features extracted from the inertial sensors are used as features and iii a deep learning-based scheme is proposed for training behavior classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning behavior system achieves an accuracy of greater than 95% compared to the proposed dataset."
