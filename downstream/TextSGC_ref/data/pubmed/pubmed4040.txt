Increased dopamine availability may be associated with impaired structural maturation of brain white matter connectivity. This study aimed to derive a comprehensive whole-brain characterization of large-scale axonal connectivity differences in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD associated with catechol-O-methyltransferase gene COMT Val158Met polymorphism. Using diffusion tensor imaging whole-brain tractography and an imaging connectomics approach we characterized altered white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD who were COMT Val-homozygous N\u2009=\u200929 compared with those who were Met-carriers N\u2009=\u200929. Additionally we examined whether dopamine transporter gene DAT1 and dopamine D4 receptor gene DRD4 polymorphisms were associated with white matter differences. Level of attention was assessed using the continuous performance test before and after an 8-week open-label trial of methylphenidate MPH. A network of white matter connections linking 18 different brain regions was significantly weakened in youth with ADHD who were COMT Met-carriers compared to those who were Val-homozygous P\u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error-corrected. A measure of white matter integrity fractional anisotropy was correlated with impaired pretreatment performance in continuous performance test omission errors and response time variability as well as with improvement in continuous performance test response time variability after MPH treatment. Altered white matter connectivity was exclusively based on COMT genotypes and was not evident in DAT1 or DRD4. We demonstrated that white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD is associated with COMT Val158Met genotypes. The present findings suggest that different layers of dopamine-related genes and interindividual variability in the genetic polymorphisms should be taken into account when investigating the human connectome. COMT genotype affects brain white matter pathways in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
