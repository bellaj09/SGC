Deep learning DL has demonstrated human expert levels of performance for medical image classification in a wide array of medical fields including ophthalmology. In this article we present the results of our DL system designed to determine optic disc laterality right eye vs left eye in the presence of both normal and abnormal optic discs. Deep Learning and Transfer Learning for Optic Disc Laterality Detection: Implications for Machine Learning in Neuro-Ophthalmology.
