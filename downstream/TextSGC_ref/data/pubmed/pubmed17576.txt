"Touch screen technology supplies a new approach to interact with virtual environments. For haptic interaction on a touch screen haptic devices that are capable of simultaneously conveying tactile and force information to users are highly desired for enhancing the sense of reality and immersion. To this end a prototype haptic interface called MH-Pen was developed and fabricated to display the virtual interactive information through multi-mode haptic feedback. The MH-Pen is a self-contained system that provides vibrotactile feedback and precise force feedback by integrating three types of actuators. In this paper MH-Pens design specifications and working principle are described. Subsequently to accurately display the interaction force a hybrid actuator was designed by combining a piston-type magnetorheological MR actuator and a voice coil motor VCM and a closed-loop control scheme was built to manage the hybrid actuator. Finally we objectively and subjectively evaluated the force feedback performance and the effect of multi-mode haptic display of the MH-Pen through physical measurements and psychophysical experiments of virtual surface stiffness display. The results show that improving the precision of force feedback and using multi-mode haptic display are both useful and necessary to enhance the sense of human-computer interaction realism."
