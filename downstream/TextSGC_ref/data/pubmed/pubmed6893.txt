The endbrain telencephalon is at the rostral end of the central nervous system and is primarily responsible for supporting cognition and affect. Structurally it consists of right and left cerebral hemispheres each parceled into multiple cortical and nuclear gray matter regions. The global network organization of axonal macroconnections between the 244 regions forming the endbrain was analyzed with a multiresolution consensus clustering MRCC method that provides a hierarchical description of community clustering modules or subsystems within the network. Experimental evidence was collated from the neuroanatomical literature for the existence of 10002 of a possible 59292 connections within the network and they cluster into four top-level subsystems and 60 bottom-level subsystems arranged in a 50-level hierarchy. Two top-level subsystems are bihemispheric: One deals with auditory and visual information and the other corresponds broadly to the default mode network. The other two top-level subsystems are bilaterally symmetrical and each deals broadly with somatic and visceral information. Because the entire endbrain connection matrix was assembled from multiple subconnectomes it was easy to show that the status of a region as a connectivity hub is not absolute but instead depends on the size and coverage of its anatomical neighborhood. It was also shown numerically that creating an ultradense connection matrix by converting all "absent" connections to a "very weak" connection weight has virtually no effect on the clustering hierarchy. The next logical step in this project is to complete the forebrain connectome by adding the thalamus and hypothalamus together the interbrain to the endbrain analysis.
