Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of a system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to detect and transmit signals in a noisy environment suggesting that it is a good candidate to take advantage of stochastic resonance. In this work we aim to identify the optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple network model of the human brain. Specifically using a dynamic model implemented on an anatomical brain network connectome we investigate the similarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the network while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that non-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and the signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not unique; rather there is a set of parameter values at which the information is transmitted with greater precision this set corresponds to the parameter values that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical points in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain at criticality. Stochastic resonance at criticality in a network model of the human cortex.
