Postpartum depression PPD is associated with abnormalities in resting-state functional connectivity RSFC but the underlying neurochemistry is unclear. We hypothesized that peripartum GABAergic neuroactive steroids NAS are related to cortical GABA concentrations and RSFC in PPD as compared to healthy comparison women HCW. To test this we measured RSFC with fMRI and GABA+/Creatine Cr concentrations with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1H MRS in the pregenual anterior cingulate pgACC and occipital cortices OCC and quantified peripartum plasma NAS. We examined between-group differences in RSFC and the relationship between cortical GABA+/Cr concentrations with RSFC. We investigated the relationship between NAS RSFC and cortical GABA+/Cr concentrations. Within the default mode network DMN an area of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex DMPFC had greater connectivity with the rest of the DMN in PPD peak voxel: MNI coordinates 2 58 32 p\u2009=\u20090.002 and was correlated to depression scores peak HAM-D17 voxel: MNI coordinates 0 60 34 p\u2009=\u20090.008. pgACC GABA+/Cr correlated positively with DMPFC RSFC in a region spanning the right anterior/posterior insula and right temporal pole r\u2009=\u2009+0.661 p\u2009=\u20090.000. OCC GABA+/Cr correlated positively with regions spanning both amygdalae right amygdala: r\u2009=\u2009+0.522 p\u2009=\u20090.000; left amygdala: r\u2009=\u2009+0.651 p\u2009=\u20090.000 as well as superior parietal areas. Plasma allopregnanolone was higher in PPD p\u2009=\u20090.03 and positively correlated with intra DMPFC connectivity r\u2009=\u2009+0.548 p\u2009=\u20090.000 but not GABA+/Cr. These results provide initial evidence that PPD is associated with altered DMN connectivity; cortical GABA+/Cr concentrations are associated with postpartum RSFC and allopregnanolone is associated with postpartum intra-DMPFC connectivity.
