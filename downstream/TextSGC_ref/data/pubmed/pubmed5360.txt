Graph theory has been recently introduced to characterize complex brain networks making it highly suitable to investigate altered connectivity in neurologic disorders. A current model proposes autism spectrum disorder ASD as a developmental disconnection syndrome supported by converging evidence in both non-syndromic and syndromic ASD. However the effects of abnormal connectivity on network properties have not been well studied particularly in syndromic ASD. To close this gap brain functional networks of electroencephalographic EEG connectivity were studied through graph measures in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex TSC a disorder with a high prevalence of ASD as well as in patients with non-syndromic ASD. Brain functional networks in syndromic and non-syndromic autism: a graph theoretical study of EEG connectivity.
