In recent years deep learning methods have been widely used in the hyperspectral image HSI classification tasks. Among them spectral-spatial combined methods based on the three-dimensional 3-D convolution have shown good performance. However because of the three-dimensional convolution increasing network depth will result in a dramatic rise in the number of parameters. In addition the previous methods do not make full use of spectral information. They mostly use the data after dimensionality reduction directly as the input of networks which result in poor classification ability in some categories with small numbers of samples. To address the above two issues in this paper we designed an end-to-end 3D-ResNeXt network which adopts feature fusion and label smoothing strategy further. On the one hand the residual connections and split-transform-merge strategy can alleviate the declining-accuracy phenomenon and decrease the number of parameters. We can adjust the hyperparameter cardinality instead of the network depth to extract more discriminative features of HSIs and improve the classification accuracy. On the other hand in order to improve the classification accuracies of classes with small numbers of samples we enrich the input of the 3D-ResNeXt spectral-spatial feature learning network by additional spectral feature learning and finally use a loss function modified by label smoothing strategy to solve the imbalance of classes. The experimental results on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed network and an effective improvement in the accuracies especially for the classes with small numbers of training samples.
