"In this study the P300 latency jitter has been explored in an EEG data set collected from a group of patients with disorders of consciousness DOC; n=13 that was administered with an auditory Oddball paradigm under passive and active conditions. A method based on wavelet transform was applied to estimate single trial P300 waveforms. Preliminary results showed that 5 Vegetative State VS and 8 Minimally Conscious Staten MCS patients exhibited significantly higher values of P300 latency jitter as compared to those obtained from a control group of 12 healthy subjects. In addition the magnitude of the P300 latency jitter negatively correlated with patients clinical status. The existence of such phenomenon might substantially limit an effective use of Brain Computer Interface systems for communication."
