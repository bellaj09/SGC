Structural connectome measurement combined with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI and tractography allows generation of a whole-brain connectome. However current cortical structural connectivity SC measurements have not been well combined with the vertex-wise multi-subjects statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using group comparison vertex-wise analysis for cortical SC measurement. A fiber connectivity density FiCD method based on a combination of a diffusion fiber tracking technique and cortical surface-based analysis was used to measure the whole-brain cortical SC map FiCD map. A public MRI dataset GigaDB was employed to evaluate the reproducibility of the FiCD method. For group comparison 14 post-stroke patients mean age 68.367.33y and 19 healthy participants mean age 66.848.58y had FiCD measurement. The intergroup comparison of the FiCD map was performed using vertex-wise multi-subject statistical analysis. Reliability testing showed the mean intra- and inter-subject FiCD variability was 3.512.12% and 19.444.79% respectively. The group comparison of the whole-brain FiCD identified cortical regions with altered FiCD values and there was a spatial consistency between the cortical clusters with low FiCD values and the subcortical lesions of patients. This study demonstrated the feasibility of vertex-wise group comparison for evaluating cortical fiber connectivity density. The FiCD method has good intra- and inter-individual reproducibility and accurately reflects the affected cortical regions in post-stroke patients. This method may be helpful for neuroscience research. Group comparison of cortical fiber connectivity map: An application between post-stroke patients and healthy subjects.
