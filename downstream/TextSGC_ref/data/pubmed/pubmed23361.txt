Nowadays motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been developed rapidly. In these systems electroencephalogram EEG signals are recorded when a subject is involved in the imagination of doing any motor imagery movement like the imagination of the right/left hands etc. In this paper we sought to validate and enhance our previously proposed angle-amplitude transformation AAT technique which is a simple signal-to-image transformation approach for the classification of EEG and MEG signals. For this purpose we diversified our previous method and proposed four new angle-amplitude graph AAG representation methods for AAT transformation. These modifications were made on some points such as using different left/right side changing points at a different distance. To confirm the validity of the proposed methods we performed experiments on the BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa which is a benchmark dataset widely used for EEG-based multi-class motor imagery tasks. The procedure of proposed methods can be summarized in a concise manner as follows: i convert EEG signals to AAG images by using the proposed AAT transformation approaches; ii extract image features by employing Scale Invariant Feature Transform SIFT-based Bag of Visual Word BoW; and iii classify features with k-Nearest Neighbor k NN algorithm. Experimental results showed that the changes in the baseline AAT approaches enhanced the classification performance on Dataset IIIa with an accuracy of 96.50% for two-class problem left/right hand movement imaginations and 97.99% for four-class problem left/right hand foot and tongue movement imaginations. These achievements are mainly due to the help of effective enhancements on AAG image representations. Graphical Abstract The flow diagram of the proposed methodology.
