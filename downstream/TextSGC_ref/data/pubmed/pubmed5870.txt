Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior and it constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality EC using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data from two different psychological contexts resting state and a working memory task in a large cross-sectional sample n = 754 spanning the age from 8 to 22 years and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis ICA. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.
