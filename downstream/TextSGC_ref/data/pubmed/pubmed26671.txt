In this paper we investigated the performance of a multi-class brain-computer interface BCI. The BCI system is based on the concept of somatosensory attentional orientation SAO in which the user shifts and maintains somatosensory attention by imagining the sensation of tactile stimulation of a body part. At the beginning of every trial a vibration stimulus 200 ms informed the subjects to prepare for the task. Four SAO tasks were performed following randomly presented cues: SAO of the left hand SAO-LF SAO of the right hand SAO-RT bilateral SAO SAO-BI and SAO suppressed or idle state SAO-ID. Analysis of the event-related desynchronization and synchronization ERD/ERS in the EEG indicated that the four SAO tasks had different somatosensory cortical activation patterns. SAO-LF and SAO-RT exhibited stronger contralateral ERD whereas bilateral ERD activation was indicative of SAO-BI and bilateral ERS activation was associated with SAO-ID. By selecting the frequency bands and/or optimal classes classification accuracy of the system reached 85.2%11.2% for two classes 69.5%16.2% for three classes and 55.9%15.8% for four classes. The results validated a multi-class BCI system based on SAO on a single trial basis. Somatosensory attention to different body parts induces diverse oscillatory dynamics within the somatosensory area of the brain and the proposed SAO paradigm provided a new approach for a multiple-class BCI that is potentially stimulus independent.
