Simulation training plays a paramount role in medicine especially when it comes to mastering surgical skills. By simulating students gain not only confidence but expertise learning to apply theory in a safe environment. As the technological arsenal improved virtual reality and physical simulators have developed and are now an important part of the Neurosurgery training curriculum. Based on deliberate practice in a controlled space simulation allows psychomotor skills augment without putting neither patients nor students at risk. When compared to the master-apprentice ongoing model of teaching simutation becomes even more appealing as it is time-efficient shortening the learning curve and ultimately leading to error reduction which is reflected by diminished health care costs in the long run. In this chapter we will discuss the current state of neurosurgery simulation highlight the potential benefits of this approach assessing specific training methods and making considerations towards the future of neurosurgical simulation.
