Current deep neural network based approaches to computed tomography CT metal artifact reduction MAR are supervised methods that rely on synthesized metal artifacts for training. However as synthesized data may not accurately simulate the underlying physical mechanisms of CT imaging the supervised methods often generalize poorly to clinical applications. To address this problem we propose to the best of our knowledge the first unsupervised learning approach to MAR. Specifically we introduce a novel artifact disentanglement network that disentangles the metal artifacts from CT images in the latent space. It supports different forms of generations artifact reduction artifact transfer and self-reconstruction etc. with specialized loss functions to obviate the need for supervision with synthesized data. Extensive experiments show that when applied to a synthesized dataset our method addresses metal artifacts significantly better than the existing unsupervised models designed for natural image-to-image translation problems and achieves comparable performance to existing supervised models for MAR. When applied to clinical datasets our method demonstrates better generalization ability over the supervised models.
