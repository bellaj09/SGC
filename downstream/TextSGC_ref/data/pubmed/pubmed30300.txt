Neuroprosthetics that combine a brain computer interface BCI with functional electrical stimulation FES can restore voluntary control of a patients\ own paralyzed limbs. To date human studies have demonstrated an "all-or-none" type of control for a fixed number of pre-determined states like hand-open and hand-closed. To be practical for everyday use a BCI-FES system should enable smooth control of limb movements through a continuum of states and generate situationally appropriate graded muscle contractions. Crucially this functionality will allow users of BCI-FES neuroprosthetics to manipulate objects of different sizes and weights without dropping or crushing them. In this study we present the first evidence that using a BCI-FES system a human with tetraplegia can regain volitional graded control of muscle contraction in his paralyzed limb. In addition we show the critical ability of the system to generalize beyond training states and accurately generate wrist flexion states that are intermediate to training levels. These innovations provide the groundwork for enabling enhanced and more natural fine motor control of paralyzed limbs by BCI-FES neuroprosthetics.
