"Alzheimers disease AD is associated not only with regional gray matter damages but also with abnormalities in functional integration between brain regions. Here we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and voxel-based graph-theory analysis to systematically investigate intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of whole-brain networks in 32 AD patients and 38 healthy controls HCs. We found that AD selectively targeted highly connected hub regions in terms of nodal functional connectivity strength of brain networks involving the medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices insula and thalamus. This impairment was connectivity distance-dependent Euclidean with the most prominent disruptions appearing in the long-range connections e.g. 100-130 mm. Moreover AD also disrupted functional connections within the default-mode salience and executive-control modules and connections between the salience and executive-control modules. These disruptions of hub connectivity and modular integrity significantly correlated with the patients cognitive performance. Finally the nodal connectivity strength in the posteromedial cortex exhibited a highly discriminative power in distinguishing individuals with AD from HCs. Taken together our results emphasize AD-related degeneration of specific brain hubs thus providing novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of connectivity dysfunction in AD and suggesting the potential of using network hub connectivity as a diagnostic biomarker."
