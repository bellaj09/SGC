"Evidence suggests that the sense of the position of our body parts can be surreptitiously deceived for instance through illusory visual inputs. However whether altered visual feedback during limb movement can induce substantial unconscious motor and muscular adjustments is not known. To address this question we covertly manipulated virtual body movements in immersive virtual reality. Participants were instructed to flex their elbow to 90 while tensing an elastic band as their virtual arm reproduced the same a reduced 75 or an amplified 105 movement. We recorded muscle activity using electromyography and assessed body ownership agency and proprioception of the arm. Our results not only show that participants compensated for the avatars manipulated arm movement while being completely unaware of it but also that it is possible to induce unconscious motor adaptations requiring significant changes in muscular activity. Altered visual feedback through body ownership illusions can influence motor performance in a process that bypasses awareness." Altered visual feedback from an embodied avatar unconsciously influences movement amplitude and muscle activity.
