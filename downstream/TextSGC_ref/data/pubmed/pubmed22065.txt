The relationship between M1 activity representing motor information in real and imagined movements have not been investigated with high spatiotemporal resolution using non-invasive measurements. We examined the similarities and differences in M1 activity during real and imagined movements. Ten subjects performed or imagined three types of right upper limb movements. To infer the movement type we used 40 virtual channels in the M1 contralateral to the movement side cM1 using a beamforming approach. For both real and imagined movements cM1 activities increased around response onset after which their intensities were significantly different. Similarly although decoding accuracies surpassed the chance level in both real and imagined movements these were significantly different after the onset. Single virtual channel-based analysis showed that decoding accuracy significantly increased around the hand and arm areas during real and imagined movements and that these are spatially correlated. The temporal correlation of decoding accuracy significantly increased around the hand and arm areas except for the period immediately after response onset. Our results suggest that cM1 is involved in similar neural activities related to the representation of motor information during real and imagined movements except for presence or absence of sensory-motor integration induced by sensory feedback. Common neural correlates of real and imagined movements contributing to the performance of brain-machine interfaces.
