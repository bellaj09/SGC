There is a significant and troubling link between diabetes DM and falls in the elderly. Individuals with DM are prone to fall for reasons such as decreased sensorimotor function musculoskeletal/neuromuscular deficits foot and body pain pharmacological complications and specialty offloading footwear devices. Additionally there is some concern that DM patients are prone to have more severe problems with falls than non-DM individuals. Fractures poorer rehabilitation and increased number of falls are all concerns. Fortunately efforts to mitigate falls by DM patients show promise. A number of studies have shown that balance strength and gait training may be utilized to successfully reduce fall risk in this population. Furthermore new technologies such as virtual reality proprioceptive training may be able to provide this reduced risk within a safe training environment. A growing troubling triad: diabetes aging and falls.
