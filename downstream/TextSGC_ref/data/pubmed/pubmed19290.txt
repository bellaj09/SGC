This study aimed to evaluate the utility of a novel more cost-effective driving simulator Assetto Corsa AC in detecting differences in driving performance between individuals with and without ADHD. Driving simulators are a useful means of assessing driving performance in those with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD; however they are frequently expensive and thus unavailable to many researchers. A total of 87 participants 16 with ADHD 71 without completed an AC driving simulator task. They also completed computerized measures of attention and executive functioning and a questionnaire assessing self-reported driving behaviors and anger ADHD and related symptoms and mind wandering. Relative to those without ADHD participants with ADHD reached higher average ground speeds and more greatly utilized the throttle. They also applied higher maximum pressure to the throttle and brake pedals. Within the full sample greater mind wandering was associated with average and maximum throttle pressure and maximum ground speed. Findings confirm prior works indicative of a deleterious effect of ADHD diagnosis on simulator performance and may be attributed to a combination of impulsivity and mind wandering. Utility of a novel simulator paradigm in the assessment of driving ability in individuals with and without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
