Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system CNS injury including stroke motor incomplete spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury often experience lasting locomotor deficits as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration timed distance. The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.
