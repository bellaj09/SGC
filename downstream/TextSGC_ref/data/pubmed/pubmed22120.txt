Neuroprostheses are electronic devices using electrophysiological signals to stimulate muscles electronic/ mechanical devices such as substitutes for limbs or parts of limbs or computers. The development of neuroprostheses was possible thanks to advances in understanding of the physiology of the human brain and in the capabilities of hardware and software. Recent progress in the area of neuroprosthetics may offer important breakthroughs in therapy and rehabilitation. New dedicated solutions for disabled people can lead to their increased participation in social educational and professional areas. It is worth focussing particular attention on new solutions for people with paralysis people with communication disorders and amputees. This article aims at investigating the extent to which the available opportunities are being exploited including current and potential future applications of brain-computer interfaces.
