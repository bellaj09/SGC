Despite the importance of sperm DNA to human reproduction currently no method exists to assess individual sperm DNA quality prior to clinical selection. Traditionally skilled clinicians select sperm based on a variety of morphological and motility criteria but without direct knowledge of their DNA cargo. Here we show how a deep convolutional neural network can be trained on a collection of ~1000 sperm cells of known DNA quality to predict DNA quality from brightfield images alone. Our results demonstrate moderate correlation bivariate correlation ~0.43 between a sperm cell image and DNA quality and the ability to identify higher DNA integrity cells relative to the median. This deep learning selection process is directly compatible with current manual microscopy-based sperm selection and could assist clinicians by providing rapid DNA quality predictions under 10\u2009ms per cell and sperm selection within the 86th percentile from a given sample. Deep learning-based selection of human sperm with high DNA integrity.
