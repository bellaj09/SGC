"Despite recent progress on brain connectivity modeling using neuroimaging data such as fMRI most current approaches assume that brain connectivity networks have time-invariant topology/coefficients. This is clearly problematic as the brain is inherently nonstationary. Here we present a time-varying model to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain connectivity networks. The proposed method allows for abrupt changes in network structure via a fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator LASSO scheme as well as recovery of time-varying networks with smoothly changing coefficients via a weighted regression technique. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method yields improved accuracy on estimating time-dependent connectivity patterns when compared to a static sparse regression model or a weighted time-varying regression model. When applied to real resting-state fMRI datasets from Parkinsons disease PD and control subjects significantly different temporal and spatial patterns were found to be associated with PD. Specifically PD subjects demonstrated reduced network variability over time which may be related to impaired cognitive flexibility previously reported in PD. The temporal dynamic properties of brain connectivity in PD subjects may provide insights into brain dynamics associated with PD and may serve as a potential biomarker in future studies."
