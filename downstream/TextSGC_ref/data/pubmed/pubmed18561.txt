The fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery FLS trainer box which is now established as a standard for evaluating minimally invasive surgical skills consists of five tasks: peg transfer pattern cutting ligation intra- and extracorporeal suturing. Virtual simulators of these tasks have been developed and validated as part of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer VBLaST Arikatla et al. in Int J Med Robot Comput Assist Surg 10:344-355 2014; Zhang et al. in Surg Endosc 2710:3603-3615 2013; Sankaranarayanan et al. in J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech 202:153-157 2010; Qi et al. J Biomed Inform 75:48-62 2017. The virtual task trainers have many advantages including automatic real-time objective scoring reduced costs and eliminating human proctors. In this paper we extend VBLaST by adding two camera navigation system tasks: a pattern matching and b path tracing. Development and face validation of a virtual camera navigation task trainer.
