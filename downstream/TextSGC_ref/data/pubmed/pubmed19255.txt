The authors examined the efficacy of a 1-session virtual reality VR exposure treatment and sought to determine whether VR exposure is the active treatment component. Forty-five patients with fear of flying were randomly assigned to a cognitive treatment plus VR exposure with motion simulation b cognitive treatment plus VR exposure without motion simulation or c cognitive treatment alone. Fear of flying was assessed before immediately after and 6 months after treatment. Posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments revealed reduced fear of flying only in the VR exposure groups. VR exposure with or without motion simulation yielded comparable treatment outcomes. Dismantling of treatment components indicated that exposure to visual and acoustic stimuli is the main active component of VR exposure therapy. Motion simulation as part of VR exposure does not seem to further enhance treatment effects. Efficacy of a one-session virtual reality exposure treatment for fear of flying.
