"Augmented reality technology was used in 5 patients for secondary reconstruction of post-traumatic unilateral deformities of the zygomaticomaxillary complex. Three electromagnetic sensors interfaced to a computer-aided navigation system ARTMA Biomedical Inc. were utilized. The computer navigation procedure was planned by drawing graphic lines on the CT scan at the level of the zygomatic arch representing the outer surface of the zygoma. The desired position of the displaced zygoma was planned by mirroring from the healthy side using a virtual mid-sagittal plane. These virtual graphics were presented intraoperatively on a TV monitor and also on the surgeons see-through head-mounted display. Correct reduction was assumed when the virtual line representing the position of the zygoma before the osteotomy reached the virtual line defined preoperatively as the desired position. The advantages of the technique presented are that a complete exposure of the zygomatic bone is no longer necessary and coronal and subciliary incisions may be avoided unless enophthalmos correction has to be carried out which was in fact necessary in 2 patients. The results of zygomatic reconstruction have been satisfactory in all 5 patients." Computer-aided navigation in secondary reconstruction of post-traumatic deformities of the zygoma.
