Micro-RNAs miRNAs play a significant role in regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions such as cancers. However it remains a challenging problem to discover the target messenger RNAs mRNAs of a miRNA in a data driven fashion. On one hand sequence-based methods for predicting miRNA targets tend to make too many false positive calls. On the other hand analyzing expression correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs cannot establish whether relationship between a pair of correlated miRNA and mRNA is causal.
