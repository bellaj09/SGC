"This chapter describes the characteristics and preliminary evaluation of The Virtual Environment for Body Image Modification VEBIM a set of tasks aimed at treating body image disturbances and body dissatisfaction associated with eating disorders. Two methods are commonly used to treat body image: 1 a cognitive/behavioural therapy to influence patients feelings of dissatisfaction; 2 a visual/motorial therapy with the aim of influencing the level of bodily awareness. VEBIM tries to integrate these two therapeutic approaches within an immersive virtual environment. This choice would not only make it possible to intervene simultaneously on all of the forms of bodily representations but also to use the psycho-physiological effects provoked on the body by the virtual experience for therapeutic purposes. The chapter together with the description of the VEBIM theoretical approach it also presents a study on two preliminary samples 71 normal subjects uncontrolled study 48 normal subjects controlled study to test its efficacy."
