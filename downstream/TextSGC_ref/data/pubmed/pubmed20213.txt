Virtual reality VR opens up a vast number of possibilities in many domains of therapy. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the acceptability for elderly subjects of a VR experience using the image-based rendering virtual environment IBVE approach and secondly to test the hypothesis that visual cues using VR may enhance the generation of autobiographical memories. Is it possible to use highly realistic virtual reality in the elderly? A feasibility study with image-based rendering.
