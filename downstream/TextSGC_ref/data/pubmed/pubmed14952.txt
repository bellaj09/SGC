"Externally observing the experience of a participant in a virtual environment is generally accomplished by viewing an egocentric perspective. Monitoring this view can often be difficult for others to watch due to unwanted camera motions that appear unnatural and unmotivated. We present a novel method for reducing the unnaturalness of these camera motions by minimizing camera movement while maintaining the context of the participants observations. For each time-step we compare the parts of the scene viewed by the virtual participant to the parts of the scene viewed by the camera. Based on the similarity of these two viewpoints we next determine how the camera should be adjusted. We present two means of adjustment one which continuously adjusts the camera and a second which attempts to stop camera movement when possible. Empirical evaluation shows that our method can produce paths that have substantially shorter travel distances are easier to watch and maintain the original observations of the participants virtual experience."
