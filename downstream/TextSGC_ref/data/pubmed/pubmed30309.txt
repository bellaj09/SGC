Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here we used a novel virtual reality VR system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study we examined i rehabilitation dose and training intensity ii functional improvements and iii safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. Increasing upper limb training intensity in chronic stroke using embodied virtual reality: a pilot study.
