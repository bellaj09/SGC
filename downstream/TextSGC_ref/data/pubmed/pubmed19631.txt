Biology and biochemistry students must learn to visualize and comprehend the complex three-dimensional 3D structures of macromolecules such as proteins or DNA. However most tools available for teaching biomolecular structures typically operate in two dimensions. Here we present protocols and pedagogical approaches for using immersive augmented reality AR visors specifically the Microsoft HoloLens to reinforce learning with large scale 3D holographic structures. We developed a novel workflow to render vividly colored custom biomolecules in AR visors. In addition we developed AR exercises to review concepts relevant to protein or DNA structure and then implemented the exercises in four different biology and biochemistry courses. Surveys showed that students reported greater interest in biomolecular structures after the exercise. We also highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of the software and hardware of this upcoming technology. An idea to explore: Use of augmented reality for teaching three-dimensional biomolecular structures.
