Recent interest in the use of conducting polymers CPs for neural stimulation electrodes has been growing; however concerns remain regarding the stability of coatings under stimulation conditions. These studies examine the factors of the CP and implant environment that affect coating stability. The CP polyethylene dioxythiophene PEDOT is examined in comparison to platinum Pt to demonstrate the potential performance of these coatings in neuroprosthetic applications. Performance of conducting polymer electrodes for stimulating neuroprosthetics.
