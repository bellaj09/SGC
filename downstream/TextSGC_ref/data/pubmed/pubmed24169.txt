"Exposure therapy EXP is the most empirically supported treatment for anxiety and trauma-related disorders. EXP consists of repeated exposure to a feared object or situation in the absence of the feared outcome in order to extinguish associated anxiety. Key to the success of EXP is the need to present the feared object/event/situation in as much detail and utilizing as many sensory modalities as possible in order to augment the sense of presence during exposure sessions. Various technologies used to augment the exposure therapy process by presenting multi-sensory cues e.g. sights smells sounds. Studies have shown that scents can elicit emotionally charged memories but no prior research has examined the effect of olfactory stimuli upon the patients sense of presence during simulated exposure tasks."
