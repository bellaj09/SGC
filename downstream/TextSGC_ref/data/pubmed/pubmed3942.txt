"Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterised by the recurrence of seizures. During seizures multiple brain areas can behave abnormally. Rather than considering each abnormal area in isolation one can consider them as an interconnected functional network. Recently there has been a shift in emphasis to consider epilepsy as a disorder involving more widespread functional brain networks than perhaps was previously thought. The basis for these functional networks is proposed to be the static structural brain network established through the connectivity of the white matter. Additionally it has also been argued that time varying aspects of epilepsy are of crucial importance and as such computational models of these dynamical properties have recently advanced. We describe how dynamic computer models can be combined with static human in vivo connectivity obtained through diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We predict that in future the use of these two methods in concert will lead to predictions for optimal surgery and brain stimulation sites for epilepsy and other neurological disorders."
