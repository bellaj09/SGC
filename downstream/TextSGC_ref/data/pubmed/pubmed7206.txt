Electronic health record phenotyping is the use of raw electronic health record data to assert characterizations about patients. Researchers have been doing it since the beginning of biomedical informatics under different names. Phenotyping will benefit from an increasing focus on fidelity both in the sense of increasing richness such as measured levels degree or severity timing probability or conceptual relationships and in the sense of reducing bias. Research agendas should shift from merely improving binary assignment to studying and improving richer representations. The field is actively researching new temporal directions and abstract representations including deep learning. The field would benefit from research in nonlinear dynamics in combining mechanistic models with empirical data including data assimilation and in topology. The health care process produces substantial bias and studying that bias explicitly rather than treating it as merely another source of noise would facilitate addressing it. High-fidelity phenotyping: richness and freedom from bias.
