Forged documents and counterfeit currency can be better detected with multispectral imaging in multiple color channels instead of the usual red green and blue. However multispectral cameras/scanners are expensive. We propose the construction of a low cost scanner designed to capture multispectral images of documents. A standard sheet-feed scanner was modified by disconnecting its internal light source and connecting an external multispectral light source comprising of narrow band light emitting diodes LED. A document was scanned by illuminating the scanner light guide successively with different LEDs and capturing a scan of the document. The system costs less than a hundred dollars and is portable. It can potentially be used for applications in verification of questioned documents checks receipts and bank notes. Converting a Common Low-Cost Document Scanner into a Multispectral Scanner.
