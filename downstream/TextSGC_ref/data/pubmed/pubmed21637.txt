Classification methods are a crucial direction in the current study of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. To improve the classification accuracy for electroencephalogram EEG signals a novel KF-PP-SVM kernel fisher posterior probability and support vector machine classification method is developed. Its detailed process entails the use of common spatial patterns to obtain features based on which the within-class scatter is calculated. Then the scatter is added into the kernel function of a radial basis function to construct a new kernel function. This new kernel is integrated into the SVM to obtain a new classification model. Finally the output of SVM is calculated based on posterior probability and the final recognition result is obtained. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed KF-PP-SVM method EEG data collected from laboratory are processed with four different classification schemes KF-PP-SVM KF-SVM PP-SVM and SVM. The results showed that the overall average improvements arising from the use of the KF-PP-SVM scheme as opposed to KF-SVM PP-SVM and SVM schemes are 2.49% 5.83 % and 6.49 % respectively.
