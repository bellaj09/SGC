In this study virtual reality was the tool used to construct an experimental space. Three scenarios - one without emergency signs another with an old-version emergency sign and the third with a new-version emergency sign - were created after which 107 subjects divided into three groups engaged in an emergency escape game to determine if and how various emergency signs aid in way-finding in the event of an emergency. Under the presupposition that the minimum time needed for an emergency escape without any mistake occurring was 40s we found that the average way-finding time in the scenario without any emergency signs was 123.8s for the scenario with the new-version signs 84.8s and for the scenario with the old-version signs 75.6s; statistically this demonstrated that the absence of signs results in slower escape than either old signs p=0.001 or new signs p=0.005. These findings indicate that signs do help way-finding greatly. Males were found to exhibit better way-finding skills than females p<0.001. Construction workers and fire safety personnel as a combined group did not fare better than others with less presumed prior experience with building plans or emergency exit procedures. In addition when faced with both an emergency direction sign and an exit door almost half of the subjects 42% of the participants were chosen to take the door instead of following the direction posted on the sign. Finally we found that at T-intersections the majority of participants 60% chose to turn left versus right. Using virtual reality to determine how emergency signs facilitate way-finding.
