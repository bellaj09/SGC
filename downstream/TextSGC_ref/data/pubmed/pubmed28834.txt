We consider the detection of the control or idle state in an asynchronous Steady-state visually evoked potential SSVEP-based brain computer interface system. We propose a likelihood ratio test using Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA scores calculated from the EEG measurements. The test exploits the state-specific distributions of CCA scores. The algorithm was tested on offline measurements from 42 participants and the results should a significant improvement in detection error rate over the support vector machine classifier. The proposed test is also shown to be robust against training sample size. Detection of control or idle state with a likelihood ratio test in asynchronous SSVEP-based brain-computer interface systems.
