"The trend of an ageing and growing world population particularly in developed countries is expected to continue for decades to come causing an increase in demand for healthcare resources and services. Consequently demand is growing faster than rises in funding. The UK government in partnership with the European Commissions Vision for 2020 propose a paradigm shift towards the delivery of more patient-centred self-care interventions facilitated by novel ubiquitous computer mediated reality technology applications as a key strategy to overcome the scarcity of health resources gap. If this vision is to become a reality it is crucial that state of the art research focuses efforts on the development of applications that support the delivery of patient-centred self-care interventions."
