"Movement is planned and coordinated by the brain and carried out by contracting muscles acting on specific joints. Motor commands initiated in the brain travel through descending pathways in the spinal cord to effector motor neurons before reaching target muscles. Damage to these pathways by spinal cord injury SCI can result in paralysis below the injury level. However the planning and coordination centers of the brain as well as peripheral nerves and the muscles that they act upon remain functional. Neuroprosthetic devices can restore motor function following SCI by direct electrical stimulation of the neuromuscular system. Unfortunately conventional neuroprosthetic techniques are limited by a myriad of factors that include but are not limited to a lack of characterization of non-linear input/output system dynamics mechanical coupling limited number of degrees of freedom high power consumption large device size and rapid onset of muscle fatigue. Wireless multi-channel closed-loop neuroprostheses that integrate command signals from the brain with sensor-based feedback from the environment and the systems state offer the possibility of increasing device performance ultimately improving quality of life for people with SCI. In this manuscript we review neuroprosthetic technology for improving functional restoration following SCI and describe brain-machine interfaces suitable for control of neuroprosthetic systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Additionally we discuss novel stimulation paradigms that can improve synergy with higher planning centers and improve fatigue-resistant activation of paralyzed muscles. In the near future integration of these technologies will provide SCI survivors with versatile closed-loop neuroprosthetic systems for restoring function to paralyzed muscles."
