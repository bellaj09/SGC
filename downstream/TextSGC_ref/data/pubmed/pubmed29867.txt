"When researchers evaluate brain-computer interface BCI systems we want quantitative answers to questions such as: How good is the systems performance? How good does it need to be? and: Is it capable of reaching the desired level in future? In response to the current lack of objective quantitative study-independent approaches we introduce methods that help to address such questions. We identified three challenges: I the need for efficient measurement techniques that adapt rapidly and reliably to capture a wide range of performance levels; II the need to express results in a way that allows comparison between similar but non-identical tasks; III the need to measure the extent to which certain components of a BCI system e.g. the signal processing pipeline not only support BCI performance but also potentially restrict the maximum level it can reach." A general method for assessing brain-computer interface performance and its limitations.
