Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image HSI classification. In particular convolutional neural networks CNNs have shown superior performance to that of the conventional machine learning algorithms. Recently a novel type of neural networks called capsule networks CapsNets was presented to improve the most advanced CNNs. In this paper we present a modified two-layer CapsNet with limited training samples for HSI classification which is inspired by the comparability and simplicity of the shallower deep learning models. The presented CapsNet is trained using two real HSI datasets i.e. the PaviaU PU and SalinasA datasets representing complex and simple datasets respectively and which are used to investigate the robustness or representation of every model or classifier. In addition a comparable paradigm of network architecture design has been proposed for the comparison of CNN and CapsNet. Experiments demonstrate that CapsNet shows better accuracy and convergence behavior for the complex data than the state-of-the-art CNN. For CapsNet using the PU dataset the Kappa coefficient overall accuracy and average accuracy are 0.9456 95.90% and 96.27% respectively compared to the corresponding values yielded by CNN of 0.9345 95.11% and 95.63%. Moreover we observed that CapsNet has much higher confidence for the predicted probabilities. Subsequently this finding was analyzed and discussed with probability maps and uncertainty analysis. In terms of the existing literature CapsNet provides promising results and explicit merits in comparison with CNN and two baseline classifiers i.e. random forests RFs and support vector machines SVMs. Hyperspectral Image Classification with Capsule Network Using Limited Training Samples.
