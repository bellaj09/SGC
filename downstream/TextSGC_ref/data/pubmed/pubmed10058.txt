Prognostication is an essential tool for risk adjustment and decision making in the intensive care unit ICU. Research into prognostication in ICU has so far been limited to data from admission or the first 24 hours. Most ICU admissions last longer than this decisions are made throughout an admission and some admissions are explicitly intended as time-limited prognostic trials. Despite this temporal changes in prognostic ability during ICU admission has received little attention to date. Current predictive models in the form of prognostic clinical tools are typically derived from linear models and do not explicitly handle incremental information from trends. Machine learning ML allows predictive models to be developed which use non-linear predictors and complex interactions between variables thus allowing incorporation of trends in measured variables over time; this has made it possible to investigate prognosis throughout an admission.
