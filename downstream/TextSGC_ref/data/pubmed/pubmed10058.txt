With the recent advent of deep learning in medical image processing retinal blood vessel segmentation topic has been comprehensively handled by numerous research works. However since the ratio between the number of vessel and background pixels is heavily imbalanced many attempts utilized patches augmented from original fundus images along with fully convolutional networks for addressing such pixel-wise labeling problem which significantly costs computational resources. In this paper a method using Round-wise Features Aggregation on Bracket-shaped convolutional neural networks RFA-BNet is proposed to exclude the necessity of patches augmentation while efficiently handling the irregular and diverse representation of retinal vessels. Particularly given raw fundus images typical feature maps extracted from a pretrained backbone network are employed for a bracket-shaped decoder wherein middle-scale features are continuously exploited round-by-round. Then the decoded maps having highest resolution of each round are aggregated to enable the built model to flexibly learn various degrees of embedded semantic details while retaining proper annotations of thin and small vessels. Finally the proposed approach showed its effectiveness in terms of sensitivity 0.7932 specificity 0.9741 accuracy 0.9511 and AUROC 0.9732 on DRIVE dataset.
