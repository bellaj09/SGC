In recent times the detection of brain tumours has become more common. Generally a brain tumour is an abnormal mass of tissue where the cells grow uncontrollably and are apparently unregulated by the mechanisms that control cells. A number of techniques have been developed thus far; however the time needed in a detecting brain tumour is still a challenge in the field of image processing. This article proposes a new accurate detection model. The model includes certain processes such as preprocessing segmentation feature extraction and classification. Particularly two extreme processes such as contrast enhancement and skull stripping are processed under the initial phase. In the segmentation process we used the fuzzy means clustering FCM algorithm. Both the grey co-occurrence matrix GLCM as well as the grey-level run-length matrix GRLM features were extracted in the feature extraction phase. Moreover this paper uses a deep belief network DBN for classification. The optimized DBN concept is used here for which grey wolf optimisation GWO is used. The proposed model is termed the GW-DBN model. The proposed model compares its performance over other conventional methods in terms of accuracy specificity sensitivity precision negative predictive value NPV the F1Score and Matthews correlation coefficient MCC false negative rate FNR false positive rate FPR and false discovery rate FDR and proves the superiority of the proposed work. A robust grey wolf-based deep learning for brain tumour detection in MR images.
