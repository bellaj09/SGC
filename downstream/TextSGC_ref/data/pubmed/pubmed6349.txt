Gray matter GM atrophy associated with alcohol use disorders AUD affects predominantly the frontal lobes. Less is known how frontal lobe GM loss affects GM loss in other regions and how it influences drinking behavior or relapse after treatment. The profile similarity index PSI combined with graph analysis allows to assess how GM loss in one region affects GM loss in regions connected to it ie GM connectivity. The PSI was used to describe the pattern of GM connectivity in 21 light drinkers LDs and in 54 individuals with AUD ALC early in abstinence. Effects of abstinence and relapse were determined in a subgroup of 36 participants after 3 months. Compared with LD GM losses within the extended brain reward system eBRS at 1-month abstinence were similar between abstainers ABST and relapsers REL but REL had also GM losses outside the eBRS. Lower GM connectivities in ventro-striatal/hypothalamic and dorsolateral prefrontal regions and thalami were present in both ABST and REL. Between-networks connectivity loss of the eBRS in ABST was confined to prefrontal regions. About 3 months later the GM volume and connectivity losses had resolved in ABST and insula connectivity was increased compared with LD. GM losses and GM connectivity losses in REL were unchanged. Overall prolonged abstinence was associated with a normalization of within-eBRS connectivity and a reconnection of eBRS structures with other networks. The re-formation of structural connectivities within and across networks appears critical for cognitive-behavioral functioning related to the capacity to maintain abstinence after outpatient treatment.
