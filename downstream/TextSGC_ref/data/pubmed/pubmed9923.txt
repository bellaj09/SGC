Biopotential signals contain essential information for assessing functionality of organs and diagnosing diseases. We present a flexible sensor capable of measuring biopotentials in real time in wireless and fully-passive manner. The flexible sensor collects and transmits biopotentials to an external reader without wire battery or harvesting/regulating element. The sensor is fabricated on a 90\u202fm-thick polyimide substrate with footprint of 18\u202f\u202f15\u202f\u202f0.5\u202fmm3. The wireless fully-passive acquisition of biopotentials is enabled by the RF Radio Frequency microwave backscattering effect where the biopotentials are modulated by an array of varactors with incoming RF carrier that is backscattered to the external reader. The flexile sensor is verified and validated by emulated signal and Electrocardiogram ECG Electromyogram EMG and Electrooculogram EOG respectively. A deep learning algorithm analyzes the signal quality of wirelessly acquired data along with the data from commercially-available wired sensor counterparts. Wired and wireless data shows <3% discrepancy in deep learning testing accuracy for ECG and EMG up to the wireless distance of 240\u202fmm. Wireless acquisition of EOG further demonstrates accurate tracking of horizontal eye movement with deep learning training and testing accuracy reaching up to 93.6% and 92.2% respectively indicating successful detection of biopotentials signal as low as 250 VPP. These findings support that the real-time wireless fully-passive acquisition of on-body biopotentials is indeed feasible and may find various uses for future clinical research.
