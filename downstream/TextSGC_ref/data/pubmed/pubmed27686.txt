Brain-computer interfaces BCIs could potentially be used to interact with pathological brain signals to intervene and ameliorate their effects in disease states. Here we provide proof-of-principle of this approach by using a BCI to interpret pathological brain activity in patients with advanced Parkinson disease PD and to use this feedback to control when therapeutic deep brain stimulation DBS is delivered. Our goal was to demonstrate that by personalizing and optimizing stimulation in real time we could improve on both the efficacy and efficiency of conventional continuous DBS.
