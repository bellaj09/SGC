The hippocampus including the dorsal dentate gyrus dDG and cortex engage in bidirectional communication. We propose that low-frequency activity in hippocampal-cortical pathways contributes to brain-wide resting-state connectivity to integrate sensory information. Using optogenetic stimulation and brain-wide fMRI and resting-state fMRI rsfMRI we determined the large-scale effects of spatiotemporal-specific downstream propagation of hippocampal activity. Low-frequency 1 Hz but not high-frequency 40 Hz stimulation of dDG excitatory neurons evoked robust cortical and subcortical brain-wide fMRI responses. More importantly it enhanced interhemispheric rsfMRI connectivity in various cortices and hippocampus. Subsequent local field potential recordings revealed an increase in slow oscillations in dorsal hippocampus and visual cortex interhemispheric visual cortical connectivity and hippocampal-cortical connectivity. Meanwhile pharmacological inactivation of dDG neurons decreased interhemispheric rsfMRI connectivity. Functionally visually evoked fMRI responses in visual regions also increased during and after low-frequency dDG stimulation. Together our results indicate that low-frequency activity robustly propagates in the dorsal hippocampal-cortical pathway drives interhemispheric cortical rsfMRI connectivity and mediates visual processing. Low-frequency hippocampal-cortical activity drives brain-wide resting-state functional MRI connectivity.
