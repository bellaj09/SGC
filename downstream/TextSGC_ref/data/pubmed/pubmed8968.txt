The ventral lateral geniculate nucleus LGNv is a retinorecipient part of the ventral thalamus and in cats it consists of medial M medial intermediate IM lateral intermediate IL lateral L and dorsal D subdivisions. These subdivisions can be differentiated not only by their cytoarchitecture but also by their connectivity and putative functions. The LGNv may play a role in visuomotor gating in that there is evidence of cerebellar afferent projections to the intermediate subdivisions. The cerebellar posterior interpositus IP and lateral LC nuclei are known to project to IM and IL but the specifics of these projections are unclear. We hypothesized that the IP and LC project differentially to IM and IL. To evaluate LGNv innervation by the deep cerebellar nuclei we injected the tract-tracer wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase WGA-HRP into several different regions of the LGNv and cerebellar nuclei of adult cats in either sex. Small injections into the middle and posterior LGNv retrogradely labeled cells in the ventral part of the IP. However injections in the anterior regions of the LGNv with or without diffusion into the thalamic reticular nucleus Re retrogradely labeled cells in the ventral part of both the IP and the LC. Confirmatory injections into the IP and LC produced terminal-like labeling distributed in IM IL and Re; injections mostly localized to the LC resulted in labeling mainly in IM and Re. We concluded that the IP projects to IL whereas the LC projects to IM and Re. Cerebellar projections to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus in the cat.
