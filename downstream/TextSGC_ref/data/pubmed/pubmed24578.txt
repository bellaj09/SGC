Motor imagery MI based brain-computer interface BCI plays a crucial role in various scenarios ranging from post-traumatic rehabilitation to control prosthetics. Computer-aided interpretation of MI has augmented prior mentioned scenarios since decades but failed to address interpersonal variability. Such variability further escalates in case of multi-class MI which is currently a common practice. The failures due to interpersonal variability can be attributed to handcrafted features as they failed to extract more generalized features. The proposed approach employs convolution neural network CNN based model with both filtering through axis shuffling and feature extraction to avail end-to-end training. Axis shuffling is performed adopted in initial blocks of the model for 1D preprocessing and reduce the parameters required. Such practice has avoided the overfitting which resulted in an improved generalized model. Publicly available BCI Competition-IV 2a dataset is considered to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model has demonstrated the capability to identify subject-specific frequency band with an average and highest accuracy of 70.5% and S3.6% respectively. Proposed CNN model can classify in real time without relying on accelerated computing device like GPU.
