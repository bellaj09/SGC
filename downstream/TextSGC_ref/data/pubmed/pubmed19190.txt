"Due to limitations in their physical abilities adults with cerebral palsy CP have relatively few opportunities to engage in independent leisure activities. This pervasive lack of opportunity often leads to the development of dependent behavioral patterns and learned helplessness. The objective of this pilot study was to explore ways in which virtual reality can provide positive and enjoyable leisure experiences during physical interactions with different game-like virtual environments and potentially lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of self-empowerment. The study sample consisted of five young male adults with CP and severe intellectual disabilities who are non-speaking and who use wheelchairs for mobility. Each participant experienced three game-like virtual scenarios via VividGroups Gesture Xtreme video capture virtual reality VR system. The participants video captured image was processed on the same plane as screen graphical animations that react in real time in response to his movements. Outcome measures included the participants responses to a five-item presence questionnaire a 6-item task specific questionnaire and observation of their videotaped performance while participating in the virtual games. Participants responses to the questionnaire showed a high level of presence in all three scenarios. These participants demonstrated an exceptional degree of enthusiasm during each VR experience; some reacted to the various stimuli via appropriate and goal-oriented responses in other cases the response was more arbitrary. Documentation of behaviors during and following the VR experiences may provide insight into the important role that VR may play in nurturing their self-esteem and sense of empowerment." Virtual reality provides leisure time opportunities for young adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.
