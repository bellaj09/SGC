Deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to many image-processing problems in recent works. Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations making it easier to implement train and apply in practice and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.
