"The fatigue that users suffer when using steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs can cause a number of serious problems such as signal quality degradation and system performance deterioration users discomfort and even risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures posing heavy restrictions on the applications of SSVEP-based BCIs. Towards alleviating the fatigue a fundamental step is to measure and evaluate it but most existing works adopt self-reported questionnaire methods which are subjective offline and memory dependent. This paper proposes an objective and real-time approach based on electroencephalography EEG spectral analysis to evaluate the fatigue in SSVEP-based BCIs."
