Breast cancer is one of the most harmful diseases for women with the highest morbidity. An efficient way to decrease its mortality is to diagnose cancer earlier by screening. Clinically the best approach of screening for Asian women is ultrasound images combined with biopsies. However biopsy is invasive and it gets incomprehensive information of the lesion. The aim of this study is to build a model for automatic detection segmentation and classification of breast lesions with ultrasound images. Based on deep learning a technique using Mask regions with convolutional neural network was developed for lesion detection and differentiation between benign and malignant. The mean average precision was 0.75 for the detection and segmentation. The overall accuracy of benign/malignant classification was 85%. The proposed method provides a comprehensive and noninvasive way to detect and classify breast lesions. Detection and classification the breast tumors using mask R-CNN on sonograms.
