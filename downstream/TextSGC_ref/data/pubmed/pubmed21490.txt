For the last few years many feature extraction methods have been proposed based on biological signals. Among these the brain signals have the advantage that they can be obtained even by people with peripheral nervous system damage. Motor imagery electroencephalograms EEG are inexpensive to measure offer a high temporal resolution and are intuitive. Therefore these have received a significant amount of attention in various fields including signal processing cognitive science and medicine. The common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is a useful method for feature extraction from motor imagery EEG. However performance degradation occurs in a small-sample setting SSS because the CSP depends on sample-based covariance. Since the active frequency range is different for each subject it is also inconvenient to set the frequency range to be different every time. In this paper we propose the feature extraction method based on a filter bank to solve these problems. The proposed method consists of five steps. First motor imagery EEG is divided by a using filter bank. Second the regularized CSP R-CSP is applied to the divided EEG. Third we select the features according to mutual information based on the individual feature algorithm. Fourth parameter sets are selected for the ensemble. Finally we classify using ensemble based on features. The brain-computer interface competition III data set IVa is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method improves the mean classification accuracy by 12.34% 11.57% 9% 4.95% and 4.47% compared with CSP SR-CSP R-CSP filter bank CSP FBCSP and SR-FBCSP. Compared with the filter bank R-CSP    which is a parameter selection version of the proposed method the classification accuracy is improved by 3.49%. In particular the proposed method shows a large improvement in performance in the SSS. Filter Bank Regularized Common Spatial Pattern Ensemble for Small Sample Motor Imagery Classification.
