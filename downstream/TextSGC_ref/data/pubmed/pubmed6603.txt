Recent advances in artificial intelligence along with the development of large data sets of energies calculated using quantum mechanical QM/density functional theory DFT methods have enabled prediction of accurate molecular energies at reasonably low computational cost. However machine learning models that have been reported so far require the atomic positions obtained from geometry optimizations using high-level QM/DFT methods as input in order to predict the energies and do not allow for geometry optimization. In this study a transferable and molecule size-independent machine learning model bonds B angles A nonbonded N interactions and dihedrals D neural network BAND NN based on a chemically intuitive representation inspired by molecular mechanics force fields is presented. The model predicts the atomization energies of equilibrium and nonequilibrium structures as sum of energy contributions from bonds B angles A nonbonds N and dihedrals D at remarkable accuracy. The robustness of the proposed model is further validated by calculations that span over the conformational configurational and reaction space. The transferability of this model on systems larger than the ones in the data set is demonstrated by performing calculations on selected large molecules. Importantly employing the BAND NN model it is possible to perform geometry optimizations starting from nonequilibrium structures along with predicting their energies.
