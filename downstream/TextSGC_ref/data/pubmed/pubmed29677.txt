State of the art minimally invasive treatments and diagnostics of neurological and cardiovascular diseases demand for flexible instruments and implants that enable sensing and stimulation of bioelectric signals. Besides medical applications implantable bioelectronic brain-computer interfaces are envisioned as the next step in communication and data transfer. Conventional microelectrode arrays used for these types of applications are based on polymer substrates that are not suitable for biostable rigid and self-expanding devices. Here we present fully integrated bioelectrodes on superelastic NiTi carriers fabricated by microsystem technology processes. The insulation between the metallic NiTi structure and the Pt electrode layer is realized by different oxide layers SiOx TaOx and Yttrium stabilized Zirconia YSZ. Key properties of bioelectronic implants such as dissolution in body fluids biocompatibility mechanical properties and bioelectrical sensing/stimulation capabilities have been investigated by in vitro methods. Particular devices with YSZ are biostable and biocompatible enabling sensing and stimulation. The major advantage of this system is the combination of medically approved materials and novel fabrication technology that enables miniaturization and integration beyond the state-of-the-art processes. The results demonstrate that this functionalization of superelastic NiTi is an enabling technology for the development of new kinds of bioelectronic devices.
