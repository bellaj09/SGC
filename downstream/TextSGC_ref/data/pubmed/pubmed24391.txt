Genome-wide association studies GWAS are typically visualized using a two-dimensional Manhattan plot displaying chromosomal location of SNPs along the x-axis and the negative log-10 of their p-value on the y-axis. This traditional plot provides a broad overview of the results but offers little opportunity for interaction or expansion of specific regions and is unable to show additional dimensions of the dataset.
