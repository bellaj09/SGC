Traditionally brain-machine interfaces BMIs extract motor commands from a single brain to control the movements of artificial devices. Here we introduce a Brainet that utilizes very-large-scale brain activity VLSBA from two B2 or three B3 nonhuman primates to engage in a common motor behaviour. A B2 generated 2D movements of an avatar arm where each monkey contributed equally to X and Y coordinates; or one monkey fully controlled the X-coordinate and the other controlled the Y-coordinate. A B3 produced arm movements in 3D space while each monkey generated movements in 2D subspaces X-Y Y-Z or X-Z. With long-term training we observed increased coordination of behavior increased correlations in neuronal activity between different brains and modifications to neuronal representation of the motor plan. Overall performance of the Brainet improved owing to collective monkey behaviour. These results suggest that primate brains can be integrated into a Brainet which self-adapts to achieve a common motor goal. Computing Arm Movements with a Monkey Brainet.
