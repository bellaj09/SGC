Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of virtual reality-based eccentric training on lower extremity muscle activity and balance in stroke patients. Subjects and Methods Thirty stroke patients participated with 15 patients allotted to each of two eccentric training groups: one using a slow velocity group I and one using a fast velocity group II. The virtual reality-based eccentric training was performed by the patients for 30 minutes once a day 5 days a week for 8 weeks using an Eccentron system. Surface electromyography was used to measure the lower extremity muscle activity while a BioRescue was used to measure balancing ability. Results A significant difference in lower extremity muscle activation and balance ability was observed in group I compared with group II. Conclusion This study showed that virtual reality-based eccentric training using a slow velocity is effective for improving lower extremity muscle activity and balance in stroke patients.
