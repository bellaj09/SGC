Hypothalamic organizational concepts have greatly evolved as the primary hypothalamic pathways have been systematically investigated. In the present review we describe how the hypothalamus arises from a molecularly heterogeneous region of the embryonic neural tube but is first differentiated as a primary neuronal cell cord earliest mantle layer. This structure defines two axes that align onto two fundamental components: a longitudinal tractus postopticustpoc/retinian component and a transverse supraoptic tractsot/olfactory component. We then discuss how these two axonal tracts guide the formation of all major tracts that connect the telencephalon with the hypothalamus/ventral midbrain highlighting the existence of an early basic plan in the functional organization of the prosencephalic connectome. Characterization of a mammalian prosencephalic functional plan.
