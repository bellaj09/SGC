The study describes the application of a web-based software in the planning of the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms AAA. The software has been developed in the framework of a 2-year research project called Aneurysm QUAntification Through an Internet Collaborative System AQUATICS; it allows to manage remotely Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML models of the abdominal aorta derived from multirow computed tomography angiography CTA data sets and to obtain measurements of diameters angles and centerline lengths. To test the reliability of measurements two radiologists performed a detailed analysis of multiple 3D models generated from a synthetic phantom mimicking an AAA. The system was tested on 30 patients with AAA; CTA data sets were mailed and the time required for segmentation and measurement were collected for each case. The Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that the mean intra- and inter-observer differences in measures on phantoms were clinically acceptable. The mean time required for segmentation was 1 h range 45-120 min. The mean time required for measurements on the web was 7 min range 4-11 min. The AQUATICS web server may provide a rapid standardized and accurate tool for the evaluation of AAA prior to the endovascular treatment.
