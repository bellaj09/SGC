Electroencephalography EEG-based motor imagery MI brain-computer interface BCI technology has the potential to restore motor function by inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an EEG-based MI BCI system coupled with MIT-Manus shoulder-elbow robotic feedback BCI-Manus for subjects with chronic stroke with upper-limb hemiparesis. In this single-blind randomized trial 26 hemiplegic subjects Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery After Stroke FMMA score 4-40; 16 men; mean age 51.4 years; mean stroke duration 297.4 days prescreened with the ability to use the MI BCI were randomly allocated to BCI-Manus or Manus therapy lasting 18 hours over 4 weeks. Efficacy was measured using upper-extremity FMMA scores at weeks 0 2 4 and 12. ElEG data from subjects allocated to BCI-Manus were quantified using the revised brain symmetry index rBSI and analyzed for correlation with the improvements in FMMA score. Eleven and 15 subjects underwent BCI-Manus and Manus therapy respectively. One subject in the Manus group dropped out. Mean total FMMA scores at weeks 0 2 4 and 12 weeks improved for both groups: 26.310.3 27.412.0 30.813.8 and 31.513.5 for BCI-Manus and 26.618.9 29.920.6 32.921.4 and 33.920.2 for Manus with no intergroup differences P=.51. More subjects attained further gains in FMMA scores at week 12 from BCI-Manus 7 of 11 63.6% than Manus 5 of 14 35.7%. A negative correlation was found between the rBSI and FMMA score improvement P=.044. BCI-Manus therapy was well tolerated and not associated with adverse events. In conclusion BCI-Manus therapy is effective and safe for arm rehabilitation after severe poststroke hemiparesis. Motor gains were comparable to those attained with intensive robotic therapy 1040 repetitions/session despite reduced arm exercise repetitions using EEG-based MI-triggered robotic feedback 136 repetitions/session. The correlation of rBSI with motor improvements suggests that the rBSI can be used as a prognostic measure for BCI-based stroke rehabilitation.
