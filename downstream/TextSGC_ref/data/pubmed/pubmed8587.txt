"This Whats new in oncodermatology? addresses the developments in 2017 on the epidemiology and management of skin cancers. We observe a constant increase in carcinomas risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma especially in transplant recipients where skin cancer mortality is important. Among epidemiological developments in melanoma are increased mortality despite screening occupational exposure to UV second melanoma and higher risk after carcinoma. New classifications that should be considered are AJCC8 for melanoma and carcinoma. In a near future artificial intelligence could change skin cancer screening practices through deep learning. For the sentinel lymph node there is no interest in systematic lymphadenectomy that does not improve survival. Radiation therapy is essential for the prognosis of Merkels carcinoma and Mohs surgery can be of interest. In metastatic melanoma results on immunotherapy and targeted treatments include duration dose combinations and the study of resistance mechanisms. The great novelty is immunotherapy or targeted therapy as an adjuvant treatment giving an improvement in survival without relapse." "Whats new in oncodermatology?"
