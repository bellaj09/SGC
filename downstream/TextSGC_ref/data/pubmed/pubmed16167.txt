The segmentation of pancreas is important for medical image analysis yet it faces great challenges of class imbalance background distractions and non-rigid geometrical features. To address these difficulties we introduce a deep Q network DQN driven approach with deformable U-Net to accurately segment the pancreas by explicitly interacting with contextual information and extract anisotropic features from pancreas. The DQN-based model learns a context-adaptive localization policy to produce a visually tightened and precise localization bounding box of the pancreas. Furthermore deformable U-Net captures geometry-aware information of pancreas by learning geometrically deformable filters for feature extraction. The experiments on NIH dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in pancreas segmentation. Deep Q Learning Driven CT Pancreas Segmentation With Geometry-Aware U-Net.
