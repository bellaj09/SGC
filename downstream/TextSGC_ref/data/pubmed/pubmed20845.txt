The carrying out of training courses in surgical endoscopy for surgeons in training centres is becoming more common. In addition to adequately planning activities simulation systems are used to improve learning and monitor progression. Inanimate models and virtual reality programs increase psychomotor skills and assessment of performance. In this work we tried to improve our training program basically in training boxes by introducing a virtual simulator. Does the incorporation of a virtual simulator improve abilities in endoscopic surgery acquired with an inanimate simulator?.
