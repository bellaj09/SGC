Brain-machine interfaces BMIs also called brain-computer interfaces BCIs decode neural signals and use them to control some type of external device. Despite many experimental successes and terrific demonstrations in animals and humans a high-performance clinically viable device has not yet been developed for widespread usage. There are many factors that impact clinical viability and BMI performance. Arguably the first of these is the selection of brain signals used to control BMIs. In this review we summarize the physiological characteristics and performance-including movement-related information longevity and stability-of multiple types of input signals that have been used in invasive BMIs to date. These include intracortical spikes as well as field potentials obtained inside the cortex at the surface of the cortex electrocorticography and at the surface of the dura mater epidural signals. We also discuss the potential for future enhancements in input signal performance both by improving hardware and by leveraging the knowledge of the physiological characteristics of these signals to improve decoding and stability.
