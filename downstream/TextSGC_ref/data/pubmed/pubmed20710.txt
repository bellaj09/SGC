"As the characteristics of EEG signals change over time updating the classifier of a brain computer interface BCI over time would improve the performance of the system. Developing an adaptive classifier for a self-paced BCI however is not easy because the users intention and therefore the true labels of the EEG signals are not known during the operation of the system. For certain applications it may be possible to predict the labels of some of the EEG segments using some information about the users state e.g. the error potentials or gaze information. This study proposes a method that adaptively updates the classifier of a self-paced BCI in a supervised or semi-supervised manner using those EEG segments whose labels can be predicted. We employ the eye position information obtained from an eye-tracker to predict the EEG labels. This eye-tracker is also used along with a self-paced BCI to form a hybrid BCI system. The results obtained from seven individuals show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-adaptive and other unsupervised adaptive classifiers. It achieves a true positive rate of 49.7% and lowers the number of false positives significantly to only 2.2 FPs/minute."
