The aging population has led to an increase in cognitive impairment CI resulting in significant costs to patients their families and society. A research endeavor on a large cohort to better understand the frequency and severity of CI is urgent to respond to the health needs of this population. However little is known about temporal trends of patient health functions i.e. activity of daily living ADL and how these trends are associated with the onset of CI in elderly patients. Also the use of a rich source of clinical free text in electronic health records EHRs to facilitate CI research has not been well explored. The aim of this study is to characterize and better understand early signals of elderly patient CI by examining temporal trends of patient ADL and analyzing topics of patient medical conditions in clinical free text using topic models. Early temporal characteristics of elderly patient cognitive impairment in electronic health records.
