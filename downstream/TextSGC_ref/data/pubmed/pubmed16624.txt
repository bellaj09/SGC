Digital propagation of an off-axis hologram can provide the quantitative phase-contrast image if the exact distance between the sensor plane such as CCD and the reconstruction plane is correctly provided. In this paper we present a deep-learning convolutional neural network with a regression layer as the top layer to estimate the best reconstruction distance. The experimental results obtained using microsphere beads and red blood cells show that the proposed method can accurately predict the propagation distance from a filtered hologram. The result is compared with the conventional automatic focus-evaluation function. Additionally our approach can be utilized at the single-cell level which is useful for cell-to-cell depth measurement and cell adherent studies.
