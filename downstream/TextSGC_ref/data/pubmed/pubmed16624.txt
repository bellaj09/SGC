The presence of visual dependence as an influential factor on the development of functional stability in ambulatory individuals with cerebral palsy CP was studied in 22 adults with spastic bilateral CP 11 of whom were considered visually dependent and 18 healthy adults. Participants stood upright during pitch plane disturbances of the visual field and support surface. Intersegmental coordination behaviors were assessed by fitting trajectories of adjacent body segments to an ellipse. Mixed-model repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on ellipse orientation angle and area. Dissimilar stabilizing strategies adopted by the two groups with CP imply that visual dependence impacts postural control. Postural reorganization in response to visual flow in all groups indicates that we cannot ignore perceptual aspects of postural control when designing therapeutic interventions.
