Clinical and brain structural differences have been reported between patients with familial and sporadic schizophrenia; however little is known about the brain functional differences between the two subtypes of schizophrenia. Twenty-six patients with familial schizophrenia PFS 26 patients with sporadic schizophrenia PSS and 26 healthy controls HC underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The whole-brain functional network was constructed and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Topological properties including global nodal and edge measures were compared among the three groups. We found that PFS PSS and HC exhibited common small-world architecture of the functional brain networks. However at a global level only PFS showed significantly lower normalized clustering coefficient small-worldness and local efficiency indicating a randomization shift of their brain networks. At a regional level PFS and PSS disrupted different neural circuits consisting of abnormal nodes increased or decreased nodal centrality and edges decreased functional connectivity strength which were widely distributed throughout the entire brain. Furthermore some of these altered network measures were significantly correlated with severity of psychotic symptoms. These results suggest that familial and sporadic schizophrenia had segregated disruptions in the topological organization of the intrinsic functional brain network which may be due to different etiological contributions. Distinct disruptions of resting-state functional brain networks in familial and sporadic schizophrenia.
