Immersive Virtual Reality VR distraction can be used in addition to traditional opioids to reduce procedural pain. The current study explored whether a High-Tech-VR helmet ie a 60-degree field-of-view head-mounted display reduces pain more effectively than a Low-Tech-VR helmet a 35-degree field-of-view head-mounted display. Using a double-blind between-groups design 77 healthy volunteers no patients aged 18-23 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Each subject received a brief baseline thermal pain stimulus and the same stimulus again minutes later while in SnowWorld using a Low-Tech-VR helmet Group 1 using a High-Tech-VR helmet Group 2 or receiving no distraction Group 3 control group. Each participant provided subjective 0-10 ratings of cognitive sensory and affective components of pain and amount of fun during the pain stimulus. Compared to the Low-Tech-VR helmet group subjects in the High-Tech-VR helmet group reported 34% more reduction in worst pain P < .05 46% more reduction in pain unpleasantness P = .001 29% more reduction in "time spent thinking about pain" P < .05 and 32% more fun during the pain stimulus in VR P < .05. Only 29% of participants in the Low-Tech helmet group as opposed to 65% of participants in the High-Tech-VR helmet group showed a clinically significant reduction in pain intensity during virtual reality. These results highlight the importance of using an appropriately designed VR helmet to achieve effective VR analgesia see . Virtual reality helmet display quality influences the magnitude of virtual reality analgesia.
