We developed a deep learning neural network the Shape Variation Analyzer SVA that allows disease staging of bony changes in temporomandibular joint TMJ osteoarthritis OA. The sample was composed of 259 TMJ CBCT scans for the training set and 34 for the testing dataset. The 3D meshes had been previously classified in 6 groups by 2 expert clinicians. We improved the robustness of the training data using data augmentation SMOTE to alleviate over-fitting and to balance classes. We combined geometrical features and a shape descriptor heat kernel signature to describe every shape. The results were compared to nine different supervised machine learning algorithms. The deep learning neural network was the most accurate for classification of TMJ OA. In conclusion SVA is a 3D Sheer extension that classifies pathology of the temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis cases based on 3D morphology. Shape variation analyzer: a classifier for temporomandibular joint damaged by osteoarthritis.
