"A portfolio assessment system has been introduced into a biomedical science programme to promote both continuous learning and deep approaches to learning. Attention has been focused on creating harmony between the assessment system and the PBL curriculum of the programme. Biomedicine and laboratory work are central in the curriculum. The portfolio included evidence of laboratory work personal reflections and certificates from the PBL tutor. The portfolio was assessed on three occasions over 20 weeks. The grades were pass or fail. The tutor certificate appeared to be a crucial part of the portfolio since a fail in this part usually led to an overall fail. Both students and teachers were concerned about ensuring that enough factual knowledge as measured by a traditional test had been achieved. The agreement was good enough for the pass or fail level but some expected differences were found at the detailed level. The course including the portfolio was evaluated orally during weekly whole-group meetings and using a questionnaire at the end. The students felt comfortable with the portfolio system and preferred it to a traditional test. The teachers felt that they needed to develop their teacher-student discussion skills and to improve their feedback on the reflections. Peer assessment between students is proposed as a line of action to enhance the credibility of the crucial tutor certificate. The portfolio might be an efficient tool for the students to concentrate their efforts on the most central concepts of medical laboratory work. The model will be developed through further discussions and better consensus among faculty." Portfolio as a method for continuous assessment in an undergraduate health education programme.
