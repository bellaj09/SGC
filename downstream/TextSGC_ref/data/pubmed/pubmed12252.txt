Various power-constrained contrast enhance-ment PCCE techniques have been applied to an organic light emitting diode OLED display for reducing the pow-er demands of the display while preserving the image qual-ity. In this paper we propose a new deep learning-based PCCE scheme that constrains the power consumption of the OLED displays while enhancing the contrast of the displayed image. In the proposed method the power con-sumption is constrained by simply reducing the brightness a certain ratio whereas the perceived visual quality is pre-served as much as possible by enhancing the contrast of the image using a convolutional neural network CNN. Furthermore our CNN can learn the PCCE technique without a reference image by unsupervised learning. Ex-perimental results show that the proposed method is supe-rior to conventional ones in terms of image quality assess-ment metrics such as a visual saliency-induced index VSI and a measure of enhancement EME.1.
