Electroencephalography EEG monitors brain activity during sleep and is used to identify sleep disorders. In sleep medicine clinicians interpret raw EEG signals in so-called sleep stages which are assigned by experts to every 30s window of signal. For diagnosis they also rely on shorter prototypical micro-architecture events which exhibit variable durations and shapes such as spindles K-complexes or arousals. Annotating such events is traditionally performed by a trained sleep expert making the process time consuming tedious and subject to inter-scorer variability. To automate this procedure various methods have been developed yet these are event-specific and rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features.
