"Although the inter-subject information has been demonstrated to be effective for a rapid calibration of the P300-based brain-computer interface BCI it has never been comprehensively tested to find if the incorporation of heterogeneous data could enhance the accuracy. This study aims to improve the subject-specific P300 classifier by adding other subjects data. A classifier calibration strategy weighted ensemble learning generic information WELGI was developed in which elementary classifiers were constructed by using both the intra- and inter-subject information and then integrated into a strong classifier with a weight assessment. 55 subjects were recruited to spell 20 characters offline using the conventional P300-based BCI i.e. the P300-speller. Four different metrics the P300 accuracy and precision the round accuracy and the character accuracy were performed for a comprehensive investigation. The results revealed that the classifier constructed on the training dataset in combination with adding other subjects data was significantly superior to that without the inter-subject information. Therefore the WELGI is an effective classifier calibration strategy which uses the inter-subject information to improve the accuracy of subject-specific P300 classifiers and could also be applied to other BCI paradigms."
