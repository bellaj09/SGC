Using electroencephalography EEG psychophysiology and psychometric measures this is the first study which investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of spatial presence. Spatial presence is considered a sense of being physically situated within a spatial environment portrayed by a medium e.g. television virtual reality. Twelve healthy children and 11 healthy adolescents were watching different virtual roller coaster scenarios. During a control session the roller coaster cab drove through a horizontal roundabout track. The following realistic roller coaster rides consisted of spectacular ups downs and loops. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography LORETA and event-related desynchronization ERD were used to analyze the EEG data. As expected we found that compared to the control condition experiencing a virtual roller coaster ride evoked in both groups strong SP experiences increased electrodermal reactions and activations in parietal brain areas known to be involved in spatial navigation. In addition brain areas that receive homeostatic afferents from somatic and visceral sensations of the body were strongly activated. Most interesting children as compared to adolescents reported higher spatial presence experiences and demonstrated a different frontal activation pattern. While adolescents showed increased activation in prefrontal areas known to be involved in the control of executive functions children demonstrated a decreased activity in these brain regions. Interestingly recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies have shown that the frontal brain continues to develop to adult status well into adolescence. Thus the result of our study implies that the increased spatial presence experience in children may result from the not fully developed control functions of the frontal cortex.
