In our daily life experience the angular size of an object correlates with its distance from the observer provided that the physical size of the object remains constant. In this work we investigated depth perception in action space i.e. beyond the arm reach while keeping the angular size of the target object constant. This was achieved by increasing the physical size of the target object as its distance to the observer increased. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a similar protocol has been tested in action space for distances to the observer ranging from 1.4-2.4 m. We replicated the task in virtual and real environments and we found that the performance was significantly different between the two environments. In the real environment all participants perceived the depth of the target object precisely. Whereas in virtual reality VR the responses were significantly less precise although still above chance level in 16 of the 20 observers. The difference in the discriminability of the stimuli was likely due to different contributions of the convergence and the accommodation cues in the two environments. The values of Weber fractions estimated in our study were compared to those reported in previous studies in peripersonal and action space.
