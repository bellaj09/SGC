Growing interest exists for superolateral medial forebrain bundle slMFB deep brain stimulation DBS in psychiatric disorders. The surgical approach warrants tractographic rendition. Commercial stereotactic planning systems use deterministic tractography which suffers from inherent limitations is dependent on manual interaction ROI definition and has to be regarded as subjective. We aimed to develop an objective but patient-specific tracking of the slMFB which at the same time allows the use of a commercial surgical planning system in the context of deep brain stimulation. Machine learning-aided personalized DTI tractographic planning for deep brain stimulation of the superolateral medial forebrain bundle using HAMLET.
