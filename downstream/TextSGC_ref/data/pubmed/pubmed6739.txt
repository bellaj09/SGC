The human microbiome plays a number of critical roles impacting almost every aspect of human health and well-being. Conditions in the microbiome have been linked to a number of significant diseases. Additionally revolutions in sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in publicly-available sequencing data. Consequently there have been growing efforts to predict disease status from metagenomic sequencing data with a proliferation of new approaches in the last few years. Some of these efforts have explored utilizing a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning which has been applied successfully in several biological domains. Here we review some of these methods and the algorithms that they are based on with a particular focus on deep learning methods. We also perform a deeper analysis of Type 2 Diabetes and obesity datasets that have eluded improved results using a variety of machine learning and feature extraction methods. We conclude by offering perspectives on study design considerations that may impact results and future directions the field can take to improve results and offer more valuable conclusions.
