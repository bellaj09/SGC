The gap between the computational and semantic features is the one of major factors that bottlenecks the computer-aided diagnosis CAD performance from clinical usage. To bridge this gap we exploit three multi-task learning MTL schemes to leverage heterogeneous computational features derived from deep learning models of stacked denoising autoencoder SDAE and convolutional neural network CNN as well as hand-crafted Haar-like and HoG features for the description of 9 semantic features for lung nodules in CT images. We regard that there may exist relations among the semantic features of "spiculation" "texture" "margin" etc. that can be explored with the MTL. The Lung Image Database Consortium LIDC data is adopted in this study for the rich annotation resources. The LIDC nodules were quantitatively scored w.r.t. 9 semantic features from 12 radiologists of several institutes in U.S.A. By treating each semantic feature as an individual task the MTL schemes select and map the heterogeneous computational features toward the radiologists\ ratings with cross validation evaluation schemes on the randomly selected 2400 nodules from the LIDC dataset. The experimental results suggest that the predicted semantic scores from the three MTL schemes are closer to the radiologists\ ratings than the scores from single-task LASSO and elastic net regression methods. The proposed semantic attribute scoring scheme may provide richer quantitative assessments of nodules for better support of diagnostic decision and management. Meanwhile the capability of the automatic association of medical image contents with the clinical semantic terms by our method may also assist the development of medical search engine.
