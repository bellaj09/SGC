Traditional methods for drug discovery are time-consuming and expensive so efforts are being made to repurpose existing drugs. To find new ways for drug repurposing many computational approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions DTIs. However due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets extracted from drugs and targets traditional machine learning approaches such as logistic regression analysis cannot analyze these data sets efficiently. To overcome this issue we propose LASSO Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based regularized linear classification models and a LASSO-DNN Deep Neural Network model based on LASSO feature selection to predict DTIs. These methods are demonstrated for repurposing drugs for breast cancer treatment. Predicting drug-target interaction network using deep learning model.
