Stressful life events are related to negative outcomes including physical and psychological manifestations of distress and behavioral deficits. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer report impaired attention and working memory prior to adjuvant therapy which may be induced by distress. In this article we examine whether brain dynamics show systematic changes due to the distress associated with cancer diagnosis. We hypothesized that impaired working memory is associated with suppression of "long-memory" neuronal dynamics; we tested this by measuring scale-free "fractal" brain dynamics quantified by the Hurst exponent H. Fractal scaling refers to signals that do not occur at a specific time-scale possessing a spectral power curve Pf f-; they are "long-memory" processes with significant autocorrelations. In a BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging study we scanned three groups during a working memory task: women scheduled to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy and aged-matched controls. Surprisingly patients\ BOLD signal exhibited greater H with increasing intensity of anticipated treatment. However an analysis of H and functional connectivity against self-reported measures of psychological distress Worry Anxiety Depression and physical distress Fatigue Sleep problems revealed significant interactions. The modulation of Worry Anxiety versus Fatigue Sleep Problems Depression showed the strongest effect where higher worry and lower fatigue was related to reduced H in regions involved in visuospatial search attention and memory processing. This is also linked to decreased functional connectivity in these brain regions. Our results indicate that the distress associated with cancer diagnosis alters BOLD scaling and H is a sensitive measure of the interaction between psychological versus physical distress. Scale-free brain dynamics under physical and psychological distress: pre-treatment effects in women diagnosed with breast cancer.
