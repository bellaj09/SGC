Given the availability of empirically supported practices for addressing posttraumatic stress disorder and other forms of trauma-related distress the development and implementation of new technology to deliver these treatments is exciting. Technological innovations in this literature aim to expand availability of empirically based intervention increase treatment adherence and acceptability and overcome barriers commonly encountered with conventional trauma-focused treatment. Much of the current research on these technological developments consists of brief reviews and case studies of the separate therapy modalities. Although this work serves to document the appeal and utility of these innovations it does not provide comprehensive information about the host of options available. To that end the three general categories of technological advances in trauma therapy i.e. videoconferencing e-Health virtual reality are reviewed here including information regarding their empirical support and suggestions for future research and clinical practice. Technological advances in the treatment of trauma: a review of promising practices.
