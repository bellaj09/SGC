"We describe a new and freely available 3D interactive model of the intracranial internal carotid artery ICA and the skull base that also allows to display and compare its main segment classifications. High-resolution 3D human angiography isometric voxels size 0.36\xa0mm and Computed Tomography angiography images were exported to Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML format for processing in a 3D software platform and embedding in a 3D Portable Document Format PDF document that can be freely downloaded at http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/112442 and runs under Acrobat Reader on Mac and Windows computers and Windows 10 tablets. The 3D-PDF allows for visualisation and interaction through JavaScript-based functions including zoom rotation selective visualization and transparentation of structures or a predefined sequence view of the main segment classifications if desired. The ICA and its main branches and loops the Gasserian ganglion the petrolingual ligament and the proximal and distal dural rings within the skull base environment anterior and posterior clinoid processes silla turcica ethmoid and sphenoid bones orbital fossae may be visualized from different perspectives. This interactive 3D-PDF provides virtual views of the ICA and becomes an innovative tool to improve the understanding of the neuroanatomy of the ICA and surrounding structures."
