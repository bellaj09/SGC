"Event-related potentials ERPs are widely used in brain-computer interface BCI systems as input signals conveying a subjects intention. A fast and reliable single-trial ERP detection method can be used to develop a BCI system with both high speed and high accuracy. However most of single-trial ERP detection methods are developed for offline EEG analysis and thus have a high computational complexity and need manual operations. Therefore they are not applicable to practical BCI systems which require a low-complexity and automatic ERP detection method. This work presents a joint spatial-time-frequency filter that combines common spatial patterns CSP and wavelet filtering WF for improving the signal-to-noise SNR of visual evoked potentials VEP which can lead to a single-trial ERP-based BCI." Single-trial detection of visual evoked potentials by common spatial patterns and wavelet filtering for brain-computer interface.
