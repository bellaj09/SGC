Intracortical electrodes are important tools with applications ranging from fundamental laboratory studies to potential solutions to intractable clinical applications. However the longevity and reliability of the interfaces remain their major limitation to the wider implementation and adoption of this technology especially in broader translational work. Accordingly this review summarizes the most significant biological and technical factors influencing the long-term performance of intracortical electrodes. In a laboratory setting intracortical electrodes have been used to study the normal and abnormal function of the brain. This improved understanding has led to valuable insights regarding many neurological conditions. Likewise clinical applications of intracortical brain-machine interfaces offer the ability to improve the quality of life of many patients afflicted with high-level paralysis from spinal cord injury brain stem stroke amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other conditions. It is widely hypothesized that the tissue response to the electrodes including inflammation limits their longevity. Many studies have examined and modified the tissue response to intracortical electrodes to improve future intracortical electrode technologies. Overall the relationship between biological mechanical and technological considerations are crucial for the fidelity of chronic electrode recordings and represent a presently active area of investigation in the field of neural engineering. Biological mechanical and technological considerations affecting the longevity of intracortical electrode recordings.
