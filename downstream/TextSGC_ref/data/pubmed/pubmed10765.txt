Machine-learning ML techniques have rapidly found applications in many domains of materials chemistry and physics where large data sets are available. Aiming to accelerate the discovery of materials for battery applications in this work we develop a tool  http://se.cmich.edu/batteries  based on ML models to predict voltages of electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. To this end we use deep neural network support vector machine and kernel ridge regression as ML algorithms in combination with data taken from the Materials Project database as well as feature vectors from properties of chemical compounds and elemental properties of their constituents. We show that our ML models have predictive capabilities for different reference test sets and as an example we utilize them to generate a voltage profile diagram and compare it to density functional theory calculations. In addition using our models we propose nearly 5000 candidate electrode materials for Na- and K-ion batteries. We also make available a web-accessible tool that within a minute can be used to estimate the voltage of any bulk electrode material for a number of metal ions. These results show that ML is a promising alternative for computationally demanding calculations as a first screening tool of novel materials for battery applications.
