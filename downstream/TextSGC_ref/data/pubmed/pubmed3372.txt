The wiring of synaptic connections in the developing mammalian brain is shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals. One point where these regulatory pathways converge is via the sensory experience-dependent regulation of new gene transcription. Recent studies have elucidated a number of molecular mechanisms that allow nuclear transcription factors and chromatin regulatory proteins to encode aspects of specificity in experience-dependent synapse development. Here we review the evidence for the transcriptional mechanisms that sculpt activity-dependent aspects of synaptic connectivity during postnatal development and discuss how disruption of these processes is associated with aberrant brain development in autism and intellectual disability.
