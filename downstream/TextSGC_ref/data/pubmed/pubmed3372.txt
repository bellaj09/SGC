"Brain connectivity investigations are becoming increasingly multimodal and they present challenges for quantitatively characterizing and interactively visualizing data. In this study we present a new set of network-based software tools for combining functional and anatomical connectivity from magnetic resonance imaging MRI data. The computational tools are available as part of Functional and Tractographic Connectivity Analysis Toolbox FATCAT a toolbox that interfaces with Analysis of Functional NeuroImages AFNI and SUrface MApping SUMA for interactive queries and visualization. This includes a novel tractographic mini-probabilistic approach to improve streamline tracking in networks. We show how one obtains more robust tracking results for determining white matter connections by utilizing the uncertainty of the estimated diffusion tensor imaging DTI parameters and a few Monte Carlo iterations. This allows for thresholding based on the number of connections between target pairs to reduce the presence of tracts likely due to noise. To assist users in combining data we describe an interface for navigating and performing queries in two-dimensional and three-dimensional data defined over voxel surface tract and graph domains. These varied types of information can be visualized simultaneously and the queries performed interactively using SUMA and AFNI. The methods have been designed to increase the users ability to visualize and combine functional MRI and DTI modalities particularly in the context of single-subject inferences e.g. in deep brain stimulation studies. Finally we present a multivariate framework for statistically modeling network-based features in group analysis which can be implemented for both functional and structural studies."
