Data annotation finds increasing use in Virtual Reality applications with the goal to support the data analysis process such as architectural reviews. In this context a variety of different annotation systems for application to immersive virtual environments have been presented. While many interesting interaction designs for the data annotation workflow have emerged from them important details and evaluations are often omitted. In particular we observe that the process of handling metadata to interactively create and manage complex annotations is often not covered in detail. In this paper we strive to improve this situation by focusing on the design of data annotation workflows and their evaluation. We propose a workflow design that facilitates the most important annotation operations i.e. annotation creation review and modification. Our workflow design is easily extensible in terms of supported annotation and metadata types as well as interaction techniques which makes it suitable for a variety of application scenarios. To evaluate it we have conducted a user study in a CAVE-like virtual environment in which we compared our design to two alternatives in terms of a realistic annotation creation task. Our design obtained good results in terms of task performance and user experience. Design and Evaluation of Data Annotation Workflows for CAVE-like Virtual Environments.
