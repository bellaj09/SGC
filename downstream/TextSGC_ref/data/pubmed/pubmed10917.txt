Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations electrodiagnostic studies and since recently magnetic resonance neurography MRN. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859  0.061 and 0.719  0.128 Hausdorff distances of 13.9  26.6 and 12.4  12.1 mm and volumetric similarities of 0.930  0.054 and 0.897  0.109 for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second which is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19  8 min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as biomarker for lesion burden or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible time.
