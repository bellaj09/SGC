In this study an advanced Kinect sensor was adopted to acquire infrared radiation IR images for liveness detection. The proposed liveness detection method based on infrared radiation IR images can deal with face spoofs. Face pictures were acquired by a Kinect camera and converted into IR images. Feature extraction and classification were carried out by a deep neural network to distinguish between real individuals and face spoofs. IR images collected by the Kinect camera have depth information. Therefore the IR pixels from live images have an evident hierarchical structure while those from photos or videos have no evident hierarchical feature. Accordingly two types of IR images were learned through the deep network to realize the identification of whether images were from live individuals. In comparison with other liveness detection cross-databases our recognition accuracy was 99.8% and better than other algorithms. FaceNet is a face recognition model and it is robust to occlusion blur illumination and steering. We combined the liveness detection and FaceNet model for identity authentication. For improving the application of the authentication approach we proposed two improved ways to run the FaceNet model. Experimental results showed that the combination of the proposed liveness detection and improved face recognition had a good recognition effect and can be used for identity authentication.
