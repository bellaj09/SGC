"The surgeons knowledge of a patients individual anatomy is critical in skull base surgery. Trainees and experienced surgeons can benefit from surgical simulation; however current models are expensive and impractical for widespread use. In this study we report a next-generation mixed-reality surgical simulator. We segmented critical anatomic structures for 3-dimensional 3D models to develop a modular teaching tool. We then developed a navigation tracking system utilizing a 3D-printed endoscope as a trackable virtual-reality VR controller and validated the accuracy on VR and 3D-printed skull models within 1 cm. We combined VR and augmented-reality visual cues with our 3D physical model to simulate sinus endoscopy and highlight segmented structures in real time. This report provides evidence that a mixed-reality simulator combining VR and 3D-printed models is feasible and may prove useful as an educational tool that is low cost and customizable."
