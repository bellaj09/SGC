2-dimensional movement control is an interesting issue in Brain-Computer Interface. In this paper we present a motor imagery based 2-D cursor control paradigm. To move the cursor to a random position two-class motor imagery is simultaneously combined to output 2-D command which directly points to target position. A center-out experiment 8 targets is set to verify the proposed paradigm. The results of the online experiment three subjects participated validate the proposed strategy very well. Control 2-dimensional movement using a three-class motor imagery based brain-computer interface.
