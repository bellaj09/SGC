Synthetic devices for traceless remote control of gene expression may provide new treatment opportunities in future gene- and cell-based therapies. Here we report the design of a synthetic mind-controlled gene switch that enables human brain activities and mental states to wirelessly programme the transgene expression in human cells. An electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI processing mental state-specific brain waves programs an inductively linked wireless-powered optogenetic implant containing designer cells engineered for near-infrared NIR light-adjustable expression of the human glycoprotein SEAP secreted alkaline phosphatase. The synthetic optogenetic signalling pathway interfacing the BCI with target gene expression consists of an engineered NIR light-activated bacterial diguanylate cyclase DGCL producing the orthogonal second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c-di-GMP which triggers the stimulator of interferon genes STING-dependent induction of synthetic interferon- promoters. Humans generating different mental states biofeedback control concentration meditation can differentially control SEAP production of the designer cells in culture and of subcutaneous wireless-powered optogenetic implants in mice.
