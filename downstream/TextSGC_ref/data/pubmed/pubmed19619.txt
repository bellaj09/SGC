Motor impairments are very common in multiple sclerosis MS leading to a reduced Quality of Life and active participation. In the past decades new insights into the functional reorganization processes that occur after a brain injury have been introduced. Specifically the motor practice seems to be determinant to induce neuroplastic changes and motor recovery. More recently these findings have been extended to multiple sclerosis in particular it has been hypothesized that disease progression functional reorganization and disability are mutually related. For this reason neuroplasticity-based technologies and interventions have been rapidly introduced in MS rehabilitation. Constraint-induced movement therapy CIMT robotics and virtual reality training are new rehabilitative interventions that deliver an intensive e task-specific practice which are two critical factors associated with functional improvements and cortical reorganization. Another promising strategy for enhancing neuroplastic changes is non-invasive brain stimulation that can be used with a priming effect on motor training. The aims of this chapter are to review the evidence of neuroplastic changes in multiple sclerosis and to present technologies and interventions that have been tested in clinical trials. Neuroplasticity-Based Technologies and Interventions for Restoring Motor Functions in Multiple Sclerosis.
