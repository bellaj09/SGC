"Delineation of the cardiac structures from 2D echocardiographic images is a common clinical task to establish a diagnosis. Over the past decades the automation of this task has been the subject of intense research. In this paper we evaluate how far the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural network methods can go at assessing 2D echocardiographic images i.e. segmenting cardiac structures and estimating clinical indices on a dataset especially designed to answer this objective. We therefore introduce the cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation dataset the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for the purpose of echocardiographic assessment. The dataset contains two and four-chamber acquisitions from 500 patients with reference measurements from one cardiologist on the full dataset and from three cardiologists on a fold of 50 patients. Results show that encoder-decoder-based architectures outperform state-of-the-art non-deep learning methods and faithfully reproduce the expert analysis for the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes with a mean correlation of 0.95 and an absolute mean error of 9.5 ml. Concerning the ejection fraction of the left ventricle results are more contrasted with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.80 and an absolute mean error of 5.6%. Although these results are below the inter-observer scores they remain slightly worse than the intra-observers ones. Based on this observation areas for improvement are defined which open the door for accurate and fully-automatic analysis of 2D echocardiographic images."
