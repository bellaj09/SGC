To precisely diagnose the rotating machinery structural faults especially structural faults under low rotating speeds a novel scheme based on combination of empirical mode decomposition EMD sample entropy and deep belief network DBN is proposed in this paper. EMD can decompose a signal into several intrinsic mode functions IMFs with different signal-to-noise ratios SNRs and sample entropy is performed to extract the signals that carry fault information with high SNR. The extracted fault signal is reconstructed into a new vibration signal that will carry abundant fault information. DBN has strong feature extraction and classification performance. It is suitably performed to build the diagnosis model based on the reconstructed signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by structural faults signal and the comparative experiments BPNN CNN time-domain signal only frequency-domain signal only. The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method is between 99% and 100% the BPNN is less than 25% and the CNN is between 70% and 95% which means the verified proposed method has a superior performance to diagnose the structural fault.
