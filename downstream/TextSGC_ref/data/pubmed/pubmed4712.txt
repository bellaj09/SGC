Slow oscillations a defining characteristic of the nonrapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram EEG proliferate across the scalp in highly reproducible patterns. In adults the propagation of slow oscillations is a recognized fingerprint of brain connectivity and excitability. In this study we 1 describe for the first time maturational features of sleep slow oscillation propagation in children n = 23; 2-13 years using high-density hd EEG and 2 examine associations between sleep slow oscillatory propagation characteristics ie distance traveling speed cortical involvement and white matter myelin microstructure as measured with multicomponent Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2-magnetic resonance imaging mcDESPOT-MRI. Results showed that with increasing age slow oscillations propagated across longer distances average growth of 0.2 cm per year; R21 = 0.50 p < .05 while traveling speed and cortical involvement ie slow oscillation expanse remained unchanged across childhood. Cortical involvement R20 = 0.44 and slow oscillation speed R20 = -0.47; both p < .05 corrected for age were associated with myelin content in the superior longitudinal fascicle the largest anterior-posterior intrahemispheric white matter connectivity tract. Furthermore slow oscillation distance was moderately associated with whole-brain R21 = 0.46 p < .05 and interhemispheric myelin content the latter represented by callosal myelin water fraction R21 = 0.54 p < .01 uncorrected. Thus we demonstrate age-related changes in slow oscillation propagation distance as well as regional associations between brain activity during sleep and the anatomical connectivity of white matter microstructure. Our findings make an important contribution to knowledge of the brain connectome using a noninvasive and novel analytic approach. These data also have implications for understanding the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders and the role of sleep in brain maturation trajectories.
