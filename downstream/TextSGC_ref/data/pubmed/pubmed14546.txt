Diabetic Retinopathy DR is considered a pathology of retinal vascular complications which stays in the top causes of vision impairment and blindness. Therefore precisely inspecting its progression enables the ophthalmologists to set up appropriate next-visit schedule and cost-effective treatment plans. In the literature existing work only makes use of numerical attributes in Electronic Medical Records EMR for acquiring such kind of DR-oriented knowledge through conventional machine learning techniques which require an exhaustive job of engineering most impactful risk factors. Bimodal learning via trilogy of skip-connection deep networks for diabetic retinopathy risk progression identification.
