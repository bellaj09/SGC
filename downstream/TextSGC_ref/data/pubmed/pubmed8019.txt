Schizophrenia SZ is a serious and incurable mental disorder characterized by clinical manifestations of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. High-frequency deep brain stimulation DBS of the ventral hippocampus VHP has been recently applied as a therapeutic approach for SZ in both experimental and clinical studies. However little is known about the precise mechanism of VHP-DBS treatment for SZ and the role of hippocampal cell activation in the pathogenesis of SZ. With optogenetic technology in this study we tried to inhibit neuronal activity in the VHP which has dense projections to the prefrontal cortex before measuring long stumulus-induced delay eyeblink conditioning long-dEBC in a rodent model of SZ. Rats were administrated with phencyclidine PCP 3 mg/kg 1/d ip for successive 7 days before optogenetic intervention. The current data show that PCP administration causes significant impairment in the acquisition and timing of long-dEBC; the inhibition of bilateral VHP neurons alleviates the decreased acquisition and impaired timing of longd-dEBC in PCP-administered rats. The results provide direct evidence at the cellular level that the inhibition of VHP neuronal cells may be a prominent effect of hippocampal DBS intervention and increased activity in the hippocampal network play a pivotal role in SZ. Optogenetic inhibition of ventral hippocampal neurons alleviates associative motor learning dysfunction in a rodent model of schizophrenia.
