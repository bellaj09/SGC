Research has shown that many smokers experience an increase in the desire to smoke when exposed to smoking-related cues. Cue exposure treatment CET refers to the manualized repeated exposure to smoking-related cues aimed at the reducing cue reactivity by extinction. In this study we constructed a virtual reality system for evoking a desire of nicotine which was based on the results of a Questionnaire of Nicotine-craving. And we investigated the effectiveness of the virtual reality system as compared to classical device pictures. As a result we reached the conclusion that virtual reality elicits more craving symptoms than the classical devices. Experimental application of virtual reality for nicotine craving through cue exposure.
