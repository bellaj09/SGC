Medical education technology initiatives can be used to prepare osteopathic medical students for modern primary care practice and to provide students with training to serve vulnerable populations. Over academic years 2014 through 2017 the authors designed and implemented 26 case studies using patient simulations through a virtual community health center CHC. First-year students who were preparing for clinical training in CHCs and second-year students who were training in CHCs completed the simulation case studies gaining practice in clinical reasoning Health Systems Science and applied osteopathic principles and practice. This article explains the project illustrates an alignment with Health Systems Science and osteopathic competencies and highlights findings from previous research studies.
