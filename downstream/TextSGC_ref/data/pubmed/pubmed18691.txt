The evolution of image-guided and robot-assisted procedures can be beneficial to intracardiac interventions. This paper proposes a novel approach and a virtual reality system for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance of cardiac procedures and for investigating the kinematics and control of a virtual robotic manipulator based on MRI CINE images. The system incorporates dedicated software modules for processing MR images generating dynamic trajectories in the continuously changing environment of a beating heart controlling a specific generic virtual manipulator along those trajectories and a virtual reality interface that fuses all those information. The proposed system is applied for the simulation of accessing the aortic valve annulus via a small incision on the apex by maneuvering a robotic manipulator through an access corridor that safely transverses the left ventricle LV of the beating heart. A novel virtual reality environment for preoperative planning and simulation of image guided intracardiac surgeries with robotic manipulators.
