Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 8 weeks of Wii Fit balance game training on the balance abilities of students with intellectual disabilities. Subjects and Methods Twenty-four students with intellectual disabilities were selected and randomly divided into Wii Fit balance game training physical education and sedentary activity groups. The Wii Fit balance game training group received two 40-minute Wii Fit balance game training sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare differences. Results After eight weeks of training the Wii Fit balance game training group showed significant differences between the pre- and post-training parameters including the duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed average anteroposterior movement speed swing area per unit time and speed strength index. The physical education group showed significant differences between the pre- and post-training speed strength index values. The sedentary activity group did not show any significant differences between the pre- and post-training parameters. Conclusion Wii Fit balance game training can improve static balance and lower extremity muscle strength in students with intellectual disabilities. Effects of Wii Fit balance game training on the balance ability of students with intellectual disabilities.
