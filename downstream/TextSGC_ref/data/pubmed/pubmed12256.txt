The artificial neural network ANN one of the machine learning ML algorithms inspired by the human brain system was developed by connecting layers with artificial neurons. However due to the low computing power and insufficient learnable data ANN has suffered from overfitting and vanishing gradient problems for training deep networks. The advancement of computing power with graphics processing units and the availability of large data acquisition deep neural network outperforms human or other ML capabilities in computer vision and speech recognition tasks. These potentials are recently applied to healthcare problems including computer-aided detection/diagnosis disease prediction image segmentation image generation etc. In this review article we will explain the history development and applications in medical imaging.
