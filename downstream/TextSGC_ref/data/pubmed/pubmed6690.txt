Data science is likely to lead to major changes in cardiovascular imaging. Problems with timing efficiency and missed diagnoses occur at all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial intelligence AI is dependent on robust data; the application of appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its clinical application to image segmentation automated measurements and eventually automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at the stages of image acquisition interpretation and decision-making. Moreover the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging combined with "big data" from the electronic health record and pathology is likely to better characterize disease and personalize therapy. This review summarizes recent promising applications of AI in cardiology and cardiac imaging which potentially add value to patient care.
