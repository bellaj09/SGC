"There is a pressing need to better understand how parents make feeding decisions for their children but extant measures focus primarily on outcomes rather than examining the process of food choice as it unfolds. This exploratory study examined parents translational movement as they moved throughout a virtual reality-based buffet restaurant to select a lunch for their child. Our aim was to explore whether translational movement would be related to cognitive and affective variables that underlie motivation effort and ultimate choices within food decision-making contexts e.g. guilt self-efficacy. Movement data were quantified in terms of path tortuosity: the degree of straightness of ones path while traveling through a space. Greater path tortuosity predicted a reduction in parents guilt about their child feeding above and beyond actual food chosen. Results suggest path tortuosity serves as an implicit measure of effort put forth by parents throughout the food decision-making process. Future work should continue to explore the utility of novel metrics that can be obtained from unique data sources such as location tracking for elucidating complicated behavioral processes such as food choice."
