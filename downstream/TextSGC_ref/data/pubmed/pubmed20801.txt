"We all have an irrational fear or two. Some of us get scared by an unexpected visit from a spider in our house; others get nervous when they look down from a high building. Fear is an evolutionary and adaptive function that can promote self-preservation and help us deal with the feared object or situation. However when this state becomes excessive it might develop into psychological disorders such as phobias producing high anxiety and affecting everyday life.
