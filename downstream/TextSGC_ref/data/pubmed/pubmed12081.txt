Most popular deep models for action recognition in videos generate independent predictions for short clips which are then pooled heuristically to assign an action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may characterize the underlying action pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. To tackle this problem we propose discriminative pooling based on the notion that among the features generated on all short clips there is at least one that characterizes the action. To identify useful features we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that are known to be irrelevant. With the features from the video as a positive bag and the irrelevant features as the negative bag we cast an objective to learn a nonlinear hyperplane that separates the unknown useful feature from the rest in a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine setup. We use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as descriptors for the video. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework they can be treated as weighted-average-pooling of the features from the bags. We report results from experiments on eight computer vision benchmarks demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across these tasks.
