Nowadays the majority of the progress in the development of implantable neuroprostheses has been achieved by improving the knowledge of brain functions so as to restore sensorial impairments. Intracortical microstimulation ICMS is a widely used technique to investigate site-specific cortical responses to electrical stimuli. Herein we investigated the neural modulation induced in the primary auditory cortex A1 by an acousto-electric transduction of ultrasonic signals using a bio-inspired intracortical microstimulator. The developed electronic system emulates the transduction of ultrasound signals in the cochlea providing bio-inspired electrical stimuli. Firstly we identified the receptive fields in the primary auditory cortex devoted to encoding ultrasonic waves at different frequencies mapping each area with neurophysiological patterns. Subsequently the activity elicited by bio-inspired ICMS in the previously identified areas bypassing the sense organ was investigated. The observed evoked response by microstimulation resulted as highly specific to the stimuli and the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural oscillatory activity in the alpha beta and gamma waves were related to the stimuli preferred by the neurons at the stimulated site. The alpha waves modulated cortical excitability only during the activation of the specific tonotopic neuronal populations inhibiting neural responses in unrelated areas. Greater neuronal activity in the posterior area of A1 was observed in the beta band whereas a gamma rhythm was induced in the anterior A1. The results evidence that the proposed bio-inspired acousto-electric ICMS triggers high-frequency oscillations encoding information about the stimulation sites and involving a large-scale integration in the brain.
