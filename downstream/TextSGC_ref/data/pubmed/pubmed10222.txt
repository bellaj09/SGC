We present a novel framework combining convolutional neural networks CNN and graph search methods termed as CNN-GS for the automatic segmentation of nine layer boundaries on retinal optical coherence tomography OCT images. CNN-GS first utilizes a CNN to extract features of specific retinal layer boundaries and train a corresponding classifier to delineate a pilot estimate of the eight layers. Next a graph search method uses the probability maps created from the CNN to find the final boundaries. We validated our proposed method on 60 volumes 2915 B-scans from 20 human eyes with non-exudative age-related macular degeneration AMD which attested to effectiveness of our proposed technique. Automatic segmentation of nine retinal layer boundaries in OCT images of non-exudative AMD patients using deep learning and graph search.
