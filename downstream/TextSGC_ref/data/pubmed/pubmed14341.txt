Bilingual lexicon induction BLI is an important task in the biomedical domain as translation resources are usually available for general language usage but are often lacking in domain-specific settings. In this article we consider BLI as a classification problem and train a neural network composed of a combination of recurrent long short-term memory and deep feed-forward networks in order to obtain word-level and character-level representations. A deep learning approach to bilingual lexicon induction in the biomedical domain.
