Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions etc. Hence reliable automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper we proposed two deep learning methods to address three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing i.e. lesion segmentation task 1 lesion dermoscopic feature extraction task 2 and lesion classification task 3. A deep learning framework consisting of two fully convolutional residual networks FCRN is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit LICU is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. The proposed deep learning frameworks were evaluated on the ISIC 2017 dataset. Experimental results show the promising accuracies of our frameworks i.e. 0.753 for task 1 0.848 for task 2 and 0.912 for task 3 were achieved.
