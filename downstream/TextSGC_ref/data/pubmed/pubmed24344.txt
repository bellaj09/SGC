Practical motor imagery-based brain computer interface MI-BCI applications are limited by the difficult to decode brain signals in a reliable way. In this paper we propose a processing framework to address non-stationarity as well as handle spectral temporal and spatial characteristics associated with execution of motor tasks. Stacked generalization is used to exploit the power of classifier ensembles for combining information coming from multiple sources and reducing the existing uncertainty in EEG signals. The outputs of several regularized linear discriminant analysis RLDA models are combined to account for temporal spatial and spectral information. The resultant algorithm is called stacked RLDA SRLDA. Additionally an adaptive processing stage is introduced before classification to reduce the harmful effect of intersession non-stationarity. The benefits of the proposed method are evaluated on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. We demonstrate its effectiveness in binary and multiclass settings with four different motor imagery tasks: left-hand right-hand both feet and tongue movements. The results show that adaptive SRLDA outperforms the winner of the competition and other approaches tested on this multiclass dataset.
