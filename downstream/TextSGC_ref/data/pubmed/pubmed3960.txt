"Functional connectivity measured from resting state fMRI R-fMRI data has been widely used to examine the brains functional activities and has been recently used to characterize and differentiate brain conditions. However the dynamical transition patterns of the brains functional states have been less explored. In this work we propose a novel computational framework to quantitatively characterize the brain state dynamics via hidden Markov models HMMs learned from the observations of temporally dynamic functional connectomics denoted as functional connectome states. The framework has been applied to the R-fMRI dataset including 44 post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD patients and 51 normal control NC subjects. Experimental results show that both PTSD and NC brains were undergoing remarkable changes in resting state and mainly transiting amongst a few brain states. Interestingly further prediction with the best-matched HMM demonstrates that PTSD would enter into but could not disengage from a negative mood state. Importantly 84% of PTSD patients and 86% of NC subjects are successfully classified via multiple HMMs using majority voting."
