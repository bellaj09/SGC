Lithium therapy has been shown to affect imaging measures of brain function and microstructure in human immunodeficiency virus HIV-infected subjects with cognitive impairment. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to explore whether changes in brain microstructure also entail changes in functional connectivity. Functional MRI data of seven cognitively impaired HIV infected individuals enrolled in an open-label lithium study were included in the connectivity analysis. Seven regions of interest ROI were defined based on previously observed lithium induced microstructural changes measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Generalized partial directed coherence gPDC based on time-variant multivariate autoregressive models was used to quantify the degree of connectivity between the selected ROIs. Statistical analyses using a linear mixed model showed significant differences in the average node strength between pre and post lithium therapy conditions. Specifically we found that lithium treatment in this population induced changes suggestive of increased strength in functional connectivity. Therefore by exploiting the information about the strength of functional interactions provided by gPDC we can quantify the connectivity changes observed in relation to a given intervention. Furthermore in conditions where the intervention is associated with clinical changes we suggest that this methodology could enable an interpretation of such changes in the context of disease or treatment induced modulations in functional networks. Are Structural Changes Induced by Lithium in the HIV Brain Accompanied by Changes in Functional Connectivity?
