An extremely simple bulk sheet made of a piezoresistive carbon nanotube CNT-Ecoflex composite can act as a smart keypad that is portable disposable and flexible enough to be carried crushed inside the pocket of a pair of trousers. Both a rigid-button-imbedded rollable or foldable pad and a patterned flexible pad have been introduced for use as portable keyboards. Herein we suggest a bare bulk macroscale piezoresistive sheet as a replacement for these complex devices that are achievable only through high-cost fabrication processes such as patterning-based coating printing deposition and mounting. A deep-learning technique based on deep neural networks DNN enables this extremely simple bulk sheet to play the role of a smart keypad without the use of complicated fabrication processes. To develop this keypad instantaneous electrical resistance change was recorded at several locations on the edge of the sheet along with the exact information on the touch position and pressure for a huge number of random touches. The recorded data were used for training a DNN model that could eventually act as a brain for a simple sheet-type keypad. This simple sheet-type keypad worked perfectly and outperformed all of the existing portable keypads in terms of functionality flexibility disposability and cost.
