"Our research aims at supporting existing therapies for children with intellectual and developmental disorders IDD. The personal and social autonomy is the desired end state to be achieved to enable a smooth integration in the real world. We developed and tested a framework for storytelling and learning activities that exploits an immersive virtual reality viewer to interact with target users. We co-designed our system with experts from the medical sector identifying features that allow patients to stay focused on exercises to perform. Our approach triggers a learning process for a seamless assimilation of common behavioral skills useful in every days life. This paper highlights the technologic challenges in healthcare and discusses cutting-edge interaction paradigms."
