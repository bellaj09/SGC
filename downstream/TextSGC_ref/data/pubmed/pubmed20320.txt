BackgroundPeople with social anxiety disorder SAD fear social interactions and may be reluctant to seek treatments involving exposure to social situations. Social exposure conducted in virtual reality VR embedded in individual cognitive-behavioural therapy CBT could be an answer.AimsTo show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivoMethodParticipants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure n = 17 in vivo exposure n = 22 or waiting list n = 20. Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069ResultsImprovements were found on the primary Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure.ConclusionsUsing VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient cost-effective and practical medium of exposure. Virtual reality compared with in vivo exposure in the treatment of social anxiety disorder: a three-arm randomised controlled trial.
