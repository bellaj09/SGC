Combining imaging modalities to synthesize their inherent strengths provides a promising means for improving brain subnetwork identification. We propose a multimodal integration technique based on a sex-differentiated formulation of replicator dynamics for identifying subnetworks of brain regions that exhibit high inter-connectivity both functionally and structurally. Our method has a number of desired properties namely it can operate on weighted graphs derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging tMRI and diffusion MRI dMRI data allows for subnetwork overlaps has an intrinsic criterion for setting the number of subnetworks and provides statistical control on false node inclusion in the identified subnetworks via the incorporation of stability selection. We thus refer to our technique as coupled stable overlapping replicator dynamics CSORD. On synthetic data We demonstrate that CSORD achieves significantly higher subnetwork identification accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques. On real. data from the Human Connectome Project HCP we show that CSORD attains improved test-retest reliability on multiple network measures and superior task classification accuracy.
