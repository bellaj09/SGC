The proposed study evaluates the efficacy of knowledge transfer gained through an ensemble of modality-specific deep learning models toward improving the state-of-the-art in Tuberculosis TB detection. A custom convolutional neural network CNN and selected popular pretrained CNNs are trained to learn modality-specific features from large-scale publicly available chest x-ray CXR collections including i RSNA dataset normal = 8851 abnormal = 17833 ii Pediatric pneumonia dataset normal = 1583 abnormal = 4273 and iii Indiana dataset normal = 1726 abnormal = 2378. The knowledge acquired through modality-specific learning is transferred and fine-tuned for TB detection on the publicly available Shenzhen CXR collection normal = 326 abnormal =336. The predictions of the best performing models are combined using different ensemble methods to demonstrate improved performance over any individual constituent model in classifying TB-infected and normal CXRs. The models are evaluated through cross-validation n = 5 at the patient-level with an aim to prevent overfitting improve robustness and generalization. It is observed that a stacked ensemble of the top-3 retrained models demonstrates promising performance accuracy: 0.941; 95% confidence interval CI: 0.899 0.985 area under the curve AUC: 0.995; 95% CI: 0.945 1.00. One-way ANOVA analyses show there are no statistically significant differences in accuracy P = .759 and AUC P = .831 among the ensemble methods. Knowledge transferred through modality-specific learning of relevant features helped improve the classification. The ensemble model resulted in reduced prediction variance and sensitivity to training data fluctuations. Results from their combined use are superior to the state-of-the-art.
