"Objectives: The Jansari assessment of Executive Functions for Children JEF-C is a new non-immersive computerised assessment of executive functions. The objectives of the study were to test the feasibility and validity of JEF-C in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury ABI. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with ABI aged 10-18 years and 30 age-and gender-matched controls were tested. Participants performed JEF-C Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence WASI and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome for Children BADS-C while parents completed the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function BRIEF questionnaire. Results: The JEF-C task proved feasible in patients with ABI. The internal consistency was medium Cronbachs alpha\u2009=\u20090.62 and significant intercorrelations between individual JEF-C constructs. Patients performed significantly worse than controls on most of the JEF-C subscales and total score with 41.4% of participants with ABI classified as having severe executive dysfunction. No significant correlations were found between JEF-C total score the BRIEF indices and the BADS-C. Significant correlations were found between JEF-C and demographic characteristics of the sample and intellectual ability but not with severity/medical variables. Conclusion: JEF-C is a playful complex task that appears to be a sensitive and ecologically valid assessment tool especially for relatively high-functioning individuals."
