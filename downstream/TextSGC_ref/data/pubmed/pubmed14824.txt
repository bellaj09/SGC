The physiological monitoring of older people using wearable sensors has shown great potential in improving their quality of life and preventing undesired events related to their health status. Nevertheless creating robust predictive models from data collected unobtrusively in home environments can be challenging especially for vulnerable ageing population. Under that premise we propose an activity recognition scheme for older people exploiting feature extraction and machine learning along with heuristic computational solutions to address the challenges due to inconsistent measurements in non-standardized environments. In addition we compare the customized pipeline with deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks applied to raw sensor data without any pre- or post-processing adjustments. The results demonstrate that the generalizable deep architectures can compensate for inconsistencies during data acquisition providing a valuable alternative.
