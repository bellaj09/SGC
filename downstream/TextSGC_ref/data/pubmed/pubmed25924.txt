Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS has become an established tool to investigate brain function and is due to its portability and resistance to electromagnetic noise an interesting modality for brain-machine interfaces BMIs. BMIs have been successfully realized using the decoding of movement kinematics from intra-cortical recordings in monkey and human. Recently it has been shown that hemodynamic brain responses as measured by fMRI are modulated by the direction of hand movements. However quantitative data on the decoding of movement direction from hemodynamic responses is still lacking and it remains unclear whether this can be achieved with fNIRS which records signals at a lower spatial resolution but with the advantage of being portable. Here we recorded brain activity with fNIRS above different cortical areas while subjects performed hand movements in two different directions. We found that hemodynamic signals in contralateral sensorimotor areas vary with the direction of movements though only weakly. Using these signals movement direction could be inferred on a single-trial basis with an accuracy of 65% on average across subjects. The temporal evolution of decoding accuracy resembled that of typical hemodynamic responses observed in motor experiments. Simultaneous recordings with a head tracking system showed that head movements at least up to some extent do not influence the decoding of fNIRS signals. Due to the low accuracy fNIRS is not a viable alternative for BMIs utilizing decoding of movement direction. However due to its relative resistance to head movements it is promising for studies investigating brain activity during motor experiments. fNIRS exhibits weak tuning to hand movement direction.
