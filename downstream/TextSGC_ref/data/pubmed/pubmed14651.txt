Deep learning involves a difficult nonconvex optimization problem with a large number of weights between any two adjacent layers of a deep structure. To handle large data sets or complicated networks distributed training is needed but the calculation of function gradient and Hessian is expensive. In particular the communication and the synchronization cost may become a bottleneck. In this letter we focus on situations where the model is distributedly stored and propose a novel distributed Newton method for training deep neural networks. By variable and feature-wise data partitions and some careful designs we are able to explicitly use the Jacobian matrix for matrix-vector products in the Newton method. Some techniques are incorporated to reduce the running time as well as memory consumption. First to reduce the communication cost we propose a diagonalization method such that an approximate Newton direction can be obtained without communication between machines. Second we consider subsampled Gauss-Newton matrices for reducing the running time as well as the communication cost. Third to reduce the synchronization cost we terminate the process of finding an approximate Newton direction even though some nodes have not finished their tasks. Details of some implementation issues in distributed environments are thoroughly investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the distributed training of deep neural networks. Compared with stochastic gradient methods it is more robust and may give better test accuracy. Distributed Newton Methods for Deep Neural Networks.
