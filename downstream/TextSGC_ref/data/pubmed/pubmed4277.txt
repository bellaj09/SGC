"Accurate reliable prediction of risk for Alzheimers disease AD is essential for early disease-modifying therapeutics. Multimodal MRI such as structural and diffusion MRI is likely to contain complementary information of neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here we tested the utility of the multimodal MRI T1-weighted structure and diffusion MRI combined with high-throughput brain phenotyping-morphometry and structural connectomics-and machine learning as a diagnostic tool for AD. We used firstly a clinical cohort at a dementia clinic National Health Insurance Service-Ilsan Hospital NHIS-IH; N\u202f=\u202f211; 110 AD 64 mild cognitive impairment MCI and 37 cognitively normal with subjective memory complaints SMC to test the diagnostic models; and secondly Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI-2 to test the generalizability. Our machine learning models trained on the morphometric and connectome estimates number of features\u202f=\u202f34646 showed optimal classification accuracy AD/SMC: 97% accuracy MCI/SMC: 83% accuracy; AD/MCI: 97% accuracy in NHIS-IH cohort outperforming a benchmark model FLAIR-based white matter hyperintensity volumes. In ADNI-2 data the combined connectome and morphometry model showed similar or superior accuracies AD/HC: 96%; MCI/HC: 70%; AD/MCI: 75% accuracy compared with the CSF biomarker model t-tau p-tau and Amyloid  and ratios. In predicting MCI to AD progression in a smaller cohort of ADNI-2 n\u202f=\u202f60 the morphometry model showed similar performance with 69% accuracy compared with CSF biomarker model with 70% accuracy. Our comparisons of the classifiers trained on structural MRI diffusion MRI FLAIR and CSF biomarkers showed the promising utility of the white matter structural connectomes in classifying AD and MCI in addition to the widely used structural MRI-based morphometry when combined with machine learning."
