The coordinated recruitment of group of muscles through muscles synergies is known to simplify the control of movements. However how and to what extent such control scheme is encoded at a cortical level is poorly understood. So far electroencephalography EEG and electromyography EMG have been used separately to investigate the cortical regions of the human brain which may be involved in activating muscle synergies. Here we aim at extending these results by looking for a hierarchical relationship between cortical and muscular sources of activity neuro-muscular synergies with a unified analysis of independent components IC simultaneously extracted from both EEG and EMG signals. We show for the first time how the direct fusion of EEG and EMG signals to extract unified ICs unICs can overcome the limitations of previous approaches i.e. the difficulty in linking neural with muscular activations and the lack of reliability of separate preprocessing techniques. Our results show that unified ICs were physiologically meaningful components in agreement with previous works. UNICA Unified Independent Component Analysis can also be considered as a solution for estimating overcomplete ICA on EEG and EMG data. These findings are an important step towards an understanding of the cortical control of human muscles synergies and may have important applications for understanding movement dysfunction and to develop novel approaches for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses.
