"The authors introduce a tool referred to as the Ultimate Intubation Head UIH to train medical practitioners hand-eye coordination in performing endotracheal intubation with the help of augmented reality methods. In this paper we describe the integration of a deployable UIH and present methods for augmented reality registration of real and virtual anatomical models. The assessment of the 52 degrees field of view optics of the custom-designed and built head-mounted display is less than 1.5 arc minutes in the amount of blur and astigmatism the two limiting optical aberrations. Distortion is less than 2.5%. Preliminary results of the registration of a physical phantom mandible on its virtual counterpart yields less than 3mm rms. in registration. Finally we describe an approach to distributed visualization where a given training procedure may be visualized and shared at various remote locations. Basic assessments of delays within two scenarios of data distribution were conducted and reported." Development of a training tool for endotracheal intubation: distributed augmented reality.
