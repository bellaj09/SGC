"This paper proposes a UAV platform that autonomously detects hunts and takes down other small UAVs in GPS-denied environments. The platform detects tracks and follows another drone within its sensor range using a pre-trained machine learning model. We collect and generate a 58647-image dataset and use it to train a Tiny YOLO detection algorithm. This algorithm combined with a simple visual-servoing approach was validated on a physical platform. Our platform was able to successfully track and follow a target drone at an estimated speed of 1.5 m/s. Performance was limited by the detection algorithms 77% accuracy in cluttered environments and the frame rate of eight frames per second along with the field of view of the camera."
