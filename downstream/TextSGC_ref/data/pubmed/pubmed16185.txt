A key learning outcome for undergraduate biochemistry classes is a thorough understanding of the principles of protein structure. Traditional approaches to teaching this material which include two-dimensional 2D images on paper physical molecular modeling kits and projections of 3D structures into 2D are unable to fully capture the dynamic 3D nature of proteins. We have built a virtual reality application Peppy aimed at facilitating teaching of the principles of protein secondary structure. Rather than attempt to model molecules with the same fidelity to the underlying physical chemistry as existing research-oriented molecular modelling approaches we took the more straightforward approach of harnessing the Unity video game physics engine. Indeed the simplicity and limitations of our model are strengths in a teaching context provoking questions and thus deeper understanding. Peppy allows exploration of the relative effects of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions more generally backbone / angles basic chemical structure and steric effects on a polypeptide structure in an accessible format that is novel dynamic and fun to use. Apart from describing the implementation and use of Peppy we discuss the outcomes of deploying Peppy in undergraduate biochemistry courses.
