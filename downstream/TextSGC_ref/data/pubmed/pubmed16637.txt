"Some task analysis methods break down a task into a hierarchy of subgoals. Although an important tool of many fields of study learning to create such a hierarchy redescription is not trivial. To further the understanding of what makes task analysis a skill the present research examined novices problems with learning Hierarchical Task Analysis and captured practitioners performance. All participants received a task description and analyzed three cooking and three communication tasks by drawing on their knowledge of those tasks. Thirty six younger adults 18-28 years in Study 1 analyzed one task before training and five afterwards. Training consisted of a general handout that all participants received and an additional handout that differed between three conditions: a list of steps a flow-diagram and concept map. In Study 2 eight experienced task analysts received the same task descriptions as in Study 1 and demonstrated their understanding of task analysis while thinking aloud. Novices initial task analysis scored low on all coding criteria. Performance improved on some criteria but was well below 100 % on others. Practitioners task analyses were 2-3 levels deep but also scored low on some criteria. A task analysts purpose of analysis may be the reason for higher specificity of analysis. This research furthers the understanding of Hierarchical Task Analysis and provides insights into the varying nature of task analyses as a function of experience. The derived skill components can inform training objectives." Skill components of task analysis.
