"The Nash embedding theorem demonstrates that any compact manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space. Assuming the complex brain states form a high-dimensional manifold in a topological space we propose a manifold learning framework termed Thought Chart to reconstruct and visualize the manifold in a low-dimensional space. Furthermore it serves as a data-driven approach to discover the underlying dynamics when the brain is engaged in a series of emotion and cognitive regulation tasks. EEG-based temporal dynamic functional connectomes are created based on 20 psychiatrically healthy participants EEG recordings during resting state and an emotion regulation task. Graph dissimilarity space embedding was applied to all the dynamic EEG connectomes. In order to visualize the learned manifold in a lower dimensional space local neighborhood information is reconstructed via k-nearest neighbor-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction NDR and epsilon distance-based NDR. We showed that two neighborhood constructing approaches of NDR embed the manifold in a two-dimensional space which we named Thought Chart. In Thought Chart different task conditions represent distinct trajectories. Properties such as the distribution or average length in the 2-D space may serve as useful parameters to explore the underlying cognitive load and emotion processing during the complex task. In sum this framework is a novel data-driven approach to the learning and visualization of underlying neurophysiological dynamics of complex functional brain data."
