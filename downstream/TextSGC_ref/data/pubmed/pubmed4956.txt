"Resting-state functional connectivity patterns are highly stable over time within subjects. This suggests that such functional fingerprints may have strong genetic component. We investigated whether the functional FC or effective EC connectivity patterns of one monozygotic twin could be used to identify the co-twin among a larger sample and determined the overlap in functional fingerprints within monozygotic MZ twin pairs using resting state magnetoencephalography MEG. We included 32 cognitively normal MZ twin pairs from the Netherlands Twin Register who participate in the EMIF-AD preclinAD study average age 68 years. Combining EC information across multiple frequency bands we obtained an identification rate over 75%. Since MZ twin pairs are genetically identical these results suggest a high genetic contribution to MEG-based EC patterns leading to large similarities in brain connectivity patterns between two individuals even after 60 years of life or more."
