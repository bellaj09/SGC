"Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities is an important problem in computational chemistry since it can substantially accelerate drug discovery for virtual screening and lead optimization. We propose here a fast machine-learning approach for predicting binding affinities using state-of-the-art 3D-convolutional neural networks and compare this approach to other machine-learning and scoring methods using several diverse data sets. The results for the standard PDBbind v.2016 core test-set are state-of-the-art with a Pearsons correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a RMSE of 1.27 in pK units between experimental and predicted affinity but accuracy is still very sensitive to the specific protein used. KDEEP is made available via PlayMolecule.org for users to test easily their own protein-ligand complexes with each prediction taking a fraction of a second. We believe that the speed performance and ease of use of KDEEP makes it already an attractive scoring function for modern computational chemistry pipelines."
