Absorption distribution metabolism and excretion ADME studies are critical for drug discovery. Conventionally these tasks together with other chemical property predictions rely on domain-specific feature descriptors or fingerprints. Following the recent success of neural networks we developed Chemi-Net a completely data-driven domain knowledge-free deep learning method for ADME property prediction. To compare the relative performance of Chemi-Net with Cubist one of the popular machine learning programs used by Amgen a large-scale ADME property prediction study was performed on-site at Amgen. For all 13 data sets Chemi-Net resulted in higher R2 values compared with the Cubist benchmark. The median R2 increase rate over Cubist was 26.7%. We expect that the significantly increased accuracy of ADME prediction seen with Chemi-Net over Cubist will greatly accelerate drug discovery.
