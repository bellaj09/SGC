In view of an increasing use of breast MRI supplementing X-ray mammography the purpose of this study was the development of a method for fast and efficient analysis of dynamic MR image series of the female breast. The dynamic image data sets were analyzed by tracer kinetic modeling in order to describe the physiological processes underlying the contrast enhancement in mathematical terms and thus to enable the estimation of functional tissue specific parameters reflecting the status of microcirculation. To display morphological and functional tissue information simultaneously a multidimensional real-time visualization system using 3D-texture mapping was developed which enables a practical and intuitive human-computer interface in virtual reality. Morphofunctional visualization of MR-mammography in virtual reality.
