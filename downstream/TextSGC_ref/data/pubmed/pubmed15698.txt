Colonoscopy is an endoscopic medical procedure where the colon of the patient is examined. This minimally invasive technique is performed with a colonoscope a long tube with an integrated imaging device at its tip. The doctors performing these procedures require high skills in multiple domains such as hand-eye coordination visualization safety and ease at guiding flexible endoscopes. The importance of training colonoscopy procedures rises with the growth of variety of colon diseases. In order to safely train surgeons to these procedures a computer-assisted haptic simulator is proposed. This paper describes both the haptic hardware interface and virtual reality software that compose the training system. A high friction belt is used to render the required forces and to insure the absence of slippage. A differential drive actuated with two DC motors enables to set the system into translation and rotation. A virtual reality environment has been developed to provide real-time visualisation and force feedback. Real-time haptic interface for VR colonoscopy simulation.
