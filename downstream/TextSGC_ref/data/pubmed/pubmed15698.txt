"The big breakthrough on the ImageNet challenge in 2012 was partially due to the Dropout technique used to avoid overfitting. Here we introduce a new approach called Spectral Dropout to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. We cast the proposed approach in the form of regular Convolutional Neural Network CNN weight layers using a decorrelation transform with fixed basis functions. Our spectral dropout method prevents overfitting by eliminating weak and noisy Fourier domain coefficients of the neural network activations leading to remarkably better results than the current regularization methods. Furthermore the proposed is very efficient due to the fixed basis functions used for spectral transformation. In particular compared to Dropout and Drop-Connect our method significantly speeds up the network convergence rate during the training process roughly 2 with considerably higher neuron pruning rates an increase of 30%. We demonstrate that the spectral dropout can also be used in conjunction with other regularization approaches resulting in additional performance gains."
