Deep learning methods for person identification based on electroencephalographic EEG brain activity encounters the problem of exploiting the temporally correlated structures or recording session specific variability within EEG. Furthermore recent methods have mostly trained and evaluated based on single session EEG data. We address this problem from an invariant representation learning perspective. We propose an adversarial inference approach to extend such deep learning models to learn session-invariant person-discriminative representations that can provide robustness in terms of longitudinal usability. Using adversarial learning within a deep convolutional network we empirically assess and show improvements with our approach based on longitudinally collected EEG data for person identification from half-second EEG epochs.
