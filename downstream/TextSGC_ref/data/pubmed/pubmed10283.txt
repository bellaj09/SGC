Error patterns in vocabulary learning data were used as a window into the mechanisms that underlie vocabulary learning performance in bilinguals vs. monolinguals. English-Spanish bilinguals n = 18 and English-speaking monolinguals n = 18 were taught novel vocabulary items in association with English translations. At testing participants produced English translations for the newly-learned words. Findings revealed broad learning advantages in the bilingual data. Moreover bilinguals made proportionately more deep within-category semantic errors than monolinguals when tested immediately after learning. We interpret these data to suggest that bilingual learners may encode the information associated with the novel words to a deeper semantic level than monolinguals. What can errors tell us about differences between monolingual and bilingual vocabulary learning?
