Many forms of technology both "high" and "low" can help individuals with learning disabilities capitalize on their strengths and bypass or compensate for their disabilities. This article surveys the current status of assistive technology for this population and reflects on future promises and potential problems. In addition a model is presented for conceptualizing assistive technology in terms of the types of barriers it helps persons with disabilities to surmount. Several current technologies are described and the research supporting their effectiveness reviewed: word processing computer-based instruction in reading and other academic areas interactive videodisc interventions for math and technologies for daily life. In conclusion three themes related to the future success of assistive technology applications are discussed: equity of access to technology; ease of technology use; and emergent technologies such as virtual reality.
