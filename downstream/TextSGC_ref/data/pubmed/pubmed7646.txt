"The scientific clinical and pedagogical significance of devising methodologies to train nonprofessional subjects to recognize diagnostic visual patterns in medical images has been broadly recognized. However systematic approaches to doing so remain poorly established. Using mammography as an exemplar case we use a series of experiments to demonstrate that deep learning DL techniques can in principle be used to train nave subjects to reliably detect certain diagnostic visual patterns of cancer in medical images. In the main experiment subjects were required to learn to detect statistical visual patterns diagnostic of cancer in mammograms using only the mammograms and feedback provided following the subjects response. We found not only that the subjects learned to perform the task at statistically significant levels but also that their eye movements related to image scrutiny changed in a learning-dependent fashion. Two additional smaller exploratory experiments suggested that allowing subjects to re-examine the mammogram in light of various items of diagnostic information may help further improve DL of the diagnostic patterns. Finally a fourth small exploratory experiment suggested that the image information learned was similar across subjects. Together these results prove the principle that DL methodologies can be used to train nonprofessional subjects to reliably perform those aspects of medical image perception tasks that depend on visual pattern recognition expertise." Deep learning can be used to train nave nonprofessional observers to detect diagnostic visual patterns of certain cancers in mammograms: a proof-of-principle study.
