Non-invasive prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH genotype plays an important role in tumor glioma diagnosis and prognosis. Recently research has shown that radiology images can be a potential tool for genotype prediction and fusion of multi-modality data by deep learning methods can further provide complementary information to enhance prediction accuracy. However it still does not have an effective deep learning architecture to predict IDH genotype with three-dimensional 3D multimodal medical images. In this paper we proposed a novel multimodal 3D DenseNet M3D-DenseNet model to predict IDH genotypes with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging MRI data. To evaluate its performance we conducted experiments on the BRATS-2017 and The Cancer Genome Atlas breast invasive carcinoma TCGA-BRCA dataset to get image data as input and gene mutation information as the target respectively. We achieved 84.6% accuracy area under the curve AUC = 85.7% on the validation dataset. To evaluate its generalizability we applied transfer learning techniques to predict World Health Organization WHO grade status which also achieved a high accuracy of 91.4% AUC = 94.8% on validation dataset. With the properties of automatic feature extraction and effective and high generalizability M3D-DenseNet can serve as a useful method for other multimodal radiogenomics problems and has the potential to be applied in clinical decision making.
