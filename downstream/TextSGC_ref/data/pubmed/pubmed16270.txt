Arthroscopy is a\xa0technically challenging surgical procedure with a\xa0relatively shallow learning curve compared to open procedures. To become an expert special cognitive and manual abilities have to be acquired and trained. The current situation in further medical education combined with the increasing economic pressure in the medical field does not leave enough room for a\xa0time-consuming training in arthroscopic techniques. A structured simulation training could be an alternative solution to this problem. The benefits of arthroscopic simulation training are meanwhile well documented. The complex tasks that an expert carries out during arthroscopy can be fragmented into more simple and elementary exercises and can be trained in a\xa0stress-free environment outside the operation room. An essential advantage of simulation training is the assessment of objective measurement parameters during the individual exercises. These parameters can be used to evaluate the learning process and performance of arthroscopic tasks. The aim of this review is to reflect the current state of simulation technology in arthroscopy and to show how simulator training can be meaningfully and effectively integrated into arthroscopic further training exemplified by a modern medical further education concept. Virtual arthroscopy : Gaming or training concept of the future.
