"Sedation protocols during spinal anesthesia often involve sedative drugs associated with complications. We investigated whether virtual reality VR distraction could be applied during endoscopic urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia and yield better satisfaction than pharmacologic sedation. VR distraction without sedative was compared with pharmacologic sedation using repeat doses of midazolam 12 mg every 30 min during urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We compared the satisfaction of patients surgeons and anesthesiologists as rated on a 5-point prespecified verbal rating scale. Two surgeons and two anesthesiologists rated the scale and an overall score was reported after discussion. Thirty-seven patients were randomized to a VR group n = 18 or a sedation group n = 19. The anesthesiologists satisfaction score was significantly higher in the VR group than in the sedation group median interquartile range 5 55 vs. 4 45 p = 0.005. The likelihood of both patients and anesthesiologists being extremely satisfied was significantly higher in the VR group than in the sedation group. Agreement between the scores for surgeons and those for anesthesiologists was very good kappa = 0.874 and 0.944 respectively. The incidence of apnea was significantly lower in the VR group than in the sedation group n = 1 5.6% vs. n = 7 36.8% p = 0.042. The present findings suggest that VR distraction is better than drug sedation with midazolam in terms of patients and anesthesiologists satisfaction and avoiding the respiratory side effects of midazolam during endoscopic urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia."
