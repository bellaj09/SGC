Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Because COPD is an incurable disease and requires considerable time to be diagnosed even by an experienced specialist it becomes important to provide analysis abnormalities in simple ways. The aim of the study is comparing multiple machine learning algorithms for the early diagnosis of COPD using multi-channel lung sounds.
