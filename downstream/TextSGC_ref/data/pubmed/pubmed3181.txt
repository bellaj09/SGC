"Alzheimers disease AD is a progressive brain disease. Accurate detection of AD and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment MCI are crucial. There is also a growing interest in identifying brain imaging biomarkers that help to automatically differentiate stages of Alzheimers disease. Here we focused on brain structural networks computed from diffusion MRI and proposed a new feature extraction and classification framework based on higher order singular value decomposition and sparse logistic regression. In tests on publicly available data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative our proposed framework showed promise in detecting brain network differences that help in classifying different stages of Alzheimers disease."
