Recently there has been an increase in the number of stroke patients with motor paralysis. Appropriate re-afferent sensory feedback synchronized with a voluntary motor intention would be effective for promoting neural plasticity in the stroke rehabilitation. Therefore BCI technology is considered to be a promising approach in the neuro-rehabilitation. To estimate human motor intention an event-related desynchronization ERD a feature of electroencephalogram EEG evoked by motor execution or motor imagery is usually used. However there exists various factors that affect ERD production and its neural mechanism is still an open question. As a preliminary stage we evaluate mutual effects of intrinsic voluntary motor imagery and extrinsic visual and somatosensory stimuli factors on the ERD production. Experimental results indicate that these three factors are not always additively interacting with each other and affecting the ERD production. Analysis of extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting event related desynchronization production.
