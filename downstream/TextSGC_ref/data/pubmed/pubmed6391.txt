The anatomical architecture of the mammalian brain can be modeled as the connectivity between functionally distinct areas of cortex and sub-cortex which we refer to as the connectome. The community structure of the connectome describes how the network can be parsed into meaningful groups of nodes. This process called community detection is commonly carried out to find internally densely connected communities-a modular topology. However other community structure patterns are possible. Here we employ the weighted stochastic block model WSBM which can identify a wide range of topologies to the rat cerebral cortex connectome to probe the network for evidence of modular core periphery and disassortative organization. Despite its algorithmic flexibility the WSBM identifies substantial modular and assortative topology throughout the rat cerebral cortex connectome significantly aligning to the modular approach in some parts of the network. Significant deviations from modular partitions include the identification of communities that are highly enriched in core rich club areas. A comparison of the WSBM and modular models demonstrates that the former when applied as a generative model more closely captures several nodal network attributes. An analysis of variation across an ensemble of partitions reveals\xa0that certain parts of the network participate in multiple topological regimes. Overall our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of adopting the WSBM which can be applied to a single weighted and directed matrix such as the rat cerebral cortex connectome to identify community structure with\xa0a broad definition that transcends the common modular\xa0approach.
