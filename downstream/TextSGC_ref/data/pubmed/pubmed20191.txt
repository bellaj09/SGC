The surgical navigation system has experienced tremendous development over the past decades for minimizing the risks and improving the precision of the surgery. Nowadays Augmented Reality AR-based surgical navigation is a promising technology for clinical applications. In the AR system virtual and actual reality are mixed offering real-time high-quality visualization of an extensive variety of information to the users Moussa et al. 2012 1. For example virtual anatomical structures such as soft tissues blood vessels and nerves can be integrated with the real-world scenario in real time. In this study an AR-based surgical navigation system AR-SNS is developed using an optical see-through HMD head-mounted display aiming at improving the safety and reliability of the surgery. With the use of this system including the calibration of instruments registration and the calibration of HMD the 3D virtual critical anatomical structures in the head-mounted display are aligned with the actual structures of patient in real-world scenario during the intra-operative motion tracking process. The accuracy verification experiment demonstrated that the mean distance and angular errors were respectively 0.8090.05mm and 1.0380.05 which was sufficient to meet the clinical requirements.
