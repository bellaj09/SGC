"Doctor utilizes various kinds of clinical technologies like MRI endoscopy CT scan etc. to identify patients deformity during the review time. Among set of clinical technologies wireless capsule endoscopy WCE is an advanced procedures used for digestive track malformation. During this complete process more than 57000 frames are captured and doctors need to examine a complete video frame by frame which is a tedious task even for an experienced gastrologist. In this article a novel computerized automated method is proposed for the classification of abdominal infections of gastrointestinal track from WCE images. Three core steps of the suggested system belong to the category of segmentation deep features extraction and fusion followed by robust features selection. The ulcer abnormalities from WCE videos are initially extracted through a proposed color features based low level and high-level saliency CFbLHS estimation method. Later DenseNet CNN model is utilized and through transfer learning TL features are computed prior to feature optimization using Kapurs entropy. A parallel fusion methodology is opted for the selection of maximum feature value PMFV. For feature selection Tsallis entropy is calculated later sorted into descending order. Finally top 50% high ranked features are selected for classification using multilayered feedforward neural network classifier for recognition. Simulation is performed on collected WCE dataset and achieved maximum accuracy of 99.5% in 21.15\xa0s." Stomach Deformities Recognition Using Rank-Based Deep Features Selection.
