"Group recommendation research has recently received much attention in a recommender system community. Currently several deep-learning-based methods are used in group recommendation to learn preferences of groups on items and predict the next ones in which groups may be interested. However their recommendation effectiveness is disappointing. To address this challenge this article proposes a novel model called a multiattention-based group recommendation model MAGRM. It well utilizes multiattention-based deep neural network structures to achieve accurate group recommendation. We train its two closely related modules: vector representation for group features and preference learning for groups on items. The former is proposed to learn to accurately represent each groups deep semantic features. It integrates four aspects of subfeatures: group co-occurrence group description and external and internal social features. In particular we employ multiattention networks to learn to capture internal social features for groups. The latter employs a neural attention mechanism to depict preference interactions between each group and its members and then combines group and item features to accurately learn group preferences on items. Through extensive experiments on two real-world databases we show that MAGRM remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in solving a group recommendation problem."
