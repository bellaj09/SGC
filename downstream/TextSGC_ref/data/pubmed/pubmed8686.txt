Perforator free flap-based reconstruction of the head and neck is a challenging surgical procedure and needs a steep learning curve. A reproducible mammal large animal model with similarities to human anatomy is relevant for perforator flap raising and microanastomosis. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a swine model for perforator-based free flaps in reconstructive microsurgery. Porcine experimental model for perforator flap raising in reconstructive microsurgery.
