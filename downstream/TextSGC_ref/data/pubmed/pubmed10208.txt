"Optical coherence tomography OCT has become an established clinical routine for the in vivo imaging of the optic nerve head ONH tissues that is crucial in the diagnosis and management of various ocular and neuro-ocular pathologies. However the presence of speckle noise affects the quality of OCT images and its interpretation. Although recent frame-averaging techniques have shown to enhance OCT image quality they require longer scanning durations resulting in patient discomfort. Using a custom deep learning network trained with 2328 clean B-scans multi-frame B-scans; signal averaged and their corresponding noisy B-scans clean B-scans\u2009+\u2009Gaussian noise we were able to successfully denoise 1552 unseen single-frame without signal averaging B-scans. The denoised B-scans were qualitatively similar to their corresponding multi-frame B-scans with enhanced visibility of the ONH tissues. The mean signal to noise ratio SNR increased from 4.02\u2009\u20090.68\u2009dB single-frame to 8.14\u2009\u20091.03\u2009dB denoised. For all the ONH tissues the mean contrast to noise ratio CNR increased from 3.50\u2009\u20090.56 single-frame to 7.63\u2009\u20091.81 denoised. The mean structural similarity index MSSIM increased from 0.13\u2009\u20090.02 single frame to 0.65\u2009\u20090.03 denoised when compared with the corresponding multi-frame B-scans. Our deep learning algorithm can denoise a single-frame OCT B-scan of the ONH in under 20\u2009ms thus offering a framework to obtain superior quality OCT B-scans with reduced scanning times and minimal patient discomfort."
