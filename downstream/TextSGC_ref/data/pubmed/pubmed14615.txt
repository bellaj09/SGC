Basal cell carcinoma BCC is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the number of diagnosis is growing worldwide due to increased exposure to solar radiation and the aging population.\xa0Reduction of positive margin rates when removing BCC leads to fewer revision surgeries and consequently lower health care costs improved cosmetic outcomes and better patient care.\xa0In this study we propose the first use of a perioperative mass spectrometry technology iKnife along with a deep learning framework for detection of BCC signatures from tissue burns. Perioperative margin detection in basal cell carcinoma using a deep learning framework: a feasibility study.
