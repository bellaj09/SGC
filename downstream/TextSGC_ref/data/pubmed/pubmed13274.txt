"Although age-related changes of cerebral arteries were observed in in\xa0vivo magnetic resonance angiography MRA standard tools or methods measuring those changes were limited. In this study we developed and evaluated a model to measure age-related changes in the cerebral arteries from 3D MRA using a 3D deep convolutional neural network. From participants without any medical abnormality training n\xa0= 800 and validation sets n\xa0= 88 of 3D MRA were built. After preprocessing and data augmentation a 3D convolutional neural network was trained to estimate each subjects chronological age from in\xa0vivo MRA data. There was good correlation between chronological age and predicted age r\xa0=\xa00.83 in an independent test set n\xa0= 354. The predicted age difference PAD of the test set was 2.41  6.22. Interaction term between age and sex was significant for PAD p\xa0= 0.008. After correcting for age and interaction term men showed higher PAD p < 0.001. Hypertension was associated with higher PAD with marginal significance p\xa0= 0.073. We suggested that PAD might be a potential measurement of cerebral vascular aging."
