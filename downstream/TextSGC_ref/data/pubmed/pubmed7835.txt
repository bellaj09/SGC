Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy among women. Sentinel lymph node SLN status is a crucial prognostic factor for breast cancer. In this paper we propose an integrated scheme of deep learning and bag-of-features BOF model for preoperative prediction of SLN metastasis. Specifically convolution neural networks CNNs are used to extract deep features from the three 2D representative orthogonal views of a segmented 3D volume of interest. Then we use a BOF model to furtherly encode the all deep features which makes features more compact and products high-dimension sparse representation. In particular a kernel fusion method that assembles all features is proposed to build a discriminative support vector machine SVM classifier. The bag of deep feature model is evaluated using the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging DWI database of 172 patients including 74 SLN and 98 non-SLN. The results show that the proposed method achieves area under the curve AUC as high as 0.852 95% confidence interval CI: 0.716-0.988 at test set. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can potentially provide a noninvasive approach for automatically predicting prediction of SLN metastasis in patients with breast cancer.
