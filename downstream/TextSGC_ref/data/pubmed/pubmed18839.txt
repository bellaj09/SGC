"Virtual reality VR simulators have been created for various surgical specialties. The common theme is extensive use of graphics confined spaces limited functionality and limited tactile feedback. A development team at the University of Nottingham UK consisting of computer scientists mechanical engineers graphic designers and a neurosurgeon set out to develop a haptic e.g. tactile simulator for neurosurgery making use of boundary elements BE. The relative homogeneity of the brain allows boundary elements e.g. surface only rendering to simulate the brain structure. A boundary element simplifies the computing equations saves computing time by assuming the properties of the surface equal the properties of the body. A limited audit was done by neurosurgical users confirming the potential of the simulator as a training tool. This paper focuses on the application of the computational method and refers to the underlying mathematical structure. Full references are included regarding the mathematical methodology." Virtual neurosurgery training for the future.
