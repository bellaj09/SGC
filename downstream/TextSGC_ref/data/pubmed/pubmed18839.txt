This paper gives a short overview of the feasibility of walking through a virtual city by using motor imagery. Therefore an electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface BCI is combined with virtual reality technology. A BCI transforms bioelectrical brain signals modulated by mental activity e.g. imagination of foot or right hand movements into a control signal. This signal is used to walk forward / backward or to remain stationary inside a virtual city. Results of the first experimental sessions are presented. Walking through a virtual city by thought.
