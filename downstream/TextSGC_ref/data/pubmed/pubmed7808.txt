Prostate cancer PCa is a major cause of death since ancient time documented in Egyptian Ptolemaic mummy imaging. PCa detection is critical to personalized medicine and varies considerably under an MRI scan. 172 patients with 2602 morphologic images axial 2D T2-weighted imaging of the prostate were obtained. A deep learning with deep convolutional neural network DCNN and a non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and bag-of-word BoW a representative method for image recognition and analysis were used to distinguish pathologically confirmed PCa patients from prostate benign conditions BCs patients with prostatitis or prostate benign hyperplasia BPH. In fully automated detection of PCa patients deep learning had a statistically higher area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUC than non-deep learning P\u2009=\u20090.0007\u2009<\u20090.001. The AUCs were 0.84 95% CI 0.78-0.89 for deep learning method and 0.70 95% CI 0.63-0.77 for non-deep learning method respectively. Our results suggest that deep learning with DCNN is superior to non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and BoW model for fully automated PCa patients differentiation from prostate BCs patients. Our deep learning method is extensible to image modalities such as MR imaging CT and PET of other organs.
