There has been burgeoning interest in applying machine learning methods for predicting radiotherapy outcomes. However the imbalanced ratio of a large number of variables to a limited sample size in radiation oncology constitutes a major challenge. Therefore dimensionality reduction methods can be a key to success. The study investigates and contrasts the application of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning approaches for outcome modeling in radiotherapy. In particular new joint architectures based on variational autoencoder VAE for dimensionality reduction are presented and their application is demonstrated for the prediction of lung radiation pneumonitis RP from a large-scale heterogeneous dataset. Combining handcrafted features with latent variables in machine learning for prediction of radiation-induced lung damage.
