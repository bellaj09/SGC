"This study aims to develop an automatic classifier based on deep learning for exacerbation frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. A threelayer deep belief network DBN with two hidden layers and one visible layer was employed to develop classification models and the models robustness to exacerbation was analyzed. Subjects from the COPDGene cohort were labeled with exacerbation frequency defined as the number of exacerbation events per year. 10300 subjects with 361 features each were included in the analysis. After feature selection and parameter optimization the proposed classification method achieved an accuracy of 91.99% using a 10-fold cross validation experiment. The analysis of DBN weights showed that there was a good visual spatial relationship between the underlying critical features of different layers. Our findings show that the most sensitive features obtained from the DBN weights are consistent with the consensus showed by clinical rules and standards for COPD diagnostics. We thus demonstrate that DBN is a competitive tool for exacerbation risk assessment for patients suffering from COPD."
