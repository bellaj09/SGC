"Deep brain stimulation of the medial globus pallidus GPm is a surgical procedure for treating patients suffering from Parkinsons disease. Its therapeutic effect may be limited by the presence of pyramidal tract side effect PTSE. PTSE is a contraction time-locked to the stimulation when the current spreading reaches the motor fibers of the pyramidal tract within the internal capsule. The objective of the study was to propose a preoperative predictive model of PTSE. A machine learning-based method called PyMAN PTSE model based on artificial neural network accounting for the current used in stimulation the three-dimensional electrode coordinates and the angle of the trajectory was designed to predict the occurrence of PTSE. Ten patients implanted in the GPm have been tested by a clinician to create a labeled dataset of the stimulation parameters that trigger PTSE. The kappa index value between the data predicted by PyMAN and the labeled data was 0.78. Further evaluation studies are desirable to confirm whether PyMAN could be a reliable tool for assisting the surgeon to prevent PTSE during the preoperative planning."
