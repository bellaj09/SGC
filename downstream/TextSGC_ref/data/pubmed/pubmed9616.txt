Automated synthetic computed tomography sCT generation based on magnetic resonance imaging MRI images would allow for MRI-only based treatment planning in radiation therapy eliminating the need for CT simulation and simplifying the patient treatment workflow. In this work the authors propose a novel method for generation of sCT based on dense cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks cycle GAN a deep-learning based model that trains two transformation mappings MRI to CT and CT to MRI simultaneously. MRI-only based synthetic CT generation using dense cycle consistent generative adversarial networks.
