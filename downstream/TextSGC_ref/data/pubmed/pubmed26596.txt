"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on event related potentials ERPs strive for offering communication pathways which are independent of muscle activity. While most visual ERP-based BCI paradigms require good control of the users gaze direction auditory BCI paradigms overcome this restriction. The present work proposes a novel approach using auditory evoked potentials for the example of a multiclass text spelling application. To control the ERP speller BCI users focus their attention to two-dimensional auditory stimuli that vary in both pitch high/medium/low and direction left/middle/right and that are presented via headphones. The resulting nine different control signals are exploited to drive a predictive text entry system. It enables the user to spell a letter by a single nine-class decision plus two additional decisions to confirm a spelled word. This paradigm - called PASS2D - was investigated in an online study with 12 healthy participants. Users spelled with more than 0.8 characters per minute on average 3.4\u2009bits/min which makes PASS2D a competitive method. It could enrich the toolbox of existing ERP paradigms for BCI end users like people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease in a late stage."
