With the increasing availability of advanced imaging technologies we are entering a new era of neuroscience. Detailed descriptions of the complex brain network enable us to map out a structural connectome characterize it with graph theoretical methods and compare it to the functional networks with increasing detail. To link these two aspects and understand how dynamics and structure interact to form functional brain networks in task and in the resting state we use theoretical models. The advantage of using theoretical models is that by recreating functional connectivity and time series explicitly from structure and pre-defined dynamics we can extract critical mechanisms by linking structure and function in ways not directly accessible in the real brain. Recently resting-state models with varying local dynamics have reproduced empirical functional connectivity patterns and given support to the view that the brain works at a critical point at the edge of a bifurcation of the system. Here we present an overview of a modeling approach of the resting brain network and give an application of a neural mass model in the study of complexity changes in aging. Bottom up modeling of the connectome: linking structure and function in the resting brain and their changes in aging.
