Effective use of brain-computer interfaces BCIs typically requires training. Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying BCI training will facilitate optimisation of BCIs. The current study examined the neural mechanisms related to training for electroencephalography EEG-based communication with an auditory event-related potential ERP BCI. Neural mechanisms of training in 10 healthy volunteers were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI during an auditory ERP-based BCI task before t1 and after t5 three ERP-BCI training sessions outside the fMRI scanner t2 t3 and t4. Attended stimuli were contrasted with ignored stimuli in the first-level fMRI data analysis t1 and t5; the training effect was verified using the EEG data t2-t4; and brain activation was contrasted before and after training in the second-level fMRI data analysis t1 vs. t5. Training increased the communication speed from 2.9 bits/min t2 to 4 bits/min t4. Strong activation was found in the putamen supplementary motor area SMA and superior temporal gyrus STG associated with attention to the stimuli. Training led to decreased activation in the superior frontal gyrus and stronger haemodynamic rebound in the STG and supramarginal gyrus. The neural mechanisms of ERP-BCI training indicate improved stimulus perception and reduced mental workload. The ERP task used in the current study showed overlapping activations with a motor imagery based BCI task from a previous study on the neural mechanisms of BCI training in the SMA and putamen. This suggests commonalities between the neural mechanisms of training for both BCI paradigms.
