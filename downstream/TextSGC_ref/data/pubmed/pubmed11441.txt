The convolutional neural network CNN is a promising technique to detect breast cancer based on mammograms. Training the CNN from scratch however requires a large amount of labeled data. Such a requirement usually is infeasible for some kinds of medical image data such as mammographic tumor images. Because improvement of the performance of a CNN classifier requires more training data the creation of new training images image augmentation is one solution to this problem. We applied the generative adversarial network GAN to generate synthetic mammographic images from the digital database for screening mammography DDSM. From the DDSM we cropped two sets of regions of interest ROIs from the images: normal and abnormal cancer/tumor. Those ROIs were used to train the GAN and the GAN then generated synthetic images. For comparison with the affine transformation augmentation methods such as rotation shifting scaling etc. we used six groups of ROIs three simple groups: affine augmented GAN synthetic real original and three mixture groups of any two of the three simple groups for each to train a CNN classifier from scratch. And we used real ROIs that were not used in training to validate classification outcomes. Our results show that to classify the normal ROIs and abnormal ROIs from DDSM adding GAN-generated ROIs in the training data can help the classifier prevent overfitting and on validation accuracy the GAN performs about 3.6% better than affine transformations for image augmentation. Therefore GAN could be an ideal augmentation approach. The images augmented by GAN or affine transformation cannot substitute for real images to train CNN classifiers because the absence of real images in the training set will cause over-fitting.
