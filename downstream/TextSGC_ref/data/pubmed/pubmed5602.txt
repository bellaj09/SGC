Identifying novel indications for approved drugs can accelerate drug development and reduce research costs. Most previous studies used shallow models for prioritizing the potential drug-related diseases and failed to deeply integrate the paths between drugs and diseases which may contain additional association information. A deep-learning-based method for predicting drug-disease associations by integrating useful information is needed. We proposed a novel method based on a convolutional neural network CNN and bidirectional long short-term memory BiLSTM-CBPred-for predicting drug-related diseases. Our method deeply integrates similarities and associations between drugs and diseases and paths among drug-disease pairs. The CNN-based framework focuses on learning the original representation of a drug-disease pair from their similarities and associations. As the drug-disease association possibility also depends on the multiple paths between them the BiLSTM-based framework mainly learns the path representation of the drug-disease pair. In addition considering that different paths have discriminate contributions to the association prediction an attention mechanism at path level is constructed. Our method CBPred showed better performance and retrieved more real associations in the front of the results which is more important for biologists. Case studies further confirmed that CBPred can discover potential drug-disease associations.
