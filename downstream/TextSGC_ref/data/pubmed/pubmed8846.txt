"To avoid test-driven learning there have been discussions regarding the use of more formative assessments in health care education to promote students deep learning. Feedback is important in formative assessment but many students ignore it; therefore interventions should be introduced which stimulate them to reflect on the new knowledge. The aim for this study was to explore if Virtual Patient VP-based formative assessments in connection with self-evaluations had an impact on postgraduate pediatric nursing students development of clinical reasoning abilities. Students self-evaluations served as the basis for measuring progress. Data was analysed using deductive content analysis. The findings showed a clear progression of the clinical reasoning ability of the students. After the first assessment the students described feelings of uncertainty and that their knowledge gaps were exposed. At the mid-course assessment the awareness of improved clinical reasoning was obvious and the students were more certain of knowing how to solve the VP cases. In the final assessment self-efficacy was expressed. VP-based assessments in connection with self-evaluations early in the education resulted in a gain of students own identification of the concept of clinical reasoning awareness of what to focus on during clinical practice and visualised expected clinical competence."
