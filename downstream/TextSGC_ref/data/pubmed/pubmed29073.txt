Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are a promising tool in neurorehabilitation. The intention to perform a motor action can be detected from brain signals and used to control robotic devices. Most previous studies have focused on the starting of movements from a resting state while in daily life activities motions occur continuously and the neural activities correlated to the evolving movements are yet to be investigated. Detecting intention to execute the next movement while performing current movement from EEG using global optimal constrained ICA.
