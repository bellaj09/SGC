While both the sciences and the humanities as currently defined may be too heterogeneous to be encompassed within a unified historical framework there is good reason to believe that the history of science and the history of philologies both have much to gain by joining forces. This collaboration has already yielded striking results in the case of the history of science and humanist learning in early modern Europe. This essay argues that first philology and at least some of the sciences e.g. astronomy remained intertwined in consequential ways well into the modern period in Western cultures; and second widening the scope of inquiry to include other philological traditions in non-Western cultures offers rich possibilities for a comparative history of learned practices. The focus on practices is key; by shifting the emphasis from what is studied to how it is studied deep commonalities emerge among disciplines--and intellectual traditions--now classified as disparate.
