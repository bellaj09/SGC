A principle-based concept analysis of student engagement was used to examine the state of the science across disciplines. Four major perspectives of philosophy of science guided analysis and provided a framework for study of interrelationships and integration of conceptual components which then resulted in formulation of a theoretical definition. Findings revealed student engagement as a dynamic reiterative process marked by positive behavioral cognitive and affective elements exhibited in pursuit of deep learning. This process is influenced by a broader sociocultural environment bound by contextual preconditions of self-investment motivation and a valuing of learning. Outcomes of student engagement include satisfaction sense of well-being and personal development. Findings of this analysis prove relevant to nursing education as faculty transition from traditional teaching paradigms incorporate learner-centered strategies and adopt innovative pedagogical methodologies. It lends support for curricula reform development of more accurate evaluative measures and creation of meaningful teaching-learning environments within the discipline.
