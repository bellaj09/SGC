Oxygen-induced retinopathy OIR is a widely used model to study ischemia-driven neovascularization NV in the retina and to serve in proof-of-concept studies in evaluating antiangiogenic drugs for ocular as well as nonocular diseases. The primary parameters that are analyzed in this mouse model include the percentage of retina with vaso-obliteration VO and NV areas. However quantification of these two key variables comes with a great challenge due to the requirement of human experts to read the images. Human readers are costly time-consuming and subject to bias. Using recent advances in machine learning and computer vision we trained deep learning neural networks using over a thousand segmentations to fully automate segmentation in OIR images. While determining the percentage area of VO our algorithm achieved a similar range of correlation coefficients to that of expert inter-human correlation coefficients. In addition our algorithm achieved a higher range of correlation coefficients compared with inter-expert correlation coefficients for quantification of the percentage area of neovascular tufts. In summary we have created an open-source fully automated pipeline for the quantification of key values of OIR images using deep learning neural networks. Fully automated deep learning segmentation of oxygen-induced retinopathy images.
