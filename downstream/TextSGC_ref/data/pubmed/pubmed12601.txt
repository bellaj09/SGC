The aim of the current study is to identify possible new Ocular Response Analyzer ORA waveform parameters related to changes of retinal structure/deformation as measured by the peripapillary retinal arteries angle PRAA using a generative deep learning method of variational autoencoder VAE. Fifty-four eyes of 52 subjects were enrolled. The PRAA was calculated from fundus photographs and was used to train a VAE model. By analyzing the ORA waveform reconstructed noise filtered using VAE a novel ORA waveform parameter Monot1-2 was introduced representing the change in monotonicity between the first and second applanation peak of the waveform. The variables mostly related to the PRAA were identified from a set of 41 variables including age axial length AL keratometry ORA corneal hysteresis ORA corneal resistant factor 35 well established ORA waveform parameters and Monot1-2 using a model selection method based on the second-order bias-corrected Akaike information criterion. The optimal model for PRAA was the AL and six ORA waveform parameters including Monot1-2. This optimal model was significantly better than the model without Monot1-2 p\u2009=\u20090.0031 ANOVA. The current study suggested the value of a generative deep learning approach in discovering new useful parameters that may have clinical relevance.
