"According to theories of anticipatory behavior control actions are initiated by predicting their sensory outcomes. From the perspective of event-predictive cognition and active inference predictive processes activate currently desired events and event boundaries as well as the expected sensorimotor mappings necessary to realize them dependent on the involved predicted uncertainties before actual motor control unfolds. Accordingly we asked whether peripersonal hand space is remapped in an uncertainty anticipating manner while grasping and placing bottles in a virtual reality VR setup. To investigate we combined the crossmodal congruency paradigm with virtual object interactions in two experiments. As expected an anticipatory crossmodal congruency effect aCCE at the future finger position on the bottle was detected. Moreover a manipulation of the visuo-motor mapping of the participants virtual hand while approaching the bottle selectively reduced the aCCE at movement onset. Our results support theories of event-predictive anticipatory behavior control and active inference showing that expected uncertainties in movement control indeed influence anticipatory stimulus processing."
