Mixed reality a blending of the physical and digital worlds can enhance the surgical experience leading to greater precision efficiency and improved outcomes. Various studies across different disciplines have reported encouraging results using mixed reality technologies such as augmented and virtual reality. To provide a better understanding of the applications and limitations of this technology in plastic surgery we performed a systematic review of the literature in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The initial query of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database yielded 2544 results and only 46 articles met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were in the field of craniofacial surgery and uses of mixed reality included preoperative planning intraoperative guides and education of surgical trainees. A deeper understanding of mixed reality technologies may promote its integration and also help inspire new and creative applications in healthcare.
