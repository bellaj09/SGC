Studies on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging rs-fMRI have shown that different brain regions still actively interact with each other while a subject is at rest and such functional interaction is not stationary but changes over time. In terms of a large-scale brain network in this paper we focus on time-varying patterns of functional networks i.e. functional dynamics inherent in rs-fMRI which is one of the emerging issues along with the network modelling. Specifically we propose a novel methodological architecture that combines deep learning and state-space modelling and apply it to rs-fMRI based Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI diagnosis. We first devise a Deep Auto-Encoder DAE to discover hierarchical non-linear functional relations among regions by which we transform the regional features into an embedding space whose bases are complex functional networks. Given the embedded functional features we then use a Hidden Markov Model HMM to estimate dynamic characteristics of functional networks inherent in rs-fMRI via internal states which are unobservable but can be inferred from observations statistically. By building a generative model with an HMM we estimate the likelihood of the input features of rs-fMRI as belonging to the corresponding status i.e. MCI or normal healthy control based on which we identify the clinical label of a testing subject. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method we performed experiments on two different datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We also analyzed the functional networks learned by DAE estimated the functional connectivities by decoding hidden states in HMM and investigated the estimated functional connectivities by means of a graph-theoretic approach.
