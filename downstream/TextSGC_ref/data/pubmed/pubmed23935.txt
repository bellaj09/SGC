In recent years virtual reality VR technologies have become widely used in clinical settings because they offer impressive opportunities for neurorehabilitation of different cognitive deficits. Specifically virtual environments VEs have ideal characteristics for navigational training aimed at rehabilitating spatial memory. A systematic search following PRISMA guidelines was carried out to explore the current scenario in neurorehabilitation of spatial memory using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried 5048 papers were screened and 16 studies were included covering patients presenting different neuropsychological diseases. Our findings highlight the potential of the navigational task in virtual environments VEs for enhancing navigation and orientation abilities in patients with spatial memory disorders. The results are promising and suggest that VR training can facilitate neurorehabilitation promoting brain plasticity processes. An overview of how VR-based training has been implemented is crucial for using these tools in clinical settings. Hence in the current manuscript we have critically debated the structure and the length of training protocols as well as a different type of exploration through VR devices with different degrees of immersion. Furthermore we analyzed and highlighted the crucial role played by the selection of the assessment tools. Neurorehabilitation of Spatial Memory Using Virtual Environments: A Systematic Review.
