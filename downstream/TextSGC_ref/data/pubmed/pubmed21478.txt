"Robotic systems offer the possibility of improving the life quality of people with severe motor disabilities enhancing the individuals degree of independence and interaction with the external environment. In this direction the operators residual functions must be exploited for the control of the robot movements and the underlying dynamic interaction through intuitive and effective human-robot interfaces. Towards this end this work aims at exploring the potential of a novel Soft Brain-Machine Interface BMI suitable for dynamic execution of remote manipulation tasks for a wide range of patients. The interface is composed of an eye-tracking system for an intuitive and reliable control of a robotic arm systems trajectories and a Brain-Computer Interface BCI unit for the control of the robot Cartesian stiffness which determines the interaction forces between the robot and environment. The latter control is achieved by estimating in real-time a unidimensional index from users electroencephalographic EEG signals which provides the probability of a neutral or active state. This estimated state is then translated into a stiffness value for the robotic arm allowing a reliable modulation of the robots impedance. A preliminary evaluation of this hybrid interface concept provided evidence on the effective execution of tasks with dynamic uncertainties demonstrating the great potential of this control method in BMI applications for self-service and clinical care."
