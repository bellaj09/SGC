Routine daily practice shows that successful vaginal delivery for women with suspected narrow pelvis or large fetus remains possible. We present a computer software for the detection of fetopelvic disproportion based on 3D vectorial reconstructions of the fetal head and maternal pelvis with simulation of head passage through the pelvis for collision detection. Three delivery simulations were generated from MR pelvimetry data in two patients one with narrow pelvis and the other with macrosomic fetus. Based on the simulation fetus size in both cases was appropriate for the pelvic size but delivery simulation for the macrosomic fetus concluded that vaginal delivery was mechanically impossible. Further evaluation of this promising software on a larger patient population is necessary. Detection of cephalopelvic disproportion using a virtual reality model: a feasibility study of three cases.
