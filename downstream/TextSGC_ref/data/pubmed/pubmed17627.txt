Virtual reality VR is a computer technique that creates an artificial environment composed of realistic images sounds and other sensations. Many researchers have used VR devices to generate various stimuli and have utilized them to perform experiments or to provide treatment. In this study the participants performed mental tasks using a VR device while physiological signals were measured: a photoplethysmogram PPG electrodermal activity EDA and skin temperature SKT. In general stress is an important factor that can influence the autonomic nervous system ANS. Heart-rate variability HRV is known to be related to ANS activity so we used an HRV derived from the PPG peak interval. In addition the peak characteristics of the skin conductance SC from EDA and SKT variation can also reflect ANS activity; we utilized them as well. Then we applied a kernel-based extreme-learning machine K-ELM to correctly classify the stress levels induced by the VR task to reflect five different levels of stress situations: baseline mild stress moderate stress severe stress and recovery. Twelve healthy subjects voluntarily participated in the study. Three physiological signals were measured in stress environment generated by VR device. As a result the average classification accuracy was over 95% using K-ELM and the integrated feature IT = HRV + SC + SKT. In addition the proposed algorithm can embed a microcontroller chip since K-ELM algorithm have very short computation time. Therefore a compact wearable device classifying stress levels using physiological signals can be developed.
