Gastrointestinal disturbances are among symptoms commonly reported by individuals diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ME/CFS. However whether ME/CFS is associated with an altered microbiome has remained uncertain. Here we profiled gut microbial diversity by sequencing 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid rRNA genes from stool as well as inflammatory markers from serum for cases n\u2009=\u200948 and controls n\u2009=\u200939. We also examined a set of inflammatory markers in blood: C-reactive protein CRP intestinal fatty acid-binding protein I-FABP lipopolysaccharide LPS LPS-binding protein LBP and soluble CD14 sCD14. Reduced diversity and altered composition of the gut microbiome in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.
