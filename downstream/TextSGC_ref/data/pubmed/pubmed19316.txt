The process of determining the functional sequence content of an organism is confounded by several factors. Large protein coding sequences are relatively easy to find by statistical methods. Smaller proteins however may escape detection due to their size falling below some arbitrary researcher-defined minimum cutoff or the inability to precisely define a promoter or translational start Delcher et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 27 4636-4641 1999. Promoter and regulatory sequences themselves are difficult to define due to a significant amount of allowable sequence variation as well as a probable lack of any completely accurate whole-organismal gene catalogs to date. Finally certain genes coding functional RNAs may have insufficient structural or sequence constraints to be detectable by normal sequence structure/pattern searching methods Eddy and Rivas Bioinformatics 16 583-605 2000. In those cases where there are multiple closely related organisms that have been sequenced there is additional information that may be used in the investigation of sequence content-that being the possible conserved nature of functional sequences between the organisms. We present a method for the utilization of this conserved information to detect genes and other potentially functional sequences that may be missed by standard ORF-calling RNA finding and pattern matching software. The tricross programs produce a multi-way cross comparison of three sets of sequences determine which are conserved in all three sets and produce a graphical Virtual Reality Modelling Language-VRML; ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997 VDC 1997 representation as well as alignments of all sequence triples found. The software can also be applied to a pair of sequence sets though the noise in the results increases. Tricross : using dot-plots in sequence-id space to detect uncataloged intergenic features.
