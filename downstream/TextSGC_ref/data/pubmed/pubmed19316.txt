"Virtual reality VR offers powerful therapy options within a functional purposeful and motivating context. Several studies have shown that patients motivation plays a crucial role in determining therapy outcome. However few studies have demonstrated the potential of VR in pediatric rehabilitation. Therefore we developed a VR-based soccer scenario which provided interactive elements to engage patients during robotic assisted treadmill training RAGT. The aim of this study was to compare the immediate effect of different supportive conditions VR versus non-VR conditions on motor output in patients and healthy control children during training with the driven gait orthosis Lokomat*."
