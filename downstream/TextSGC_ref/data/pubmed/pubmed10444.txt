Across three experiments we explore differences between relational categories-whose members share common relational patterns-and entity categories whose members share common intrinsic properties. Specifically we test the claim that relational concepts are more semantically mutable in context and therefore less stable in memory than entity concepts. We compared memory for entity nouns and relational nouns tested either in the same context as at encoding or in a different context. We found that a participants show better recognition accuracy for entity nouns than for relational nouns and b recognition of relational nouns is more impaired by a change in context than is recognition of entity nouns. We replicated these findings even when controlling for factors highly correlated with relationality such as abstractness-concreteness. This suggests that the contextual mutability of relational concepts is due to the core semantic property of conveying relational structure and not simply to accompanying characteristics such as abstractness. We note parallels with the distinction between nouns and verbs and suggest implications for lexical and conceptual structure. Finally we relate these patterns to proposals that a deep distinction exists between words with an essentially referential function and those with a predicate function. Relational categories are more mutable than entity categories.
