The study investigated hypnosis-related electroencephalographic EEG coherence and power spectra changes in high and low hypnotizables Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale induced by a virtual reality hypnosis VRH induction system. In this study the EEG from 17 participants Mean age = 21.35 SD = 1.58 were compared based on their hypnotizability score. The EEG recording associated with a 2-minute eyes-closed baseline state was compared to the EEG during a hypnosis-related state. This novel induction system was able to produce EEG findings consistent with previous hypnosis literature. Interactions of significance were found with EEG beta coherence. The high susceptibility group n = 7 showed decreased coherence while the low susceptibility group n = 10 demonstrated an increase in coherence between medial frontal and lateral left prefrontal sites. Methodological and efficacy issues are discussed. EEG correlates of virtual reality hypnosis.
