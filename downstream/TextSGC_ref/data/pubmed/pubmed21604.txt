Neurobiological markers of stress symptom progression for healthy survivors from a disaster e.g. an earthquake would greatly help with early intervention to prevent the development of stress-related disorders. However the relationship between the neurobiological alterations and the symptom progression over time is unclear. Here we examined 44 healthy survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake in China in a longitudinal resting-state fMRI study to observe the alterations of brain functions related to depressive or anxiety symptom progression. Using multi-variate pattern analysis to the fMRI data we successfully predicted the depressive or anxiety symptom severity for these survivors in short- 25 days and long-term 2 years and the symptom severity changes over time. Several brain areas e.g. the frontolimbic and striatal areas and the functional connectivities located within the fronto-striato-thalamic and default-mode networks were found to be correlated with the symptom progression and might play important roles in the adaptation to trauma.
