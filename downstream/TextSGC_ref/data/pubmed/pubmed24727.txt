It is quite remarkable that brain machine interfaces BMIs can be used to control complex movements with fewer than 100 neurons. Success may be due in part to the limited range of dynamical conditions under which most BMIs are tested. Achieving high-quality control that spans these conditions with a single linear mapping will be more challenging. Even for simple reaching movements existing BMIs must reduce the stochastic noise of neurons by averaging the control signals over time instead of over the many neurons that normally control movement. This forces a compromise between a decoder with dynamics allowing rapid movement and one that allows postures to be maintained with little jitter. Our current work presents a method for addressing this compromise which may also generalize to more highly varied dynamical situations including movements with more greatly varying speed. Brain-state classification and a dual-state decoder dramatically improve the control of cursor movement through a brain-machine interface.
