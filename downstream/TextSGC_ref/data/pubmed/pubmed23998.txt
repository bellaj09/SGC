Since the liver is one of the most important organs of the body that can be injured during trauma that is during accidents like car crashes understanding its mechanical properties is of great interest. Experimental data is needed to address the mechanical properties of the liver to be used for a variety of applications such as the numerical simulations for medical purposes including the virtual reality simulators trauma research diagnosis objectives as well as injury biomechanics. However the data on the mechanical properties of the liver capsule is limited to the animal models or confined to the tensile/compressive loading under single direction. Therefore this study was aimed at experimentally measuring the axial and transversal mechanical properties of the human liver capsule under both the tensile and compressive loadings.
