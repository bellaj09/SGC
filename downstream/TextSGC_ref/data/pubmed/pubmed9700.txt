Among the many types of deep models deep generative models DGMs provide a solution to the important problem of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. However training DGMs requires more skill experience and know-how because their training is more complex than other types of deep models such as convolutional neural networks CNNs. We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the overall training process we first extract a large amount of time series data that represents training dynamics e.g. activation changes over time. A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models such as CNNs.
