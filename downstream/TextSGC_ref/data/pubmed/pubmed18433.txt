"Freezing of gait is an episodic inability to move the feet forward despite the intention to walk. It is a common cause of falls and subsequent morbidity and mortality in Parkinsons disease. Virtual reality paradigms provide an opportunity to safely evaluate freezing of gait in order to better understand the underlying pathophysiology. This article focuses on the methodology threshold used to define freezing of gait results limitations of studies using virtual reality paradigms and proposes future directions of research. Summarizing these articles improves our understanding of freezing of gait in Parkinsons disease and critical evaluation provides an opportunity for future studies to improve upon these efforts."
