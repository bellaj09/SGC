After peripheral nerve injury motor and sensory axons are able to regenerate but inaccuracy of target reinnervation leads to poor functional recovery. Extracellular matrix ECM components and neurotrophic factors NTFs exert their effect on different neuronal populations creating a suitable environment to promote axonal growth. Here we assessed in vitro and in vivo the selective effects of combining different ECM components with NTFs on motor and sensory axons regeneration and target reinnervation. Organotypic cultures with collagen laminin and nerve growth factor NGF/neurotrophin-3 NT3 or collagen fibronectin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF selectively enhanced sensory neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons and motor neurite outgrowth from spinal cord slices respectively. For in vivo studies the rat sciatic nerve was transected and repaired with a silicone tube filled with a collagen and laminin matrix with NGF/NT3 encapsulated in polylactic-co-glycolic acid PLGA microspheres MP LM + MP.NGF/NT3 or a collagen and fibronectin matrix with BDNF in PLGA MPs FN + MP.BDNF. Retrograde labeling and functional tests showed that LM + MP.NGF/NT3 increased the number of regenerated sensory neurons and improved sensory functional recovery whereas FN + MP.BDNF preferentially increased regenerated motoneurons and enhanced motor functional recovery. Therefore combination of ECM molecules with NTFs may be a good approach to selectively enhance motor and sensory axons regeneration and promote appropriate target reinnervation.
