This paper describes a low-power hardware implementation for movement decoding of brain computer interface. Our proposed hardware design is facilitated by two novel ideas: i an efficient feature extraction method based on reduced-resolution discrete cosine transform DCT and ii a new hardware architecture of dual look-up table to perform discrete cosine transform without explicit multiplication. The proposed hardware implementation has been validated for movement decoding of electrocorticography ECoG signal by using a Xilinx FPGA Zynq-7000 board. It achieves more than 56 energy reduction over a reference design using band-pass filters for feature extraction. Low-power hardware implementation of movement decoding for brain computer interface with reduced-resolution discrete cosine transform.
