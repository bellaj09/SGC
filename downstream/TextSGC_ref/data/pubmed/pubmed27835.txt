We propose an empirical mode decomposition EMD- based method to extract features from the multichannel recordings of local field potential LFP collected from the middle temporal MT visual cortex in a macaque monkey for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion SFM perception. The feature extraction approach consists of three stages. First we employ EMD to decompose nonstationary single-trial time series into narrowband components called intrinsic mode functions IMFs with time scales dependent on the data. Second we adopt unsupervised K-means clustering to group the IMFs and residues into several clusters across all trials and channels. Third we use the supervised common spatial patterns CSP approach to design spatial filters for the clustered spatiotemporal signals. We exploit the support vector machine SVM classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We demonstrate that the CSP feature of the cluster in the gamma frequency band outperforms the features in other frequency bands and leads to the best decoding performance. We also show that the EMD-based feature extraction can be useful for evoked potential estimation. Our proposed feature extraction approach may have potential for many applications involving nonstationary multivariable time series such as brain-computer interfaces BCI.
