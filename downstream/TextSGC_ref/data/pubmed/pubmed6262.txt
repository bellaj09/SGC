Multiple large-scale neural networks orchestrate a wide range of cognitive processes. For example interoceptive processes related to self-referential thinking have been linked to the default-mode network DMN; whereas exteroceptive processes related to cognitive control have been linked to the executive-control network ECN. Although the DMN and ECN have been postulated to exert opposing effects on cognition it remains unclear how connectivity with these spatially overlapping networks contribute to fluctuations in behavior. While previous work has suggested the medial-prefrontal cortex MPFC is involved in behavioral change following feedback these observations could be linked to interoceptive processes tied to DMN or exteroceptive processes tied to ECN because MPFC is positioned in both networks. To address this problem we employed independent component analysis combined with dual-regression functional connectivity analysis. Participants made a series of financial decisions framed as monetary gains or losses. In some sessions participants received feedback from a peer observing their choices; in other sessions feedback was not provided. Following feedback framing susceptibility-indexed as the increase in gambling behavior in loss frames compared to gain frames-was heightened in some participants and diminished in others. We examined whether these individual differences were linked to differences in connectivity by contrasting sessions containing feedback against those that did not contain feedback. We found two key results. As framing susceptibility increased the MPFC increased connectivity with DMN; in contrast temporal-parietal junction decreased connectivity with the ECN. Our results highlight how functional connectivity patterns with distinct neural networks contribute to idiosyncratic behavioral changes. Functional connectivity with distinct neural networks tracks fluctuations in gain/loss framing susceptibility.
