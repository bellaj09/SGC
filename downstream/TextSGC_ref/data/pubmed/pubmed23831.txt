Visually induced motion sickness VIMS is a well-known sensation in virtual environments and simulators typically characterized by a variety of symptoms such as pallor sweating dizziness fatigue and/or nausea. Numerous methods to reduce VIMS have been previously introduced; however a reliable countermeasure is still missing. In the present study the effect of airflow and seat vibration to alleviate VIMS was investigated. Eighty-two participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups airflow vibration combined airflow and vibration and control and then exposed to a 15\xa0min long video of a bicycle ride shot from first-person view. VIMS was measured using the Fast Motion Sickness Scale FMS and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire SSQ. Results showed that the exposure of airflow significantly reduced VIMS whereas the presence of seat vibration in contrast did not have an impact on VIMS. Additionally we found that females reported higher FMS scores than males however this sex difference was not found in the SSQ scores. Our findings demonstrate that airflow can be an effective and easy-to-apply technique to reduce VIMS in virtual environments and simulators while vibration applied to the seat is not a successful method. The efficacy of airflow and seat vibration on reducing visually induced motion sickness.
