The application of navigation integrated virtual reality VR in neurosurgery is an emerging paradigm that may offer improved situational awareness for the surgeon. Here we present a case of a complex arteriovenous malformation AVM with complex venous drainage and observe how VR impacted structural delineation during approach resection and overall strategic planning. The patient was a 30-yr-old female with no past medical history who presented with headaches and a generalized tonic clonic seizure. Workup included computed tomography computed tomography angiography magnetic resonance imaging magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography; a high flow right frontal AVM was found. The AVM was safely resected using navigation integrated with VR; careful arterial devascularization preceded resection of the draining veins and then the AVM nidus. Postoperative scans confirmed complete resection of the AVM. This case outlines the application of a current state-of-the-art VR platform to assist the craniotomy for resection of an AVM.
