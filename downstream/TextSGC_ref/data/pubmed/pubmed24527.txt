Immersive virtual reality is thought to be advantageous by leading to higher levels of presence. However and despite users getting actively involved in immersive three-dimensional virtual environments that incorporate sound and motion there are individual factors such as age video game knowledge and the predisposition to immersion that may be associated with the quality of virtual reality experience. Moreover one particular concern for users engaged in immersive virtual reality environments VREs is the possibility of side effects such as cybersickness. The literature suggests that at least 60% of virtual reality users report having felt symptoms of cybersickness which reduces the quality of the virtual reality experience. The aim of this study was thus to profile the right user to be involved in a VRE through head-mounted display. To examine which user characteristics are associated with the most effective virtual reality experience lower cybersickness a multiple correspondence analysis combined with cluster analysis technique was performed. Results revealed three distinct profiles showing that the PC gamer profile is more associated with higher levels of virtual reality effectiveness that is higher predisposition to be immersed and reduced cybersickness symptoms in the VRE than console gamer and nongamer. These findings can be a useful orientation in clinical practice and future research as they help identify which users are more predisposed to benefit from immersive VREs.
