Chest radiograph interpretation is critical for the detection of thoracic diseases including tuberculosis and lung cancer which affect millions of people worldwide each year. This time-consuming task typically requires expert radiologists to read the images leading to fatigue-based diagnostic error and lack of diagnostic expertise in areas of the world where radiologists are not available. Recently deep learning approaches have been able to achieve expert-level performance in medical image interpretation tasks powered by large network architectures and fueled by the emergence of large labeled datasets. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a deep learning algorithm on the detection of pathologies in chest radiographs compared with practicing radiologists.
