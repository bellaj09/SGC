Dental anxiety and anxiety-related avoidance of dental care create significant problems for patients and the dental profession. Distraction interventions are used in daily medical practice to help patients cope with unpleasant procedures. There is evidence that exposure to natural scenery is beneficial for patients and that the use of virtual reality VR distraction is more effective than other distraction interventions such as watching television. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the use of VR during dental treatment can improve the overall dental experience and recollections of treatment for patients breaking the negative cycle of memories of anxiety leading to further anxiety and avoidance of future dental appointments. Additionally the aim is to test whether VR benefits dental patients with all levels of dental anxiety or whether it could be especially beneficial for patients suffering from higher levels of dental anxiety. The third aim is to test whether the content of the VR distraction can make a difference for its effectiveness by comparing two types of virtual environments a natural environment and an urban environment. Can virtual nature improve patient experiences and memories of dental treatment? A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
