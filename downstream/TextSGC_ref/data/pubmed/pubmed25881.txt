This paper describes the initial development of an innovative haptic device that will be integrated into an existing virtual reality training system for knee arthroscopy. The resulting system will be called WISHKATS Warwick Imperial Sheffield Knee Arthroscopy Training System. This haptic device will enable the trainee to feel realistic forces on the probing tool and will work together with software which will simulate tissue deformation. The proposed haptic system is a compact multi-degree of freedom motorised mechanism with force sensors and will be used to simulate the diagnostic aspects of knee arthroscopy. There are a number of problems associated with the development of a suitable haptic system and this paper explores the engineering requirements of such a device. Engineering requirements for a haptic simulator for knee arthroscopy training.
