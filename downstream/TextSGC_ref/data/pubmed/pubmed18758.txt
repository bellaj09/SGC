Wearable electronics such as smartwatches VR virtual reality/AR augmented reality smartglasses and E-textiles are an emerging technology platform that is reshaping the way people interact with the surrounding world. However the power source of these devices can be a critical issue causing short operational/standby times and frequent charging. Here a stretchable transparent wireless charging coil fabricated by negative adhesive transfer printing NATP is demonstrated. The stretchable transparent conductor is based on the silver nanowire AgNW-polyurethane acrylate PUA composite with high conductivity and robustness under harsh mechanical treatment. A 10.6 ohm/sq thin film has a transmittance of 84% and is still conductive under a mechanical deformation up to 60% tensile strain. A maximum power of 59 mW power transfer efficiency 24% is transferred wirelessly. A green-light-emitting diode LED was wirelessly powered to illustratively demonstrate the functionality of the system. This work provides an alternative power solution which is compatible with the soft and flexible components of wearable devices.
