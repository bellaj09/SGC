After ventral decompression of monosegmental cervical spondylotic stenosis a stand-alone cage SC or cage-with-plate CP can be inserted for fusion. Postoperative radiological evaluation can be achieved using different imaging modalities. We retrospectively compared complications as well as clinical and radiological outcomes for both fusion techniques and analyzed the possible role of virtual reality VR in evaluating the postoperative results. Comparison of stand-alone cage and cage-with-plate for monosegmental cervical fusion and impact of virtual reality in evaluating surgical results.
