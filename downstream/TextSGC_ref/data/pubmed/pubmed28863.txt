Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source. Implications for a Wireless External Device System to Study Electrocorticography.
