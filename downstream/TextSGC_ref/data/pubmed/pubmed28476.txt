A well defined set of design criteria is of great importance in the process of designing brain machine interfaces BMI based on extracellular recordings with chronically implanted micro-electrode arrays in the central nervous system CNS. In order to compare algorithms and evaluate their performance under various circumstances ground truth about their input needs to be present. Obtaining ground truth from real data would require optimal algorithms to be used given that those exist. This is not possible since it relies on the very algorithms that are to be evaluated. Using realistic models of the recording situation facilitates the simulation of extracellular recordings. The simulation gives access to a priori known signal characteristics such as spike times and identities. In this paper we describe a simulator based on a library of spikes obtained from recordings in the cat cerebellum and observed statistics of neuronal behavior during spontaneous activity. The simulator has proved to be useful in the task of generating extracellular recordings with realistic background noise and known ground truth to use in the evaluation of algorithms for spike detection and sorting. Spike library based simulator for extracellular single unit neuronal signals.
