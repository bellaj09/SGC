Opioid use disorder OUD is a chronic disorder with relapse based on both desire for reinforcement craving and avoidance of withdrawal. The aversive aspect of dependence and relapse has been associated with a small brain structure called the habenula which expresses large numbers of both opioid and nicotinic receptors. Additionally opioid withdrawal symptoms can be induced in opioid-treated rodents by blocking not only opioid but also nicotinic receptors. This receptor co-localization and cross-induction of withdrawal therefore might lead to genetic variation in the nicotinic receptor influencing development of human opioid dependence through its impact on the aversive components of opioid dependence. Increased habenular connectivity in opioid users is associated with an 5 subunit nicotinic receptor genetic variant.
