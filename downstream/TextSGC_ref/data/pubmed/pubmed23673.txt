Self-perception is scaffolded upon the integration of multisensory cues on the body the space surrounding the body i.e. the peri-personal space; PPS and from within the body. We asked whether reducing information available from external space would change: PPS interoceptive accuracy and self-experience. Twenty participants were exposed to 15\u202fmin of audio-visual deprivation and performed: i a visuo-tactile interaction task measuring their PPS; ii a heartbeat perception task measuring interoceptive accuracy; and iii a series of questionnaires related to self-perception and mental illness. These tasks were carried out in two conditions: while exposed to a standard sensory environment and under a condition of audio-visual deprivation. Results suggest that while PPS becomes ill defined after audio-visual deprivation interoceptive accuracy is unaltered at a group-level with some participants improving and some worsening in interoceptive accuracy. Interestingly correlational individual differences analyses revealed that changes in PPS after audio-visual deprivation were related to interoceptive accuracy and self-reports of "unusual experiences" on an individual subject basis. Taken together the findings argue for a relationship between the malleability of PPS interoceptive accuracy and an inclination toward aberrant ideation often associated with mental illness. Audio-visual sensory deprivation degrades visuo-tactile peri-personal space.
