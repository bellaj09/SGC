Virtual reality VR distraction has become increasingly available in health care contexts and is used in acute pain management. However there has been no systematic exploration of the importance of the content of VR environments. Two studies tested how interacting with nature VR influenced experienced and recollected pain after 1 week. Study 1 n = 85 used a laboratory pain task cold pressor whereas Study 2 n = 70 was a randomized controlled trial with patients undergoing dental treatment. In Study 1 nature coastal VR reduced both experienced and recollected pain compared with no VR. In Study 2 nature coastal VR reduced experienced and recalled pain in dental patients compared with urban VR and standard care. Together these data show that nature can improve experience of health care procedures through the use of VR and that the content of the VR matters: Coastal nature is better than urban.
