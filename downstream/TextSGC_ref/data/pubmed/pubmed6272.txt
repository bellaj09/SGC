"A functional polymorphism 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter linked polymorphic region 5-HTTLPR in the promoter region of human serotonin transporter gene has been found to be associated with several dimensions of neuroticism and psychopathology especially anxiety. However the neural basis underlying the association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety is less clear. Here we explored how 5-HTTLPR influenced anxiety by modulating the spontaneous brain activities in Han Chinese. First we found an association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety only in the male and not in the female population where male S/S homozygotes had a significantly higher level of anxiety than male L allele carriers. Then we examined how 5-HTTLPR influenced anxiety at both regional and network levels in the brain at rest. At the regional level we found a significantly higher fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the amygdala in male S/S homozygotes relative to male L allele carriers. At the network level male S/S homozygotes showed a weaker resting-state functional connectivity RSFC between the amygdala and various regions including the insula Heschls gyrus lateral occipital cortex superior temporal gyrus and hippocampus and a stronger RSFC between the amygdala and various regions including the supramariginal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. However at both levels only was the amygdala-insula RSFC correlated with anxiety. Mediation analyses further revealed that the amygdala-insula RSFC mediated the association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety. In short our study provided the first empirical evidence that the amygdala-insula RSFC served as the neural basis underlying the association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety suggesting a potential neurogenetic susceptibility mechanism for anxiety." Serotonin transporter gene polymorphism 5-HTTLPR influences trait anxiety by modulating the functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula in Han Chinese males.
