Purpose The purpose of this study was to develop a new telerehabilitation system based on VR technology for training of paralyzed upper and lower extremities and poor balance in patients with stroke. Moreover the effectiveness of the system was verified by analysis of the recovery of these patients. Subjects Five healthy persons and five people with motor paralysis caused by cerebrovascular disease participated. Methods The features of our system are as follows: 1 Our system can train upper and lower limbs and balancing with 3D images. 2 A Kinect is used for user posture detection. 3 A vibrator is used for feedback to a sensory receptor in order to promote the learning effect of motion. Upper limb and balance training were conducted in this study. Results The time necessary for the upper limb and balance training tasks was shortened for the participants with disabilities. The joint angle for the participants with disabilities tended to equate to that of the healthy participants over time. Moreover our system had no side effects. Conclusion These points suggest that our system is effective and safe. The user interface and assessment of the conditions of patients from a distance should be studied in the future. Development and evaluation of a new telerehabilitation system based on VR technology using multisensory feedback for patients with stroke.
