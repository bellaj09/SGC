"We present a novel approach to describe a P300 by a shape-feature vector which offers several advantages over the feature vector used by the BCI2000 system. Additionally we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector the number of trials and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents for a given electrode the subjects P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDAs performance using our shape-feature vector was 93% that is 10% higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-features vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC AUROC curve of 0.88. Also most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8. Finally we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification." P300 Detection Based on EEG Shape Features.
