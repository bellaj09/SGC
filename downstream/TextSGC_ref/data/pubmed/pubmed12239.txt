Endoscopic submucosal dissection ESD allows en bloc resection of lesions > 2 cm in diameter. However the procedure is difficult because of limited visualization of the cutting area. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new endoscope the "R-scope" for ESD; this provides a second flexible section for improved positioning capability and two instrumentation channels for vertical lifting of the targeted mucosal area and horizontal cutting of the submucosa. Endoscopic submucosal dissection ESD of early neoplastic gastric lesions using a new double-channel endoscope the "R-scope".
