This protocol describes a procedure to assist surgeons in training for the implantation of microelectrode arrays into the neocortex of the human brain. Recent technological progress has enabled the fabrication of microelectrode arrays that allow recording the activity of multiple individual neurons in the neocortex of the human brain. These arrays have the potential to bring unique insight onto the neuronal correlates of cerebral function in health and disease. Furthermore the identification and decoding of volitional neuronal activity opens the possibility to establish brain-computer interfaces and thus might help restore lost neurological functions. The implantation of neocortical microelectrode arrays is an invasive procedure requiring a supra-centimetric craniotomy and the exposure of the cortical surface; thus the procedure must be performed by an adequately trained neurosurgeon. In order to provide an opportunity for surgical training we designed a procedure based on a human cadaver model. The use of a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver bypasses the practical ethical and financial difficulties of surgical practice on animals especially non-human primates while preserving the macroscopic structure of the head skull meninges and cerebral surface and allowing realistic operating room-like positioning and instrumentation. Furthermore the use of a human cadaver is closer to clinical daily practice than any non-human model. The major drawbacks of the cadaveric simulation are the absence of cerebral pulsation and of blood and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. We suggest that a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver model is an adequate practical and cost-effective approach to ensure proper surgical training before implanting microelectrode arrays in the living human neocortex.
