A high fidelity Virtual Human Interface VHI system was developed using low-cost and portable computers. The system features real-time photo-realistic digital replicas of multiple individuals capable of talking acting and showing emotions and over 60 different facial expressions. These virtual patients appear in a high-performance virtual reality environment featuring full panoramic backgrounds animated 3D objects behavior and AI models a complete vision system for supporting interaction and advanced animation interfaces. The VHI takes advantage of the latest advances in computer graphics. As such it allows medical researchers and practitioners to create real-time responsive virtual humans for their experiments using computer systems priced under $2000.
