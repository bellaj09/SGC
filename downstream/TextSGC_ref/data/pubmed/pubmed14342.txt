"The concept of canaloplasty is to increase aqueous egress through all structures that control the aqueous outflow such as the trabecular meshwork Schlemms canal and collector channels by viscomodulation and by placing of a suture stent into the canal. Clinical studies show canaloplasty to be safe and efficient in lowering the intraocular pressure; however proper knotting of the tensioning suture is technically challenging and even impossible if circumferential cannulation cannot be achieved; furthermore protrusion of the suture stent is a potential lifelong risk."
