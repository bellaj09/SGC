"Among the possible approaches for building virtual environments VE researchers have recently started employing game engines GE. Although there are already studies reporting the usage of GE-based VEs their potential for supporting a more comprehensive workspace analysis considering the physical organizational and cognitive aspects of work has yet to be better understood. The main goal of this paper is to investigate how a GE-based simulation of a real workplace a local control room in an oil refinery can be used as a tool by practitioners and researchers in evaluating work conditions. Participants n\u202f=\u202f38 were recruited to explore the simulation and evaluate the workplace dimensions represented. A comparison between the scores participants attributed to the work dimensions and the scores assigned by the ergonomics consultant was performed through a statistical test to verify whether they significantly differed or not. Out of the 10 aspects evaluated only 3 presented significant differences thus showing that GE suitability for ergonomics analysis is conditioned to the aspects represented. Qualitative data analysis highlighted participants perception of GEs potential as an analysis and educational tool as well as a medium for fostering communication and stakeholder involvement in the design process."
