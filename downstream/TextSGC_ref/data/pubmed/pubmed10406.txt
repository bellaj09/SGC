Real-time interventional MRI I-MRI could help to visualize the position of the interventional feature thus improving patient outcomes in MR-guided neurosurgery. In particular in deep brain stimulation real-time visualization of the intervention procedure using I-MRI could improve the accuracy of the electrode placement. However the requirements of a high undersampling rate and fast reconstruction speed for real-time imaging pose a great challenge for reconstruction of the interventional images. Based on recent advances in deep learning DL we proposed a feature-based convolutional neural network FbCNN for reconstructing interventional images from golden-angle radially sampled data. The method was composed of two stages: a reconstruction of the interventional feature and b feature refinement and postprocessing. With only five radially sampled spokes the interventional feature was reconstructed with a cascade CNN. The final interventional image was constructed with a refined feature and a fully sampled reference image. With a comparison of traditional reconstruction techniques and recent DL-based methods it was shown that only FbCNN could reconstruct the interventional feature and the final interventional image. With a reconstruction time of ~ 500\xa0ms per frame and an acceleration factor of ~ 80 it was demonstrated that FbCNN had the potential for application in real-time I-MRI.
