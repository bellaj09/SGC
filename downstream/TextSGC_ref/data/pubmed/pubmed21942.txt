Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are a form of technology that read a user\s neural signals to perform a task often with the aim of inferring user intention. They demonstrate potential in a wide range of clinical commercial and personal applications. But BCIs are not always simple to operate and even with training some BCI users do not operate their systems as intended. Many researchers have described this phenomenon as "BCI illiteracy" and a body of research has emerged aiming to characterize predict and solve this perceived problem. However BCI illiteracy is an inadequate concept for explaining difficulty that users face in operating BCI systems. BCI illiteracy is a methodologically weak concept; furthermore it relies on the flawed assumption that BCI users possess physiological or functional traits that prevent proficient performance during BCI use. Alternative concepts to BCI illiteracy may offer better outcomes for prospective users and may avoid the conceptual pitfalls that BCI illiteracy brings to the BCI research process.
