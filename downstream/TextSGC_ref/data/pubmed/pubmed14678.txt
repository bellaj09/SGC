Recent advances in deep learning have impacted various scientific and industrial fields. Due to the rapid application of deep learning in biomedical data molecular imaging has also started to adopt this technique. In this regard it is expected that deep learning will potentially affect the roles of molecular imaging experts as well as clinical decision making. This review firstly offers a basic overview of deep learning particularly for image data analysis to give knowledge to nuclear medicine physicians and researchers. Because of the unique characteristics and distinctive aims of various types of molecular imaging deep learning applications can be different from other fields. In this context the review deals with current perspectives of deep learning in molecular imaging particularly in terms of development of biomarkers. Finally future challenges of deep learning application for molecular imaging and future roles of experts in molecular imaging will be discussed.
