"Robots and virtual reality are gaining popularity in the intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder ASD. To shed light on childrens attitudes towards robots and characters in virtual reality this study aims to examine whether children with ASD show the uncanny valley effect. We varied the realism of facial appearance by morphing a cartoon face into a human face and induced perceptual mismatch by enlarging the eyes which has previously been shown as an effective method to induce the uncanny valley effect in adults. Children with ASD and typically developing TD children participated in a two-alternative forced choice task that asked them to choose one they liked more from the two images presented on the screen. We found that TD children showed the effect i.e. the enlargement of eye size and the approaching realism reduced their preference. In contrast children with ASD did not show the uncanny valley effect. Our findings in TD children help resolve the controversy in the literature about the existence of the uncanny valley effect among young children. Meanwhile the absence of the uncanny valley effect in children with ASD might be attributed to their reduced sensitivity to subtle changes of face features and their limited visual experience to faces caused by diminished social motivation. Last our findings provide practical implications for designing robots and virtual characters for the intervention of children with ASD." The uncanny valley effect in typically developing children and its absence in children with autism spectrum disorders.
