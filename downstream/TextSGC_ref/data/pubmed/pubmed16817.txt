Haptic technology has been widely employed in applications ranging from teleoperation and medical simulation to art and design including entertainment flight simulation and virtual reality. Today there is a growing interest among researchers in integrating haptic feedback into audiovisual systems. A new medium emerges from this effort: haptic-audiovisual HAV content. This paper presents the techniques formalisms and key results pertinent to this medium. We first review the three main stages of the HAV workflow: the production distribution and rendering of haptic effects. We then highlight the pressing necessity for evaluation techniques in this context and discuss the key challenges in the field. By building on existing technologies and tackling the specific challenges of the enhancement of audiovisual experience with haptics we believe the field presents exciting research perspectives whose financial and societal stakes are significant. Enhancing audiovisual experience with haptic feedback: a survey on HAV.
