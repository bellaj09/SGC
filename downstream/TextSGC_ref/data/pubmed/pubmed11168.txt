Artificial intelligence is a general term that means to accomplish a task mainly by a computer with the least human beings participation and it is widely accepted as the invention of robots. With the development of this new technology artificial intelligence has been one of the most influential information technology revolutions. We searched these English-language studies relative to ophthalmology published on PubMed and Springer databases. The application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology mainly concentrates on the diseases with a high incidence such as diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration glaucoma retinopathy of prematurity age-related or congenital cataract and few with retinal vein occlusion. According to the above studies we conclude that the sensitivity of detection and accuracy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 91.7% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ranged from 75% to 94.7% for age-related macular degeneration it ranged from 75% to 100% for retinopathy of prematurity ranged over 95% for retinal vein occlusion just one study reported ranged over 97% for glaucoma ranged 63.7% to 93.1% and for cataract it achieved a more than 70% similarity against clinical grading.
