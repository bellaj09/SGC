"To achieve accurate and fast deformable image registration DIR for pulmonary CT we proposed a Multi-scale DIR framework with unsupervised Joint training of Convolutional Neural Network MJ-CNN. MJ-CNN contains three models at multi-scale levels for a coarse-to-fine DIR to avoid being trapped in a local minimum. It is trained based on image similarity and deformation vector field DVF smoothness requiring no supervision of ground-truth DVF. The three models are first trained sequentially and separately for their own registration tasks and then are trained jointly for an end-to-end optimization under the multi-scale framework. In this study MJ-CNN was trained using public SPARE 4D-CT data. The trained MJ-CNN was then evaluated on public DIR-LAB 4D-CT dataset as well as clinical CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration. For 4D-CT inter-phase registration MJ-CNN achieved comparable accuracy to conventional iteration optimization-based methods and showed the smallest registration errors compared to recently published deep learning-based DIR methods demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed multi-scale joint training scheme. Besides MJ-CNN trained using one dataset SPARE could generalize to a different dataset DIR-LAB acquired by different scanners and imaging protocols. Furthermore MJ-CNN trained on 4D-CTs also performed well on CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration without any re-training or fine-tuning demonstrating MJ-CNNs robustness against applications and imaging techniques. MJ-CNN took about 1.4\u2009s for DVF estimation and required no manual-tuning of parameters during the evaluation. MJ-CNN is able to perform accurate DIR for pulmonary CT with nearly real-time speed making it very applicable for clinical tasks."
