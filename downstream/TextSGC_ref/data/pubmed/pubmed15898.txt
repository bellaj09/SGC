We describe Quanti.us  a crowd-based image-annotation platform that provides an accurate alternative to computational algorithms for difficult image-analysis problems. We used Quanti.us for a variety of medium-throughput image-analysis tasks and achieved 10-50\u2009savings in analysis time compared with that required for the same task by a single expert annotator. We show equivalent deep learning performance for Quanti.us-derived and expert-derived annotations which should allow scalable integration with tailored machine learning algorithms. Quanti.us: a tool for rapid flexible crowd-based annotation of images.
