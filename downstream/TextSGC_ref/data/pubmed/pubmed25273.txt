The eye level and the horizontal midline of the body trunk can serve respectively as references for judging the vertical and horizontal egocentric directions. We investigated whether the optic-flow pattern which is the dynamic motion information generated when one moves in the visual world can be used by the visual system to determine and calibrate these two references. Using a virtual-reality setup to generate the optic-flow pattern we showed that judged elevation of the eye level and the azimuth of the horizontal midline of the body trunk are biased toward the positional placement of the focus of expansion FOE of the optic-flow pattern. Furthermore for the vertical reference prolonged viewing of an optic-flow pattern with lowered FOE not only causes a lowered judged eye level after removal of the optic-flow pattern but also an overestimation of distance in the dark. This is equivalent to a reduction in the judged angular declination of the object after adaptation indicating that the optic-flow information also plays a role in calibrating the extraretinal signals used to establish the vertical reference.
