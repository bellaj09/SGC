Transposable elements TEs constitute the most common repeated sequences in eukaryotic genomes. Recent studies demonstrated their deep impact on species diversity adaptation to the environment and diseases. Although there are many conventional bioinformatics algorithms for detecting and classifying TEs none have achieved reliable results on different types of TEs. Machine learning ML techniques can automatically extract hidden patterns and novel information from labeled or non-labeled data and have been applied to solving several scientific problems. A systematic review of the application of machine learning in the detection and classification of transposable elements.
