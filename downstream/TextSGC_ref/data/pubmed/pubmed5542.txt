Membrane proteins the most important drug targets account for around 30% of total proteins encoded by the genome of living organisms. An important role of these proteins is to bind adenosine triphosphate ATP facilitating crucial biological processes such as metabolism and cell signaling. There are several reports elucidating ATP-binding sites within proteins. However such studies on membrane proteins are limited. Our prediction tool DeepATP combines evolutionary information in the form of Position Specific Scoring Matrix and two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network to predict ATP-binding sites in membrane proteins with an MCC of 0.89 and an AUC of 99%. Compared to recently published ATP-binding site predictors and classifiers that use traditional machine learning algorithms our approach performs significantly better. We suggest this method as a reliable tool for biologists for ATP-binding site prediction in membrane proteins.
