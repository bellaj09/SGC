"Brain structure and cognitive function change in the temporal lobe hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease and brain network-connection strength network efficiency and nodal attributes are abnormal. However existing research has only analyzed the differences between these patients and normal controls. In this study we constructed brain networks using resting-state functional MRI data that was extracted from four populations normal controls patients with early mild cognitive impairment patients with late mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimers disease using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set. The aim was to analyze the characteristics of resting-state functional neural networks and to observe mild cognitive impairment at different stages before the transformation to Alzheimers disease. Results showed that as cognitive deficits increased across the four groups the shortest path in the resting-state functional network gradually increased while clustering coefficients gradually decreased. This evidence indicates that dementia is associated with a decline of brain network efficiency. In addition the changes in functional networks revealed the progressive deterioration of network function across brain regions from healthy elderly adults to those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease. The alterations of node attributes in brain regions may reflect the cognitive functions in brain regions and we speculate that early impairments in memory hearing and language function can eventually lead to diffuse brain injury and other cognitive impairments."
