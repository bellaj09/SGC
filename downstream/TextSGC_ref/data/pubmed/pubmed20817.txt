A range of empirical findings suggest that active learning is important for memory. However few studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying this enactment effect in episodic memory using complex environments. Research using virtual reality has yielded inconsistent results. We postulated that the effect of action depends on the degree of interaction with the environment and freedom in the planning of an itinerary. To test these hypotheses we disentangled the interaction and planning components of action to investigate whether each enhances factual and spatial memory. Seventy-two participants 36 male and 36 female explored a virtual town in one of three experimental conditions: a a passive condition where participants were immersed as passenger of the car no interaction no planning; b a planning-only condition the subject chose the itinerary but did not drive the car; c an interaction-only condition the subject drove the car but the itinerary was fixed. We found that itinerary choice and motor control both enhanced spatial memory while factual memory was impaired by online motor control. The role of action in memory is discussed.
