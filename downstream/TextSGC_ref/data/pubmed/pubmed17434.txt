To develop a genome-based classification scheme for clear-cell sarcoma CCS also known as melanoma of soft parts MSP which would have implications for diagnosis and treatment. This tumor displays characteristic features of soft tissue sarcoma STS including deep soft tissue primary location and a characteristic translocation t12;22q13;q12 involving EWS and ATF1 genes. CCS/MSP also has typical melanoma features including immunoreactivity for S100 and HMB45 pigmentation MITF-M expression and a propensity for regional lymph node metastases. Classification of clear-cell sarcoma as a subtype of melanoma by genomic profiling.
