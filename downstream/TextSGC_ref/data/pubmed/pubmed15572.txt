Ultrasound US-guided high dose rate HDR prostate brachytherapy requests the clinicians to place HDR needles catheters into the prostate gland under transrectal US TRUS guidance in the operating room. The quality of the subsequent radiation treatment plan is largely dictated by the needle placements which varies upon the experience level of the clinicians and the procedure protocols. Real-time plan dose distribution if available could be a vital tool to provide more subjective assessment of the needle placements hence potentially improving the radiation plan quality and the treatment outcome. However due to low signal-to-noise ratio SNR in US imaging real-time multi-needle segmentation in 3D TRUS which is the major obstacle for real-time dose mapping has not been realized to date. In this study we propose a deep learning-based method that enables accurate and real-time digitization of the multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy.
