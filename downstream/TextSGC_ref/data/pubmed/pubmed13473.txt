Previous studies using resting-state functional neuroimaging have revealed alterations in whole-brain images connectome-wide functional connectivity and graph-based metrics in groups of patients with schizophrenia relative to groups of healthy controls. However it is unclear which of these measures best captures the neural correlates of this disorder at the level of the individual patient. Detecting schizophrenia at the level of the individual: relative diagnostic value of whole-brain images connectome-wide functional connectivity and graph-based metrics.
