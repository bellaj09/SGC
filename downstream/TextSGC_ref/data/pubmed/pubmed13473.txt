"Paraphrasing Pasteur in scientific work Fortuna favors only the prepared mind. This is illustrated by my career after an incidental escape from the former German East Prussia just ahead of the Red Army my switch in Kiel from zoology to oceanography and my learning of a vacancy in Seattle. Treated here are the accidental discovery of upwelling during the southwest monsoon along Indias west coast studies of benthic polychaetous annelids in the Oregonian zoogeographic province the discovery of phytoplankton blooms and an absence of upwelling during the northeast monsoon in the northern Arabian Sea and an ocean-wide description of the seasonality of satellite-derived chlorophyll. My admonition is that grazing rather than cell division rate regulates the abundance and size composition of phytoplankton and affects the dynamics of the understudied zooplankton. I end with a pessimistic view about predicting the vertical flux of particulate organic matter from the euphotic layer with an accuracy useful for deep-sea carbon budgets." Reflections about chance in my career and on the top-down regulated world.
