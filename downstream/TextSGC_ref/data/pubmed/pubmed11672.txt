Glutamate weighted Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer GluCEST MRI is a noninvasive technique for mapping parenchymal glutamate in the brain. Because of the sensitivity to field B0  inhomogeneity the total acquisition time is prolonged due to the repeated image acquisitions at several saturation offset frequencies which can cause practical issues such as increased sensitivity to patient motions. Because GluCEST signal is derived from the small z-spectrum difference it often has a low signal-to-noise-ratio SNR. We proposed a novel deep learning DL-based algorithm armed with wide activation neural network blocks to address both issues. Accelerating GluCEST imaging using deep learning for B0 correction.
