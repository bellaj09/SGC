"We present a novel virtual reality VR system to measure soccer players read-the-game ability. Read-the-game is a term that encompasses a conglomerate of visual exploratory behavioral patterns and cognitive elements required to make accurate in-game decisions. Our technological approach in the Sports Science domain focuses on the visuomotor component of targeted skill development in a VR simulation because VR is a powerful perception-action coupling training solution for visuomotor coordination due to its high sense of immersion and its psychological byproduct presence. Additionally we analyze two critical aspects: psychological i.e. sense of presence and the human-computer interaction HCI domain i.e. suitable input device for full-body immersion. To measure head movements related to visual explorations the system tracks the users head excursions. Specifically the engaged visual exploratory activity VEA during a VR simulation is measured frame-by-frame at runtime to study the behavior of players making passing decisions while experiencing pressure from rivals during in-game situations recreated with computer graphics CG. Additionally the sense of presence elicited by our system is measured via the Igroup Presence Questionnaire applied to beginner and amateur soccer players n = 24. Regarding the HCI aspect a comparison of input options reveals that a high presence can be achieved when using full body interactions that integrate head and body motions via a combination of an HMD and kinetic body tracking. During our system verification a difference in the VEA performance is observed between beginner and amateur players. Moreover we demonstrate the capacity of the system to measure the VEA while evoking immersive soccer in-match experiences with a portable VR setup."
