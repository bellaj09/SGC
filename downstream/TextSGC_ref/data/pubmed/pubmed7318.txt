"Residents have a limited time to be trained. Although having a highly variable caseload should be beneficial for resident training residents do not necessarily get a uniform distribution of cases. By developing a dashboard where residents and their attendings can track the procedures they have done and cases that they have seen we hope to give residents a greater insight into their training and into where gaps in their training may be occurring. By taking advantage of modern advances in NLP techniques we process medical records and generate statistics describing each residents progress so far. We have built the system described and its life within the NYP ecosystem. By creating better tracking we hope that caseloads can be shifted to better close any individual gaps in training. One of the educational pain points for radiology residency is the assignment of cases to match a well-balanced curriculum. By illuminating the historical cases of a resident we can better assign future cases for a better educational experience." Developing a More Responsive Radiology Resident Dashboard.
