Providing real-time interactive immersive surgical training has been a key research area in telemedicine. Earlier approaches have mainly adopted videotaped training that can only show imagery from a fixed view point. Recent advances on commodity 3D imaging have enabled a new paradigm for immersive surgical training by acquiring nearly complete 3D reconstructions of actual surgical procedures. However unlike 2D videotaping that can easily stream data in real-time by far 3D imaging based solutions require pre-capturing and processing the data; surgical trainings using the data have to be conducted offline after the acquisition. In this paper we present a new real-time immersive 3D surgical training system. Our solution builds upon the recent multi-Kinect based surgical training system 1 that can acquire and display high delity 3D surgical procedures using only a small number of Microsoft Kinect sensors. We build on top of the system a client-server model for real-time streaming. On the server front we efficiently fuse multiple Kinect data acquired from different viewpoints and compress and then stream the data to the client. On the client front we build an interactive space-time navigator to allow remote users e.g. trainees to witness the surgical procedure in real-time as if they were present in the room. An immersive surgery training system with live streaming capability.
