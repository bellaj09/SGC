Partial discharge PD is not only an important symptom for monitoring the imperfections in the insulation system of a gas-insulated switchgear GIS but also the factor that accelerates the degradation. At present monitoring ultra-high-frequency UHF signals induced by PDs is regarded as one of the most effective approaches for assessing the insulation severity and classifying the PDs. Therefore in this paper a deep learning-based PD classification algorithm is proposed and realized with a multi-column convolutional neural network CNN that incorporates UHF spectra of multiple resolutions. First three subnetworks as characterized by their specified designed temporal filters frequency filters and texture filters are organized and then intergraded by a fully-connected neural network. Then a long short-term memory LSTM network is utilized for fusing the embedded multi-sensor information. Furthermore to alleviate the risk of overfitting a transfer learning approach inspired by manifold learning is also present for model training. To demonstrate 13 modes of defects considering both the defect types and their relative positions were well designed for a simulated GIS tank. A detailed analysis of the performance reveals the clear superiority of the proposed method compared to18 typical baselines. Several advanced visualization techniques are also implemented to explore the possible qualitative interpretations of the learned features. Finally a unified framework based on matrix projection is discussed to provide a possible explanation for the effectiveness of the architecture.
