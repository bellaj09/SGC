This article explores the combination of live virtual and constructive LVC simulations in healthcare. Live virtual and constructive simulations have long existed in the military but their consideration and deployment in medical and healthcare domains is relatively new. We conducted a review on LVC- its current application in the military domain -and highlight an approach challenges and present suggestions for its implementation in healthcare learning. Furthermore based on the state of the art in simulation in healthcare we suggest that a combination of two simulation types LV VC LC at the time may be a simpler approach to the community at large. Toward Live Virtual Constructive Simulations in Healthcare Learning.
