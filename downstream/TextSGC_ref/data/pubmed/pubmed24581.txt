"The surgical anatomy of the petrous bone is difficult to learn and to imagine due to the porous structure. Obviously the surgeons training is based on cadaver dissections as we are still lacking good versatile models of the temporal bone and its important structures. The clearly visible rapid development of computer science provides us with new possibilities that should be immediately engaged in modelling and simulating the human anatomy. The virtual three-dimensional computer model of the bony pyramid was created based on the tomographic x-ray 1 mm slices and evaluated in accordance to its usefulness in learning and planning the neurosurgical approaches to the petrous region. The model was created in the virtual reality markup language in order to make it available through the Internet. The basic anatomy of the main surgical approaches used in this region was visualised and evaluated in accordance with the real intraoperative anatomy. The model could be easily accessed through the Internet. It was user-friendly and intuitive. The model seemed to be helpful in planning the basic approaches to the petroclival region. Computer science with the help of the virtual modelling techniques gives us a powerful method of learning and training surgical anatomy and approaches although cadaveric dissection still remains the main point of the surgeons training."
