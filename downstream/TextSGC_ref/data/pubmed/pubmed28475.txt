Decoding neural activities associated with limb movements is the key of motor prosthesis control. So far most of these studies have been based on invasive approaches. Nevertheless a few researchers have decoded kinematic parameters of single hand in non-invasive ways such as magnetoencephalogram MEG and electroencephalogram EEG. Regarding these EEG studies center-out reaching tasks have been employed. Yet whether hand velocity can be decoded using EEG recorded during a self-routed drawing task is unclear. Decoding hand movement velocity from electroencephalogram signals during a drawing task.
