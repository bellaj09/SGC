"Forklifts are among the machines involved with the highest levels of occupational fatalities. As many accidents involved with a forklift can be attributed to the low situation awareness SA of the operator it is essential to understand the factors influencing a forklift operators SA for reducing forklift accidents especially of collision type. Against this background this research aims to investigate how a forklift operators SA about other people around can be influenced by the type of subtasks they are carrying out. In this research a virtual reality VR environment is used as the experiment environment in which subjects perform a series of subtasks such as driving turning reversing loading and unloading with a VR forklift simulation model. A SAGAT-an established SA measurement technique based on a series of queries targeting Level 1 2 and 3 SA-is used as the main method to collect data about subjects SA in the experiment. The analysis of the data reveals that a forklift operator is likely to have a reduced SA about the workers around when he/she is performing a loading or unloading task due to attention narrowing which occurs when a person concentrates on a cognitively demanding task. The findings provide insights into how forklift operator SA could be improved through an SA-oriented safety training program and also how sensing technologies might assist forklift operators with maintaining a good SA."
