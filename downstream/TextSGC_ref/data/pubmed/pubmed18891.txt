Previous research suggests that the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy should increase as the experience becomes more immersive. However the neural mechanisms underlying the experience of immersion are not yet well understood. To address this question neural activity during exposure to two virtual worlds was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. Two levels of immersion were used: unimodal video only and multimodal video plus audio. The results indicated increased activity in both auditory and visual sensory cortices during multimodal presentation. Additionally multimodal presentation elicited increased activity in the hippocampus a region well known to be involved in learning and memory. The implications of this finding for exposure therapy are discussed. Auditory cues increase the hippocampal response to unimodal virtual reality.
