Autism spectrum traits exist on a continuum and are more common in males than in females but the basis for this sex difference is unclear. To this end the present study draws on the extreme male brain theory investigating the relationship between sex difference and the default mode network DMN both known to be associated with autism spectrum traits. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI was carried out in 42 females mean age  standard deviation 22.4  4.2 years and 43 males mean age  standard deviation 23.8  3.9 years with typical development. Using a combination of different analyses viz. independent component analysis ICA fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation fALFF regional homogeneity ReHo and seed-based analyses we examined sex differences in the DMN and the relationship to autism spectrum traits as measured by autism-spectrum quotient AQ scores. We found significant differences between female and male subjects in DMN brain regions with seed-based analysis revealing a significant negative correlation between default-mode resting state functional connectivity of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex seed aMPFC and AQ scores in males. However there were no relationships between DMN sex differences and autism spectrum traits in females. Our findings may provide important insight into the skewed balance of functional connectivity in males compared to females that could serve as a potential biomarker of the degree of autism spectrum traits in line with the extreme male brain theory.
