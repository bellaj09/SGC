Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics. Abnormal neuronal circuits in a wide-spread structural and functional network involved in planning execution and control of motor functions are thought to represent the underlying pathology. We therefore studied changes of structural brain networks in 13 adult GTS patients reconstructed by diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography. Structural connectivity and network topology were characterized by graph theoretical measures and compared to 13 age-matched controls. In GTS patients significantly reduced connectivity was detected in right hemispheric networks. These were furthermore characterized by significantly reduced local graph parameters local clustering efficiency and strength indicating decreased structural segregation of local subnetworks. Contrasting these results whole brain and right hemispheric networks of GTS patients showed significantly increased normalized global efficiency indicating an overall increase of structural integration among distributed areas. Higher global efficiency was associated with tic severity R\u2009=\u20090.63 p\u2009=\u20090.022 suggesting the clinical relevance of altered network topology. Our findings reflect an imbalance between structural integration and segregation in right hemispheric structural connectome of patients with GTS. These changes might be related to an underlying pathology of impaired neuronal development but could also indicate potential adaptive plasticity.
