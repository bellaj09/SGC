"Neural signatures of humans movement intention can be exploited by future neuroprosthesis. We propose a method for detecting self-paced upper limb movement intention from brain signals acquired with both invasive and non-invasive methods. In the first study with scalp electroencephalograph EEG signals from healthy controls we report single trial detection of movement intention using movement-related potentials MRPs in a frequency range between 0.1 to 1 Hz. Movement intention can be detected above chance level p&#60;0.05 on average 460 ms before the movement onset with low detection rate during the non-movement intention period. Using intracranial EEG iEEG from one epileptic subject we detect movement intention as early as 1500 ms before movement onset with accuracy above 90% using electrodes implanted in the bilateral supplementary motor area SMA. The coherent results obtained with non-invasive and invasive method and its generalization capabilities across different days of recording strengthened the theory that self-paced movement intention can be detected before movement initiation for the advancement in robot-assisted neurorehabilitation."
