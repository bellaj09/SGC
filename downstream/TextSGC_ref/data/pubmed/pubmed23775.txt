The explosive increase in the power of computers has enabled the creation of fast interactive 3D environments sometimes called virtual reality VR. This technology often associated with arcade games is increasingly being used for more serious applications. This paper describes research showing transfer of skills from a virtual environment to the real world. We then describe our VR authoring tool and an application to help cognitively impaired individuals relearn important daily living skills. Additionally we describe the development of a prototype networked system to enable a doctor to monitor remotely the rehabilitation of a group of patients. Virtual reality for relearning daily living skills.
