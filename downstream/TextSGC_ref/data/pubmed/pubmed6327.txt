The protracted development of structural and functional brain connectivity within distributed association networks coincides with improvements in higher-order cognitive processes such as executive function. However it remains unclear how white-matter architecture develops during youth to directly support coordinated neural activity. Here we characterize the development of structure-function coupling using diffusion-weighted imaging and n-back functional MRI data in a sample of 727 individuals ages 8 to 23 y. We found that spatial variability in structure-function coupling aligned with cortical hierarchies of functional specialization and evolutionary expansion. Furthermore hierarchy-dependent age effects on structure-function coupling localized to transmodal cortex in both cross-sectional data and a subset of participants with longitudinal data n = 294. Moreover structure-function coupling in rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with executive performance and partially mediated age-related improvements in executive function. Together these findings delineate a critical dimension of adolescent brain development whereby the coupling between structural and functional connectivity remodels to support functional specialization and cognition.
