"The P300 speller is a common brain-computer interface BCI application designed to communicate language by detecting event related potentials in a subjects electroencephalogram signal. Information about the structure of natural language can be valuable for BCI communication but attempts to use this information have thus far been limited to rudimentary n-gram models. While more sophisticated language models are prevalent in natural language processing literature current BCI analysis methods based on dynamic programming cannot handle their complexity." Incorporating advanced language models into the P300 speller using particle filtering.
