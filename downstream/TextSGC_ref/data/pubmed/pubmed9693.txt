The identification of interactions between compounds and proteins plays an important role in network pharmacology and drug discovery. However experimentally identifying compound-protein interactions CPIs is generally expensive and time-consuming computational approaches are thus introduced. Among these machine-learning based methods have achieved a considerable success. However due to the nonlinear and imbalanced nature of biological data many machine learning approaches have their own limitations. Recently deep learning techniques show advantages over many state-of-the-art machine learning methods in some applications. In this study we aim at improving the performance of CPI prediction based on deep learning and propose a method called DL-CPI the abbreviation of Deep Learning for Compound-Protein Interactions prediction which employs deep neural network DNN to effectively learn the representations of compound-protein pairs. Extensive experiments show that DL-CPI can learn useful features of compound-protein pairs by a layerwise abstraction and thus achieves better prediction performance than existing methods on both balanced and imbalanced datasets.
