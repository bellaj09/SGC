"In patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy NAC some patients achieve a complete pathologic response pCR some achieve a partial response and some do not respond at all or even progress. Accurate prediction of treatment response has the potential to improve patient care by improving prognostication enabling de-escalation of toxic treatment that has little benefit facilitating upfront use of novel targeted therapies and avoiding delays to surgery. Visual inspection of a patients tumor on multiparametric MRI is insufficient to predict that patients response to NAC. However machine learning and deep learning approaches using a mix of qualitative and quantitative MRI features have recently been applied to predict treatment response early in the course of or even before the start of NAC. This is a novel field but the data published so far has shown promising results. We provide an overview of the machine learning and deep learning models developed to date as well as discuss some of the challenges to clinical implementation."
