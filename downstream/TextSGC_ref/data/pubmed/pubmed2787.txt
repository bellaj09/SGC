Radical glioma resection improves overall survival both in low-grade and high-grade glial tumors. However preservation of the quality of life is also crucial. Areas covered: Due to the diffuse feature of gliomas which invade the central nervous system and due to considerable variations of brain organization among patients an individual cerebral mapping is mandatory to solve the classical dilemma between the oncological and functional issues. Because functional neuroimaging is not reliable enough intraoperative electrical stimulation especially in awake patients benefiting from a real-time cognitive monitoring is the best way to increase the extent of resection while sparing eloquent neural networks. Expert commentary: Here we propose a paradigmatic shift from image-guided resection to functional mapping-guided resection based on the study of the dynamic distribution of delocalized cortico-subcortical circuits at the individual level i.e. the investigation of brain connectomics and neuroplastic potential. This surgical philosophy results in an improvement of both oncological outcomes and quality of life. This highlights the need to reinforce the link between glioma surgery and cognitive neurosciences.
