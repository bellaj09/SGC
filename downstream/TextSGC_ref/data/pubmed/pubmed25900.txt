Surgical training systems based on virtual reality VR and simulation techniques offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional training methods. This paper describes a virtual reality system for training arthroscopic knee surgery. The virtual model used in this system is constructed from the Visual Human Project dataset. The system simulates the real-time deformation of soft tissue with topological change using finite element analysis. To offer the realistic tactile feedback we construct a specialized force feedback hardware. Virtual reality based system for training on knee arthroscopic surgery.
