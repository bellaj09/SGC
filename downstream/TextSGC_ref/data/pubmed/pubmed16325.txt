For several reasons there has been pressure to seek alternatives to the Halstedian method of surgical training both for residents and for practicing surgeons faced with a new procedure. The use of bench models to train urology residents in order to maximize their operating-room experience is becoming popular. Realistic latex models and virtual-reality simulators have been introduced. However the model does not have to look realistic as long as the trainee can practice the pertinent steps of the procedure using the same skills: training on a well-designed low-fidelity model confers the same benefit as training on a high-fidelity model. Bench model training in ureteroscopy appears to have a durable effect on the clinical performance of surgical residents. More research is necessary to validate training on bench models and may lead to more objective measures of surgical competency. Low-fidelity ureteroscopy models.
