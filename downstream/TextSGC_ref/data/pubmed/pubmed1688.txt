SARS-CoV-2 is a new generation of coronavirus which was firstly determined in Wuhan China in December 2019. So far however there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease SARS-CoV-2 M pro may facilitate searching for new therapies for SARS-COV-2 . The aim was to assess the effectiveness of available FDA approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with Cys145 inside binding site SARS-CoV-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening. Using Integrated Computational Approaches to Identify Safe and Rapid Treatment for SARS -CoV- 2.
