"Wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet surgery has been shown to decrease cost and hospital length of stay. The authors studied the use of virtual reality during wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet outpatient upper extremity surgery to assess its effect on patient pain anxiety and fun. Patients undergoing wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet surgery were randomized to use virtual reality or not use non-virtual reality virtual reality during their procedures. Pain fun and anxiety were measured with a Likert scale at several time points as were blood pressure and heart rate. A postoperative questionnaire was used to assess overall satisfaction. Virtual reality patients exhibited lower anxiety scores during injection during the procedure and at the end of the procedure. There were no differences in blood pressure heart rate or pain scores. Compared with non-virtual reality patients virtual reality patients fun scores were higher. Virtual reality patients felt the experience helped them to relax and they would recommend virtual reality-assisted wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet surgery. Among patients with self-reported preexisting anxiety virtual reality patients had lower pain and anxiety scores during injection of local anesthesia compared with non-virtual reality patients. This study demonstrates that readily available virtual reality hardware and software can provide a virtual reality experience that reduces patient anxiety both during the injection of local anesthesia and during the surgical procedure.
