The camera-augmented mobile C-arm CamC augments any mobile C-arm by a video camera and mirror construction and provides a co-registration of X-ray with video images. The accurate overlay between these images is crucial to high-quality surgical outcomes. In this work we propose a practical solution that improves the overlay accuracy for any C-arm orientation by: i improving the existing CamC calibration ii removing distortion effects and iii accounting for the mechanical sagging of the C-arm gantry due to gravity. Precise X-ray and video overlay for augmented reality fluoroscopy.
