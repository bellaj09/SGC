Previous studies have shown that the size of the leftward bias after exposure to rightward prism-deviation the prismatic after-effect depends on the degree of rightward prism-deviation as well as the type of visual feedback receives during exposure to prism-deviation. In this study we tested if it was possible to obtain a leftward bias in pointing precision using two different methods of creating diverted visual input by simulating a rightward prism diversion of visual input in immersive virtual reality. We compared the results to the leftward bias in pointing precision obtained after exposure to standard prism goggles deviating visual input 10 degrees to the right. Twenty healthy participants were subjected to one session of standard prism adaptation therapy under three different conditions of deviated visual input: 1 created by imitating a 10 degree leftward rotation of the head VRR 2 created by imitating a 2D leftward horizontal displacement of 10 degrees VRS and 3 a control condition using real right-deviating prisms PCP. The study showed that the simulated prisms in the VRR and VRS conditions produced deviations in pointing precision of a similar size. However exposure to the VRS and VRR conditions both produced larger prismatic after-effects than the exposure to real prism goggles. This research is important for the development and use of virtual reality systems in the rehabilitation of neglect after brain injury as it emphasizes that the adjustment to deviated visual input may be affected positively by the use of immersive virtual reality technology. Simulated prism exposure in immersed virtual reality produces larger prismatic after-effects than standard prism exposure in healthy subjects.
