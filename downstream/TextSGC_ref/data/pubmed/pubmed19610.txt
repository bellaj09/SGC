"Previous research has linked cognitive insight a measure of self-reflectiveness and self-certainty in psychosis with neurocognitive and neuroanatomical disturbances in the fronto-hippocampal neural network. The authors goal was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive insight during an external source memory paradigm in non-clinical subjects." Functional magnetic resonance imaging study of external source memory and its relation to cognitive insight in non-clinical subjects.
