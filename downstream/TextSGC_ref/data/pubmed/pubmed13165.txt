"Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease AD. Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used but in recent years new deep learning DL-based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network DNN. The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: 1 a U-Net-based segmentation 2 a shape model estimation and 3 a second U-Net-based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups AD patients subjects with mild cognitive impairment MCI and controls from two cohorts ADNI and AddNeuroMed. Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context. Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover compared to other types of context information the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes."
