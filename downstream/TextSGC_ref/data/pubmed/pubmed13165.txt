Deep learning has gained popularity in a variety of computer vision tasks. Recently it has also been successfully applied for hyperspectral image classification tasks. Training deep neural networks such as a convolutional neural network for classification requires a large number of labeled samples. However in remote sensing applications we usually only have a small amount of labeled data for training because they are expensive to collect although we still have abundant unlabeled data. In this paper we propose semi-supervised deep learning for hyperspectral image classification-our approach uses limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to train a deep neural network. More specifically we use deep convolutional recurrent neural networks CRNN for hyperspectral image classification by treating each hyperspectral pixel as a spectral sequence. In the proposed semi-supervised learning framework the abundant unlabeled data are utilized with their pseudo labels cluster labels. We propose to use all the training data together with their pseudo labels to pre-train a deep CRNN and then fine-tune using the limited available labeled data. Further to utilize spatial information in the hyperspectral images we propose a constrained Dirichlet process mixture model C-DPMM a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm for semi-supervised clustering which includes pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints-this produces high-quality pseudo-labels resulting in improved initialization of the deep neural network. We also derived a variational inference model for the C-DPMM for efficient inference. Experimental results with real hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning methods for hyperspectral classification.
