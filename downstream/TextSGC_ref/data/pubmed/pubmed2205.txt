The human brain is an inherently complex and dynamic system. Even at rest functional brain networks dynamically reconfigure in a well-organized way to warrant an efficient communication between brain regions. However a precise characterization of this reconfiguration at very fast time-scale hundreds of millisecond during rest remains elusive. In this study we used dense electroencephalography data recorded during task-free paradigm to track the fast temporal dynamics of spontaneous brain networks. Results obtained from network-based analysis methods revealed the existence of a functional dynamic core network formed of a set of key brain regions that ensure segregation and integration functions. Brain regions within this functional core share high betweenness centrality strength and vulnerability high impact on the network global efficiency and low clustering coefficient. These regions are mainly located in the cingulate and the medial frontal cortex. In particular most of the identified hubs were found to belong to the Default Mode Network. Results also revealed that the same central regions may dynamically alternate and play the role of either provincial local or connector global hubs.
