"People suffering from neuromuscular disorders such as locked-in syndrome LIS are left in a paralyzed state with preserved awareness and cognition. In this study it was hypothesized that changes in local hemodynamic activity due to the activation of Brocas area during overt/covert speech can be harnessed to create an intuitive Brain Computer Interface based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy NIRS. A 12-channel square template was used to cover inferior frontal gyrus and changes in hemoglobin concentration corresponding to six aloud overtly and six silently covertly spoken words were collected from eight healthy participants. An unsupervised feature extraction algorithm was implemented with an optimized support vector machine for classification. For all participants when considering overt and covert classes regardless of words classification accuracy of 92.88  18.49% was achieved with oxy-hemoglobin O2Hb and 95.14  5.39% with deoxy-hemoglobin HHb as a chromophore. For a six-active-class problem of overtly spoken words 88.19  7.12% accuracy was achieved for O2Hb and 78.82  15.76% for HHb. Similarly for a six-active-class classification of covertly spoken words 79.17  14.30% accuracy was achieved with O2Hb and 86.81  9.90% with HHb as an absorber. These results indicate that a control paradigm based on covert speech can be reliably implemented into future BrainComputer Interfaces BCIs based on NIRS."
