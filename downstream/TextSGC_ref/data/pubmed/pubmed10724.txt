Stereotactic radiosurgery SRS is widely used to obliterate arteriovenous malformations AVMs. Its performance relies on the accuracy of delineating the target AVM. Manual segmentation during a framed SRS procedure is time consuming and subject to inter- and intraobserver variation. To address these drawbacks we proposed a deep learning-based method to automatically segment AVMs on CT simulation image sets. Learning-based automatic segmentation of arteriovenous malformations on contrast CT images in brain stereotactic radiosurgery.
