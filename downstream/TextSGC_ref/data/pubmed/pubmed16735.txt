Exposure therapy for anxiety disorder is grounded in fear-conditioning models in which extinction learning involves the process through which conditioned fear responses decrease or are inhibited. The present review will provide an overview of extinction training and anxiety disorder treatment advantages for using VR within extinction training a review of the literature regarding the effectiveness of VR within exposure therapy for specific phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder and limitations and future directions of the extant empirical literature.
