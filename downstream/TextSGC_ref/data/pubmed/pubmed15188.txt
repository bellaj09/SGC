"Speech is the most significant mode of communication among human beings and a potential method for human-computer interaction HCI by using a microphone sensor. Quantifiable emotion recognition using these sensors from speech signals is an emerging area of research in HCI which applies to multiple applications such as human-reboot interaction virtual reality behavior assessment healthcare and emergency call centers to determine the speakers emotional state from an individuals speech. In this paper we present major contributions for; i increasing the accuracy of speech emotion recognition SER compared to state of the art and ii reducing the computational complexity of the presented SER model. We propose an artificial intelligence-assisted deep stride convolutional neural network DSCNN architecture using the plain nets strategy to learn salient and discriminative features from spectrogram of speech signals that are enhanced in prior steps to perform better. Local hidden patterns are learned in convolutional layers with special strides to down-sample the feature maps rather than pooling layer and global discriminative features are learned in fully connected layers. A SoftMax classifier is used for the classification of emotions in speech. The proposed technique is evaluated on Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture IEMOCAP and Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song RAVDESS datasets to improve accuracy by 7.85% and 4.5% respectively with the model size reduced by 34.5 MB. It proves the effectiveness and significance of the proposed SER technique and reveals its applicability in real-world applications."
