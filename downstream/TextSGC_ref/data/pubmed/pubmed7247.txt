"In this study to advance smart health applications which have increasing security/privacy requirements we propose a novel highly wearable ECG-based user identification system empowered by both non-standard convenient ECG lead configurations and deep learning techniques. Specifically to achieve a super wearability we suggest situating all the ECG electrodes on the left upper-arm or behind the ears and successfully obtain weak but distinguishable ECG waveforms. Afterwards to identify individuals from weak ECG we further present a two-stage framework including ECG imaging and deep feature learning/identification. In the former stage the ECG heartbeats are projected to a 2D state space to reveal heartbeats trajectory behaviors and produce 2D images by a split-then-hit method. In the second stage a convolutional neural network is introduced to automatically learn the intricate patterns directly from the ECG image representations without heavy feature engineering and then perform user identification. Experimental results on two acquired datasets using our wearable prototype show a promising identification rate of 98.4% single-arm-ECG and 91.1% ear-ECG respectively. To the best of our knowledge it is the first study on the feasibility of using single-arm-ECG/ear-ECG for user identification purpose which is expected to contribute to pervasive ECG-based user identification in smart health applications."
