Different ages are closely related especially among the adjacent ages because aging is a slow and extremely non-stationary process with much randomness. To explore the relationship between the real age and its adjacent ages an age group-n encoding AGEn method is proposed in this paper. In our model adjacent ages are grouped into the same group and each age corresponds to n groups. The ages grouped into the same group would be regarded as an independent class in the training stage. On this basis the original age estimation problem can be transformed into a series of binary classification sub-problems. And a deep Convolutional Neural Networks CNN with multiple classifiers is designed to cope with such sub-problems. Later a Local Age Decoding LAD strategy is further presented to accelerate the prediction process which locally decodes the estimated age value from ordinal classifiers. Besides to alleviate the imbalance data learning problem of each classifier a penalty factor is inserted into the unified objective function to favor the minority class. To compare with state-of-the-art methods we evaluate the proposed method on FG-NET MORPH II CACD and Chalearn LAP 2015 databases and it achieves the best performance.
