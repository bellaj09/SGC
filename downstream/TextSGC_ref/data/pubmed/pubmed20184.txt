Competency-based education in health care requires rigorous standards to ensure professional proficiency. Demonstrating competency in hands-on laboratories calls for effective preparation knowledge and experience all of which can be difficult to achieve using traditional teaching methods. Virtual laboratories are an alternative cost-effective approach to providing students with sufficient preparatory information. Research on the use of virtual labs in allied health education is limited. The current study investigated the benefits challenges and perceived impact of a virtual lab in an allied health program. The sample consisted of 64 students 55 females 9 males enrolled in a university medical laboratory science program. A convergent mixed-methods approach Likert survey open-ended questions think-aloud protocol data revealed that students had positive attitudes towards visual learning authenticity learner control organization and scaffolding afforded by the virtual lab. Challenges reported included navigational difficulties an absence of control over content selection and lack of understanding for certain concepts. Over 90% of students agreed that the virtual lab helped them prepare for hands-on laboratory sessions and that they would use this format of instruction again. Overall 84% of the students agreed that the virtual lab helped them to achieve greater success in learning. Assessing the Impact of a Virtual Lab in an Allied Health Program.
