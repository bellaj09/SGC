The cerebellum integrates descending motor commands and sensory information to generate predictions and detect errors during ongoing behaviors. Cerebellar computation has been proposed to control motor but also non-motor behaviors including reward expectation and cognitive flexibility. However the organization and functional contribution of cerebellar output channels are incompletely understood. Here we elaborate the cell-type specificity of a broad connectivity matrix from the deep cerebellar nuclei DCN to the dorsal striatum in mice. Cerebello-striatal connections arise from all deep cerebellar subnuclei and are relayed through intralaminar thalamic nuclei ILN. In the dorsal striatum these connections target medium spiny neurons but also ChAT-positive interneurons a class of tonically active interneurons implicated in shifting and updating behavioral strategies. Chemogenetic silencing of cerebello-striatal connectivity modifies function of striatal ChAT-positive interneurons. We propose that cerebello-striatal connections relay cerebellar computation to striatal circuits for goal-directed behaviors. Regulation of striatal cells and goal-directed behavior by cerebellar outputs.
