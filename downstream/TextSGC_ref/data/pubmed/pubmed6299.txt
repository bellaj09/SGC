Among women in China gynecological cancers are the second most common cancers after breast cancer. Cancer-related cognitive impairment CRCI has emerged as a significant problem affecting gynecological cancer survivors. While acupuncture has been used in different aspects of cancer care the possible positive effects of acupuncture on cognitive impairment have received little attention. This study hypothesized that patients would demonstrate lower neurocognitive performance and lower structural connectivity compared to healthy controls. This pilot study also hypothesized that acupuncture may potentially be effective in treating CRCI of cancer patients by increasing brain structural connectivity and integrity.
