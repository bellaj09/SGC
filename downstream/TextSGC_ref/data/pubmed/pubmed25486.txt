Generally physiological modeling and biomedical signal processing constitute two important paradigms of biomedical engineering BME: their fundamental concepts are taught starting from undergraduate studies and are more completely dealt with in the last years of graduate curricula as well as in Ph.D. courses. Traditionally these two cultural aspects were separated with the first one more oriented to physiological issues and how to model them and the second one more dedicated to the development of processing tools or algorithms to enhance useful information from clinical data. A practical consequence was that those who did models did not do signal processing and vice versa. However in recent yearsthe need for closer integration between signal processing and modeling of the relevant biological systems emerged very clearly 1 2. This is not only true for training purposesi.e. to properly prepare the new professional members of BME but also for the development of newly conceived research projects in which the integration between biomedical signal and image processing BSIP and modeling plays a crucial role. Just to give simple examples topics such as braincomputer machine or interfacesneuroengineering nonlinear dynamical analysis of the cardiovascular CV systemintegration of sensory-motor characteristics aimed at the building of advanced prostheses and rehabilitation tools and wearable devices for vital sign monitoring and others do require an intelligent fusion of modeling and signal processing competences that are certainly peculiar of our discipline of BME.
