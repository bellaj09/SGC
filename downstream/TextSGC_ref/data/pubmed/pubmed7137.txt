The objective of this study was to build deep learning models with optical coherence tomography OCT images to classify normal and age related macular degeneration AMD AMD with fluid and AMD without any fluid. In this study 185 normal OCT images from 49 normal subjects 535 OCT images of AMD with fluid and 514 OCT mages of AMD without fluid from 120 AMD eyes as training data while 49 normal images from 25 normal eyes 188 AMD OCT images with fluid and 154 AMD images without any fluid from 77 AMD eyes as test data were enrolled. Data augmentation was applied to increase the number of images to build deep learning models. Totally two classification models were built in two steps. In the first step a VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset was transfer learned to classify normal and AMD including AMD with fluid and/or without any fluid. Then in the second step the fine-tuned model in the first step was transfer learned again to distinguish the images of AMD with fluid from the ones without any fluid. With the first model normal and AMD OCT images were classified with 0.999 area under receiver operating characteristic curve AUC and 99.2% accuracy. With the second model AMD with the presence of any fluid and AMD without fluid were classified with 0.992 AUC and 95.1% accuracy. Compared with a transfer learned VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset to classify the three categories directly higher classification performance was achieved with our notable approach. Conclusively two classification models for AMD clinical practice were built with high classification performance and these models should help improve the early diagnosis and treatment for AMD.
