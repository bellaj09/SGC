In recent years human activity recognition from body sensor data or wearable sensor data has become a considerable research attention from academia and health industry. This research can be useful for various e-health applications such as monitoring elderly and physical impaired people at Smart home to improve their rehabilitation processes. However it is not easy to accurately and automatically recognize physical human activity through wearable sensors due to the complexity and variety of body activities. In this paper we address the human activity recognition problem as a classification problem using wearable body sensor data. In particular we propose to utilize a Deep Belief Network DBN model for successful human activity recognition. First we extract the important initial features from the raw body sensor data. Then a kernel principal component analysis KPCA and linear discriminant analysis LDA are performed to further process the features and make them more robust to be useful for fast activity recognition. Finally the DBN is trained by these features. Various experiments were performed on a real-world wearable sensor dataset to verify the effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm. The results show that the proposed DBN outperformed other algorithms and achieves satisfactory activity recognition performance. Human Activity Recognition from Body Sensor Data using Deep Learning.
