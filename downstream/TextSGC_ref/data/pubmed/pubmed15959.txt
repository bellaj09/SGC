"Virtual reality training VRT uses computer software to track a users movements and allow him or her to interact with a game presented on a television screen. VRT is increasingly being used for the rehabilitation of arm function balance and walking after stroke. Patients often require ongoing therapy post discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Outpatient therapy may be limited or inaccessible due to waiting lists transportation issues distance etc.; therefore home-based VRT could provide the required therapy in a more convenient and accessible setting. The objectives of this parallel randomized feasibility trial are to determine 1 the feasibility of using VRT in the home post stroke and 2 the feasibility of a battery of quantitative and qualitative outcome measures of stroke recovery."
