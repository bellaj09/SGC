One of the largest factors affecting disease recurrence after surgical cancer resection is negative surgical margins. Hyperspectral imaging HSI is an optical imaging technique with potential to serve as a computer aided diagnostic tool for identifying cancer in gross ex-vivo specimens. We developed a tissue classifier using three distinct convolutional neural network CNN architectures on HSI data to investigate the ability to classify the cancer margins from ex-vivo human surgical specimens collected from 20 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection as a preliminary validation group. A new approach for generating the HSI ground truth using a registered histological cancer margin is applied in order to create a validation dataset. The CNN-based method classifies the tumor-normal margin of squamous cell carcinoma SCCa versus normal oral tissue with an area under the curve AUC of 0.86 for inter-patient validation performing with 81% accuracy 84% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Thyroid carcinoma cancer-normal margins are classified with an AUC of 0.94 for inter-patient validation performing with 90% accuracy 91% sensitivity and 88% specificity. Our preliminary results on a limited patient dataset demonstrate the predictive ability of HSI-based cancer margin detection which warrants further investigation with more patient data and additional processing techniques to optimize the proposed deep learning method.
