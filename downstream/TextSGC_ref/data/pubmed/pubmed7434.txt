We propose a novel dual-domain convolutional neural network framework to improve structural information of routine 3\u202fT images. We introduce a parameter-efficient butterfly network that involves two complementary domains: a spatial domain and a frequency domain. The butterfly network allows the interaction of these two domains in learning the complex mapping from 3\u202fT to 7\u202fT images. We verified the efficacy of the dual-domain strategy and butterfly network using 3\u202fT and 7\u202fT image pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework generates synthetic 7\u202fT-like images and achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods.
