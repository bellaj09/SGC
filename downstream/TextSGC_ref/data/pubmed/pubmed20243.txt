The advent of technologically-based approaches to disaster response training through Virtual Reality VR environments appears promising in its ability to bridge the gaps of other commonly established training formats. Specifically the immersive and participatory nature of VR training offers a unique realistic quality that is not generally present in classroom-based or web-based training yet retains considerable cost advantages over large-scale real-life exercises and other modalities and is gaining increasing acceptance. Currently numerous government departments and agencies including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security DHS the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as well as academic institutions are exploring the unique advantages of VR-based training for disaster preparedness and response. Growing implementation of VR-based training for disaster preparedness and response conducted either independently or combined with other training formats is anticipated. This paper reviews several applications of VR-based training in the United States and reveals advantages as well as potential drawbacks and challenges associated with the implementation of such training platform.
