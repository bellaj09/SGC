"Aim: To investigate the effect of Virtual Reality Therapy VRT on balance and walking in children with cerebral palsy CP.Method: A systematic search in Pubmed and Embase was performed until the 9th of July 2019. Articles were included if the population consisted of children with CP and data on balance and/or walking were reported. Results were pooled in two meta-analyses.Results: 26 articles were included. For balance 5 and for walking 4 were used for the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses showed a significant result in favor of VRT for balance SMD 0.89 95% CI SD 0.14 1.63 and for walking SMD 3.10 95% Cl SD 0.78 5.35.Interpretation: VRT seems a promising intervention for rehabilitation in children with CP. The meta-analysis confirmed this positive effect. These results must be interpreted with caution due to differences in the interventions used the lack of randomized-controlled trials and the relatively small groups."
