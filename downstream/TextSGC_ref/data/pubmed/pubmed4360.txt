"Longitudinal studies measuring changes in cortical morphology over time are best facilitated by parcellation schemes compatible across all life stages. The Melbourne Childrens Regional Infant Brain M-CRIB and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases provide voxel-based parcellations of the cerebral cortex compatible with the Desikan-Killiany DK and the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville DKT cortical labelling schemes. This study introduces surface-based versions of the M-CRIB and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases termed M-CRIB-SDK and M-CRIB-SDKT with a pipeline for automated parcellation utilizing FreeSurfer and developing Human Connectome Project dHCP tools. Using T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of healthy neonates n\u2009=\u200958 we created average spherical templates of cortical curvature and sulcal depth. Manually labelled regions in a subset n\u2009=\u200910 were encoded into the spherical template space to construct M-CRIB-SDK and M-CRIB-SDKT atlases. Labelling accuracy was assessed using Dice overlap and boundary discrepancy measures with leave-one-out cross-validation. Cross-validated labelling accuracy was high for both atlases average regional Dice = 0.79-0.83. Worst-case boundary discrepancy instances ranged from 9.96-10.22\u2009mm which appeared to be driven by variability in anatomy for some cases. The M-CRIB-S atlas data and automatic pipeline allow extraction of neonatal cortical surfaces labelled according to the DK or DKT parcellation schemes."
