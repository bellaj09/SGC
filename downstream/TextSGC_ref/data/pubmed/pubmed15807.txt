"The generalization of studies of the systemic work of cortical neurons during the information processing initiated in Livanovs laboratory allows us to make the following conclusions in terms of the modem state of the problem. In different brain structures there is a considerable degree of correlation between neuronal activities and slow potential oscillations. In the state of rest or deep extinction the synchronization of brain neurons increases by the inhibitory type. In the active state of the brain the degree of neuronal synchronization increases by the activation type. Both processes are determined by the involvement of the whole brain inhibitory or activation systems respectively. A relative augmentation of inhibitory processes results in a restriction of information transmission in the cortex and prevents its fixation in memory of the system. A decrease in inhibition facilitates the excitation thransmission in the interconnected brain structures. Synchronous convergence of ordered polse flows ensures the information fixation during learning."
