Surgical training has changed radically in the last few decades. The traditional Halstedian model of time-bound apprenticeship has been replaced with competency-based training. In our previous article we presented an overview of learning theory relevant to clinical teaching; a summary for the busy paediatric surgeon and urologist. We introduced the concepts underpinning current changes in surgical education and training. In this next article we give an overview of the various modalities of surgical simulation the educational principles that underlie them and potential applications in clinical practice. These modalities include; open surgical models and trainers laparoscopic bench trainers virtual reality trainers simulated patients and role-play hybrid simulation scenario-based simulation distributed simulation virtual reality and online simulation. Specific examples of technology that may be used for these modalities are included but this is not a comprehensive review of all available products.
