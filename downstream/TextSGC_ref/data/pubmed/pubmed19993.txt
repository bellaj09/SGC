The aim of this study is to summarize evidence on the effectiveness of virtual reality simulators for experienced and novice surgeons in improving their hysteroscopic skills. Three types of hysteroscopic simulators were evaluated: Hyst Sim VR Virtual Reality Uterine Resectoscopic Simulator Essure Sim TM. Virtual reality simulators have been assessed to be highly relevant to reality and all surgeons attained significant improvements between their pre-test and post-test phases independent of their previous level of experience demonstrating more improvement among novices than experts. Available evidence supports the effectiveness of virtual simulators in increasing the diagnostic and surgical skills of gynaecologists independent from their starting level of expertise. The value of virtual reality simulators in hysteroscopy and training capacity: a systematic review.
