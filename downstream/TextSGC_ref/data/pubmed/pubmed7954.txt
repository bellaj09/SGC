"This paper dispenses an exhaustive review on deep learning techniques used in the prognosis of eight different neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders such as stroke alzheimer parkinsons epilepsy autism migraine cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. These diseases are critical life-threatening and in most of the cases may lead to other precarious human disorders. Deep learning techniques are emerging soft computing technique which has been lucratively used to unravel different real-life problems such as pattern recognition Face Emotion and Speech traffic management drug discovery disease diagnosis and network intrusion detection. This study confers the discipline frameworks and methodologies used by different deep learning techniques to diagnose different human neurological disorders. Here one hundred and thirty-six different articles related to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosed using different deep learning techniques are studied. The morbidity and mortality rate of major neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders has also been delineated. The performance and publication trend of different deep learning techniques employed in the investigation of these diseases has been examined and analyzed. Different performance metrics like accuracy specificity and sensitivity have also been examined. The research implication challenges and the future directions related to the study have also been highlighted. Eventually the research breaches are identified and it is\xa0witnessed that there is more scope in the diagnosis of migraine cerebral palsy and stroke using different deep learning models. Likewise there is a potential opportunity to use and explore the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machine Deep Boltzmann Machine and Deep Belief Network for diagnosis of different human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders."
