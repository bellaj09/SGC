"Aesthetic value or beauty is important to the relationship between humans and natural environments and is therefore a fundamental socio-economic attribute of conservation alongside other ecosystem services. However beauty is difficult to quantify and is not estimated well using traditional approaches to monitoring coral-reef aesthetics. To improve the estimation of ecosystem aesthetic values we developed and implemented a novel framework used to quantify features of coral-reef aesthetics based on peoples perceptions of beauty. Three observer groups with different experience to reef environments Marine Scientist Experienced Diver and Citizen were virtually immersed in Australians Great Barrier Reef GBR using 360 images. Perceptions of beauty and observations were used to assess the importance of eight potential attributes of reef-aesthetic value. Among these heterogeneity defined by structural complexity and colour diversity was positively associated with coral-reef-aesthetic values. There were no group-level differences in the way the observer groups perceived reef aesthetics suggesting that past experiences with coral reefs do not necessarily influence the perception of beauty by the observer. The framework developed here provides a generic tool to help identify indicators of aesthetic value applicable to a wide variety of natural systems. The ability to estimate aesthetic values robustly adds an important dimension to the holistic conservation of the GBR coral reefs worldwide and other natural ecosystems."
