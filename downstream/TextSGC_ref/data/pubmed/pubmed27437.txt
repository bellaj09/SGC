Intracranial electroencephalography iEEG is measured from electrodes placed in or on the brain. These measurements have an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and iEEG signals have often been used to decode brain activity or drive brain-computer interfaces BCIs. iEEG recordings are typically done for seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients who have these electrodes placed for a clinical purpose: to localize both brain regions that are essential for function and others where seizures start. Brain regions not involved in epilepsy are thought to function normally and provide a unique opportunity to learn about human neurophysiology. Intracranial electrodes measure the aggregate activity of large neuronal populations and recorded signals contain many features. Different features are extracted by analyzing these signals in the time and frequency domain. The time domain may reveal an evoked potential at a particular time after the onset of an event. Decomposition into the frequency domain may show narrowband peaks in the spectrum at specific frequencies or broadband signal changes that span a wide range of frequencies. Broadband power increases are generally observed when a brain region is active while most other features are highly specific to brain regions inputs and tasks. Here we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of several iEEG signals that have often been used to decode brain activity and drive BCIs. iEEG: Dura-lining electrodes.
