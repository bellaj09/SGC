In this paper we advocate the combination of four key ingredients that we believe are necessary to design long-lasting effective treatments for neurorehabilitation: i motor-cognitive training ii evidence-based neuroscience principles in particular those related to body perception iii motivational games and iv empowerment techniques. Then we propose virtual reality VR as the appropriate medium to encompass all the requirements mentioned above. VR is arguably one of the most suitable technologies for neurorehabilitation able to integrate evidence-based neurorehabilitation techniques and neuroscience principles into motivating training approaches that promote self-management by empowering patients to own their recovery process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of such an approach on several exemplary applications and outline directions for future developments. We strongly believe that the combination of positive psychology and positive technology mediated by VR-based interventions can heavily impact the rehabilitation outcomes of motor-cognitive functions along all the stages of the rehabilitation path.
