Acquired Brain Injury ABI frequently results in memory impairment causing significant disabilities in daily life and is therefore a critical target for cognitive rehabilitation. Current understanding of brain plasticity has led to novel insights in remediation-oriented approaches for the rehabilitation of memory deficits. We will describe 3 of these approaches that have emerged in the last decade: Virtual Reality VR training Computer-Based Cognitive Retraining CBCR and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation NBS and evaluate its effectiveness. Novel insights into the rehabilitation of memory post acquired brain injury: a systematic review.
