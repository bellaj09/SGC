The introduction of online learning and interactive technology into tertiary education has enabled biomedical science and medical faculties to provide students with quality resources for off-campus study. This encompasses online self-directed learning interactive blogs quizzes recordings of lectures and other resources. In addition textbooks are now supplemented with interactive online learning tools meaning that the student now has more accessibility than ever to engage with content. However in biomedical sciences and medicine technology has also enhanced the in-classroom experience. Anatomical and physiological visualisations in virtual augmented and mixed reality provide students with an unprecedented ability to explore virtual content in-class while learning remains structured by the facilitator and teaching team. This chapter will provide insights into the past use of technology to enhance off-campus learning and then focus on the range of visualisations utilised within the laboratory or classroom in order to facilitate learning in biomedical sciences and medicine including: augmented reality virtual reality; mixed reality and Holograms; 3D printing; simulated dissections and anatomy simulation tables; and "Smart" tablets and touchscreen devices. Utilising Anatomical and Physiological Visualisations to Enhance the Face-to-Face Student Learning Experience in Biomedical Sciences and Medicine.
