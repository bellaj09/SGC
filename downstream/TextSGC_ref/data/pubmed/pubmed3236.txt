"Depressive symptoms are common in Parkinsons disease PD but the neurophysiological mechanisms of depression in PD are poorly understood. The current study attempted to examine disrupted spontaneous local brain activities and functional connectivities that underlie the depression in PD. We recruited a total of 20 depressed PD patients DPD 40 non-depressed PD patients NDPD and 43 matched healthy controls HC. All the subjects underwent neuropsychological tests and resting-state fMRI scanning. The between-group differences in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ALFF of BOLD signals were examined using post-hoc tests after the analysis of covariance. Compared with the NDPD and HC the DPD group showed significantly increased ALFF in the left median cingulated cortex MCC. The functional connectivity FC between left MCC and all the other voxels in the brain were then calculated. Compared with the HC and NDPD group the DPD patients showed stronger FC between the left MCC and some of the major nodes of the default mode network DMN including the post cingulated cortex/precuneus medial prefrontal cortex inferior frontal gyrus and cerebellum. Correlation analysis revealed that both the ALFF values in the left MCC and the FC between the left MCC and the nodes of DMN were significantly correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. Moreover higher local activities in the left MCC were associated with increased functional connections between the MCC and the nodes of DMN in PD. These abnormal activities and connectivities of the limbic-cortical circuit may indicate impaired high-order cortical control or uncontrol of negative mood in DPD which suggested a possible neural mechanism of the depression in PD."
