One of the major limitations of motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interface BCI is its long calibration time. Due to between sessions/subjects variations in the properties of brain signals typically a large amount of training data needs to be collected at the beginning of each session to calibrate the parameters of the BCI system for the target user. In this paper we propose a novel transfer learning approach on the classification domain to reduce the calibration time without sacrificing the classification accuracy of MI-BCI. Thus when only few subject-specific trials are available for training the estimation of the classification parameters is improved by incorporating previously recorded data from other users. For this purpose a regularization parameter is added to the objective function of the classifier to make the classification parameters as close as possible to the classification parameters of the previous users who have feature spaces similar to that of the target subject. In this paper a new similarity measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL is used to measure the similarity between two feature spaces obtained using subject-specific common spatial patterns CSP. The proposed transfer learning approach is applied on the logistic regression classifier and evaluated using three datasets. The results showed that compared with the subject-specific classifier the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier improved the classification results particularly when few subject-specific trials were available for training p < 0.05. Importantly this improvement was more pronounced for users with medium and poor accuracy. Moreover the statistical results showed that the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier performed significantly better than the considered comparable baseline algorithms.
