"Spatial navigation relies on multiple mnemonic mechanisms and previous work in younger adults has described two separate types of spatial memory. One type uses directional as well as boundary-related information for spatial memory and mainly implicates the hippocampal formation. The other type has been linked to directional and landmark-related information and primarily involves the striatum. Using a virtual reality navigation paradigm we studied the impacts of aging and a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP rs17070145 of the KIBRA gene official name: WWC1 on these memory forms. Our data showed that older adults spatial learning was preferentially related to processing of landmark information whereas processing of boundary information played a more prominent role in younger adults. Moreover among older adults T-allele carriers of the examined KIBRA polymorphism showed better spatial learning compared to C homozygotes. Together these findings provide the first evidence for an effect of the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism on spatial memory in humans and age differences in the reliance on landmark and boundary-related spatial information." Aging and KIBRA/WWC1 genotype affect spatial memory processes in a virtual navigation task.
