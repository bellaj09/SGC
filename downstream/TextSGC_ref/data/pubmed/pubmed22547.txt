We propose a novel interpretation of single channel Electroencephalogram EEG traces based on the transient nature of encoded processes in the brain. In particular the proposed framework models EEG as the output of the noisy addition of temporal reoccurring transient patterns known as phasic events. This is not only neurophysiologically sound but it also provides additional information that classical EEG analysis often disregards. Furthermore by utilizing sparse decomposition techniques it is possible to obtain amplitude and timing that is further modeled using estimation and fitting techniques. We model Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI competition data features as Gaussian Mixture Model GMM samples in order to show the potential of working in the joint space of the parameters. The results not only preserve the topographic discriminant behavior but also expand the realm of possible EEG analysis. Estimation and modeling of EEG amplitude-temporal characteristics using a marked point process approach.
