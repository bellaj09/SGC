Percutaneous coronary intervention PCI uses x-ray images which may give high radiation dose and high concentrations of contrast media leading to the risk of radiation-induced injury and nephropathy. These drawbacks can be reduced by using lower doses of x-rays and contrast media with the disadvantage of noisier PCI images with less contrast. Vessel-edge-preserving convolutional neural networks CNN were designed to denoise simulated low x-ray dose PCI images created by adding artificial noise to high-dose images. Objective functions of the designed CNNs have been optimized to achieve an edge-preserving effect of vessel walls and the results of the proposed objective functions were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally the proposed CNN-based method was compared with two state-of-the-art denoising methods: K-SVD and block-matching and 3D filtering. The results showed promising performance of the proposed CNN-based method for PCI image enhancement with interesting capabilities of CNNs for real-time denoising and contrast enhancement tasks.
