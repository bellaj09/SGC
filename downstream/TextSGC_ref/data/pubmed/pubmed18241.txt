"We propose a bifocal computational near eye light field display bifocal computational display and structure parameters determination scheme SPDS for bifocal computational display that achieves greater depth of field DOF high resolution accommodation and compact form factor. Using a liquid varifocal lens two single-focal computational light fields are superimposed to reconstruct a virtual objects light field by time multiplex and avoid the limitation on high refresh rate. By minimizing the deviation between reconstructed light field and original light field we propose a determination framework to determine the structure parameters of bifocal computational light field display. When applied to different objective to SPDS it can achieve high average resolution or uniform resolution display over scene depth range. To analyze the advantages and limitation of our proposed method we have conducted simulations and constructed a simple prototype which comprises a liquid varifocal lens dual-layer LCDs and a uniform backlight. The results of simulation and experiments with our method show that the proposed system can achieve expected performance well. Owing to the excellent performance of our system we motivate bifocal computational display and SPDS to contribute to a daily-use and commercial virtual reality display."
