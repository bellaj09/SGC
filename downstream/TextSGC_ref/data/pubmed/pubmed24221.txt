The field of pathology has used light microscopy LM extensively since the mid-19th century for examination of histological tissue preparations. This technology has remained the foremost tool in use by pathologists even as other fields have undergone a great change in recent years through new technologies. However as new microscopy techniques are perfected and made available this reliance on the standard LM will likely begin to change. Advanced imaging involving both diffraction-limited and subdiffraction techniques are bringing nondestructive high-resolution molecular-level imaging to pathology. Some of these technologies can produce three-dimensional 3D datasets from sampled tissues. In addition block-face/tissue-sectioning techniques are already providing automated large-scale 3D datasets of whole specimens. These datasets allow pathologists to see an entire sample with all of its spatial information intact and furthermore allow image analysis such as detection segmentation and classification which are impossible in standard LM. It is likely that these technologies herald a major paradigm shift in the field of pathology. The coming paradigm shift: A transition from manual to automated microscopy.
