Virtual reality exposure therapy VRET is one of the few interventions supported by randomized controlled trials for the treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD in active duty service members. A comparative effectiveness study was conducted to determine if virtual reality technology itself improved outcomes or if similar results could be achieved with a control exposure therapy CET condition. Service members with combat-related PTSD were randomly selected to receive nine weeks of VRET or CET. Assessors but not therapists were blinded. PTSD symptom improvement was assessed one week and 3 months after the conclusion of treatment using the clinician-administered PTSD scale CAPS. A small crossover component was included. Results demonstrated that PTSD symptoms improved with both treatments but there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Dropout rates were higher in VRET. Of those who received VRET 13/42 31% showed >30% improvement on the CAPS versus 16/43 37% who received CET. Three months after treatment >30% improvement was seen in 10/33 30% of VRET participants and 12/33 36% in CET. Participants who crossed over n\u2009=\u200911 showed no statistically significant improvements in a second round of treatment regardless of condition. This study supported the utility of exposure therapy for PTSD but did not support additional benefit by the inclusion of virtual reality.
