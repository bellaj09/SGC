Background: Stroke is a major cause of life-long disability in adults associated with poor quality of life. Virtual reality VR-based therapy systems are known to be helpful in improving motor functions following stroke but recent clinical findings have not been included in the previous publications of meta-analysis studies.Aims: This meta-analysis was based on the available literature to evaluate the therapeutic potential of VR as compared to dose-matched conventional therapies CT in patients with stroke.Methods: We retrieved relevant articles in EMBASE MEDLINE PubMed and Web of Science published between 2010 and February 2019. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials that compared VR with CT were included.Results: A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. The analysis indicated that the VR group showed statistically significant improvement in the recovery of UL function Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity FM-UE: n = 20 studies Mean Difference MD = 3.84 P = .01 activity Box and Block Test BBT: n = 13 MD = 3.82 P = .04 and participation Motor Activity Log MAL: n = 6 MD = 0.8 P = .0001 versus the control group.Conclusion: VR appears to be a promising therapeutic technology for UL motor rehabilitation in patients with stroke.
