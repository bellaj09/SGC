Brain-computer interface BCI is a novel method for stroke rehabilitation. However lacking of sufficient motor-related cortical activity greatly decreases the BCI performance in stroke patients. Interestingly high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS has been shown to increase the cortical excitability of lesioned hemisphere in stroke patients. This stimulation effect may have benefits on the enhancement of BCI decoding. This study recruited 16 stroke patients to evaluate the stimulation effect on BCI accuracy with 8 patients were assigned to the TMS-group and the other 8 patients were assigned to the Control-group. Patients in the TMS-group underwent 12 sessions of 10-Hz TMS interventions in four consecutive weeks whereas no stimulation was applied during this period in the Control-group. Meanwhile three BCI evaluation sessions were carried out in one day before one day after and three days after the TMS intervention separately. The results showed that the TMS intervention significantly improved the BCI accuracy from 63.5% to 74.3% in motor imagery MI tasks and from 81.9% to 91.1% in motor execution ME tasks. This finding provides a novel method for the cure of BCI-inefficiency problem and may facilitate the clinical application of BCI-based stroke rehabilitation.
