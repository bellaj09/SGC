"Pedestrian injuries are among the most common cause of death and serious injury to children. A range of risk factors including individual differences and traffic environment factors has been investigated as predictors of childrens pedestrian behaviours. There is little evidence examining how risk factors might interact with each other to influence childrens risk however. The present study examined the independent and joint influences of individual differences sex and sensation seeking and traffic environment factors vehicle speeds and inter-vehicle distances on childrens pedestrian safety."
