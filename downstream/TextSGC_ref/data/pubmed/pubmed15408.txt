We use central frequency ratio and noise magnitude ratio from noise power spectrum NPS to evaluate the noise reduction techniques of ASiR and ASiR-V of GE SAFIRE and ADMIRE of Siemens and PixelShine of AlgoMedica. ASiR ASiR-V SAFIRE and ADMIRE use a combination of image and projection data whereas PixelShine uses artificial intelligence neural network for noise reduction. Technical Note: Impact on central frequency and noise magnitude ratios by advanced CT image reconstruction techniques.
