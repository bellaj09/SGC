The applications of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR-based genome editing can be limited by a lack of compatible protospacer adjacent motifs PAMs insufficient on-target activity and off-target effects. Here we report an extensive comparison of the PAM-sequence compatibilities and the on-target and off-target activities of Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes SpCas9 and the SpCas9 variants xCas9 and SpCas9-NG which are known to have broader PAM compatibility than SpCas9 at 26478 lentivirally integrated target sequences and 78 endogenous target sites in human cells. We found that xCas9 has the lowest tolerance for mismatched target sequences and that SpCas9-NG has the broadest PAM compatibility. We also show on the basis of newly identified non-NGG PAM sequences that SpCas9-NG and SpCas9 can edit six previously unedited endogenous sites associated with genetic diseases. Moreover we provide deep-learning models that predict the activities of xCas9 and SpCas9-NG at the target sequences. The resulting deeper understanding of the activities of xCas9 SpCas9-NG and SpCas9 in human cells should facilitate their use. High-throughput analysis of the activities of xCas9 SpCas9-NG and SpCas9 at matched and mismatched target sequences in human cells.
