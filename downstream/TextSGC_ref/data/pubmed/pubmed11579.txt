Bone age is an essential measure of skeletal maturity in children with growth disorders. It is typically assessed by a trained physician using radiographs of the hand and a reference model. However it has been described that the reference models leave room for interpretation leading to a large inter-observer and intra-observer variation. In this work we explore a novel method for automated bone age assessment to assist physicians with their estimation. It consists of a powerful combination of deep learning and Gaussian process regression. Using this combination sensitivity of the deep learning model to rotations and flips of the input images can be exploited to increase overall predictive performance compared to only using the deep learning network. We validate our approach retrospectively on a set of 12611 radiographs of patients between 0 and 19 years of age. Automated Assessment of Bone Age Using Deep Learning and Gaussian Process Regression.
