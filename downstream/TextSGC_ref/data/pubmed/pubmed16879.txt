Swedish healthcare has an internationally high standard but is often criticized from a patient perspective owing to access problems to primary and specialist care. The waiting time to get in touch or get an appointment with a doctor nurse or physiotherapist is often too long. Access problems also create stress for employees when there are too few appointments to offer. In addition too much time gets spent on the administration of long waiting lists which adds no value to patients. Jnkping County Council was not satisfied with this situation and decided to make an attempt to improve access in the whole system. How improved access to healthcare was successfully spread across Sweden.
