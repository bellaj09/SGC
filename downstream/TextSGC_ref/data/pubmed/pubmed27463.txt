"Typically clinical measures of cognition require motor or speech responses. Thus a significant percentage of people with disabilities are not able to complete standardized assessments. This situation could be resolved by employing a more accessible test administration method such as a brain-computer interface BCI. A BCI can circumvent motor and speech requirements by translating brain activity to identify a subjects response. By eliminating the need for motor or speech input one could use a BCI to assess an individual who previously did not have access to clinical tests."
