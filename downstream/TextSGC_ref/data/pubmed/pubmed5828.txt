We report webKnossos an in-browser annotation tool for 3D electron microscopic data. webKnossos provides flight mode a single-view egocentric reconstruction method enabling trained annotator crowds to reconstruct at a speed of 1.5  0.6 mm/h for axons and 2.1  0.9 mm/h for dendrites in 3D electron microscopic data from mammalian cortex. webKnossos accelerates neurite reconstruction for connectomics by 4- to 13-fold compared with current state-of-the-art tools thus extending the range of connectomes that can realistically be mapped in the future. webKnossos: efficient online 3D data annotation for connectomics.
