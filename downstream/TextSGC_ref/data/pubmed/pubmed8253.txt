Traditional handcrafted crowd-counting techniques in an image are currently transformed via machine-learning and artificial-intelligence techniques into intelligent crowd-counting techniques. This paradigm shift offers many advanced features in terms of adaptive monitoring and the control of dynamic crowd gatherings. Adaptive monitoring identification/recognition and the management of diverse crowd gatherings can improve many crowd-management-related tasks in terms of efficiency capacity reliability and safety. Despite many challenges such as occlusion clutter and irregular object distribution and nonuniform object scale convolutional neural networks are a promising technology for intelligent image crowd counting and analysis. In this article we review categorize analyze limitations and distinctive features and provide a detailed performance evaluation of the latest convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. We also highlight the potential applications of convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Finally we conclude this article by presenting our key observations providing strong foundation for future research directions while designing convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Further the article discusses new advancements toward understanding crowd counting in smart cities using the Internet of Things IoT.
