Segmentation of organs at risk OAR in computed tomography CT is of vital importance in radiotherapy treatment. This task is time consuming and for some organs it is very challenging due to low-intensity contrast in CT. We propose a framework to perform the automatic segmentation of multiple OAR: esophagus heart trachea and aorta. Different from previous works using deep learning techniques we make use of global localization information based on an original distance map that yields not only the localization of each organ but also the spatial relationship between them. Instead of segmenting directly the organs we first generate the localization map by minimizing a reconstruction error within an adversarial framework. This map that includes localization information of all organs is then used to guide the segmentation task in a fully convolutional setting. Experimental results show encouraging performance on CT scans of 60 patients totaling 11084 slices in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
