A number of studies have associated the adult intelligence quotient with the structure and function of the bilateral parieto-frontal networks whereas the relationship between intelligence quotient and parieto-frontal network function has been found to be relatively weak in early childhood. Because both human intelligence and brain function undergo protracted development into adulthood the purpose of the present study was to provide a better understanding of the development of the parieto-frontal network-intelligence quotient relationship. Association between resting-state coactivation in the parieto-frontal network and intelligence during late childhood and adolescence.
