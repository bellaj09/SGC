Computer-aided diagnosis CAD is becoming a next-generation tool for the diagnosis of human disease. CAD for colon polyps has been suggested as a particularly useful tool for trainee colonoscopists as the use of a CAD system avoids the complications associated with endoscopic resections. In addition to conventional CAD a convolutional neural network CNN system utilizing artificial intelligence AI has been developing rapidly over the past 5 years. We attempted to generate a unique CNN-CAD system with an AI function that studied endoscopic images extracted from movies obtained with colonoscopes used in routine examinations. Here we report our preliminary results of this novel CNN-CAD system for the diagnosis of colon polyps.
