Electronic medical claims EMCs can be used to accurately predict the occurrence of a variety of diseases which can contribute to precise medical interventions. While there is a growing interest in the application of machine learning ML techniques to address clinical problems the use of deep-learning in healthcare have just gained attention recently. Deep learning such as deep neural network DNN has achieved impressive results in the areas of speech recognition computer vision and natural language processing in recent years. However deep learning is often difficult to comprehend due to the complexities in its framework. Furthermore this method has not yet been demonstrated to achieve a better performance comparing to other conventional ML algorithms in disease prediction tasks using EMCs. In this study we utilize a large population-based EMC database of around 800000 patients to compare DNN with three other ML approaches for predicting 5-year stroke occurrence. The result shows that DNN and gradient boosting decision tree GBDT can result in similarly high prediction accuracies that are better compared to logistic regression LR and support vector machine SVM approaches. Meanwhile DNN achieves optimal results by using lesser amounts of patient data when comparing to GBDT method.
