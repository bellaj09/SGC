Screening and assessing diabetic retinopathy DR are essential for reducing morbidity associated with diabetes. Macular ischemia is known to correlate with the severity of retinopathy. Recent studies have shown that optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA with intrinsic contrast from blood flow motion is well suited for quantified analysis of the avascular area which is potentially a useful biomarker in DR. In this study we propose the first deep learning solution to segment the avascular area in OCTA of DR. The network design consists of a multi-scaled encoder-decoder neural network MEDnet to detect the non-perfusion area in 6  6 mm2 and in ultra-wide field retinal angiograms. Avascular areas were effectively detected in DR subjects of various disease stages as well as in the foveal avascular zone of healthy subjects.
