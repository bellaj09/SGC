Recently deep learning frameworks have been shown to be successful and efficient in processing digital histology images for various detection and classification tasks. Among these tasks cell detection and classification are key steps in many computer-assisted diagnosis systems. Traditionally cell detection and classification is performed as a sequence of two consecutive steps by using two separate deep learning networks: one for detection and the other for classification. This strategy inevitably increases the computational complexity of the training stage. In this paper we propose a synchronized deep autoencoder network for simultaneous detection and classification of cells in bone marrow histology images. The proposed network uses a single architecture to detect the positions of cells and classify the detected cells in parallel. It uses a curve-support Gaussian model to compute probability maps that allow detecting irregularly shape cells precisely. Moreover the network includes a novel neighborhood selection mechanism to boost the classification accuracy. We show that the performance of the proposed network is superior than traditional deep learning detection methods and very competitive compared to traditional deep learning classification networks. Runtime comparison also shows that our network requires less time to be trained. Simultaneous Cell Detection and Classification in Bone Marrow Histology Images.
