During the last years because of the progress in magnetic resonance imaging MRI magnetic resonance angiography MRA has become a serious alternative to conventional X-ray angiography. The potential of MRA in combination with methods for three-dimensional reconstruction will be presented and different methods for image post-processing are discussed based on a number of cases. The examinations were performed on a clinical 1.5 T magnetic resonance tomograph Siemens Vision Erlangen using conventional MR angiography sequences. The different options of post-processing were carried out online on the console and offline using dedicated workstations Siemens Virtuoso and CHILI. Use of virtual reality for MRI data of complex vascular structures.
