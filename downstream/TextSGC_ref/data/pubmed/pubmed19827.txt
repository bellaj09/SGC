"The high power output of flight muscles places special demands on the respiratory gas exchange system in insects. In small insects respiration relies on diffusion and for elevated locomotor performance such as flight instantaneous gas exchange rates typically co-vary with the animals metabolic activity. By contrast under certain conditions instantaneous release rate of carbon dioxide from the fruit fly Drosophila flying in a virtual-reality flight arena may oscillate distinctly at low frequency 0.37+/-0.055 Hz even though flight muscle mechanical power output requires constant metabolic activity. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that this uncoupling between respiratory and metabolic rate is not driven by conventional types of convective flow reinforcement such as abdominal pumping but might result from two unusual mechanisms for tracheal breathing. Simplified analytical modeling of diffusive tracheal gas exchange suggests that cyclic release patterns in the insect occur as a consequence of the stochastically synchronized control of spiracle opening area by the four large thoracic spiracles. Alternatively in-flight motion analysis of the abdomen and proboscis using infra-red video imaging suggests utilization of the proboscis extension reflex PER for tracheal convection. Although the respiratory benefit of synchronized spiracle opening activity in the fruit fly is unclear proboscis-induced tracheal convection might potentially help to balance the local oxygen supply between different body compartments of the flying animal." Unconventional mechanisms control cyclic respiratory gas release in flying Drosophila.
