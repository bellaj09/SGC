"Animals gustatory system has been widely acknowledged as one of the most sensitive chemosensing systems especially for its ability to detect bitterness. Since bitterness usually symbolizes inedibility the potential to use rodents gustatory system is investigated to detect bitter compounds. In this work the extracellular potentials of a group of neurons are recorded by chronically coupling microelectrode array to rats gustatory cortex with brain-machine interface BMI technology. Local field potentials LFPs which represent the electrophysiological activity of neural networks are chosen as target signals due to stable response patterns across trials and are further divided into different oscillations. As a result different taste qualities yield quality-specific LFPs in time domain which suggests the selectivity of this in vivo bioelectronic tongue. Meanwhile more quantitative study in frequency domain indicates that the post-stimulation power of beta and low gamma oscillations shows dependence with concentrations of denatonium benzoate a prototypical bitter compound and the limit of detection is deduced to be 0.076 M which is two orders lower than previous in vitro bioelectronic tongues and conventional electronic tongues. According to the results this in vivo bioelectronic tongue in combination with BMI presents a promising method in highly sensitive bitterness detection and is supposed to provide new platform in measuring bitterness degree." A novel bioelectronic tongue in vivo for highly sensitive bitterness detection with brain-machine interface.
