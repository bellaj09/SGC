Integrating anatomic nomenclature with geometric anatomic data via a web interface and providing illustration and visualization tools presents numerous challenges. We have developed a library of anatomic models and methods for navigating anatomic nomenclature. Based on the library and tools we have developed a simple yet powerful open web-based tool that uses tree navigation and selection for assembling and downloading self-documenting anatomic scenes in Virtual Reality Modeling Language. Web-based viewer for systematic combination of anatomy and nomenclature.
