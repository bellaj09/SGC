Electrophysiological studies revealed that different neuronal oscillations among which the alpha 8-13\u202fHz rhythm in particular but also the beta 13-30\u202fHz and gamma 30-80\u202fHz rhythms are modulated during rest in the default mode network DMN. Little is known however about the role of these rhythms in supporting DMN connectivity. Biophysical studies suggest that lower and higher frequencies mediate long- and short-range connectivity respectively. Accordingly we hypothesized that interactions between all DMN areas are supported by the alpha rhythm and that the connectivity between specific DMN areas is established through other frequencies mainly in the beta and/or gamma bands. To test this hypothesis we used high-density electroencefalographic data collected in 19 healthy volunteers at rest. We analyzed frequency-dependent functional interactions between four main DMN nodes in a broad 1-80\u202fHz frequency range. In line with our hypothesis we found that the frequency-dependent connectivity profile between pairs of DMN nodes had a peak at 9-11\u202fHz. Also the connectivity profile showed other peaks at higher frequencies which depended on the specific connection. Overall our findings suggest that frequency-dependent connectivity analysis may be a powerful tool to better understand how different neuronal oscillations support connectivity within and between brain networks.
