Our 3-D Body Representation constructed during development by our Central Nervous System under the direction of our DNA consists of a holographic representation arising from sensory input in the cerebellum and projected extraneurally in the brain ventricular fluid which has the chemical structure of liquid crystal. The structure of 3-D holographic Body Representation is then extrapolated by such cognitive instruments as boundarization geometrization and gestalt organization upon the external environment which is perceived consequently as three dimensional. When the Body Representation collapses as in psychotic panic states. patients become terrified as they suddenly lose the perception of themselves and the world around them as three dimensional solid in a reliably solid environment but feel suddenly that they are no longer a person but a disorganized blob. In our clinical practice we found serendipitously that the structure of three dimensionality can be restored even without medication by techniques involving stimulation of the body sensory system in the presence of a benevolent psychotherapist. Implications for Virtual Reality will be discussed. The construction of tridimensional representation of body and external reality in man. The greatest achievement of evolution to date implications for virtual reality.
