Noninvasive brain computer interfaces BCI and more specifically Electroencephalography EEG based systems for intent detection need to compensate for the low signal to noise ratio of EEG signals. In many applications the temporal dependency information from consecutive decisions and contextual data can be used to provide a prior probability for the upcoming decision. In this study we proposed two probabilistic graphical models PGMs using context information and previously observed EEG evidences to estimate a probability distribution over the decision space in graph based decision-making mechanism. In this approach user moves a pointer to the desired vertex in the graph in which each vertex represents an action. To select a vertex a "Select" command or a proposed probabilistic Selection criterion PSC can be used to automatically detect the user intended vertex. Performance of different PGMs and Selection criteria combinations are compared over a keyboard based on a graph layout. Based on the simulation results probabilistic Selection criterion along with the probabilistic graphical model provides the highest performance boost for individuals with pour calibration performance and achieving the same performance for individuals with high calibration performance.
