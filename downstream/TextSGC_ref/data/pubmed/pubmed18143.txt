Endovascular surgery provides a minimally invasive solution for the treatment of aortic aneurysms. Fluoroscopic guidance involves X-rays exposure and loss of space information. We have developed a navigation system allowing real-time visualisation of the endovascular tools in a 3D model of the vessels without any radiation exposure. A modified endoprosthesis is equipped with a magnetic sensor tracked by the Aurora magnetic localizer. The registration step uses 2.5D ultrasonography to replace pre-operative CT data in the Operating Room referential. The Virtual Reality based navigation system shows the location of the endoprosthesis inside a 3D CT model of the aorta. Endovascular procedure benefits from a reduced radiation exposure.
