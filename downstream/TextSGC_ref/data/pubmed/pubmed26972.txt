Brain-machine interface BMI provides a bidirectional pathway between the brain and external facilities. The machine-to-brain pathway makes it possible to send artificial information back into the biological brain interfering neural activities and generating sensations. The idea of the BMI-assisted bio-robotic animal system is accomplished by stimulations on specific sites of the nervous system. With the technology of BMI animals\ locomotion behavior can be precisely controlled as robots which made the animal turning into bio-robot. In this chapter we reviewed our lab works focused on rat-robot navigation. The principles of rat-robot system have been briefly described first including the target brain sites chosen for locomotion control and the design of remote control system. Some methodological advances made by optogenetic technologies for better modulation control have then been introduced. Besides we also introduced our implementation of "mind-controlled" rat navigation system. Moreover we have presented our efforts made on combining biological intelligence with artificial intelligence with developments of automatic control and training system assisted with images or voices inputs. We concluded this chapter by discussing further developments to acquire environmental information as well as promising applications with write-in BMIs.
