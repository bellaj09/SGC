"The integration of artificial intelligence in the radiation oncologists workflow has multiple applications and significant potential. From the initial patient encounter artificial intelligence may aid in pretreatment disease outcome and toxicity prediction. It may subsequently aid in treatment planning and enhanced dose optimization. Artificial intelligence may also optimize the quality assurance process and support a higher level of safety quality and efficiency of care. This article describes components of the radiation consultation planning and treatment process and how the thoughtful integration of artificial intelligence may improve shared decision making planning efficiency planning quality patient safety and patient outcomes."
