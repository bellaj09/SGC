"Chromosome classification is critical for karyotyping in abnormality diagnosis. To expedite the diagnosis we present a novel method named Varifocal-Net for simultaneous classification of chromosomes type and polarity using deep convolutional networks. The approach consists of one global-scale network G-Net and one local-scale network L-Net. It follows three stages. The first stage is to learn both global and local features. We extract global features and detect finer local regions via the G-Net. By proposing a varifocal mechanism we zoom into local parts and extract local features via the L-Net. Residual learning and multi-task learning strategies are utilized to promote high-level feature extraction. The detection of discriminative local parts is fulfilled by a localization subnet of the G-Net whose training process involves both supervised and weakly supervised learning. The second stage is to build two multi-layer perceptron classifiers that exploit features of both two scales to boost classification performance. The third stage is to introduce a dispatch strategy of assigning each chromosome to a type within each patient case by utilizing the domain knowledge of karyotyping. The evaluation results from 1909 karyotyping cases showed that the proposed Varifocal-Net achieved the highest accuracy per patient case % of 99.2 for both type and polarity tasks. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods demonstrating the effectiveness of our varifocal mechanism multi-scale feature ensemble and dispatch strategy. The proposed method has been applied to assist practical karyotype diagnosis." Varifocal-Net: A Chromosome Classification Approach Using Deep Convolutional Networks.
