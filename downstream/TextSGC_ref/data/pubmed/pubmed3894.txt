"We investigated the relationship between individual subjects functional connectomes and 280 behavioral and demographic measures in a single holistic multivariate analysis relating imaging to non-imaging data from 461 subjects in the Human Connectome Project. We identified one strong mode of population co-variation: subjects were predominantly spread along a single positive-negative axis linking lifestyle demographic and psychometric measures to each other and to a specific pattern of brain connectivity." A positive-negative mode of population covariation links brain connectivity demographics and behavior.
