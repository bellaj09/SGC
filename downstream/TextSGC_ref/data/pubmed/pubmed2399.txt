"Recent studies have suggested that the brains structural and functional networks i.e. connectomics can be constructed by various imaging technologies e.g. EEG/MEG; structural diffusion and functional MRI and further characterized by graph theory. Given the huge complexity of network construction analysis and statistics toolboxes incorporating these functions are largely lacking. Here we developed the GRaph thEoreTical Network Analysis GRETNA toolbox for imaging connectomics. The GRETNA contains several key features as follows: i an open-source Matlab-based cross-platform Windows and UNIX OS package with a graphical user interface GUI; ii allowing topological analyses of global and local network properties with parallel computing ability independent of imaging modality and species; iii providing flexible manipulations in several key steps during network construction and analysis which include network node definition network connectivity processing network type selection and choice of thresholding procedure; iv allowing statistical comparisons of global nodal and connectional network metrics and assessments of relationship between these network metrics and clinical or behavioral variables of interest; and v including functionality in image preprocessing and network construction based on resting-state functional MRI R-fMRI data. After applying the GRETNA to a publicly released R-fMRI dataset of 54 healthy young adults we demonstrated that human brain functional networks exhibit efficient small-world assortative hierarchical and modular organizations and possess highly connected hubs and that these findings are robust against different analytical strategies. With these efforts we anticipate that GRETNA will accelerate imaging connectomics in an easy quick and flexible manner. GRETNA is freely available on the NITRC website."
