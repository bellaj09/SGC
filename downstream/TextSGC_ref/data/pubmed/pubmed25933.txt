The MMVR Conference is one of a handful of national forums where leading researchers regularly convene to discuss medical modeling and simulation. As such the presentations made during the conference represent a reasonable overview of both the state-of-the-art in virtual reality in medicine and the basic and applied research trends in the field. This article describes those trends and some of the implications based on a meta-analysis of almost three hundred articles published as a result of the MMVR Conferences in 2000 2001 and 2002. Analyzing the MMVR research space: past emphases future directions.
