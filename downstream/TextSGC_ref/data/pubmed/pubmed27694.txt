"Brain computer interface BCI is an emerging technology for paralyzed patients to communicate with external environments. Among current BCIs the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCI has drawn great attention due to its characteristics of easy preparation high information transfer rate ITR high accuracy and low cost. However electroencephalogram EEG signals are electrophysiological responses reflecting the underlying neural activities which are dependent upon subjects physiological states e.g. emotion attention etc. and usually variant among different individuals. The development of classification approaches to account for each individuals difference in SSVEP is needed but was seldom reported." Improvement of classification accuracy in a phase-tagged steady-state visual evoked potential-based brain computer interface using multiclass support vector machine.
