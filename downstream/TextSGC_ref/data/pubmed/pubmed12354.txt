Rapid induction of profound hypothermic arrest suspended animation can provide valuable time for the repair of complex injuries and improve survival. The optimal rate for re-warming from a state of profound hypothermia is unknown. This experiment was designed to test the impact of different warming rates on outcome in a swine model of lethal hemorrhage from complex vascular injuries. Does the rate of rewarming from profound hypothermic arrest influence the outcome in a swine model of lethal hemorrhage?
