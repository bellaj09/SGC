"The insula IC and cingulate are key components of the central autonomic network and central nodes of the salience network SN a set of spatially distinct but temporally correlated brain regions identified with resting-state task free functional MRI rsMRI. To examine the SNs involvement in sympathetic outflow we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in intrinsic connectivity of the SN correlate positively with resting postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity MSNA burst incidence BI in subjects without and with obstructive sleep apnea OSA. Overnight polysomnography 5-min rsMRI and fibular MSNA recording were performed in 36 subjects mean age 57 yr; 10 women 26 men. Independent component analysis ICA of the entire cohort identified the SN as including bilateral IC pregenual anterior cingulate cortex pgACC midcingulate cortex MCC and the temporoparietal junction TPJ. There was a positive correlation between BI and the apnea-hypopnea index AHI P < 0.001 but dual-regression analysis identified no differences in SN functional connectivity between subjects with no or mild OSA n = 17 and moderate or severe n = 19 OSA. Correlation analysis relating BI to the strength of connectivity within the SN revealed large i.e. spatial extent and strong correlations for the left IC P < 0.001 right pgACC/MCC P < 0.006 left TPJ P < 0.004 thalamus P < 0.035 and cerebellum P < 0.013. Indexes of sleep apnea were unrelated to BI and the strength of SN connectivity. There were no relationships between BI and default or sensorimotor network connectivity. This study links connectivity within the SN to MSNA demonstrating several of its nodes to be key sympathoexcitatory regions." Association between resting-state brain functional connectivity and muscle sympathetic burst incidence.
