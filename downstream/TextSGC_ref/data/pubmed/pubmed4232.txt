The structural human connectome i.e. the network of fiber connections in the brain can be analyzed at ever finer spatial resolution thanks to advances in neuroimaging. Here we analyze several large data sets for the human brain network made available by the Open Connectome Project. We apply statistical model selection to characterize the degree distributions of graphs containing up to nodes and edges. A three-parameter generalized Weibull also known as a stretched exponential distribution is a good fit to most of the observed degree distributions. For almost all networks simple power laws cannot fit the data but in some cases there is statistical support for power laws with an exponential cutoff. We also calculate the topological graph dimension D and the small-world coefficient  of these networks. While  suggests a small-world topology we found that D\u2009<\u20094 showing that long-distance connections provide only a small correction to the topology of the embedding three-dimensional space.
