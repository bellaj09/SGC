Proton MRSI is a noninvasive modality capable of generating volumetric maps of in vivo tissue metabolism without the need for ionizing radiation or injected contrast agent. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging has been shown to be a viable imaging modality for studying several neuropathologies. However a key hurdle in the routine clinical adoption of MRSI is the presence of spectral artifacts that can arise from a number of sources possibly leading to false information. A convolutional neural network to filter artifacts in spectroscopic MRI.
