We present a deep learning framework based on a generative adversarial network GAN to perform super-resolution in coherent imaging systems. We demonstrate that this framework can enhance the resolution of both pixel size-limited and diffraction-limited coherent imaging systems. The capabilities of this approach are experimentally validated by super-resolving complex-valued images acquired using a lensfree on-chip holographic microscope the resolution of which was pixel size-limited. Using the same GAN-based approach we also improved the resolution of a lens-based holographic imaging system that was limited in resolution by the numerical aperture of its objective lens. This deep learning-based super-resolution framework can be broadly applied to enhance the space-bandwidth product of coherent imaging systems using image data and convolutional neural networks and provides a rapid non-iterative method for solving inverse image reconstruction or enhancement problems in optics.
