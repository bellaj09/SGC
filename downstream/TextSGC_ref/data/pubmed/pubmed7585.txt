Precipitation is useful information for assessing vital water resources agriculture ecosystems and hydrology. Data-driven model predictions using deep learning algorithms are promising for these purposes. Echo state network ESN and Deep Echo state network DeepESN referred to as Reservoir Computing RC are effective and speedy algorithms to process a large amount of data. In this study we used the ESN and the DeepESN algorithms to analyze the meteorological hourly data from 2002 to 2014 at the Tainan Observatory in the southern Taiwan. The results show that the correlation coefficient by using the DeepESN was better than that by using the ESN and commercial neuronal network algorithms Back-propagation network BPN and support vector regression SVR MATLAB The MathWorks co. and the accuracy of predicted rainfall by using the DeepESN can be significantly improved compared with those by using ESN the BPN and the SVR. In sum the DeepESN is a trustworthy and good method to predict rainfall; it could be applied to global climate forecasts which need high-volume data processing. Application of the deep learning for the prediction of rainfall in Southern Taiwan.
