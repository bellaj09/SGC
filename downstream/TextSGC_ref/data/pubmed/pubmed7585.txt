"A Fully Convolutional Network FCN based deep architecture called Dual Path U-Net DPU-Net is proposed for automatic segmentation of the lumen and media-adventitia in IntraVascular UltraSound IVUS frames which is crucial for diagnosis of many cardiovascular diseases and also for facilitating 3D reconstructions of human arteries. One of the most prevalent problems in medical image analysis is the lack of training data. To overcome this limitation we propose a twofold solution. First we introduce a deep architecture that is able to learn using a small number of training images and still achieves a high degree of generalization ability. Second we strengthen the proposed DPU-Net by having a real-time augmentor control the image augmentation process. Our real-time augmentor contains specially-designed operations that simulate three types of IVUS artifacts and integrate them into the training images. We exhaustively assessed our twofold contribution over Baloccos standard publicly available IVUS 20\u202fMHz and 40\u202fMHz B-mode dataset which contain 109 training image 326 test images and 19 training images 59 test images respectively. Models are trained from scratch with the training images provided and evaluated with two commonly used metrics in the IVUS segmentation literature namely Jaccard Measure JM and Hausdorff Distance HD. Experimental results show that DPU-Net achieves 0.87 JM 0.82\u202fmm HD and 0.86 JM 1.07\u202fmm HD over 40\u202fMHz dataset for segmenting the lumen and the media respectively. Also DPU-Net achieves 0.90 JM 0.25\u202fmm HD and 0.92 JM 0.30\u202fmm HD over 20\u202fMHz images for segmenting the lumen and the media respectively. In addition DPU-Net outperforms existing methods by 8-15% in terms of HD distance. DPU-Net also shows a strong generalization property for predicting images in the test sets that contain a significant amount of major artifacts such as bifurcations shadows and side branches that are not common in the training set. Furthermore DPU-Net runs within 0.03\u202fs to segment each frame with a single modern GPU Nvidia GTX 1080. The proposed work leverages modern deep learning-based method for segmentation of lumen and the media vessel walls in both 20\u202fMHz and 40\u202fMHz IVUS B-mode images and achieves state-of-the-art results without any manual intervention.
