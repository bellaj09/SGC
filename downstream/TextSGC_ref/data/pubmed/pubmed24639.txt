This study describes our experience with using a virtual reality simulator CricSim to enhance the training of combat medics to perform a cricothyroidotomy surgical airway while in Iraq. Over a six month period 65 medics used the simulator as part of a Combat Medic Advanced Skills Training class while in Iraq and were asked to evaluate it. Students self-assessed comfort level with the procedure improved dramatically from baseline p<5.6 x 10-17. The CricSim was rated highly on realism but only moderately on ease of use. The use of this simulator in a far forward setting was feasible enhanced training and provided necessary end-user feedback for future development of this training platform. Far forward feasibility: testing a cricothyroidotmy simulator in Iraq.
