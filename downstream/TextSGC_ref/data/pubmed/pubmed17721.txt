"Using the internal mammary vessels as recipient vessels in free-flap autologous breast reconstruction has become a common practice. However these vessels are typically accessed by removing a costochondral segment. The purpose of this study was to describe the authors rib-sparing technique for accessing the internal mammary vessels that is efficient and reliable and limits chest wall morbidity." Rib-sparing internal mammary vessel harvest for microvascular breast reconstruction in 100 consecutive cases.
