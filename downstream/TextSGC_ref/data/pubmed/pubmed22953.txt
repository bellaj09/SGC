We present a feasibility study of a novel hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system for advanced functional electrical therapy FET of grasp. FET procedure is improved with both automated stimulation pattern selection and stimulation triggering. The proposed hybrid BCI comprises the two BCI control signals: steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP and event-related desynchronization ERD. The sequence of the two stages SSVEP-BCI and ERD-BCI runs in a closed-loop architecture. The first stage SSVEP-BCI acts as a selector of electrical stimulation pattern that corresponds to one of the three basic types of grasp: palmar lateral or precision. In the second stage ERD-BCI operates as a brain switch which activates the stimulation pattern selected in the previous stage. The system was tested in 6 healthy subjects who were all able to control the device with accuracy in a range of 0.64-0.96. The results provided the reference data needed for the planned clinical study. This novel BCI may promote further restoration of the impaired motor function by closing the loop between the "will to move" and contingent temporally synchronized sensory feedback.
