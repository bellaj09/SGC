Studies on brain computer interfaces BCIs have been mainly concerned with algorithm improvement for better signal classification. Fewer studies however have addressed to date the role of cognitive mechanisms underlying the elicitation of brain-signals in BCIs. We tested the effect of visuospatial attention orienting on a P300-guided BCI by comparing the effectiveness of three visual interfaces which elicited different modalities of visuospatial attention orienting exogenous vs. endogenous. Exogenous and endogenous orienting of visuospatial attention in P300-guided brain computer interfaces: a pilot study on healthy participants.
