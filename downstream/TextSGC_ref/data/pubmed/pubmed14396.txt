Permanent His bundle pacing is feasible and effective in patients with atrioventricular block or left bundle branch block. However pacing thresholds to capture the distal His bundle is often higher. Recently left bundle branch area pacing LBBP has been shown to be feasible by advancing the lead transvenously deep into the interventricular septum to reach the left ventricular endocardial surface. In this article we describe the utility of three dimensional 3D mapping to achieve LBBP. Left bundle branch pacing utilizing three dimensional mapping.
