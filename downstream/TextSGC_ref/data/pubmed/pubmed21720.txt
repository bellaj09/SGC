"Transcranial focused ultrasound FUS is capable of modulating the neural activity of specific brain regions with a potential role as a non-invasive computer-to-brain interface CBI. In conjunction with the use of brain-to-computer interface BCI techniques that translate brain function to generate computer commands we investigated the feasibility of using the FUS-based CBI to non-invasively establish a functional link between the brains of different species i.e. human and Sprague-Dawley rat thus creating a brain-to-brain interface BBI. The implementation was aimed to non-invasively translate the human volunteers intention to stimulate a rats brain motor area that is responsible for the tail movement. The volunteer initiated the intention by looking at a strobe light flicker on a computer display and the degree of synchronization in the electroencephalographic steady-state-visual-evoked-potentials SSVEP with respect to the strobe frequency was analyzed using a computer. Increased signal amplitude in the SSVEP indicating the volunteers intention triggered the delivery of a burst-mode FUS 350 kHz ultrasound frequency tone burst duration of 0.5 ms pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz given for 300 msec duration to excite the motor area of an anesthetized rat transcranially. The successful excitation subsequently elicited the tail movement which was detected by a motion sensor. The interface was achieved at 94.03.0% accuracy with a time delay of 1.591.07 sec from the thought-initiation to the creation of the tail movement. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a computer-mediated BBI that links central neural functions between two biological entities which may confer unexplored opportunities in the study of neuroscience with potential implications for therapeutic applications."
