The examination begins on page 421. Endermologie has been touted as an alternative to or adjunctive therapy with liposuction for the removal of subcutaneous fat body contouring and tissue toning. In this study we examined the effects of Endermologie treatment with the Yucatan mini-pig model. Pigs were divided into three treatment groups n = 4 and underwent 4 10 or 20 treatment sessions respectively. Blood and urine analysis was conducted during the study to obtain evidence of tissue trauma or breakdown and excretion of subcutaneous fatty tissue. Matched en bloc tissue sections from treated and untreated areas were examined for possible wound healing inflammatory response and tissue architecture changes. Examination of tissues revealed changes of architecture with accumulation of dense longitudinal collagen bands in the mid and deep subdermal tissue layer; some distortion and disruption of adipocyte cell membranes were also observed. The degree of tissue change found was dependent on the number of treatment sessions performed. Endermologie treatments did not elicit a classical wound healing or inflammatory response with no evidence of either increased tissue vascularity or cell division. No evidence of mobilization of fatty tissue was found and no fat breakdown products or metabolites were detectable in blood or urine. Treatments did not cause a decrease in subcutaneous tissue thickness. No evidence of skin or muscle injury was noted. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the changes noted are short term or permanent. Analysis of the cutaneous and systemic effects of Endermologie in the porcine model.
