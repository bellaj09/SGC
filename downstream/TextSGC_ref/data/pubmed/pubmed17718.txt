Although dogs are the animals used more often in Experimental Surgeries the use of sheep bovine and swine as models for scientific experiments has been growing. Thus further learning on the treatment and basic standardization of more complex surgeries in swine are necessary. The objective of this study was to evaluate sedation and analgesia obtained by the intramuscular administration of midazolam and ketamine and local anesthetics with 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor in tracheostomy and dissection of femoral artery and vein. Standardization of anesthesia in swine for experimental cardiovascular surgeries.
