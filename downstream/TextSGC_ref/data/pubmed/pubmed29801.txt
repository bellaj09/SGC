"Functional electrical stimulation FES has been shown to facilitate the recovery of grasping function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Neurophysiological theory suggests that this benefit may be further enhanced by a more consistent pairing of the voluntary commands sent from the users brain down their spinal cord with the electrical stimuli applied to the users periphery. The objective of the study was to compare brain-machine interfaces BMIs-controlled and electromyogram EMG-controlled FES therapy to three more well-researched therapies namely push button-controlled FES therapy voluntary grasping VOL and BMI-guided voluntary grasping." Short-term neuroplastic effects of brain-controlled and muscle-controlled electrical stimulation.
