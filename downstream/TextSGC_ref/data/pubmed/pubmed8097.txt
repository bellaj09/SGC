To compare results for radiological prediction of pathological invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma between radiologists and a deep learning DL system.Ninety patients 50 men 40 women; mean age 66 years; range 40-88 years who underwent pre-operative chest computed tomography CT with 0.625-mm slice thickness were included in this retrospective study. Twenty-four cases of adenocarcinoma in situ AIS 20 cases of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma MIA and 46 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma IVA were pathologically diagnosed. Three radiologists of different levels of experience diagnosed each nodule by using previously documented CT findings to predict pathological invasiveness. DL was structured using a 3-dimensional 3D convolutional neural network 3D-CNN constructed with 2 successive pairs of convolution and max-pooling layers and 2 fully connected layers. The output layer comprises 3 nodes to recognize the 3 conditions of adenocarcinoma AIS MIA and IVA or 2 nodes for 2 conditions AIS and MIA/IVA. Results from DL and the 3 radiologists were statistically compared.No significant differences in pathological diagnostic accuracy rates were seen between DL and the 3 radiologists P\u200a>.11. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve for DL 0.712 was almost the same as that for the radiologist with extensive experience 0.714; P\u200a=\u200a.98. Compared with the consensus results from radiologists DL offered significantly inferior sensitivity P\u200a=\u200a.0005 but significantly superior specificity P\u200a=\u200a.02.Despite the small training data set diagnostic performance of DL was almost the same as the radiologist with extensive experience. In particular DL provided higher specificity than radiologists.
