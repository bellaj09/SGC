Agency the attribution of authorship to an action of our body requires the intention to carry out the action and subsequently a match between its predicted and actual sensory consequences. However illusory agency can be generated through priming of the action together with perception of bodily action even when there has been no actual corresponding action. Here we show that participants can have the illusion of agency over the walking of a virtual body even though in reality they are seated and only allowed head movements. The experiment n\u2009=\u200928 had two factors: Perspective 1PP or 3PP and Head Sway Sway or NoSway. Participants in 1PP saw a life-sized virtual body spatially coincident with their own from a first person perspective or the virtual body from third person perspective 3PP. In the Sway condition the viewpoint included a walking animation but not in NoSway. The results show strong illusions of body ownership agency and walking in the 1PP compared to the 3PP condition and an enhanced level of arousal while the walking was up a virtual hill. Sway reduced the level of agency. We conclude with a discussion of the results in the light of current theories of agency. First Person Perspective of Seated Participants Over a Walking Virtual Body Leads to Illusory Agency Over the Walking.
