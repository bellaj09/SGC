In this study a c-VEP based BCI system was developed to run on three distinctive pseudorandom sequences namely the m-code the Gold-code and the Barker-code. The Visual Evoked Potentials VEPs were provoked using these codes. In the online session subjects controlled a LEGO Mindstorms robot around a fixed track. Choosing the optimal code proved a significant increase in accuracy p<;0.00001 over the average performance. No single code proved significantly more accurate than the others p=0.81 suggesting that the term "optimal code" is subject-dependent. However the Gold-code was significantly faster than both alternatives p=0.006 p=0.016. When choosing the optimal code for accuracy no significant decrease in Time Per Identification TPI was found p=0.67. Thus when creating an online c-VEP based BCI system it is recommended to use multiple random sequences for increased performance.
