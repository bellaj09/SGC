"Human multitasking is typically studied by repeatedly presenting two tasks either sequentially task switch paradigms or overlapping in time dual-task paradigms. This is different from everyday life which typically presents an ever-changing sequence of many different tasks. Realistic multitasking therefore requires an ongoing orchestration of task switching and dual-tasking. Here we investigate whether the age-related decay of multitasking which has been documented with pure task-switch and pure dual-task paradigms can also be quantified with a more realistic car driving paradigm. 63 young 20-30 years of age and 61 older 65-75 years of age participants were tested in an immersive driving simulator. They followed a car that occasionally slowed down and concurrently executed a mixed sequence of loading tasks that differed with respect to their sensory input modality cognitive requirements and motor output channel. In two control conditions the car-following or the loading task were administered alone. Older participants drove more slowly more laterally and more variably than young ones and this age difference was accentuated in the multitask-condition particularly if the loading task took participants gaze and attention away from the road. In the latter case 78% of older drivers veered off the road and 15% drove across the median. The corresponding values for young drivers were 40% and 0% respectively. Our findings indicate that multitasking deteriorates in older age not only in typical laboratory paradigms but also in paradigms that require orchestration of dual-tasking and task switching. They also indicate that older drivers are at a higher risk of causing an accident when they engage in a task that takes gaze and attention away from the road."
