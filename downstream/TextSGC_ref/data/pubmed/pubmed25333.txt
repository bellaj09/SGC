Significant progress has occurred in the field of brain-machine interfaces BMI since the first demonstrations with rodents monkeys and humans controlling different prosthetic devices directly with neural activity. This technology holds great potential to aid large numbers of people with neurological disorders. However despite this initial enthusiasm and the plethora of available robotic technologies existing neural interfaces cannot as yet master the control of prosthetic paralyzed or otherwise disabled limbs. Here I briefly discuss recent advances from our laboratory into the neural basis of BMIs that should lead to better prosthetic control and clinically viable solutions as well as new insights into the neurobiology of action. Advances in neuroprosthetic learning and control.
