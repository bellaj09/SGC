Recently Caribbean coasts have experienced atypical massive arrivals of pelagic Sargassum with negative consequences both ecologically and economically. Based on deep learning techniques this study proposes a novel algorithm for floating and accumulated pelagic Sargassum detection along the coastline of Quintana Roo Mexico. Using convolutional and recurrent neural networks architectures a deep neural network named ERISNet was designed specifically to detect these macroalgae along the coastline through remote sensing support. A new dataset which includes pixel values with and without Sargassum was built to train and test ERISNet. Aqua-MODIS imagery was used to build the dataset. After the learning process the designed algorithm achieves a 90% of probability in its classification skills. ERISNet provides a novel insight to detect accurately algal blooms arrivals.
