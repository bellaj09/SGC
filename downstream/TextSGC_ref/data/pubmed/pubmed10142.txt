The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning DL method for producing four-dimensional computed tomography 4DCT ventilation imaging and to evaluate the accuracy of the DL-based ventilation imaging against single-photon emission-computed tomography SPECT ventilation imaging SPECT-VI. The performance of the DL-based method is assessed by comparing with density change- and Jacobian-based HU and JAC methods.
