The detection of voluntary motor intention from EEG has been applied to closed-loop brain-computer interfacing BCI. The movement-related cortical potential MRCP is a low frequency component of the EEG signal which represents movement intention preparation and execution. In this study we aim at detecting MRCPs from single-trial EEG traces. For this purpose we propose a detector based on a discriminant manifold learning method called locality sensitive discriminant analysis LSDA and we test it in both online and offline experiments with executed and imagined movements. The online and offline experimental results demonstrated that the proposed LSDA approach for MRCP detection outperformed the Locality Preserving Projection LPP approach which was previously shown to be the most accurate algorithm so far tested for MRCP detection. For example in the online tests the performance of LSDA was superior than LPP in terms of a significant reduction in false positives FP passive FP: 1.6 0.9/min versus 2.9 1.0/min p = 0.002 active FP: 2.2 0.8/min versus 2.7 0.6/min  p = 0.03  for a similar rate of true positives. In conclusion the proposed LSDA based MRCP detection method is superior to previous approaches and is promising for developing patient-driven BCI systems for motor function rehabilitation as well as for neuroscience research.
