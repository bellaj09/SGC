The human brain undergoes rapid growth in both structure and function from infancy through early childhood and this significantly influences cognitive and behavioral development in later life. A newly emerging research framework developmental connectomics provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring the developing brain through non-invasive mapping of structural and functional connectivity patterns. Within this framework we review recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies investigating connectome development from 20 postmenstrual weeks to 5 years of age. Specifically we highlight five fundamental principles of brain network development during the critical first years of life emphasizing strengthened segregation/integration balance a remarkable hierarchical order from primary to higher-order regions unparalleled structural and functional maturations substantial individual variability and high vulnerability to risk factors and developmental disorders.
