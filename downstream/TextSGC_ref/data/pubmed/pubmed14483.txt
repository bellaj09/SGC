The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because more often than not information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described-Biochemistry of the envenomation response-aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view.
