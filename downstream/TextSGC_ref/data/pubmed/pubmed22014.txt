"Electroencephalograms EEGs measure a brain signal that contains abundant information about the human brain function and health. For this reason recent clinical brain research and brain computer interface BCI studies use EEG signals in many applications. Due to the significant noise in EEG traces signal processing to enhance the signal to noise power ratio SNR is necessary for EEG analysis especially for non-invasive EEG. A typical method to improve the SNR is averaging many trials of event related potential ERP signal that represents a brains response to a particular stimulus or a task. The averaging however is very sensitive to variable delays. In this study we propose two time delay estimation TDE schemes based on a joint maximum likelihood ML criterion to compensate the uncertain delays which may be different in each trial. We evaluate the performance for different types of signals such as random deterministic and real EEG signals. The results show that the proposed schemes provide better performance than other conventional schemes employing averaged signal as a reference e.g. up to 4 dB gain at the expected delay error of 10."
