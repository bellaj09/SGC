"To improve surgical practice there are several different approaches to simulation. Due to wearable technologies recording 3D movies is now easy. The development of a virtual reality headset allows imagining a different way of watching these videos: using dedicated software to increase interactivity in a 3D immersive experience. The objective was to record 3D movies via a main surgeons perspective to watch files using virtual reality headsets and to validate pedagogic interest."
