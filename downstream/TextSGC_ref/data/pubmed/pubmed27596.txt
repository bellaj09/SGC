Although peripheral nerve stimulation using intraneural electrodes has been shown to be an effective and reliable solution to restore sensory feedback after hand loss there have been no reports on the characterization of multi-channel stimulation. A deeper understanding of how the simultaneous stimulation of multiple electrode channels affects the evoked\xa0sensations should help in improving the definition of encoding strategies for bidirectional prostheses. We characterized the sensations evoked by simultaneous stimulation of median and ulnar nerves multi-channel configuration in four transradial amputees who had been implanted with four TIMEs Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes. The results were compared with the characterization of single-channel stimulation. The sensations were characterized in terms of location extent type and intensity. Combining two or more single-channel configurations caused a linear combination of the sensation locations and types perceived with such single-channel stimulations. Interestingly this was also true when two active sites from the same nerve were stimulated. When stimulating in multi-channel configuration the charge needed from each electrode channel to evoke a sensation was significantly lower than the one needed in single-channel configuration sensory facilitation. This result was also supported by electroencephalography EEG recordings during nerve stimulation. Somatosensory potentials evoked by multi-channel stimulation confirmed that sensations in the amputated hand were perceived by the subjects and that a perceptual sensory facilitation occurred. Our results should help the future development of more efficient bidirectional prostheses by providing guidelines for the development of more complex stimulation approaches to effectively restore multiple sensations at the same time.
