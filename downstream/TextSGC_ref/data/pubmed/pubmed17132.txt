Science students leaving undergraduate programs are entering the biotechnology industry where they are presented with issues which require integration of science content. Students find this difficult as through-out their studies most content is limited to a single subdiscipline e.g. biochemistry immunology. In addition students need knowledge of the ethical economic and legal frame work in which the industry operates. This article presents an approach to deliver these outcomes in a collaborative and active learning modality which promotes deep learning. In the model groups of final year undergraduate students form hypothetical biotechnology companies and identify real issues of interest to industry make integrative team decisions use professional level technology and develop appropriate communication skills. The final successful teaching paradigm was based on self reflection observation and student feedback to ensure appropriate attainment of content group work skills and increased confidence in professional decision-making. It is these outcomes which will facilitate life long learning skills a major outcome applicable for all tertiary education. Hypothetical biotechnology companies: A role-playing student centered activity for undergraduate science students.
