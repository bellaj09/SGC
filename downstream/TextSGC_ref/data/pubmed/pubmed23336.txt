Introduction: As deep brain stimulation revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders in the late 80s neuromodulation in the treatment of epilepsy will undoubtedly undergo transformative changes in the years to come with the exponential growth of technological development moving into mainstream practice; the appearance of companies such as Facebook Google Neuralink within the realm of brain-computer interfaces points to this trend.Areas covered: This perspective piece will talk about the history of brain stimulation in epilepsy current-approved treatments technical developments and the future of neurostimulation.Expert opinion: Further understanding of the brain alongside machine learning and innovative technology will be the future of neuromodulation for the treatment of epilepsy. All of these innovations and advances should pave the way toward overcoming the vexing underutilization of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium against medically refractory seizures given the implicit advantage of a neuromodulatory rather than neurodestructive approach. Perspectives on the current developments with neuromodulation for the treatment of epilepsy.
