"Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration EBUS-TBNA is very operator dependent and has a long learning curve. Simulation-based training might shorten the learning curve and an assessment tool with solid validity evidence could ensure basic competency before unsupervised performance.A total of 16 respiratory physicians without EBUS experience were randomised to either virtual-reality simulator training or traditional apprenticeship training on patients and then each physician performed EBUS-TBNA procedures on three patients. Three blinded independent assessor assessed the video recordings of the procedures using a newly developed EBUS assessment tool EBUSAT.The internal consistency was high Cronbachs =0.95; the generalisability coefficient was good 0.86 and the tool had discriminatory ability p<0.001. Procedures performed by simulator-trained novices were rated higher than procedures performed by apprenticeship-trained novices: meansd are 24.27.9 points and 20.29.4 points respectively; p=0.006. A pass/fail standard of 28.9 points was established using the contrasting groups method resulting in 16 67% and 20 83% procedures performed by simulator-trained novices and apprenticeship-trained novices failing the test respectively; p<0.001.The endobronchial ultrasound assessment tool could be used to provide reliable and valid assessment of competence in EBUS-TBNA and act as an aid in certification. Virtual-reality simulator training was shown to be more effective than traditional apprenticeship training." Simulator training for endobronchial ultrasound: a randomised controlled trial.
