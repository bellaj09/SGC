The pontine parabrachial nucleus is considered to be one of the most critical regions for the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion which is an associative learning of taste and illness. To further clarify the possible involvement of the parabrachial nucleus in conditioned taste aversion we recorded neuronal responses to taste stimuli from the parabrachial nucleus of rats under deep urethane anaesthesia. Animals were separated into two groups: the conditioned taste aversion group that had acquired a taste aversion to 0.1 M NaCl conditioned stimulus after paired presentations of the taste stimulus with intraperitoneal injection of LiCl unconditioned stimulus and the control group that had received only the unconditioned stimulus before experiments. Taste-responsive neurons in the conditioned taste aversion group showed larger responses to NaCl at below 0.1 M but similar responses to 0.3 M and 0.5 M NaCl when compared with those in the control group. Furthermore hierarchical cluster analyses revealed a strong similarity among responses to sodium salts in neurons of the conditioned taste aversion group compared with the control group. These results suggest that the aversive conditioning to NaCl modified parabrachial units so that the sodium taste was more salient than other tastes. This modification may reflect a long-term plastic change persisting without support of forebrain structures and would facilitate the gustatory discrimination of the conditioned stimulus which is required by conditioned animals.
