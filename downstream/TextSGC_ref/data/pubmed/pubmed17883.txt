Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia bvFTD its most common subtype is characterized by deep alterations in behavior and personality. In 2011 new diagnostic criteria were suggested that incorporate imaging criteria into diagnostic algorithms. The study aimed at validating the potential of imaging criteria to individually predict diagnosis with machine learning algorithms. Predicting behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia with pattern classification in multi-center structural MRI data.
