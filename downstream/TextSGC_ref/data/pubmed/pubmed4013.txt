Slow-adapting type I SA-I afferents deliver sensory signals to the somatosensory cortex during low-frequency or static mechanical stimulation. It has been reported that the somatosensory projection from SA-I afferents is effective and reliable for object grasping and manipulation. Despite a large number of neuroimaging studies on cortical activation responding to tactile stimuli mediated by SA-I afferents how sensory information of such tactile stimuli flows over the somatosensory cortex remains poorly understood. In this study we investigated tactile information processing of pressure stimuli between the primary SI and secondary SII somatosensory cortices by measuring effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling DCM. We applied pressure stimuli for 3 s to the right index fingertip of healthy participants and acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data using a 3T MRI system.
