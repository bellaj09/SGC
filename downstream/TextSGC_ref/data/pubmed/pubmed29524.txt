Novel paired associative stimulation novel-PAS delivered by pairing movement-related cortical potentials MRCPs with electrical stimulation of somatosensory afferents is an innovative neuromodulatory intervention. Novel-PAS results in increased corticomotor excitability and has potential as a rehabilitative adjunct to improve outcomes following stroke. The duration of its excitatory effect has important implications for how this novel PAS intervention might be applied within a traditional therapy session but previous research has not explored its effects beyond 30 min post-intervention.
