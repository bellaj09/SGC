With the aim of transitioning functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS technology from the laboratory environment to everyday applications the field has seen a recent push toward the development of wearable/miniaturized multiwavelength multidistance and modular instruments. However it is challenging to unite all these requirements in a precision instrument with low noise low drift and fast sampling characteristics. We present the concept and development of a wearable fNIRS instrument that combines all these key features with the goal of reliably and accurately capturing brain hemodynamics. The proposed instrument consists of a modular network of miniaturized optode modules that include a four-wavelength light source and a highly sensitive silicon photomultiplier detector. Simultaneous measurements with short-separation 7.5\xa0mm; containing predominantly extracerebral signals and long-separation 20\xa0mm or more; containing both extracerebral and cerebral information channels are used with short-channel regression filtering methods to increase robustness of fNIRS measurements. Performance of the instrument was characterized with phantom measurements and further validated in human in vivo measurements demonstrating the good raw signal quality signal-to-noise ratio of 64\xa0dB for short channels; robust measurements up to 50\xa0mm; dynamic optical range larger than 160\xa0dB the valid estimation of concentration changes oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and cytochrome-c-oxidase in muscle and brain and the detection of task-evoked brain activity. The results of our preliminary tests suggest that the presented fNIRS instrument outperforms existing instruments in many aspects and bears high potential for real-time single-trial fNIRS applications as required for wearable brain-computer interfaces.
