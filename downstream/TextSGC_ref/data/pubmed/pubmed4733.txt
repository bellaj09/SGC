An important early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\s disease AD is the aberrant polymerization and extracellular accumulation of amyloid- peptide A. In young transgenic mice expressing the human A-precursor protein APP deposits of A can be induced by the inoculation of minute amounts of brain extract containing A aggregates "A seeds" indicative of a prion-like seeding phenomenon. Moreover focal intracerebral injection of A seeds can induce deposits not only in the immediate vicinity of the injection site but with time also in distal regions of the brain. However it remains uncertain whether the spatial progression of A deposits occurs via nonsystematic diffusion from the injection site to proximal regions or via directed transit along neuroanatomical pathways. To address this question we analyzed the spatiotemporal emergence of A deposits in two different APP-transgenic mouse models that had been previously inoculated with A seeds into the hippocampal formation. The results revealed a specific neuroanatomically constrained pattern of induced A deposits in structures corresponding to the limbic connectome supporting the hypothesis that neuronal pathways act as conduits for the movement of proteopathic agents among brain regions thereby facilitating the progression of disease.
