We have previously proposed temporal enhanced ultrasound TeUS as a new paradigm for tissue characterization. TeUS is based on analyzing a sequence of ultrasound data with deep learning and has been demonstrated to be successful for detection of cancer in ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Our aim is to enable the dissemination of this technology to the community for large-scale clinical validation. Toward a real-time system for temporal enhanced ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.
