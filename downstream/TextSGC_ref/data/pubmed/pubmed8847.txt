"In tomographic reconstruction the image quality of the reconstructed images can be significantly degraded by defects in the measured two-dimensional 2D raw image data. Despite the importance of screening defective 2D images for robust tomographic reconstruction manual inspection and rule-based automation suffer from low-throughput and insufficient accuracy respectively. Here we present deep learning-enabled quality control for holographic data to produce robust and high-throughput optical diffraction tomography ODT. The key idea is to distil the knowledge of an expert into a deep convolutional neural network. We built an extensive database of optical field images with clean/noisy annotations and then trained a binary-classification network based upon the data. The trained network outperformed visual inspection by non-expert users and a widely used rule-based algorithm with >90% test accuracy. Subsequently we confirmed that the superior screening performance significantly improved the tomogram quality. To further confirm the trained models performance and generalisability we evaluated it on unseen biological cell data obtained with a setup that was not used to generate the training dataset. Lastly we interpreted the trained model using various visualisation techniques that provided the saliency map underlying each model inference. We envision the proposed network would a powerful lightweight module in the tomographic reconstruction pipeline." Deep learning-based optical field screening for robust optical diffraction tomography.
