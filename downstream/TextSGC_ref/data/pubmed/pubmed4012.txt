The study on structural brain asymmetries in healthy individuals plays an important role in our understanding of the factors that modulate cognitive specialization in the brain. Here we used fiber tractography to reconstruct the left and right hemispheric networks of a large cohort of 346 healthy participants 20-86 years and performed a graph theoretical analysis to investigate this brain laterality from a network perspective. Findings revealed that the left hemisphere is significantly more "efficient" than the right hemisphere whereas the right hemisphere showed higher values of "betweenness centrality" and "small-worldness." In particular left-hemispheric networks displayed increased nodal efficiency in brain regions related to language and motor actions whereas the right hemisphere showed an increase in nodal efficiency in brain regions involved in memory and visuospatial attention. In addition we found that hemispheric networks decrease in efficiency with age. Finally we observed significant gender differences in measures of global connectivity. By analyzing the structural hemispheric brain networks we have provided new insights into understanding the neuroanatomical basis of lateralized brain functions.
