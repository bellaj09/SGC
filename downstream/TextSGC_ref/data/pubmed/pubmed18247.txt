Conventional head-mounted displays present different images to each eye and thereby create three-dimensional 3D sensation for viewers. This method can only control the stimulus to vergence but not accommodation which is located at the apparent location of the physical displays. The disrupted coupling between vergence and accommodation could cause considerable visual discomfort. To address this problem in this paper a novel multi-focal plane 3D display system is proposed. A stack of switchable liquid crystal Pancharatnam-Berry phase lenses is implemented to create real depths for each eye which is able to provide approximate focus cue and relieve the discomfort from vergence-accommodation conflict. The proposed multi-focal plane generation method has great potential for both virtual reality and augmented reality applications where correct focus cue is highly desirable.
