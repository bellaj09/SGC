Patient education for external beam radiation therapy EBRT is traditionally delivered in verbal and/or written form which may not provide a full picture of the complex technical aspects of treatment. The purpose of this pilot study was to create and evaluate a prototype 360-degree virtual reality VR video outlining the technical aspects of EBRT to the pelvis as a supplement to traditional education methods.
