"There is currently a pressing need for safe reliable cost-effective methods of evaluating driving ability. With recent improvements in virtual reality technology driving simulators seem to offer a promising alternative to on-road methods of driving assessment. One population at risk for driving difficulties may be veterans returning from combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. The use of driving simulators to evaluate and remediate veterans abilities to operate a motor vehicle is a rehabilitative goal. However there are no consistent standardized procedures for determining safe from unsafe driving using driving simulators which limit the clinical utility of this important tool. The purposes of this article are 1 to give the reader a better understanding of the parameters that are most commonly measured in the driving simulation literature and 2 to review parameters that are most relevant for the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran population." A review of driving simulator parameters relevant to the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran population.
