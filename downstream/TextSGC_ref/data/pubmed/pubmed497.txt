Our coalition of public health experts doctors and scientists worldwide want to draw attention to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine HCQ as a post-exposure drug for exposed people meaning people with close contact with positive tested patients including home and medical caregivers. We have reviewed the mechanisms of antiviral effect of HCQ the risk-benefit ratio taking into consideration the PK/PD of HCQ and the thresholds of efficacy. We have studied its use as an antimalarial an antiviral and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at does matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight 23 at 6\u202fmg/kg/day 1 loading dose followed by 5\u202fmg/kg/day with a maximum limit of 600\u202fmg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people. Coalition: Advocacy for prospective clinical trials to test the post-exposure potential of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19.
