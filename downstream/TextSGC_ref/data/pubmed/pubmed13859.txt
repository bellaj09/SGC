"Deep learning DL algorithms hold great promise for applications in the field of computational biophysics. In fact the vast amount of available molecular structures as well as their notable complexity constitutes an ideal context in which DL-based approaches can be profitably employed. To express the full potential of these techniques though it is a prerequisite to express the information contained in a molecules atomic positions and distances in a set of input quantities that the network can process. Many of the molecular descriptors devised so far are effective and manageable for relatively small structures but become complex and cumbersome for larger ones. Furthermore most of them are defined locally a feature that could represent a limit for those applications where global properties are of interest. Here we build a DL architecture capable of predicting non-trivial and intrinsically global quantities that is the eigenvalues of a proteins lowest-energy fluctuation modes. This application represents a first relatively simple test bed for the development of a neural network approach to the quantitative analysis of protein structures and demonstrates unexpected use in the identification of mechanically relevant regions of the molecule."
