Auralizations have become more prevalent in architectural acoustics and virtual reality. Studies have shown that by employing a methodical calibration procedure ecologically/perceptually valid auralizations can be obtained. Another study demonstrated a manner to include dynamic voice directivity with results indicating these auralizations were judged significantly more plausible than auralizations with static source orientations. With the increased plausibility of auralizations it is possible to study room-acoustic experience employing virtual reality having confidence that the results also apply to real-life situations. Limited studies have examined the influence of visuals on room-acoustic experience. Using a virtual reality framework this study investigated the influence of visuals on the room-acoustic experience of auralizations. Evaluations compared dynamic voice auralizations coherently matched with visualization positions to incoherently matched audio-visual pairs. Based on the results the test population could be divided into three subgroups: 1 those who judged auralizations more acoustically distant with increased visual distance 2 those who judged auralizations louder with increased visual distance and 3 those whose audio judgment was uninfluenced by the visual stimulus. The influence of visual distance on the room-acoustic experience of auralizations.
