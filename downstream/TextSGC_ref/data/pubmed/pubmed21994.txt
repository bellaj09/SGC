Regarding to the channel selection problem during the classification of electroencephalogramEEGsignalswe proposed a novel methodRelief-SBSin this paper.Firstlythe proposed method performed EEG channel selection by combining the principles of Relief and sequential backward selectionSBSalgorithms.And then correlation coefficient was used for classification of EEG signals.The selected channels that achieved optimal classification accuracy were considered as optimal channels.The data recorded from motor imagery task experiments were analyzedand the results showed that the channels selected with our proposed method achieved excellent classification accuracyand also outperformed other feature selection methods.In additionthe distribution of the optimal channels was proved to be consistent with the neurophysiological knowledge.This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.It can be well concluded that our proposed methodRelief-SBSprovides a new way for channel selection. A Novel Channel Selection Method for Brain-computer Interface Based on Relief-SBS.
