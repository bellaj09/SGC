The Chinese philosophy of Confucianism said "What I heard I forgot what I see I remember what I do I understand." During this time most of the teaching and learning process relies on viewing and listening modalities only. As a result much information does not last long in memory as well as the material understanding achieves became less deep. In studying anatomy science drawing is one of effective important methods because it is an integration of ideas and knowledge of vision thereby increasing comprehension and learning motivation of college students. The purpose of this research is to know the musculoskeletal anatomy comprehension by drawing learning method in Medical Faculty student. This research uses observational analytic design with the cross-sectional design. Total sampling was done to the entire student of Physiotherapy Study Program in 2012 2013 and 2014 Medical Faculty of Udayana University. The average value of musculoskeletal anatomy of the student in 2012 2013 and 2014 sequentially are 31.67 33.57 and 45.00 respectively. Normality test with Shapiro-Wilk and homogeneity with Levene\s test showed normal results and homogeneous. One-way ANOVA test between groups showed a significant result that is 11.00 P<0.05. It is concluded that the drawing method can improve the musculoskeletal anatomy comprehension in Medical Faculty student. Drawing method can improve musculoskeletal anatomy comprehension in medical faculty student.
