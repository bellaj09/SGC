"The pineal gland has a deep central location making it a surgeons no mans land. Surgical pathology within this territory presents a unique challenge and an opportunity for employment of various surgical techniques. In modern times the microsurgical technique has been competing with the endoscope for achieving superior surgical results. We describe two cases utilizing a purely endoscopic and an endoscopic-assisted supracerebellar infratentorial approach in accessing lesions of the pineal gland. We also discuss our early learning experience with these approaches."
