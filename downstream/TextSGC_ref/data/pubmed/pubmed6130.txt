Task-based fMRI tfMRI has been widely used to explore functional brain networks via predefined stimulus paradigm in the fMRI scan. Traditionally the general linear model GLM has been a dominant approach to detect task-evoked networks. However GLM focuses on task-evoked or event-evoked brain responses and possibly ignores the intrinsic brain functions. In comparison dictionary learning and sparse coding methods have attracted much attention recently and these methods have shown the promise of automatically and systematically decomposing fMRI signals into meaningful task-evoked and intrinsic concurrent networks. Nevertheless two notable limitations of current data-driven dictionary learning method are that the prior knowledge of task paradigm is not sufficiently utilized and that the establishment of correspondences among dictionary atoms in different brains have been challenging. In this paper we propose a novel supervised dictionary learning and sparse coding method for inferring functional networks from tfMRI data which takes both of the advantages of model-driven method and data-driven method. The basic idea is to fix the task stimulus curves as predefined model-driven dictionary atoms and only optimize the other portion of data-driven dictionary atoms. Application of this novel methodology on the publicly available human connectome project HCP tfMRI datasets has achieved promising results.
