For many pedestrian detectors background vs. foreground errors heavily influence the detection quality. Our main contribution is to design semantic regions of interest that extract the foreground target roughly to reduce the background vs. foreground errors of detectors. First we generate a pedestrian heat map from the input image with a full convolutional neural network trained on the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset. Next semantic regions of interest are extracted from the heat map by morphological image processing. Finally the semantic regions of interest divide the whole image into foreground and background to assist the decision-making of detectors. We test our approach on the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark. With the help of our semantic regions of interest the effects of the detectors have varying degrees of improvement. The best one exceeds the state-of-the-art. Pedestrian Detection with Semantic Regions of Interest.
