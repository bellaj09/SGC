"A World Health Organization WHO Feb 2018 report has recently shown that mortality rate due to brain or central nervous system CNS cancer is the highest in the Asian continent. It is of critical importance that cancer be detected earlier so that many of these lives can be saved. Cancer grading is an important aspect for targeted therapy. As cancer diagnosis is highly invasive time consuming and expensive there is an immediate requirement to develop a non-invasive cost-effective and efficient tools for brain cancer characterization and grade estimation. Brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT as well as other imaging modalities are fast and safer methods for tumor detection. In this paper we tried to summarize the pathophysiology of brain cancer imaging modalities of brain cancer and automatic computer assisted methods for brain cancer characterization in a machine and deep learning paradigm. Another objective of this paper is to find the current issues in existing engineering methods and also project a future paradigm. Further we have highlighted the relationship between brain cancer and other brain disorders like stroke Alzheimers Parkinsons and Wilsons disease leukoriaosis and other neurological disorders in the context of machine learning and the deep learning paradigm."
