In mobile augmented/virtual reality AR/VR real-time 6-Degree of Freedom DoF motion tracking is essential for the registration between virtual scenes and the real world. However due to the limited computational capacity of mobile terminals today the latency between consecutive arriving poses would damage the user experience in mobile AR/VR. Thus a visual-inertial based real-time motion tracking for mobile AR/VR is proposed in this paper. By means of high frequency and passive outputs from the inertial sensor the real-time performance of arriving poses for mobile AR/VR is achieved. In addition to alleviate the jitter phenomenon during the visual-inertial fusion an adaptive filter framework is established to cope with different motion situations automatically enabling the real-time 6-DoF motion tracking by balancing the jitter and latency. Besides the robustness of the traditional visual-only based motion tracking is enhanced giving rise to a better mobile AR/VR performance when motion blur is encountered. Finally experiments are carried out to demonstrate the proposed method and the results show that this work is capable of providing a smooth and robust 6-DoF motion tracking for mobile AR/VR in real-time.
