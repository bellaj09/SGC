To test the feasibility of implementing multisensory auditory and visual stimulation in combination with electrodes placed on non-hair positions to design more efficient and comfortable Brain-computer interfaces BCI. Fifteen volunteers participated in the experiments. They were stimulated by visual auditory and multisensory stimuli set at 37 38 39 and 40Hz and at different phases 0 90 180 and 270. The electroencephalogram EEG was measured from Oz T7 T8 Tp9 and Tp10 positions. To evaluate the amplitude of the visual and auditory evoked potentials the signal-to-noise ratio SNR was used and the accuracy of detection was calculated using canonical correlation analysis. Additionally the volunteers were asked about the discomfort of each kind of stimulus. The multisensory stimulation allows for attaining higher SNR on every electrode. Non-hair Tp9 and Tp10 positions attained SNR and accuracy similar to the ones obtained from occipital positions on visual stimulation. No significant difference was found on the discomfort produced by each kind of stimulation. The results demonstrated that multisensory stimulation can help in obtaining high amplitude steady-state evoked responses with a similar discomfort level. Then it is possible to design a more efficient and comfortable hybrid-BCI based on multisensory stimulation and electrodes on non-hair positions. The current article proposes a new paradigm for hybrid-BCI based on steady-state evoked potentials measured from the area behind-the-ears and elicited by multisensory stimulation thus allowing subjects to achieve similar performance to the one achieved by visual-occipital BCI but measuring the EEG on a more comfortable electrode location.
