The internalizing psychopathologies IP are a highly prevalent group of disorders for which little data exists to guide treatment selection. We examine whether graph theoretical metrics from white matter connectomes may serve as biomarkers of disease and predictors of treatment response. We focus on the uncinate fasciculus subnetwork which has been previously implicated in these disorders. We compared baseline graph measures from a transdiagnostic IP cohort with controls. Patients were randomized to either SSRI or cognitive behavioral therapy and we determined if graph theory metrics change following treatment and whether these changes correlated with treatment response. Lastly we investigated whether baseline metrics correlated with treatment response. Several baseline nodal graph metrics differed at baseline. Of note right amygdala betweenness centrality was increased in patients relative to controls. In addition white matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus was decreased at baseline in patients versus controls. The SSRI and CBT cohorts had increased left frontal superior orbital betweenness centrality and left frontal medial orbital clustering coefficient respectively suggesting the presence of treatment specific neural correlates of treatment response. This study provides insight on shared white matter network features of IPs and elucidates potential biomarkers of treatment response that may be modality-specific. Graph theoretical measures of the uncinate fasciculus subnetwork as predictors and correlates of treatment response in a transdiagnostic psychiatric cohort.
