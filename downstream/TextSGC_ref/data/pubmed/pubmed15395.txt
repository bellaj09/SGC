Accurate and standardized descriptions of organs at risk OARs are essential in radiation therapy for treatment planning and evaluation. Traditionally physicians have contoured patient images manually which is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. This study aims to a investigate whether customized deep-learning-based auto-segmentation could overcome the limitations of manual contouring and b compare its performance against a typical atlas-based auto-segmentation method organ structures in liver cancer. Comparative clinical evaluation of atlas and deep-learning-based auto-segmentation of organ structures in liver cancer.
