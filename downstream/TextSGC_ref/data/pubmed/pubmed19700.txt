Slip training is gaining popularity as an innovative fall intervention approach. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different slip training modality moveable platform and virtual reality in reducing fall frequency and improving reactive recovery in older adults. Thirty-six healthy older adults were involved in a laboratory study and were equally and randomly divided into the control group the moveable platform training MPT group and the virtual reality training VRT group. The MPT was achieved by inducing slips using a custom built sliding device consisting of a low friction motorized moveable platform. The VRT was conducted by inducing visual perturbation in a head mounted display while subjects walked on a treadmill. All groups performed slip trials kinematics kinetics and EMG data were collected on an actual slippery floor surface before and after a training session. The results indicated a significant reduction in fall frequency in both training groups. Between MPT and VRT groups significant differences were also found in forward trunk rotations peak knee angular velocity ankle coactivity and muscular activity in tibialis anterior. It was concluded that slip training in VR environment could produce comparable results in fall intervention. Comparison of Slip Training in VR Environment And on Moveable Platform.
