"In the past decade diabetes management has been transformed by the addition of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump data. More recently a wide variety of functions and physiologic variables such as heart rate hours of sleep number of steps walked and movement have been available through wristbands or watches. New data hydration geolocation and barometric pressure among others will be incorporated in the future. All these parameters when analyzed can be helpful for patients and doctors decision support. Similar new scenarios have appeared in most medical fields in such a way that in recent years there has been an increased interest in the development and application of the methods of artificial intelligence AI to decision support and knowledge acquisition. Multidisciplinary research teams integrated by computer engineers and doctors are more and more frequent mirroring the need of cooperation in this new topic. AI as a science can be defined as the ability to make computers do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. Increasingly diabetes-related journals have been incorporating publications focused on AI tools applied to diabetes. In summary diabetes management scenarios have suffered a deep transformation that forces diabetologists to incorporate skills from new areas. This recently needed knowledge includes AI tools which have become part of the diabetes health care. The aim of this article is to explain in an easy and plane way the most used AI methodologies to promote the implication of health care providers-doctors and nurses-in this field."
