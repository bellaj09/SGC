Despite the benefits highlighted by motor interventions based on virtual reality for children with Developmental Coordination Disorder DCD there are still doubts as to whether these are greater than those obtained with conventional interventions due to the absence of systematized protocols and lack of evidence.

Motor intervention with and without Nintendo Wii for children with developmental coordination disorder: protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
