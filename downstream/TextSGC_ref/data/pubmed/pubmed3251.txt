Primate studies indicate that the pyramidal tract PyT could originate from Brodmann area BA 6. However in humans the accurate origin of PyT from BA 6 is still uncertain owing to difficulties in visualizing anatomical features such as the fanning shape at the corona radiata and multiple crossings at the semioval centrum. High angular-resolution diffusion imaging HARDI could reliably replicate these anatomical features. We explored the origin of the human PyT from BA 6 using HARDI. With HARDI data of 30 adults from the Massachusetts General Hospital-Human Connectome Project MGH-HCP database and the HCP 1021 template average of 1021 HCP diffusion data we visualized the PyT at the 30-averaged group level and the 1021 large-sample level and validated the observations in each of the individuals. Endpoints of the fibers within each subregion were quantified. PyT fibers originating from the BA 6 were consistently visualized in all images. Specifically the bilateral supplementary motor area SMA and dorsal premotor area dPMA were consistently found to contribute to the PyT. PyT fibers from BA 6 and those from BA 4 exhibited a twisting topology. The PyT contains fibers originating from the SMA and dPMA in BA 6. Infarction of these regions or aging would result in incomplete provision of information to the PyT and concomitant decreases in motor planning and coordination abilities.
