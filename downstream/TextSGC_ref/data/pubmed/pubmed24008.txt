The larval brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a small tractable model system for neuroscience. Genes for fluorescent marker proteins can be expressed in defined spatially restricted neuron populations. Here we introduce the methods for 1 generating a standard template of the larval central nervous system CNS 2 spatial mapping of expression patterns from different larvae into a reference space defined by the standard template. We provide a manually annotated gold standard that serves for evaluation of the registration framework involved in template generation and mapping. A method for registration quality assessment enables the automatic detection of registration errors and a semi-automatic registration method allows one to correct registrations which is a prerequisite for a high-quality curated database of expression patterns. All computational methods are available within the larvalign software package: https://github.com/larvalign/larvalign/releases/tag/v1.0. larvalign: Aligning Gene Expression Patterns from the Larval Brain of Drosophila melanogaster.
