One of the main limitations preventing the realization of a successful dialogue between the brain and a putative enabling device is the intricacy of brain signals. In this perspective closed-loop in vitro systems can be used to investigate the interactions between a network of neurons and an external system such as an interacting environment or an artificial device. In this chapter we provide an overview of closed-loop in vitro systems which have been developed for investigating potential neuroprosthetic applications. In particular we first explore how to modify or set a target dynamical behavior in a network of neurons. We then analyze the behavior of in vitro systems connected to artificial devices such as robots. Finally we provide an overview of biological neuronal networks interacting with artificial neuronal networks a configuration currently offering a promising solution for clinical applications.
