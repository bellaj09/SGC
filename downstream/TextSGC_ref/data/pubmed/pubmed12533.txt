Single-pixel cameras capture images without the requirement for a multi-pixel sensor enabling the use of state-of-the-art detector technologies and providing a potentially low-cost solution for sensing beyond the visible spectrum. One limitation of single-pixel cameras is the inherent trade-off between image resolution and frame rate with current compressive compressed sensing techniques being unable to support real-time video. In this work we demonstrate the application of deep learning with convolutional auto-encoder networks to recover real-time 128\u2009\u2009128 pixel video at 30 frames-per-second from a single-pixel camera sampling at a compression ratio of 2%. In addition by training the network on a large database of images we are able to optimise the first layer of the convolutional network equivalent to optimising the basis used for scanning the image intensities. This work develops and implements a novel approach to solving the inverse problem for single-pixel cameras efficiently and represents a significant step towards real-time operation of computational imagers. By learning from examples in a particular context our approach opens up the possibility of high resolution for task-specific adaptation with importance for applications in gas sensing 3D imaging and metrology.
