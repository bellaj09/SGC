"Reliable real-time low-latency spike sorting with large data throughput is essential for studies of neural network dynamics and for brain-machine interfaces BMIs in which the stimulation of neural networks is based on the networks most recent activity. However the majority of existing multi-electrode spike-sorting algorithms are unsuited for processing high quantities of simultaneously recorded data. Recording from large neuronal networks using large high-density electrode sets thousands of electrodes imposes high demands on the data-processing hardware regarding computational complexity and data transmission bandwidth; this in turn entails demanding requirements in terms of chip area memory resources and processing latency. This paper presents computational complexity optimization techniques which facilitate the use of spike-sorting algorithms in large multi-electrode-based recording systems. The techniques are then applied to a previously published algorithm on its own unsuited for large electrode set recordings. Further a real-time low-latency high-performance VLSI hardware architecture of the modified algorithm is presented featuring a folded structure capable of processing the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously. The hardware is reconfigurable on-the-fly and adaptable to the nonstationarities of neuronal recordings. By transmitting exclusively spike time stamps and/or spike waveforms its real-time processing offers the possibility of data bandwidth and data storage reduction."
