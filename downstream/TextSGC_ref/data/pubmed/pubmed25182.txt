The management of lymphatic malformations LMs is challenging particularly for large and complex lesions involving anatomical structures in the adjacent tissue. While lymphovenous anastomosis LVA has been reported as an effective treatment for lymphedema it has hardly been described as a treatment for LM. Virtual reality has the ability to visualize human structures in three dimensions and can be used for the preoperative planning of complex cases. Here we describe the first case of the management of an LM by LVA preoperatively planned with virtual reality. A young woman presented with an LM previously treated by gross excision. Following persistent complaints of swelling a minimally invasive microsurgical intervention was planned. The results of the single photon emission tomography with computed tomography SPECT-CT and lymphoscintigraphy were analyzed using a virtual reality program and a 3D patient-specific model was constructed. Based on the combined findings of this 3D model and lymphography with a fluorescent marker a precise skin incision could be determined and one lymph vessel was anastomosed to a nearby vein. The swelling of the thigh reduced and the discomfort disappeared. Although more reports are needed to confirm its efficacy LVA planned with virtual reality constructed images appears to be a valuable treatment option for complex lesions including LMs. The Application of Virtual Reality for Preoperative Planning of Lymphovenous Anastomosis in a Patient with a Complex Lymphatic Malformation.
