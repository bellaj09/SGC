Gaze-independent brain computer interfaces BCIs are a potential communication tool for persons with paralysis. This study applies affective auditory stimuli to investigate their effects using a P300 BCI. Fifteen able-bodied participants operated the P300 BCI with positive and negative affective sounds PA: a meowing cat sound NA: a screaming cat sound. Permuted stimuli of the positive and negative affective sounds permuted-PA permuted-NA were also used for comparison. Electroencephalography data was collected and offline classification accuracies were compared. We used a visual analog scale VAS to measure positive and negative affective feelings in the participants. The mean classification accuracies were 84.7% for PA and 67.3% for permuted-PA while the VAS scores were 58.5 for PA and -12.1 for permuted-PA. The positive affective stimulus showed significantly higher accuracy and VAS scores than the negative affective stimulus. In contrast mean classification accuracies were 77.3% for NA and 76.0% for permuted-NA while the VAS scores were -50.0 for NA and -39.2 for permuted NA which are not significantly different. We determined that a positive affective stimulus with accompanying positive affective feelings significantly improved BCI accuracy. Additionally an ALS patient achieved 90% online classification accuracy. These results suggest that affective stimuli may be useful for preparing a practical auditory BCI system for patients with disabilities.
