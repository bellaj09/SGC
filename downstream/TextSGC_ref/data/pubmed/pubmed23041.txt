The use of virtual reality in the form of simulated tasks can provide a realistic environment in which to study complex naturalistic behaviors. Many of the behavioral effects of alcohol intoxication are well known but there is relatively little imaging evidence examining how alcohol exposure might transiently modulate brain function especially in the context of task performance. In this review we provide a brief synopsis of previous work using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to study the neural correlates of alcohol intoxication. We describe in detail two studies from our published work the first involving a visual perception paradigm and the second involving virtual reality through a naturalistic behavior; simulated driving. Participants received single-blind individualized doses of beverage alcohol designed to produce blood alcohol content BAC of 0.04 and 0.08 or placebo. Subjects were fMRI scanned after training to asymptote performance. In both studies we found specific circuits that were differentially modulated by alcohol we revealed both global and local effects of alcohol and we examined relationships between behavior brain function and alcohol blood levels. Using virtual reality to study alcohol intoxication effects on the neural correlates of simulated driving.
