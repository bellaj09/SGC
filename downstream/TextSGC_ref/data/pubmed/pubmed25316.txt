"J. A. Grays 1975 theory distinguishes between two motivational systems which he refers to as the behavioral activation system BAS and the behavioral inhibition system BIS. D. C. Fowles 1980 has shown that heart rate responses reflect activity of the BAS and electrodermal responses reflect activity of the BIS. Both BAS and BIS are reliably activated during in-vivo exposure to fearful situations F. H. Wilhelm & W. T. Roth 1998. However due to the constraints imposed by virtual reality VR we hypothesized that VR exposure to fearful situations would activate the BIS alone. To test this hypothesis a VR free-standing elevator simulation was presented to participants selected for high and low fear of heights. As predicted the high-anxious group strongly responded electrodermally effect size d = 1.53 but showed only minimal HR elevations during exposure d = 0.12 and little other cardiovascular or respiratory changes. The low-anxious control group showed little electrodermal and HR reactivity d = 0.28 and 0.12. A comparison with data from a previous study demonstrated that this pattern was in stark contrast to the large electrodermal and cardiovascular response observed during situational in-vivo exposure outside the laboratory. We conclude that the BIS but not BAS is selectively activated during VR exposure causing discordance between self-report and commonly used physiological measures of anxiety. Results are discussed within the framework of E. B. Foa & M. J. Kozaks 1986 emotional processing theory of fear modification suggesting different mechanisms underlying VR and in-vivo exposure treatments."
