"Support vector machine SVM-based multivariate pattern analysis MVPA has delivered promising performance in decoding specific task states based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI of the human brain. Conventionally the SVM-MVPA requires careful feature selection/extraction according to expert knowledge. In this study we propose a deep neural network DNN for directly decoding multiple brain task states from fMRI signals of the brain without any burden for feature handcrafts. We trained and tested the DNN classifier using task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Projects S1200 dataset N = 1034. In tests to verify its performance the proposed classification method identified seven tasks with an average accuracy of 93.7%. We also showed the general applicability of the DNN for transfer learning to small datasets N = 43 a situation encountered in typical neuroscience research. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 89.0 and 94.7% on a working memory task and a motor classification task respectively higher than the accuracy of 69.2 and 68.6% obtained by the SVM-MVPA. A network visualization analysis showed that the DNN automatically detected features from areas of the brain related to each task. Without incurring the burden of handcrafting the features the proposed deep decoding method can classify brain task states highly accurately and is a powerful tool for fMRI researchers."
