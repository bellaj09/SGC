In recent years powered by state-of-the-art achievements in a broad range of areas machine learning has received considerable attention from the healthcare sector. Despite their ability to provide solutions within personalized medicine strict regulations on the confidentiality of patient health information have in many cases hindered the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in clinical workflows. To allow for the processing of sensitive health information without disclosing the underlying data we propose a solution based on fully homomorphic encryption FHE. The considered encryption scheme MORE Matrix Operation for Randomization or Encryption enables the computations within a neural network model to be directly performed on floating point data with a relatively small computational overhead. We consider the well-known MNIST digit recognition problem to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method and show that performance does not decrease when deep learning is applied on MORE homomorphic data. To further evaluate the suitability of the method for healthcare applications we first train a model on encrypted data to estimate the outputs of a whole-body circulation WBC hemodynamic model and then provide a solution for classifying encrypted X-ray coronary angiography medical images. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed privacy-preserving deep learning methods to outperform existing approaches by providing within a reasonable amount of time results equivalent to those achieved by unencrypted models. Lastly we discuss the security implications of the encryption scheme and show that while the considered cryptosystem promotes efficiency and utility at a lower security level it is still applicable in certain practical use cases.
