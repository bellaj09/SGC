Appropriate axonal growth and connectivity are essential for functional wiring of the brain. Joubert syndrome-related disorders JSRD a group of ciliopathies in which mutations disrupt primary cilia function are characterized by axonal tract malformations. However little is known about how cilia-driven signaling regulates axonal growth and connectivity. We demonstrate that the deletion of related JSRD genes Arl13b and Inpp5e in projection neurons leads to de-fasciculated and misoriented axonal tracts. Arl13b deletion disrupts the function of its\xa0downstream effector Inpp5e and deregulates ciliary-PI3K/AKT signaling. Chemogenetic activation of ciliary GPCR signaling and cilia-specific optogenetic modulation of downstream second messenger cascades PI3K AKT and AC3 commonly regulated by ciliary signaling receptors induce rapid changes in axonal dynamics. Further Arl13b deletion leads to changes in transcriptional landscape associated with dysregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. These data suggest that ciliary signaling acts to modulate axonal connectivity and that impaired primary cilia signaling underlies axonal tract defects in JSRD. Primary Cilia Signaling Promotes Axonal Tract Development and Is Disrupted in Joubert Syndrome-Related Disorders Models.
