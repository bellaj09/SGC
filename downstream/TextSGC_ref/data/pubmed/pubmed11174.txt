Binding prediction between targets and drug-like compounds through deep neural networks has generated promising results in recent years outperforming traditional machine learning-based methods. However the generalization capability of these classification models is still an issue to be addressed. In this work we explored how different cross-validation strategies applied to data from different molecular databases affect to the performance of binding prediction proteochemometrics models. These strategies are 1 random splitting 2 splitting based on K-means clustering both of actives and inactives 3 splitting based on source database and 4 splitting based both in the clustering and in the source database. These schemas are applied to a deep learning proteochemometrics model and to a simple logistic regression model to be used as baseline. Additionally two different ways of describing molecules in the model are tested: 1 by their SMILES and 2 by three fingerprints. The classification performance of our deep learning-based proteochemometrics model is comparable to the state of the art. Our results show that the lack of generalization of these models is due to a bias in public molecular databases and that a restrictive cross-validation schema based on compound clustering leads to worse but more robust and credible results. Our results also show better performance when representing molecules by their fingerprints. Evaluation of Cross-Validation Strategies in Sequence-Based Binding Prediction Using Deep Learning.
