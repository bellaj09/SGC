One of the ultimate goals of computational neuroscience is to quantitatively connect between complex neural circuits and behaviors. In the past decades the touch response circuit in Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans has extensively been investigated in studies using genetically modified or laser-ablated worms. Synaptic connections including chemical and electrical synapses have been identified for most neurons in the C. elegans. However we still do not know whether the empirically observed touch responses can be derived from connectome reconstructed from databases. To address this issue we defined the transmission abilities or levels of neurons in a rate model in order to infer the behaviors of wild-type and ablated worms in response to posterior/nose/anterior touch stimuli. Our analysis showed that transmission abilities can be used to identify sensorimotor mapping from stimuli to movements and then to infer the C. elegans behaviors under simulations based on the perspective of decision-making and provide useful information about how chemical and electronic synapses should be combined in the neural network movement analysis. This paper reveals an efficient tool that provided insights into the functions of complex neural circuits.
