"Diffusion tensor imaging DTI offers rich insights into the physical characteristics of white matter WM fiber tracts and their development in the brain facilitating a network representation of brains traffic pathways. Such a network representation of brain connectivity has provided a novel means of investigating brain changes arising from pathology development or aging. The high dimensionality of these connectivity networks necessitates the development of methods that identify the connectivity building blocks or sub-network components that characterize the underlying variation in the population. In addition the projection of the subject networks into the basis set provides a low dimensional representation of it that teases apart different sources of variation in the sample facilitating variation-specific statistical analysis. We propose a unified framework of non-negative matrix factorization and graph embedding for learning sub-network patterns of connectivity by their projective non-negative decomposition into a reconstructive basis set as well as additional basis sets representing variational sources in the population like age and pathology. The proposed framework is applied to a study of diffusion-based connectivity in subjects with autism that shows localized sparse sub-networks which mostly capture the changes related to pathology and developmental variations."
