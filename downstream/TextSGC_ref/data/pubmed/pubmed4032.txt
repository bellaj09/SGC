"Representing a phylogenetically old and very basic mechanism of inhibitory neurotransmission glycine receptors have been implicated in the modulation of behavioral components underlying defensive responding toward threat. As one of the first findings being confirmed by genome-wide association studies for the phenotype of panic disorder and agoraphobia allelic variation in a gene coding for the glycine receptor beta subunit GLRB has recently been associated with increased neural fear network activation and enhanced acoustic startle reflexes. On the basis of two independent healthy control samples we here aimed to further explore the functional significance of the GLRB genotype rs7688285 by employing an intermediate phenotype approach. We focused on the phenotype of defensive system reactivity across the levels of brain function structure and physiology. Converging evidence across both samples was found for increased neurofunctional activation in the anterior insular cortex in GLRB risk allele carriers and altered fear conditioning as a function of genotype. The robustness of GLRB effects is demonstrated by consistent findings across different experimental fear conditioning paradigms and recording sites. Altogether findings provide translational evidence for glycine neurotransmission as a modulator of the brains evolutionary old dynamic defensive system and provide further support for a strong biologically plausible candidate intermediate phenotype of defensive reactivity. As such glycine-dependent neurotransmission may open up new avenues for mechanistic research on the etiopathogenesis of fear and anxiety disorders."
