We demonstrate the capability of a convolutional deep neural network in predicting the nearest-neighbor energy of the 44 Ising model. Using its success at this task we motivate the study of the larger 88 Ising model showing that the deep neural network can learn the nearest-neighbor Ising Hamiltonian after only seeing a vanishingly small fraction of configuration space. Additionally we show that the neural network has learned both the energy and magnetization operators with sufficient accuracy to replicate the low-temperature Ising phase transition. We then demonstrate the ability of the neural network to learn other spin models teaching the convolutional deep neural network to accurately predict the long-range interaction of a screened Coulomb Hamiltonian a sinusoidally attenuated screened Coulomb Hamiltonian and a modified Potts model Hamiltonian. In the case of the long-range interaction we demonstrate the ability of the neural network to recover the phase transition with equivalent accuracy to the numerically exact method. Furthermore in the case of the long-range interaction the benefits of the neural network become apparent; it is able to make predictions with a high degree of accuracy and do so 1600 times faster than a CUDA-optimized exact calculation. Additionally we demonstrate how the neural network succeeds at these tasks by looking at the weights learned in a simplified demonstration.
