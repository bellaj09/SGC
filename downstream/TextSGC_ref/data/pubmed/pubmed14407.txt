Many applications in speech robotics finance and biology deal with sequential data where ordering matters and recurrent structures are common. However this structure cannot be easily captured by standard kernel functions. To model such structure we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes. The resulting model GP-LSTM fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory LSTM recurrent networks while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP-LSTM are uniquely valuable.
