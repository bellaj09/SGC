Electroencephalogram EEG provides a non-invasive approach to measure the electrical activities of brain neurons and has long been employed for the development of brain-computer interface BCI. For this purpose various patterns/features of EEG data need to be extracted and associated with specific events like cue-paced motor imagery. However this is a challenging task since EEG data are usually non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio.
