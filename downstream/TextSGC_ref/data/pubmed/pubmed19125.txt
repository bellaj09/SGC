The aims of this research were to examine the effectiveness of feedback FB study of cavity preparation using a virtual reality system VRS and to discuss the evidence from an educational standpoint Thirty-nine dental undergraduate students of the fifth grade of Tokyo Medical and Dental University were randomly divided into the FR group and no-FR group FB group n=21 no-FR group n=18. All subjects of each group performed cavity preparation of class II on the lower left first molar using VRS DentSim four times every week EXO-3. At session EXO all subjects performed a pre-test to assess their basic skill leve. At sessions EX1 and EX2 the FR group received feedback from the instructor based on a computer-assessment system. The no-FR group practiced their self-judgment without any feedback. At the last session EX3 the preparation test was administered. All cavity preparations were graded by the VRS. The results showed that the FR group obtained significantly higher scores than the no-FR group such as total score outline shape outline centralization outline smoothness wall incline wall smoothness proximal clearance and box width. By session EX2 the FR group tended to spend longer preparation time than the no-FR group however at session EX3 there was no difference between both groups. These resdlts confirmed the effectiveness of cavity preparation with feedback study using VRS. It is suggested that this method of learning cavity preparation techniques is suitable for novice undergraduate dental students at the initial stage of cavity preparation practice. The effectiveness of cavity preparation training using a virtual reality simulation system with or without feedback.
