"Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model building because of the small number of samples n compared with the huge amount of features p. This np property has hampered application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution to this issue. Still the problem is very challenging because i there are tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples ii the scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of convolutional neural networks." A graph-embedded deep feedforward network for disease outcome classification and feature selection using gene expression data.
