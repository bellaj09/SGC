While there have been concerted efforts to reform undergraduate biology toward teaching students to organize their conceptual knowledge like experts there are few tools that attempt to measure this. We previously developed the Biology Card Sorting Task BCST designed to probe how individuals organize their conceptual biological knowledge. Previous results showed the BCST could differentiate between different populations namely non-biology majors NBM and biology faculty BF. In this study we administered the BCST to three additional populations using a cross-sectional design: entering biology majors EBM advanced biology majors ABM and biology graduate students BGS. Intriguingly ABM did not initially sort like experts any more frequently than EBM. However once the deep-feature framework was revealed ABM were able to sort like experts more readily than did EBM. These results are consistent with the conclusion that biology education enables advanced biology students to use an expert-like conceptual framework. However these results are also consistent with a process of "selection" wherein students who persist in the major may have already had an expert-like conceptual framework to begin with. These results demonstrate the utility of the BCST in measuring differences between groups of students over the course of their undergraduate education.
