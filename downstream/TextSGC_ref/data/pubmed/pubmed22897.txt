This study determines the expert and referent face validity of LAP Mentor the first procedural virtual-reality VR trainer. After a hands-on introduction to the simulator a questionnaire was administered to 49 participants 21 expert laparoscopists and 28 novices. There was a consensus on LAP Mentor being a valid training model for basic skills training and the procedural training of laparoscopic cholecystectomies. As 88% of respondents saw training on this simulator as effective and 96% experienced this training as fun it will likely be accepted in the surgical curriculum by both experts and trainees. Further validation of the system is required to determine whether its performance concurs with these favourable expectations. Determination of face validity for the Simbionix LAP mentor virtual reality training module.
