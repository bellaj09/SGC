One step toward healthy brain aging may be to entertain a physically active lifestyle. Studies investigating physical activity effects on brain integrity have however mainly been based on single brain markers and few used a multimodal imaging approach. In the present study we used cohort data from the Betula study to examine the relationships between scores reflecting current and accumulated physical activity and brain health. More specifically we first examined if physical activity scores modulated negative effects of age on seven resting state networks previously identified by Salami Pudas and Nyberg 2014. The results revealed that one of the most age-sensitive RSN was positively altered by physical activity namely the posterior default-mode network involving the posterior cingulate cortex PCC. Second within this physical activity-sensitive RSN we further analyzed the association between physical activity and gray matter GM volumes white matter integrity and cerebral perfusion using linear regression models. Regions within the identified DMN displayed larger GM volumes and stronger perfusion in relation to both current and 10-years accumulated scores of physical activity. No associations of physical activity and white matter integrity were observed. Collectively our findings demonstrate strengthened PCC-cortical connectivity within the DMN larger PCC GM volume and higher PCC perfusion as a function of physical activity. In turn these findings may provide insights into the mechanisms of how long-term regular exercise can contribute to healthy brain aging. Physical activity over a decade modifies age-related decline in perfusion gray matter volume and functional connectivity of the posterior default-mode network-A multimodal approach.
