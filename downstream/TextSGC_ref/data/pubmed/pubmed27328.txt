Electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs particularly those using motor-imagery MI data have the potential to become groundbreaking technologies in both clinical and entertainment settings. MI data is generated when a subject imagines the movement of a limb. This paper reviews state-of-the-art signal processing techniques for MI EEG-based BCIs with a particular focus on the feature extraction feature selection and classification techniques used. It also summarizes the main applications of EEG-based BCIs particularly those based on MI data and finally presents a detailed discussion of the most prevalent challenges impeding the development and commercialization of EEG-based BCIs.
