Brain-computer interface BCI is a useful device for people with severe motor disabilities. However due to its low speed and low reliability BCI still has a very limited application in daily real-world tasks. This paper proposes a P300-based BCI speller combined with a double error-related potential ErrP detection to automatically correct erroneous decisions. This novel approach introduces a second error detection to infer whether wrong automatic correction also elicits a second ErrP. Thus two single-trial responses instead of one contribute to the final selection improving the reliability of error detection. Moreover to increase error detection the evoked potential detected as target by the P300 classifier is combined with the evoked error potential at a feature-level. Discriminable error and positive potentials response to correct feedback were clearly identified. The proposed approach was tested on nine healthy participants and one tetraplegic participant. The online average accuracy for the first and second ErrPs were 88.4% and 84.8% respectively. With automatic correction we achieved an improvement around 5% achieving 89.9% in spelling accuracy for an effective 2.92 symbols/min. The proposed approach revealed that double ErrP detection can improve the reliability and speed of BCI systems. Double ErrP Detection for Automatic Error Correction in an ERP-Based BCI Speller.
