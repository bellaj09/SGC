The online performance of a motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface MI-BCI influences its effectiveness and usability in real-world clinical applications such as the restoration of motor control. The online performance depends on factors such as the different feedback techniques and motivation of the subject. This paper investigates the online performance of the MI-BCI with an augmented-reality AR 3D virtual hand feedback. The subject experiences the interaction with 3D virtual hands which have been superimposed onto his real hands and displayed on the computer monitor from a first person point-of-view. While performing motor imagery he receives continuous visual feedback from the MI-BCI in the form of different degrees of reaching and grasping actions of the 3D virtual hands with other virtual objects. The AR feedback is compared with the conventional horizontal bar feedback on 8 subjects of whom 7 are BCI-nave. The subjects found the AR feedback to be more engaging and motivating. Despite the higher mental workload involved in the AR feedback their online MI-BCI performance compared to the conventional horizontal bar feedback was not affected. The results provide motivation to further develop and refine the AR feedback protocol for MI-BCI. Online performance evaluation of motor imagery BCI with augmented-reality virtual hand feedback.
