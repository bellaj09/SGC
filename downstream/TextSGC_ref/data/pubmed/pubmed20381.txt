The maturation of pervasive computing technologies has dramatically altered the face of healthcare. With the introduction of mobile devices body area networks and embedded computing systems care providers can use continuous ecologically valid information to overcome geographic and temporal barriers and thus provide more effective and timely health assessments. In this paper we review recent technological developments that can be harnessed to replicate enhance or create methods for assessment of functional performance. Enabling technologies in wearable sensors ambient sensors mobile technologies and virtual reality make it possible to quantify real-time functional performance and changes in cognitive health. These technologies their uses for functional health assessment and their challenges for adoption are presented in this paper. Technology-Enabled Assessment of Functional Health.
