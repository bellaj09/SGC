Histopathology image analysis is a gold standard for cancer recognition and diagnosis. Automatic analysis of histopathology images can help pathologists diagnose tumor and cancer subtypes alleviating the workload of pathologists. There are two basic types of tasks in digital histopathology image analysis: image classification and image segmentation. Typical problems with histopathology images that hamper automatic analysis include complex clinical representations limited quantities of training images in a dataset and the extremely large size of singular images usually up to gigapixels. The property of extremely large size for a single image also makes a histopathology image dataset be considered large-scale even if the number of images in the dataset is limited. Large scale tissue histopathology image classification segmentation and visualization via deep convolutional activation features.
