Beginning in December 2019 the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has caused a pneumonia epidemic that began in Wuhan China and is rapidly spreading throughout the whole world. Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19 the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. Early nutritional supplementation in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19: Rationale and feasibility of a shared pragmatic protocol.
