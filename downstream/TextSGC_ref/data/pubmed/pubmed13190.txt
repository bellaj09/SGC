Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks CNNs address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks DRNNs for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional bidirectional and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory LSTM DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning such as support vector machine SVM and k-nearest neighbors KNN. Additionally the proposed models yield better performance than other deep learning techniques such as deep believe networks DBNs and CNNs.
