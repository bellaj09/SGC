"There is a long last tradition in Artificial Intelligence as use of Robots endowing human peculiarities from a cognitive and emotional point of view and not only in shape. Today Artificial Intelligence is more oriented to several form of collective intelligence also building robot simulators hardware or software to deeply understand collective behaviors in human beings and society as a whole. Modeling has also been crucial in the social sciences to understand how complex systems can arise from simple rules. However while engineers simulations can be performed in the physical world using robots for social scientist this is impossible. For decades researchers tried to improve simulations by endowing artificial agents with simple and complex rules that emulated human behavior also by using artificial intelligence AI. To include human beings and their real intelligence within artificial societies is now the big challenge. We present an hybrid human-artificial platform where experiments can be performed by simulated artificial worlds in the following manner: 1 agents behaviors are regulated by the behaviors shown in Virtual Reality involving real human beings exposed to specific situations to simulate and 2 technology transfers these rules into the artificial world. These form a closed-loop of real behaviors inserted into artificial agents which can be used to study real society."
