This study compared virtual reality VR training with low cost-blended learning BL in a structured training program.Training of laparoscopic skills outside the operating room is mandatory to reduce operative times and risks.Laparoscopy-nave medical students were randomized in 2 groups stratified for sex. The BL group n\u200a=\u200a42 used E-learning for laparoscopic cholecystectomy LC and practiced basic skills with box trainers. The VR group n\u200a=\u200a42 trained basic skills and LC on the LAP Mentor II Simbionix Cleveland OH. Each group trained 3\u200a\u200a4\u200ahours followed by a knowledge test concerning LC. Blinded raters assessed the operative performance of cadaveric porcine LC using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills OSATS. The LC was discontinued when it was not completed within 80\u200amin. Students evaluated their training modality with questionnaires.The VR group completed the LC significantly faster and more often within 80\u200amin than BL 45% v 21% P\u200a=\u200a.02. The BL group scored higher than the VR group in the knowledge test 13.3\u200a\u200a1.3 vs 11.0\u200a\u200a1.7 P\u200a<\u200a0.001. Both groups showed equal operative performance of LC in the OSATS score 49.4\u200a\u200a10.5 vs 49.7\u200a\u200a12.0 P\u200a=\u200a0.90. Students generally liked training and felt well prepared for assisting in laparoscopic surgery. The efficiency of the training was judged higher by the VR group than by the BL group.VR and BL can both be applied for training the basics of LC. Multimodality training programs should be developed that combine the advantages of both approaches.
