There is a clear need for more detailed analysis of the role of cognitive self-statements in virtual reality exposure therapy VRET. To date no research on this topic has been done. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether coping self-statements would enhance the effectiveness of VRET. In a randomized crossover design 26 patients with acrophobia DSM-IV diagnosis of specific phobia were randomly assigned to two sessions of VRET followed by two sessions of VRET plus coping self-statements or the other way around: first two sessions of VRET plus coping self-statements followed by two sessions of VRET. Results showed that VRET regardless of addition of coping self-statements decreased anxiety of heights decreased avoidance of height situations and improved attitudes towards heights. However at 6-month follow-up most gains during treatment were not fully retained. Do self-statements enhance the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy?
