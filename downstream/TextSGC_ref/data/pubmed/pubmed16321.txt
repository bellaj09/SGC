In this paper a new background modeling method called stacked multilayer self-organizing map background model SMSOM-BM is proposed which presents several merits such as strong representative ability for complex scenarios easy to use and so on. In order to enhance the representative ability of the background model and make the parameters learned automatically the recently developed idea of representative learning or deep learning is elegantly employed to extend the existing single-layer self-organizing map background model to a multilayer one namely the proposed SMSOM-BM. As a consequence the SMSOM-BM gains several merits including strong representative ability to learn background model of challenging scenarios and automatic determination for most network parameters. More specifically every pixel is modeled by a SMSOM and spatial consistency is considered at each layer. By introducing a novel over-layer filtering process we can train the background model layer by layer in an efficient manner. Furthermore for real-time performance consideration we have implemented the proposed method using NVIDIA CUDA platform. Comparative experimental results show superior performance of the proposed approach. Stacked Multilayer Self-Organizing Map for  Background Modeling.
