"The use of linear PowerPoint templates to support lectures may inadvertently encourage dental students to adopt a passive approach to learning and a narrow appreciation of the field of study. Such presentations may support short-term learning gains and validate assessment regimes that promote surface learning approaches at the expense of developing a wider appreciation of the field that is necessary for development of clinical expertise. Exploitation of concept mapping principles can provide a balance for the negative learning behaviour that is promoted by the unreflective use of PowerPoint. This increases the opportunities for students to access holistic knowledge structures that are indicators of expertise. We illustrate this using the example of partial denture design and show that undergraduates grasp of learning and teaching issues is sufficiently sophisticated for them to appreciate the implications of varying the mode of presentation. Our findings indicate that students understand the strategic value of bullet-pointed presentations for short-term assessment goals and the benefits of deep learning mediated by concept mapping that may support longer term professional development. Students are aware of the tension between these competing agendas." Using concept mapping principles in PowerPoint.
