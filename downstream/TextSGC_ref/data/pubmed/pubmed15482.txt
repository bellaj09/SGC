Efficient human promoter feature extraction is still a major challenge in genome analysis as it can better understand human gene regulation and will be useful for experimental guidance. Although many machine learning algorithms have been developed for eukaryotic gene recognition performance on promoters is unsatisfactory due to the diverse nature. To extract discriminative features from human promoters an efficient deep convolutional divergence encoding method DCDE is proposed based on statistical divergence SD and convolutional neural network CNN. SD can help optimize kmer feature extraction for human promoters. CNN can also be used to automatically extract features in gene analysis. In DCDE we first perform informative kmers settlement to encode original gene sequences. A series of SD methods can optimize the most discriminative kmers distributions while maintaining important positional information. Then CNN is utilized to extract lower dimensional deep features by secondary encoding. Finally we construct a hybrid recognition architecture with multiple support vector machines and a bilayer decision method. It is flexible to add new features or new models and can be extended to identify other genomic functional elements. The extensive experiments demonstrate that DCDE is effective in promoter encoding and can significantly improve the performance of promoter recognition.
