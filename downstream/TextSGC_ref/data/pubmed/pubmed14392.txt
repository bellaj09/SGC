Recently deep convolutional neural networks CNNs have been successfully applied to the single-image super-resolution SISR task with great improvement in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR and structural similarity SSIM. However most of the existing CNN-based SR models require high computing power which considerably limits their real-world applications. In addition most CNN-based methods rarely explore the intermediate features that are helpful for final image recovery. To address these issues in this article we propose a dense lightweight network called MADNet for stronger multiscale feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically a residual multiscale module with an attention mechanism RMAM is developed to enhance the informative multiscale feature representation ability. Furthermore we present a dual residual-path block DRPB that utilizes the hierarchical features from original low-resolution images. To take advantage of the multilevel features dense connections are employed among blocks. The comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our MADNet model while employing considerably fewer multiadds and parameters.
