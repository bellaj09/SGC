Accurate choroidal vessel segmentation with swept-source optical coherence tomography SS-OCT images provide unprecedented quantitative analysis towards the understanding of choroid-related diseases. Motivated by the leading segmentation performance in medical images from the use of deep learning methods in this study we proposed the adoption of a deep learning method RefineNet to segment the choroidal vessels from SS-OCT images. We quantitatively evaluated the RefineNet on 40 SS-OCT images consisting of ~3900 manually annotated choroidal vessels regions. We achieved a segmentation agreement SA of 0.840  0.035 with clinician 1 C1 and 0.823  0.027 with clinician 2 C2. These results were higher than inter-observer variability measure in SA between C1 and C2 of 0.821  0.037. Our results demonstrated that the choroidal vessels from SS-OCT can be automatically segmented using a deep learning method and thus provided a new approach towards an objective and reproducible quantitative analysis of vessel regions. Robust deep learning method for choroidal vessel segmentation on swept source optical coherence tomography images.
