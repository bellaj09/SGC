This paper reviews automated visual-based defect detection approaches applicable to various materials such as metals ceramics and textiles. In the first part of the paper we present a general taxonomy of the different defects that fall in two classes: visible e.g. scratches shape error etc. and palpable e.g. crack bump etc. defects. Then we describe artificial visual processing techniques that are aimed at understanding of the captured scenery in a mathematical/logical way. We continue with a survey of textural defect detection based on statistical structural and other approaches. Finally we report the state of the art for approaching the detection and classification of defects through supervised and non-supervised classifiers and deep learning.
