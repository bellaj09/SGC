Inferior vena cava IVC stenosis is a well-known complication of the IVC filter. However there are no previous reports of IVC stenosis caused by a temporary IVC filter. In this case report we describe the case of a 35-year-old man who was referred to our center for the treatment of recurrent proximal deep vein thrombosis DVT and severe IVC stenosis that occurred after retrieval of a temporary IVC filter. We performed a catheter-directed thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty. DVT resolved effectively and his leg symptoms resolved. <Learning objective: Although IVC filter-related stenosis is not common it should be managed even when a temporary IVC filter is used. The combination of catheter-directed thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty may be considered for a proximal deep vein thrombosis complicated with IVC stenosis.>. Successful catheter intervention for deep vein thrombosis due to inferior vena cava stenosis after retrieval of a temporary inferior vena cava filter.
