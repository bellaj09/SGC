Traumatic brain injury TBI is the most common cause of long-term disability and death among young adults and it represents an enormous socioeconomic and healthcare burden. Our purpose is to evaluate the effects of a virtual reality training with BTs-Nirvana BTs-N on the recovery of cognitive functions in TBI subjects using the interactive semi-immersive program. One hundred patients with TBI were enrolled in this study and randomized into either the Traditional Cognitive Rehabilitation Group TCRG: n = 50 or the Virtual Reality Training Group VRTG: n = 50. The VRTG underwent a VRT with BTs-N whereas the TCRG received a standard cognitive treatment. Each treatment session lasted 60 minutes and was repeated three times a week for 8 weeks. All of the patients were evaluated by a specific psychometric battery before T0 and immediately T1 after the end of the training. VRTG and TCRG had a significant improvement in cognitive functioning and in mood but only VRTG presented with a significant increase in cognitive flexibility and shifting skills and in selective attention. In conclusion our results suggest that VR may be a useful and effective approach for the rehabilitation of patients with TBI leading to better cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
