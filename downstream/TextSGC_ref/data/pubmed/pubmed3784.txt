"Positron emission tomography PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG reveals altered cerebral metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment MCI and Alzheimers dementia AD. Previous metabolic connectome analyses derive from groups of patients but do not support the prediction of an individuals risk of conversion from present MCI to AD. We now present an individual metabolic connectome method namely the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Similarity Estimation KLSE to characterize brain-wide metabolic networks that predict an individuals risk of conversion from MCI to AD." "Individual brain metabolic connectome indicator based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence Similarity Estimation predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimers dementia."
