Transected axons fail to regrow across anatomically complete spinal cord injuries SCI in adults. Diverse molecules can partially facilitate or attenuate axon growth during development or after injury1-3 but efficient reversal of this regrowth failure remains elusive4. Here we show that three factors\xa0that are essential for axon growth during development but are attenuated or lacking in adults-i neuron intrinsic growth capacity25-9 ii growth-supportive substrate1011 and iii chemoattraction1213-are all individually required and in combination are sufficient to stimulate robust axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions in adult rodents. We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI1415; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor1617 delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots1819 placed sequentially after SCI. We show in both mice and rats that providing these three mechanisms in combination but not individually stimulated robust propriospinal axon regrowth through astrocyte scar borders and across lesion\xa0cores of non-neural\xa0tissue that was over 100-fold greater than controls. Stimulated supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres passed well into spared neural tissue formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits. Required growth facilitators propel axon regeneration across complete spinal cord injury.
