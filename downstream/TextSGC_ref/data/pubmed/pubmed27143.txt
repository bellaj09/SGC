In recent years there has been an increasing interest in using electroencephalographic EEG activity to close the loop between brain oscillations and movement to induce functional motor rehabilitation. Rehabilitation robots or exoskeletons have been controlled using EEG activity. However all studies have used a 2-class or one-dimensional decoding scheme. In this study we investigated EEG decoding of 5 functional movements of the same limb towards an online scenario. Six healthy participants performed a three-dimensional center-out reaching task based on direction movements four directions and rest wearing a 32-channel EEG cap. A BCI design based on multiclass extensions of Spectrally Weighted Common Spatial Patterns Spec-CSP and a linear discriminant analysis LDA classifier was developed and tested offline. The decoding accuracy was 5-fold cross-validated. A decoding accuracy of 39.5% on average for all the six subjects was obtained chance level being 20%. The results of the current study demonstrate multiple functional movements decoding significantly higher than chance level from the same limb using EEG data. This study represents first steps towards a same limb multi degree of freedom DOF online EEG based BCI for motor restoration. Towards decoding of functional movements from the same limb using EEG.
