A major challenge in the field of neural interfaces is to overcome the problem of poor stability of neuronal recordings which impedes long-term studies of individual neurons in the brain. Conceivably unstable recordings reflect relative movements between electrode and tissue. To address this challenge we have developed a new ultra-flexible electrode array and evaluated its performance in awake non-restrained animals. An array of highly flexible electrodes with a tailored configuration locked by gelatin during implantation-initial evaluation in cortex cerebri of awake rats.
