To correct wavefront aberrations commonly employing proportional-integral control in adaptive optics AO systems the control process depends strictly on the response matrix of the deformable mirror. The alignment error between the Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor and the deformable mirror is caused by various factors in AO systems. In the conventional control method the response matrix can be recalibrated to reduce the impact of alignment error but the impact cannot be eliminated. This paper proposes a control method based on a deep learning control model DLCM to compensate for wavefront aberrations eliminating the dependence on the deformable mirror response matrix. Based on the wavefront slope data the cost functions of the model network and the actor network are defined and the gradient optimization algorithm improves the efficiency of the network training. The model network guarantees the stability and convergence speed while the actor network improves the control accuracy realizing an online identification and self-adaptive control of the system. A parameter-sharing mechanism is adopted between the model network and the actor network to control the system gain. Simulation results show that the DLCM has good adaptability and stability. Through self-learning it improves the convergence accuracy and iterations as well as the adjustment tolerance of the system. Deep learning control model for adaptive optics systems.
