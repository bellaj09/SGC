Adenoid hypertrophy is a pathological hyperplasia of adenoids and may cause snoring apnea and impede breathing during sleep. In clinical practice radiologists diagnose the severity of adenoid hypertrophy by measuring the ratio of adenoid width A to nasopharyngeal width N according to the lateral cephalogram which indicates the locations of four keypoints. The entire diagnostic process is tedious and time-consuming due to the acquisition of A and N. Thus there is an urgent need to develop computer-aided diagnostic tools for adenoid hypertrophy. A deep-learning-based approach for adenoid hypertrophy diagnosis.
