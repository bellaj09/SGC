Traditional methods of detecting and mapping utility poles are inefficient and costly because of the demand for visual interpretation with quality data sources or intense field inspection. The advent of deep learning for object detection provides an opportunity for detecting utility poles from side-view optical images. In this study we proposed using a deep learning-based method for automatically mapping roadside utility poles with crossarms UPCs from Google Street View GSV images. The method combines the state-of-the-art DL object detection algorithm i.e. the RetinaNet object detection algorithm and a modified brute-force-based line-of-bearing LOB a LOB stands for the ray towards the location of the target UPC at here from the original location of the sensor GSV mobile platform measurement method to estimate the locations of detected roadside UPCs from GSV. Experimental results indicate that: 1 both the average precision AP and the overall accuracy OA are around 0.78 when the intersection-over-union IoU threshold is greater than 0.3 based on the testing of 500 GSV images with a total number of 937 objects; and 2 around 2.6% 47% and 79% of estimated locations of utility poles are within 1 m 5 m and 10 m buffer zones respectively around the referenced locations of utility poles. In general this study indicates that even in a complex background most utility poles can be detected with the use of DL and the LOB measurement method can estimate the locations of most UPCs.
