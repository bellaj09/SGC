Sagittal synostosis affects 1 in 1000 live births and may result in increased intracranial pressure hindrance of normal neural development and cosmetic deformity due to scaphocephaly. Historically several approaches have been utilized for surgical correction and recently computed tomography CT-guided reconstruction procedures are increasingly used. In this report the authors describe the use of a CT-derived virtual and stereolithographic 3D printed craniofacial models which are used to guide intraoperative bone placement and intraoperative CT guidance for confirmation of bone placement to ensure the accuracy of surgical correction of scaphocephaly as demonstrated to parents. Virtual modeling stereolithography and intraoperative CT guidance for the optimization of sagittal synostosis reconstruction: a technical note.
