The acute urge to be physically active is a relevant clinical phenomenon in patients suffering from eating disorders. In this study with n\u2009=\u200920 female patients with anorexia nervosa and n\u2009=\u200910 female patients with bulimia nervosa a virtual reality VR jogging paradigm was applied as a novel highly immersive 3D exposure paradigm. Patients were asked to rate their acute urge to be physically active during the exposure procedure. A 10-item self-report questionnaire smQ was developed to capture the cognitive emotional and behavioral aspects of the acute urge to move. We hypothesized that exposure would lead to habituation of the urge to be physically active. We also hypothesized that leptin levels would be associated with the degree of the subjective urge to be physically active while habituation would be associated with a decrease in stress hormones -amylase cortisol and cortisone in saliva. A statistically significant change in subjective scores in the smQ from baseline to postexposure was seen. Our novel VR paradigm may serve as a therapeutic tool for exposure and habituation of the urge of acutely engaging in physical activity in patients with eating disorders.
