Hyperspectral imaging HSI technology has demonstrated potential to provide useful information about the chemical composition of tissue and its morphological features in a single image modality. Deep learning DL techniques have demonstrated the ability of automatic feature extraction from data for a successful classification. In this study we exploit HSI and DL for the automatic differentiation of glioblastoma GB and non-tumor tissue on hematoxylin and eosin H&E stained histological slides of human brain tissue. GB detection is a challenging application showing high heterogeneity in the cellular morphology across different patients. We employed an HSI microscope with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm to collect 517 HS cubes from 13 GB patients using 20 magnification. Using a convolutional neural network CNN we were able to automatically detect GB within the pathological slides achieving average sensitivity and specificity values of 88% and 77% respectively representing an improvement of 7% and 8% respectively as compared to the results obtained using RGB red green and blue images. This study demonstrates that the combination of hyperspectral microscopic imaging and deep learning is a promising tool for future computational pathologies.
