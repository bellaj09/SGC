Mental workload estimation is of crucial interest for user adaptive interfaces and neuroergonomics. Its estimation can be performed using event-related potentials ERPs extracted from electroencephalographic recordings EEG. Several ERP spatial filtering methods have been designed to enhance relevant EEG activity for active brain-computer interfaces. However to our knowledge they have not yet been used and compared for mental state monitoring purposes. This paper presents a thorough comparison of three ERP spatial filtering methods: principal component analysis PCA canonical correlation analysis CCA and the xDAWN algorithm. Those methods are compared in their performance to allow for an accurate classification of mental workload when applied in an otherwise similar processing chain. The data of 20 healthy participants that performed a memory task for 10 minutes each was used for classification. Two levels of mental workload were considered depending on the number of digits participants had to memorize 2/6. The highest performances were obtained using the CCA filtering and the xDAWN algorithm respectively with 98% and 97% of correct classification. Their performances were significantly higher than that obtained using the PCA filtering 88%. A comparison of ERP spatial filtering methods for optimal mental workload estimation.
