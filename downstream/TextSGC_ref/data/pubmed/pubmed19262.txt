Augmented Reality offers many applications today especially on mobile devices. Due to the lack of mobile hardware for illumination measurements photorealistic rendering with consistent appearance of virtual objects is still an area of active research. In this paper we present a full two-stage pipeline for environment acquisition and augmentation of live camera images using a mobile device with a depth sensor. We show how to directly work on a recorded 3D point cloud of the real environment containing high dynamic range color values. For unknown and automatically changing camera settings a color compensation method is introduced. Based on this we show photorealistic augmentations using variants of differential light simulation techniques. The presented methods are tailored for mobile devices and run at interactive frame rates. However our methods are scalable to trade performance for quality and can produce quality renderings on desktop hardware.
