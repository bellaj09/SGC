"Although a controversial topic in medical education the selection of aspirant surgical trainees is a subject that needs to be addressed. In the view of preventing surgical trainee drop-outs and of appropriate allocation of limited resources it is an issue critical to the profession. Traditional methods of selection are often subjective and do not seem to correlate with skill needed for surgery. Standardized neuropsychometric test batteries may be useful in helping to select aspirant laparoscopic surgeons. Our study attempts to link surgical novices psychometric ability test battery data with actual performance outcome on an objective validated and reproducible surgical laparoscopic task using virtual-reality simulation."
