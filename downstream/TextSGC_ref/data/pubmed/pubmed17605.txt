Biochemistry and physiology teachers from veterinary faculties in Hannover Budapest and Lublin prepared innovative computer-based integrative clinical case scenarios as optional learning materials for teaching and learning in basic sciences. These learning materials were designed to enhance attention and increase interest and intrinsic motivation for learning thus strengthening autonomous active and self-directed learning. We investigated learning progress and success by administering a pre-test before exposure to the virtual patients vetVIP cases offered vetVIP cases alongside regular biochemistry courses and then administered a complementary post-test. We analyzed improvement in cohort performance and level of confidence in rating questions. Results of the performance in biochemistry examinations in 2014 2015 and 2016 were correlated with the use of and performance in vetVIP cases throughout biochemistry courses in Hannover. Surveys of students reflected that interactive cases helped them understand the relevance of basic sciences in veterinary education. Differences between identical pre- and post-tests revealed knowledge improvement correct answers: +28% in Hannover +9% in Lublin and enhanced confidence in decision making "I don\t know" answers: -20% in Hannover -7.5% in Lublin. High case usage and voluntary participation use of vetVIP cases in Hannover and Lublin >70% Budapest <1%; response rates in pre-test 72% and post-test 48% indicated a good increase in motivation for the subject of biochemistry. Despite increased motivation there was only a weak correlation between performance in final exams and performance in the vetVIP cases. Case-based e-learning could be extended and generated cases should be shared across veterinary faculties. Impact of Virtual Patients as Optional Learning Material in Veterinary Biochemistry Education.
