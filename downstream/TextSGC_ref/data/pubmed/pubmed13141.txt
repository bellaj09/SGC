We present TSR-TVD a novel deep learning framework that generates temporal super-resolution TSR of time-varying data TVD using adversarial learning. TSR-TVD is the first work that applies the recurrent generative network RGN a combination of the recurrent neural network RNN and generative adversarial network GAN to generate temporal high-resolution volume sequences from low-resolution ones. The design of TSR-TVD includes a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes a pair of volumes as input and outputs the synthesized intermediate volume sequence through forward and backward predictions. The discriminator takes the synthesized intermediate volumes as input and produces a score indicating the realness of the volumes. Our method handles multivariate data as well where the trained network from one variable is applied to generate TSR for another variable. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TSR-TVD we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying multivariate data sets and compare our method against standard linear interpolation and solutions solely based on RNN or CNN.
