"Body image is the internal representation of an individuals own physical appearance. Individuals with gender identity disorder GID commonly referred to as transsexuals TXs are unable to form a satisfactory body image due to the dissonance between their biological sex and gender identity. We reasoned that changes in the resting-state functional connectivity rsFC network would neurologically reflect such experiential incongruence in TXs. Using graph theory-based network analysis we investigated the regional changes of the degree centrality of the rsFC network. The degree centrality is an index of the functional importance of a node in a neural network. We hypothesized that three key regions of the body representation network i.e. the primary somatosensory cortex the superior parietal lobule and the insula would show a higher degree centrality in TXs. Twenty-three pre-treatment TXs 11 male-to-female and 12 female-to-male TXs as one psychosocial group and 23 age-matched healthy cissexual control subjects CISs 11 males and 12 females were recruited. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed and binarized rsFC networks were constructed. The TXs demonstrated a significantly higher degree centrality in the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition the connectivity between the right insula and the bilateral primary somatosensory cortices was negatively correlated with the selfness rating of their desired genders. These data indicate that the key components of body representation manifest in TXs as critical function hubs in the rsFC network. The negative association may imply a coping mechanism that dissociates bodily emotion from body image. The changes in the functional connectome may serve as representational markers for the dysphoric bodily self of TXs." Neural network of body representation differs between transsexuals and cissexuals.
