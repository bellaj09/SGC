Brain-computer interface BCI systems have been used primarily to provide communication for persons with severe movement disabilities. This paper presents a new system that extends BCI technology to a new patient group: persons diagnosed with stroke. This system called recoveriX is designed to detect changes in motor imagery in real-time to help monitor compliance and provide closed-loop feedback during therapy. We describe recoveriX and present initial results from one patient. recoveriX: a new BCI-based technology for persons with stroke.
