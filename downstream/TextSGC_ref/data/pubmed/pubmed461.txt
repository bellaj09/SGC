As of April 20 2020 over time the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 157\xa0970 deaths out of 2\xa0319\xa0066 confirmed cases at a Case Fatality Rate of ~6.8%. With the pandemic rapidly spreading and health delivery systems being overwhelmed it is imperative that safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are rapidly explored to improve survival. In this paper we use established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that a vicious positive feedback loop of des-Arg9-bradykinin- and bradykinin-mediated inflammation\xa0\xa0injury\xa0\xa0inflammation likely precipitates life threatening respiratory complications in COVID-19. Through our hypothesis we make the prediction that the FDA-approved molecule icatibant might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and thereby improve the clinical outcomes. This hypothesis could lead to basic translational and clinical studies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A hypothesized role for dysregulated bradykinin signaling in COVID-19 respiratory complications.
