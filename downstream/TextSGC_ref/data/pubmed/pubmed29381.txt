"Brain control technology can restore communication between the brain and a prosthesis and choosing a Brain-Computer Interface BCI paradigm to evoke electroencephalogram EEG signals is an essential step for developing this technology. In this paper the Scene Graph paradigm used for controlling prostheses was proposed; this paradigm is based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials SSVEPs regarding the Scene Graph of a subjects intention. A mathematic model was built to predict SSVEPs evoked by the proposed paradigm and a sinusoidal stimulation method was used to present the Scene Graph stimulus to elicit SSVEPs from subjects. Then a 2-degree of freedom 2-DOF brain-controlled prosthesis system was constructed to validate the performance of the Scene Graph-SSVEP SG-SSVEP-based BCI. The classification of SG-SSVEPs was detected via the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA approach. To assess the efficiency of proposed BCI system the performances of traditional SSVEP-BCI system were compared. Experimental results from six subjects suggested that the proposed system effectively enhanced the SSVEP responses decreased the degradation of SSVEP strength and reduced the visual fatigue in comparison with the traditional SSVEP-BCI system. The average signal to noise ratio SNR of SG-SSVEP was 6.31\u202f\u202f2.64\u202fdB versus 3.38\u202f\u202f0.78\u202fdB of traditional-SSVEP. In addition the proposed system achieved good performances in prosthesis control. The average accuracy was 94.58%\u202f\u202f7.05% and the corresponding high information transfer rate IRT was 19.55\u202f\u202f3.07\u202fbit/min. The experimental results revealed that the SG-SSVEP based BCI system achieves the good performance and improved the stability relative to the conventional approach."
