Monte Carlo MC algorithms offer accurate modeling of dose calculation by simulating the transport and interactions of many particles through the patient geometry. However given their random nature the resulting dose distributions have statistical uncertainty noise which prevents making reliable clinical decisions. This issue is partly addressable using a huge number of simulated particles but is computationally expensive as it results in significantly greater computation times. Therefore there is a trade-off between the computation time and the noise level in MC dose maps. In this work we address the mitigation of noise inherent to MC dose distributions using dilated U-Net - an encoder-decoder-styled fully convolutional neural network which allows fast and fully automated denoising of whole-volume dose maps.
