We conducted differentiations between thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma for 8-bit bitmap ultrasonography US images utilizing a deep-learning approach. For the data sets we gathered small-boxed selected images adjacent to the marginal outline of nodules and applied a convolutional neural network CNN to have differentiation based on a statistical aggregation that is a decision by majority. From the implementation of the method introducing a newly devised scalable parameterized normalization treatment we observed meaningful aspects in various experiments collecting evidence regarding the existence of features retained on the margin of thyroid nodules such as 89.51% of the overall differentiation accuracy for the test data with 93.19% of accuracy for benign adenoma and 71.05% for carcinoma from 230 benign adenoma and 77 carcinoma US images where we used only 39 benign adenomas and 39 carcinomas to train the CNN model and with these extremely small training data sets and their model we tested 191 benign adenomas and 38 carcinomas. We present numerical results including area under receiver operating characteristic AUROC. Differentiation of the Follicular Neoplasm on the Gray-Scale US by Image Selection Subsampling along with the Marginal Outline Using Convolutional Neural Network.
