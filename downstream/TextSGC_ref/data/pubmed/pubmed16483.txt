Due to its simplicity and low cost analyzing an electrocardiogram ECG is the most common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG data collected every day in home and hospital may preclude data review by human operators/technicians. Therefore several methods are proposed for either fully automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by human experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant progress in the past years. However those methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the signal e.g. beat detection. This plus the high variability in wave morphology among patients and the presence of noise make it challenging for computerized interpretation to achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction and classification. Therefore deep learning approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection. In this work we reviewed the recent advancement of deep learning methods for automatic arrhythmia detection. We summarized existing literature from five aspects: utilized dataset application type of input data model architecture and performance evaluation. We also reported limitations of reviewed papers and potential future opportunities. Cardiac arrhythmia detection using deep learning: A review.
