In the brain mapping field there have been significant interests in representation of structural/functional profiles to establish structural/functional landmark correspondences across individuals and populations. For example from the structural perspective our previous studies have identified hundreds of consistent DICCCOL dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks landmarks across individuals and populations each of which possess consistent DTI-derived fiber connection patterns. From the functional perspective a large collection of well-characterized HAFNI holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions networks based on sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals have been identified in our prior studies. However due to the remarkable variability of structural and functional architectures in the human brain it is challenging for earlier studies to jointly represent the connectome-scale structural and functional profiles for establishing a common cortical architecture which can comprehensively encode both structural and functional characteristics across individuals. To address this challenge we propose an effective computational framework to jointly represent the structural and functional profiles for identification of consistent and common cortical landmarks with both structural and functional correspondences across different brains based on DTI and fMRI data. Experimental results demonstrate that 55 structurally and functionally common cortical landmarks can be successfully identified. Joint representation of consistent structural and functional profiles for identification of common cortical landmarks.
