COVID-19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA. Systemic tissue plasminogen activator tPA has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO2/FiO2 mmHg when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS. It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. Salvage use of tissue plasminogen activator tPA in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS due to COVID-19 in the USA: a Markov decision analysis.
