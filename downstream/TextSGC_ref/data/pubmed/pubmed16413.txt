The rapid and efficient creation of virtual environments has become a crucial part of virtual reality applications. In particular civil and defense applications often require and employ detailed models of operations areas for training simulations of different scenarios planning for natural or man-made events monitoring surveillance games and films. A realistic representation of the large-scale environments is therefore imperative for the success of such applications since it increases the immersive experience of its users and helps reduce the difference between physical and virtual reality. However the task of creating such large-scale virtual environments still remains a time-consuming and manual work. In this work we propose a novel method for the rapid reconstruction of photorealistic large-scale virtual environments. First a novel extendible parameterized geometric primitive is presented for the automatic building identification and reconstruction of building structures. In addition buildings with complex roofs containing complex linear and nonlinear surfaces are reconstructed interactively using a linear polygonal and a nonlinear primitive respectively. Second we present a rendering pipeline for the composition of photorealistic textures which unlike existing techniques can recover missing or occluded texture information by integrating multiple information captured from different optical sensors ground aerial and satellite.
