Traditional von Neumann computing systems involve separate processing and memory units. However data movement is costly in terms of time and energy and this problem is aggravated by the recent explosive growth in highly data-centric applications related to artificial intelligence. This calls for a radical departure from the traditional systems and one such non-von Neumann computational approach is in-memory computing. Hereby certain computational tasks are performed in place in the memory itself by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices. Both charge-based and resistance-based memory devices are being explored for in-memory computing. In this Review we provide a broad overview of the key computational primitives enabled by these memory devices as well as their applications spanning scientific computing signal processing optimization machine learning deep learning and stochastic computing. Memory devices and applications for in-memory computing.
