"The amount of data collected and managed in biomedicine is ever-increasing. Thus there is a need to rapidly and efficiently collect analyze and characterize all this information. Artificial intelligence AI with an emphasis on deep learning holds great promise in this area and is already being successfully applied to basic research diagnosis drug discovery and clinical trials. Rare diseases RDs which are severely underrepresented in basic and clinical research can particularly benefit from AI technologies. Of the more than 7000 RDs described worldwide only 5% have a treatment. The ability of AI technologies to integrate and analyze data from different sources e.g. multi-omics patient registries and so on can be used to overcome RDs challenges e.g. low diagnostic rates reduced number of patients geographical dispersion and so on. Ultimately RDs AI-mediated knowledge could significantly boost therapy development. Presently there are AI approaches being used in RDs and this review aims to collect and summarize these advances. A section dedicated to congenital disorders of glycosylation CDG a particular group of orphan RDs that can serve as a potential study model for other common diseases and RDs has also been included."
