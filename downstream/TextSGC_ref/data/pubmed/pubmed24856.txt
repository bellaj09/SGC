This paper presents a brain-computer interface for text entry using steady-state visually evoked potentials SSVEP. Like other SSVEP-based spellers ours identifies the desired input character by posing questions or queries to users through a visual interface. Each query defines a mapping from possible characters to steady-state stimuli. The user responds by attending to one of these stimuli. Unlike other SSVEP-based spellers ours chooses from a much larger pool of possible queries-on the order of ten thousand instead of ten. The larger query pool allows our speller to adapt more effectively to the inherent structure of what is being typed and to the input performance of the user both of which make certain queries provide more information than others. In particular our speller chooses queries from this pool that maximize the amount of information to be received per unit of time a measure of mutual information that we call information gain rate. To validate our interface we compared it with two other state-of-the-art SSVEP-based spellers which were re-implemented to use the same input mechanism. Results showed that our interface with the larger query pool allowed users to spell multiple-word texts nearly twice as fast as they could with the compared spellers. An SSVEP-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Text Spelling With Adaptive Queries That Maximize Information Gain Rates.
