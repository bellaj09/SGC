The purpose of this paper is to share what I view as 10 important qualities of an ideal protg. First protgs must have a deep-seated love of learning that drives them to make the most out of the mentoring partnership. Next protgs must be self-starters who take personal charge of their mentoring. Confidence is vital so that the junior officer can face the many challenges that lay ahead in any Army career. Careful risk taking is necessary so that the protg can reach his or her greatest potential. Bouncing back from mistakes and failures is crucial for protgs so they must be resilient. Ongoing enthusiasm is the fuel that sustains the mentoring relationship over time. By being open-minded a protg carefully considers all advice including constructive criticism that the mentor shares along the uphill path to wisdom. Remember that commitment is the very glue holding the mentoring relationship together. Also protgs remain loyal to their mentors by always maintaining confidences. Most important an ideal protg is truly grateful for all the things that the mentor has done and repays that debt by also becoming a mentor. In closing it is hoped that by developing these qualities present and future protgs will get the most out of their mentoring partnerships and keep the age-old spirit of mentorship alive. Qualities of the ideal protg.
