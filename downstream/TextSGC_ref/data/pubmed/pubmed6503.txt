We analyze how accurately supervised machine learning techniques can predict the lowest energy levels of one-dimensional noninteracting ultracold atoms subject to the correlated disorder due to an optical speckle field. Deep neural networks with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer are trained on large sets of instances of the speckle field whose energy levels have been preventively determined via a high-order finite difference technique. The Fourier components of the speckle field are used as the feature vector to represent the speckle-field instances. A comprehensive analysis of the details that determine the possible success of supervised machine learning tasks namely the depth and the width of the neural network the size of the training set and the magnitude of the regularization parameter is presented. It is found that ground state energies of previously unseen instances can be predicted with an essentially negligible error given a computationally feasible number of training instances. First and second excited state energies can be predicted too albeit with slightly lower accuracy and using more layers of hidden neurons. We also find that a three-layer neural network is remarkably resilient to Gaussian noise added to the training-set data up to 10% noise level suggesting that cold-atom quantum simulators could be used to train artificial neural networks.
