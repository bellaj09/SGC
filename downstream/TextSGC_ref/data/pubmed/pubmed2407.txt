Resting-state analyses evaluating large-scale brain networks have largely focused on static correlations in brain activity over extended time periods however emerging approaches capture time-varying or dynamic patterns of transient functional networks. In light of these new approaches there is a need to classify common transient network states TNS in terms of their spatial and dynamic properties. To fill this gap two independent resting state scans collected in 462 healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project were evaluated using coactivation pattern analysis to identify eight TNS that recurred across participants and over time. These TNS spatially overlapped with prototypical resting state networks but also diverged in notable ways. In particular analyses revealed three TNS that shared cortical midline overlap with the default mode network DMN but these "complex" DMN states also encompassed distinct regions that fall beyond the prototypical DMN suggesting that the DMN defined using static methods may represent the average of distinct complex-DMN states. Of note dwell time was higher in "complex" DMN states challenging the idea that the prototypical DMN as a single unit is the dominant resting-state network as typically defined by static resting state methods. In comparing the two resting state scans we also found high reliability in the spatial organization and dynamic activities of network states involving DMN or sensorimotor regions. Future work will determine whether these TNS defined by coactivation patterns are in other samples and are linked to fundamental cognitive properties.
