Spatial navigation requires a well-established network of brain regions including the hippocampus caudate nucleus and retrosplenial cortex. Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment aMCI is a condition with predominantly memory impairment conferring a high predictive risk factor for dementia. aMCI is associated with hippocampal atrophy and subtle deficits in spatial navigation. We present the first use of a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI navigation task in aMCI using a virtual reality analog of the Radial Arm Maze. Compared with controls aMCI patients showed reduced activity in the hippocampus bilaterally retrosplenial cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Reduced activation in key areas for successful navigation as well as additional regions was found alongside relatively normal task performance. Results also revealed increased activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in aMCI patients which may reflect compensation for reduced activations elsewhere. These data support suggestions that fMRI spatial navigation tasks may be useful for staging of progression in MCI.
