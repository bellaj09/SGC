The ability to successfully navigate in healthcare facilities is an important goal for patients visitors and staff. Despite the fundamental nature of such behavior it is not infrequent for planners to consider wayfinding only after the fact once the building or building complex is complete. This review argues that more recognition is needed for the pivotal role of wayfinding in healthcare facilities. First to provide context the review presents a brief overview of the relationship between environmental psychology and healthcare facility design. Then the core of the article covers advances in wayfinding research with an emphasis on healthcare environments including the roles of plan configuration and manifest cues technology and user characteristics. Plan configuration and manifest cues which appeared early on in wayfinding research continue to play a role in wayfinding success and should inform design decisions. Such considerations are joined by emerging technologies e.g. mobile applications virtual reality and computational models of wayfinding as a way to both enhance our theoretical knowledge of wayfinding and advance its applications for users. Among the users discussed here are those with cognitive and/or visual challenges e.g. Down syndrome age-related decrements such as dementia and limitations of vision. In addition research on the role of cross-cultural comprehension and the effort to develop a system of universal healthcare symbols is included. The article concludes with a summary of the status of these advances and directions for future research. Wayfinding in healthcare facilities: contributions from environmental psychology.
