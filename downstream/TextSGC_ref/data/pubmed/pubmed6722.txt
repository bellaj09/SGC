For patients undergoing surgical cancer resection of squamous cell carcinoma SCCa cancer-free surgical margins are essential for good prognosis. We developed a method to use hyperspectral imaging HSI a noncontact optical imaging modality and convolutional neural networks CNNs to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo surgical gross-tissue specimens collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Using a cross-validation paradigm with data from different patients the CNN can distinguish SCCa from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the receiver operator curve AUC of 0.82. Additionally normal tissue from the upper aerodigestive tract can be subclassified into squamous epithelium muscle and gland with an average AUC of 0.94. After separately training on thyroid tissue the CNN can differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95 92% accuracy 92% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Moreover the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multinodular goiter MNG with an AUC of 0.93. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from MNG with an AUC of 0.91. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multicategory diagnostic information for normal and cancerous head-and-neck tissue and more patient data are needed to fully investigate the potential and reliability of the proposed technique.
