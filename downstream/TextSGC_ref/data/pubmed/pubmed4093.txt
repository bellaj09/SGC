Interest in the function of the inferior parietal lobule IPL has resulted in increased understanding of its involvement in visuospatial and cognitive functioning and its role in semantic networks. A basic understanding of the nuanced white-matter anatomy in this region may be useful in improving outcomes when operating in this region of the brain. We sought to derive the surgical relationship between the IPL and underlying major white-matter bundles by characterizing macroscopic connectivity.
