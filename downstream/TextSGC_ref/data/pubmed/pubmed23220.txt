Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder FASD is associated with a large number of cognitive and sensory-motor deficits. In particular the accurate assessment of sensory-motor deficits in children with FASD is not always simple and relies on clinical assessment tools that may be coarse and subjective. Here we present a new approach: using robotic technology to accurately and objectively assess motor deficits of children with FASD in a center-out reaching task. Sensory-motor deficits in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder assessed using a robotic virtual reality platform.
