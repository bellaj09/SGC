Longer target-to-target intervals TTI produce greater P300 event-related potential amplitude which can increase brain-computer interface BCI classification accuracy and decrease the number of flashes needed for accurate character classification. However longer TTIs requires more time for each trial which will decrease the information transfer rate of BCI. In this paper a P300 BCI using a 7\xa0\xa012 matrix explored new flash patterns 16- 18- and 21-flash pattern with different TTIs to assess the effects of TTI on P300 BCI performance. The new flash patterns were designed to minimize TTI decrease repetition blindness and examine the temporal relationship between each flash of a given stimulus by placing a minimum of one 16-flash pattern two 18-flash pattern or three 21-flash pattern non-target flashes between each target flashes. Online results showed that the 16-flash pattern yielded the lowest classification accuracy among the three patterns. The results also showed that the 18-flash pattern provides a significantly higher information transfer rate ITR than the 21-flash pattern; both patterns provide high ITR and high accuracy for all subjects. Targeting an efficient target-to-target interval for P300 speller brain-computer interfaces.
