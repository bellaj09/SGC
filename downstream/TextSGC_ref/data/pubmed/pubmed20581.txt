"Virtual reality simulation as a teaching method is gaining increased acceptance and presence in institutions of higher learning. This study presents an innovative strategy using the interdisciplinary development of a nonimmersive virtual reality simulation to facilitate interprofessional communication. The purpose of this pilot project was to describe nursing students attitudes related to interprofessional communication following the collaborative development of a disaster triage virtual reality simulation. Collaboration between and among professionals is integral in enhancing patient outcomes. In addition ineffective communication is linked to detrimental patient outcomes especially during times of high stress. Poor communication has been identified as the root cause of the majority of negative sentinel events occurring in hospitals. The simulation-development teaching model proved useful in fostering interprofessional communication and mastering course content. Mean scores on the KidSIM Attitudes Towards Teamwork in Training Undergoing Designed Educational Simulation survey demonstrated that nursing students after simulation experiencehad agreement to strong agreement inall areas surveyed including interprofessional education communication roles and responsibilities of team members and situational awareness. The findings indicate that students value interprofessional teamwork and the opportunity to work with other disciplines."
