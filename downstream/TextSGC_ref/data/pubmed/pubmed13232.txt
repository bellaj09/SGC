"Detecting and monitoring of abnormal movement behaviors in patients with Parkinsons Disease PD and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders ASD are beneficial for adjusting care and medical treatment in order to improve the patients quality of life. Supervised methods commonly used in the literature need annotation of data which is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper we propose deep normative modeling as a probabilistic novelty detection method in which we model the distribution of normal human movements recorded by wearable sensors and try to detect abnormal movements in patients with PD and ASD in a novelty detection framework. In the proposed deep normative model a movement disorder behavior is treated as an extreme of the normal range or equivalently as a deviation from the normal movements. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms one-class SVM and the reconstruction-based novelty detection approaches. Our contribution opens the door toward modeling normal human movements during daily activities using wearable sensors and eventually real-time abnormal movement detection in neuro-developmental and neuro-degenerative disorders."
