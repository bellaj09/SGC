The mechanisms of action of anaesthetics on the living brain are still poorly understood. In this respect the analysis of the differential effects of anaesthetics on spontaneous and sensory-evoked cortical activity might provide important and novel cues. Here we show that the anaesthetic sevoflurane strongly silences the brain but potentiates in a dose- and frequency-dependent manner the cortical visual response. Such enhancement arises from a linear scaling by sevoflurane of the power-law relation between light intensity and the cortical response. The fingerprint of sevoflurane action suggests that circuit silencing can boost linearly synaptic responsiveness presumably by scaling the number of responding units and/or their correlation following a sensory stimulation. Linear transformation of the encoding mechanism for light intensity underlies the paradoxical enhancement of cortical visual responses by sevoflurane.
