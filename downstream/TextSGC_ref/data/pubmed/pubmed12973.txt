"In this study we investigated the neural substrates involved in visual working memory WM and the resulting effects of subthalamic nucleus STN stimulation in Parkinsons disease PD. Cerebral activation revealed by positron emission tomography was compared among Parkinson patients with PD-ON or without PD-OFF STN stimulation and a group of control subjects CT in two visual WM tasks with spatial SP and nonspatial NSP components. PD-OFF patients displayed significant reaction time RT deficits for both memory tasks. Although there were no significant differences in RT between patients with PD-ON and -OFF stimulation patients with PD-ON stimulation performed comparably to controls. The memory tasks were executed with normal error rates in PD-ON and -OFF stimulation. In contrast to these behavioral results whether the corresponding prefrontal activation was differentially affected by deep brain stimulation status in patients depended on whether the WM modality was SP versus NSP. Thus SP WM was associated with 1 abnormal reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal activity in PD-OFF and -ON stimulation and 2 abnormal overactivation in parieto-temporal cortex in PD-OFF and in limbic circuits in PD-ON stimulation. In NSP WM normal activation of the ventral prefrontal cortex was restored in PD-ON stimulation. In both visual modalities the posterior cerebral regions including fusiform cortex and cerebellum displayed abnormally reduced activity in PD. These results indicate that PD induces a prefrontal hypoactivation that STN stimulation can partially restore in a modality selective manner by additional recruitment of limbic structures in SP WM or by recovery of the ventral prefrontal activation in NSP WM."
