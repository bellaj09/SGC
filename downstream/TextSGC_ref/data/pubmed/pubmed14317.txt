"Accurate classification of Alzheimers disease AD and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment MCI plays a critical role in possibly preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients. Among many research tasks it is of a particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition we incorporated stability selection an adaptive learning factor and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis improving the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical deep learning methods."
