"This article describes the development and implementation of a Prototype Procedural Simulator for Nursing Education for Intravenous. With a private gift from alumni the faculty of the Nursing Department at the State University of New York worked with the firm High Techsplantions Rockville Maryland to develop a virtual reality simulation to be used to teach student nurses how to insert intravenous needles. Although originally developed for use in nursing education the Prototype Procedural Simulator for Nursing Education for Intravenous can be used in any teaching program in which the students have responsibility for inserting needles into veins eg medical students laboratory technicians emergency medical personnel and physicians assistants." Virtual reality debuts in the teaching laboratory in nursing.
