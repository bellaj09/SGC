"Self-directed learning and evidence-based medicine are becoming increasingly important in medical education. Medical student research projects can enable students to learn research methodologies and critical analysis skills. Medical schools in developed countries have introduced research programmes for medical students. A few medical colleges in developing countries have initiated student research programmes. South Asia has a huge population and massive health problems and research may be helpful in finding solutions. Student research can contribute to the published output of institutions. Research projects can help students to develop critical analysis skills teach them to write for peer-reviewed publications and can foster student-faculty interaction. In Nepal opportunities and funding for research are limited. Principles of scientific research should be taught to students. A community research project should be made compulsory. Funding for research should be boosted and infrastructure strengthened. Faculty members actively involved in research can serve as powerful role models. Marks should be allotted for research projects and students must be encouraged to publish their findings. Publications and projects should be considered during admission to postgraduate courses. Student research should be initiated actively pursued and strengthened." Initiating and strengthening medical student research: time to take up the gauntlet.
