As a hot topic in brain disease prognosis predicting clinical measures of subjects based on brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI data helps to assess the stage of pathology and predict future development of the disease. Due to incomplete clinical labels/scores previous learning-based studies often simply discard subjects without ground-truth scores. This would result in limited training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also existing methods focus only on using hand-crafted features e.g. image intensity or tissue volume of MRI data and these features may not be well coordinated with prediction models. In this paper we propose a weakly supervised densely connected neural network wiseDNN for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically we first extract multiscale image patches located by anatomical landmarks from MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images and then develop a weakly supervised densely connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points for network training. The experimental results on 1469 subjects from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently predict future clinical measures of subjects.
