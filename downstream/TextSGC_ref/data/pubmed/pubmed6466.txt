"Long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and development of complex diseases. Predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations can improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human diseases and help identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis treatment and prevention. Previous research methods have mostly integrated the similarity and association information of lncRNAs and diseases without considering the topological structure information among these nodes which is important for predicting lncRNA-disease associations. We propose a method based on information flow propagation and convolutional neural networks called LDAPred to predict disease-related lncRNAs. LDAPred not only integrates the similarities associations and interactions among lncRNAs diseases and miRNAs but also exploits the topological structures formed by them. In this study we construct a dual convolutional neural network-based framework that comprises the left and right sides. The embedding layer on the left side is established by utilizing lncRNA miRNA and disease-related biological premises. On the right side of the frame multiple types of similarity association and interaction relationships among lncRNAs diseases and miRNAs are calculated based on information flow propagation on the bi-layer networks such as the lncRNA-disease network. They contain the network topological structure and they are learned by the right side of the framework. The experimental results based on five-fold cross-validation indicate that LDAPred performs better than several state-of-the-art methods. Case studies on breast cancer colon cancer and osteosarcoma further demonstrate LDAPreds ability to discover potential lncRNA-disease associations."
