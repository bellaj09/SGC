The neural dust platform uses ultrasonic power and communication to enable a scalable wireless and batteryless system for interfacing with the nervous system. Ultrasound offers several advantages over alternative wireless approaches including a safe method for powering and communicating with sub mm-sized devices implanted deep in tissue. Early studies demonstrated that neural dust motes could wirelessly transmit high-fidelity electrophysiological data in vivo and that theoretically this system could be miniaturized well below the mm-scale. Future developments are focused on further minimization of the platform better encapsulation methods as a path towards truly chronic neural interfaces improved delivery mechanisms stimulation capabilities and finally refinements to enable deployment of neural dust in the central nervous system. Recent advances in neural dust: towards a neural interface platform.
