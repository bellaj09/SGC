Intelligent image-activated cell sorting iIACS is a machine-intelligence technology that performs real-time intelligent image-based sorting of single cells with high throughput. iIACS extends beyond the capabilities of fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS from fluorescence intensity profiles of cells to multidimensional images thereby enabling high-content sorting of cells or cell clusters with unique spatial chemical and morphological traits. Therefore iIACS serves as an integral part of holistic single-cell analysis by enabling direct links between population-level analysis flow cytometry cell-level analysis microscopy and gene-level analysis sequencing. Specifically iIACS is based on a seamless integration of high-throughput cell microscopy e.g. multicolor fluorescence imaging bright-field imaging cell focusing cell sorting and deep learning on a hybrid software-hardware data management infrastructure enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition data processing intelligent decision making and actuation. Here we provide a practical guide to iIACS that describes how to design build characterize and use an iIACS machine. The guide includes the consideration of several important design parameters such as throughput sensitivity dynamic range image quality sort purity and sort yield; the development and integration of optical microfluidic electrical computational and mechanical components; and the characterization and practical usage of the integrated system. Assuming that all components are readily available a team of several researchers experienced in optics electronics digital signal processing microfluidics mechatronics and flow cytometry can complete this protocol in ~3 months.
