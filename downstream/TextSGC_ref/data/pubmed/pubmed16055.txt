"The development of innovative technology such as virtual reality VR has provided opportunities for promoting physical activity PA in a fun and engaging manner. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in young adults situational motivation SM among immersive VR non-immersive VR and traditional stationary cycling sessions. In all 49 healthy college students 35 females; Mage = 23.6 years SD = 3.4; M%BF = 24.0% SD = 7.5 completed three separate 20 min cycling sessions: 1 immersive VR cycling; 2 non-immersive VR cycling; and 3 traditional cycling. Participants SM was assessed via the situational motivation scale which included four subconstructs: intrinsic motivation identified regulation external regulation and amotivation. Repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant differences for situational motivation between cycling sessions F 2 96 = 4.74-53.04 p < 0.01 p2 = 0.090-0.525. Specifically participants elicited the highest level of intrinsic motivation in immersive VR cycling compared to the other two sessions. Moreover participants in both immersive VR and traditional cycling showed greater identified regulation than the non-immersive VR session. Furthermore participants showed greater external regulation compared to the immersive VR session. In addition greater amotivation was observed in non-immersive VR compared to the immersive VR session. Findings suggested that immersive VR exercise has the potential to be an attractive exercise alternative possibly promoting greater PA participation and adherence among young adults."
