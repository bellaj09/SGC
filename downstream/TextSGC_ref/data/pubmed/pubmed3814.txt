MRI studies show that obese adults have reduced grey matter GM and white matter WM tissue density as well as altered WM integrity. Bariatric surgery can lead to substantial weight loss and improvements in metabolic parameters but it remains to be examined if it induces structural brain changes. The aim of this study was to characterize GM and WM density changes measured with MRI in a longitudinal setting following sleeve gastrectomy and to determine whether any changes are related to inflammation and cardiometabolic blood markers. Neuroanatomical changes in white and grey matter after sleeve gastrectomy.
