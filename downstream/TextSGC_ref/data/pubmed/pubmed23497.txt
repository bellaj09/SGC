The present study is based on the observation that computer-simulated reality applied by virtual reality VR methods may offer a new means of treating male erectile disorders. The experimental design was based on the theory of psychological development supported by multimedia acoustic experience and clinical tests. The method involved the use of virtual reality equipment and specially designed CD-ROM programmes. Excluding 15% drop-outs the success rate was 82% for male erectile disorders due to psychological factors and 84% excluding 17% drop-outs for combined factor disorders. Psychotherapy with VR seems to hasten the healing process and reduce drop-outs suggesting that this method opens or consolidates new or rarely used brain pathways facilitating the flow of new mnemonic associations that promote the satisfaction of natural drives.
