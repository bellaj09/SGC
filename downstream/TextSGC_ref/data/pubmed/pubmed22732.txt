Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Its prevalence calls for innovative rehabilitation methods. The Rutgers Arm is a novel upper extremity rehabilitation system consisting of a low-friction table three-dimensional 3D tracker custom forearm support PC workstation library of Java 3D virtual reality VR exercises clinical database module and a tele-rehabilitation extension. The system was tested on a chronic stroke subject under local and tele-rehabilitation conditions over 5 weeks of training. Results show improvements in arm motor control and shoulder range of motion corresponding to improved Fugl-Meyer test scores. Exercise duration level of difficulty and patient motivation were maintained under tele-rehabilitaion. A 1-week retention trial showed that gains were maintained. The Rutgers Arm a rehabilitation system in virtual reality: a pilot study.
