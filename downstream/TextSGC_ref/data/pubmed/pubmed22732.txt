As the needs of disabled patients are increasingly recognized in society researchers have begun to use single neuron activity to construct brain-computer interfaces BCI designed to facilitate the daily lives of individuals with physical disabilities. BCI systems typically allow users to control computer programs or external devices via signals produced in the motor or pre-motor areas of the brain rather than producing actual motor movements. However impairments in these brain areas can hinder the application of BCI. The current paper demonstrates the feasibility of a one-dimensional 1D machine controlled by rat prefrontal cortex PFC neurons using an encoding method. In this novel system rats are able to quench thirst by varying neuronal firing rate in the PFC to manipulate a water dish that can rotate in 1D. The results revealed that control commands generated by an appropriate firing frequency in rat PFC exhibited performance improvements with practice indicated by increasing water-drinking duration and frequency. These results demonstrated that it is possible for rats to understand an encoding-based BCI system and control a 1D machine using PFC activity to obtain reward.
