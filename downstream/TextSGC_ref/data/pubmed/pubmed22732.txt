Rehabilitation aims to improve hand-arm function upper-limb strength and functional independence that has been impaired by tetraplegia. On the basis of evidence derived from stroke rehabilitation interventions aiming to increase intensity i.e. duration and/or number of movements practiced or alter brain plasticity including motor imagery virtual reality transcranial direct-current or magnetic stimulations; i.e. neuromodulation are now used during tetraplegic rehabilitation. However no meta-analysis has investigated the efficacy of these interventions. Inconclusive efficacy of intervention on upper-limb function after tetraplegia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
