Glioma constitutes the most common type of primary brain tumor with a dismal survival often measured in terms of months or years. The thin line between treatment effectiveness and patient harm underpins the importance of tailoring clinical management to the individual patient. Randomized trials have laid the foundation for many neuro-oncological guidelines. Despite this their findings focus on group-level estimates. Given our current tools we are limited in our ability to guide patients on what therapy is best for them as individuals or even how long they should expect to survive. Machine learning however promises to provide the analytical support for personalizing treatment decisions and deep learning allows clinicians to unlock insight from the vast amount of unstructured data that is collected on glioma patients. Although these novel techniques have achieved astonishing results across a variety of clinical applications significant hurdles remain associated with the implementation of them in clinical practice. Future challenges include the assembly of well-curated cross-institutional datasets improvement of the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing novel evidence-based decision-making with the associated liability of automated inference. Although artificial intelligence already exceeds clinical expertise in a variety of applications clinicians remain responsible for interpreting the implications of and acting upon each prediction.
