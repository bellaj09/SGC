Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs are widely used for brain-computer interfaces. However users experience fatigue due to exposure to flickering stimuli. High-frequency stimulation has been proposed to reduce this problem. We adapt frequency-modulated FM stimulation from the auditory domain where it is commonly used to evoke steady-state responses and compare the EEG as well as behavioral flicker perceptibility ratings. Frequency-modulated steady-state visual evoked potentials: a new stimulation method for brain-computer interfaces.
