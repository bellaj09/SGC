Brain-Computer Interface BCI systems are traditionally designed by taking into account user-specific data to enable practical use. More recently subject independent SI classification algorithms have been developed which bypass the subject specific adaptation and enable rapid use of the system. A brain switch is a particular BCI system where the system is required to distinguish from two separate mental tasks corresponding to the on-off commands of a switch. Such applications require a low false positive rate FPR while having an acceptable response time RT until the switch is activated. In this work we develop a methodology that produces optimal brain switch behavior through subject specific SS adaptation of: a a multitrial prediction combination model and b an SI classification model. We propose a statistical model of combining classifier predictions that enables optimal FPR calibration through a short calibration session. We trained an SI classifier on a training synchronous dataset and tested our method on separate holdout synchronous and asynchronous brain switch experiments. Although our SI model obtained similar performance between training and holdout datasets 86% and 85% for the synchronous and 69% and 66% for the asynchronous the between subject FPR and TPR variability was high up to 62%. The short calibration session was then employed to alleviate that problem and provide decision thresholds that achieve when possible a target FPR=1% with good accuracy for both datasets.
