"Human activity recognition HAR has gained lots of attention in recent years due to its high demand in different domains. In this paper a novel HAR system based on a cascade ensemble learning CELearning model is proposed. Each layer of the proposed model is comprised of Extremely Gradient Boosting Trees XGBoost Random Forest Extremely Randomized Trees ExtraTrees and Softmax Regression and the model goes deeper layer by layer. The initial input vectors sampled from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are trained separately by four different classifiers in the first layer and the probability vectors representing different classes to which each sample belongs are obtained. Both the initial input data and the probability vectors are concatenated together and considered as input to the next layers classifiers and eventually the final prediction is obtained according to the classifiers of the last layer. This system achieved satisfying classification accuracy on two public datasets of HAR based on smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has gained better classification accuracy for HAR compared to existing state-of-the-art methods and the training process of the model is simple and efficient."
