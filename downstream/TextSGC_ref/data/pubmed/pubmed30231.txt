"Parkinsons disease motor symptoms are treated with levodopa but long-term treatment leads to disabling dyskinesia. Altered synaptic transmission and maladaptive plasticity of corticostriatal glutamatergic projections play a critical role in the pathophysiology of dyskinesia. Because the noble gas xenon inhibits excitatory glutamatergic signaling primarily through allosteric antagonism of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors we aimed to test its putative antidyskinetic capabilities. We first studied the direct effect of xenon gas exposure on corticostriatal plasticity in a murine model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia We then studied the impact of xenon inhalation on behavioral dyskinetic manifestations in the gold-standard rat and primate models of PD and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Last we studied the effect of xenon inhalation on axial gait and posture deficits in a primate model of PD with levodopa-induced dyskinesia. This study shows that xenon gas exposure 1 normalized synaptic transmission and reversed maladaptive plasticity of corticostriatal glutamatergic projections associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesia 2 ameliorated dyskinesia in rat and nonhuman primate models of PD and dyskinesia and 3 improved gait performance in a nonhuman primate model of PD. These results pave the way for clinical testing of this unconventional but safe approach.  2018 The Authors.
