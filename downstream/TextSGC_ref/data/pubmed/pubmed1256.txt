During COVID-19 outbreak there are discordant opinion towards the impact on biologics in psoriatic patients. Thus we performed a single center case-control study in Lombardia the Italian region with the higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. We enrolled 1193 PsO patients treated with biologics and small molecules and we used the entire Lombardia population as controls. Notably 17 PsO patients COVID-19 confirmed were quarantined at home and 5 hospitalized no PsO patients were admitted to intensive care unit ICU or died. With respect to the general population of Lombardy patients on biologics were at higher risk to be symptomatic for COVID-19 OR 3.43 95%CI 2.25-5.73 P\xa0< 0.0001 to be self-quarantined at home OR 9.05 95%CI 5.61-14.61 P\xa0< 0.0001 and hospitalized OR 3.59 95%CI 1.49-8.63 P\xa0= 0.0044 however not increased risk of ICU admission or death were found. PsO Patients on biologics should be carefully monitored with telemedicine during COVID-19 outbreak and early treated at home to limit hospital overwhelm. This article is protected by copyright.
