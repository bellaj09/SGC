"Moving platform are introduced in the field of the study of posturography since 70 years. Commercial platforms have some limits: a limited number of degrees of freedom; preconfigured protocols and usually they are expensive. In order to overcome these limits we developed a robotized platform: DORIS. We aimed at realizing a versatile solution that can be applied both for research purpose but also for personalizing the training of equilibrium and gait. We reached these goals by means of a Stewart platform that was realized with linear actuators and a supporting plate. Each actuator is provided by a monoaxial ad hoc built load cell. Position and force control allow a multipurpose range of movement and a reactive interaction with the force applied by the subject. TCP/IP protocol guarantees the communication between the platform and other systems. Therefore we integrated DORIS with motion analysis system EMG system and virtual reality. The adopted solution offers the opportunity to manipulate available information by means of different coupling of visual vestibular and plantar feet pressure inputs. The full control of its movement and of human dynamic interaction is a further benefit for the identification of innovative solutions for research and physical rehabilitation in a field that is strongly investigated but still open."
