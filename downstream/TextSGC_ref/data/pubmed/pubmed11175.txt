Is there a difference in surgery time and complication rate when Doppler ultrasound US is used for the preoperative mapping of perforators in comparison with computer tomography angiography CTA? Women who were candidates for breast reconstruction using the deep inferior epigastric perforator DIEP free flap were enrolled in a prospective randomized study. The operating time was 249  62 min mean  SD in the CTA group n = 32 and 255 min  75 in the US group n = 31--hence a difference of 6 min on average. No flaps were lost. Sixteen complications occurred in 15 patients: seven in the CTA group and nine in the US group. Complications were remedied without delay and all patients came through with a favorable reconstruction. Preoperative mapping of perforators with US is satisfactory enough provided the microsurgery team has proper experience in breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap.
