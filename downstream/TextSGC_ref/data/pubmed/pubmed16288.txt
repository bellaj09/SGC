"As virtual reality technology continues to attract significant attention in clinical psychology especially in the treatment of phobias physiological monitoring is increasingly considered as an objective measurement tool for studying participants. There are few studies however of the normal physiological response to virtual environments or reactions to different virtual environments. The goal of this study is to analyze nonphobic participants physiological reactions to two virtual environments: driving and flying. Eleven nonphobic participants were exposed to each virtual environment for 15 min. Heart rate skin resistance and skin temperature were measured during physiological monitoring and the Presence and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores were obtained after each exposure. This study found that skin resistance and heart rate variability can be used to show arousal of participants exposed to the virtual environment experience and that such measures generally returned to normal over time. The data suggest that skin resistance and heart rate can be used as objective measures in monitoring the reaction of non-phobic participants to virtual environments. We also noted that heart rate variability could be useful for assessing the emotional states of participants."
