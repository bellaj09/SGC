With the growing importance of three-dimensional and very large field of view imaging acquisition time becomes a serious bottleneck. Additionally dose reduction is of importance when imaging material like biological tissue that is sensitive to electron radiation. Random sparse scanning can be used in the combination with image reconstruction techniques to reduce the acquisition time or electron dose in scanning electron microscopy. In this study we demonstrate a workflow that includes data acquisition on a scanning electron microscope followed by a sparse image reconstruction based on compressive sensing or alternatively using neural networks. Neuron structures are automatically segmented from the reconstructed images using deep learning techniques. We show that the average dwell time per pixel can be reduced by a factor of 2-3 thereby providing a real-life confirmation of previous results on simulated data in one of the key segmentation applications in connectomics and thus demonstrating the feasibility and benefit of random sparse scanning techniques for a specific real-world scenario.
