"Peripersonal space PPS is created by a multisensory interaction between different sensory modalities and can be modified by experience. In this article we investigated whether an auditory training inside the peripersonal space area can modify the PPS around the head in sighted participants. The auditory training was based on echolocation. We measured the participants reaction times to a tactile stimulation on the neck while task-irrelevant looming auditory stimuli were presented. Sounds more strongly affect tactile processing when located within a limited distance from the body. We measured spatially dependent audio-tactile interaction as a proxy of PPS representation before and after an echolocation training. We found a significant speeding effect on tactile RTs after echolocation specifically when sounds where around the location where the echolocation task was performed. This effect could not be attributed to a task repetition effect nor to a shift of spatial attention as no changes of PPS were found in two control groups of participants who performed the PPS task after either a break or a temporal auditory task with stimuli located at the same position of echolocation task. These findings show that echolocation affects multisensory processing inside PPS representation likely to better represent the space where external stimuli have to be localized."
