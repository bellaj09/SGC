This paper proposes a novel fixed low-rank spatial filter estimation for brain computer interface BCI systems with an application that recognizes emotions elicited by movies. The proposed approach unifies such tasks as feature extraction feature selection and classification which are often independently tackled in a "bottom-up" manner under a regularized loss minimization problem. The loss function is explicitly derived from the conventional BCI approach and solves its minimization by optimization with a nonconvex fixed low-rank constraint. For evaluation an experiment was conducted to induce emotions by movies for dozens of young adult subjects and estimated the emotional states using the proposed method. The advantage of the proposed method is that it combines feature selection feature extraction and classification into a monolithic optimization problem with a fixed low-rank regularization which implicitly estimates optimal spatial filters. The proposed method shows competitive performance against the best CSP-based alternatives.
