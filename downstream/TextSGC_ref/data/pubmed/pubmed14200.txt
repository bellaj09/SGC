"Regular crack inspection of tunnels is essential to guarantee their safe operation. At present the manual detection method is time-consuming subjective and even dangerous while the automatic detection method is relatively inaccurate. Detecting tunnel cracks is a challenging task since cracks are tiny and there are many noise patterns in the tunnel images. This study proposes a deep learning algorithm based on U-Net and a convolutional neural network with alternately updated clique CliqueNet called U-CliqueNet to separate cracks from background in the tunnel images. A consumer-grade DSC-WX700 camera SONY Wuxi China was used to collect 200 original images then cracks are manually marked and divided into sub-images with a resolution of 496  496 pixels. A total of 60000 sub-images were obtained in the dataset of tunnel cracks among which 50000 were used for training and 10000 were used for testing. The proposed framework conducted training and testing on this dataset the mean pixel accuracy MPA mean intersection over union MIoU precision and F1-score are 92.25% 86.96% 86.32% and 83.40% respectively. We compared the U-CliqueNet with fully convolutional networks FCN U-net Encoder-decoder network SegNet and the multi-scale fusion crack detection MFCD algorithm using hypothesis testing and its proved that the MIoU predicted by U-CliqueNet was significantly higher than that of the other four algorithms. The area length and mean width of cracks can be calculated and the relative error between the detected mean crack width and the actual mean crack width ranges from -11.20% to 18.57%. The results show that this framework can be used for fast and accurate crack semantic segmentation of tunnel images."
