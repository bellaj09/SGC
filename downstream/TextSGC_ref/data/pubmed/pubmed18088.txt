The author\s starting point is a psychoanalysis conducted with Emile a teenager who was unable to form close relationships and was living in a virtual world planning a school massacre. For him virtual reality functioned as a bottomless container in which he was no longer a victim of bullying but rather a god. When the boundlessness of cyberspace encounters a "black hole" in the psyche any fantasies can be put into virtual realization and actions. By recounting his wickedness violence destructiveness and perversion Emile could start restoring his self boundaries and create his own autobiographical narrative. Unable to sustain the pain of mourning his envelope of invulnerability and omnipotence however he prematurely terminated analysis. Emile or on devastation: when virtual boundlessness meets inner emptiness.
