"Mandible angle fractures can be exceedingly difficult to manage and are associated with the highest complication rate of all mandible fractures. Although technically demanding minimally invasive plate repair of angle fractures offers minimal morbidity and effective fragment stabilization while providing optimal aesthetic outcome. Although minimally invasive fixation provides attractive results full mobilization of the operative site is often substantially limited by the inherent nature of local masseteric and deeper tissues. Although access limitations often prompt creation of an additional facial incision trocar withdrawal into subcutaneous tissue followed by repositioning and deep tissue penetration greatly enhances operative mobility. Although this modification may seem simple the senior authors experience at several outside institutions demonstrates that surgeons will all-too-often resort to additional facial incisions when access is severely limited. In review of our 5-year experience with minimally invasive angle repair this straightforward innovation significantly decreased operative challenge improved instrument range-of-motion and eased the steep learning curve of these often-difficult procedures."
