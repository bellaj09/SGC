Reaching and grasping parameters with and without haptic feedback were characterized in people with chronic post-stroke behaviors. Twelve 67  10 years individuals with chronic stroke and arm/hand paresis Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Arm:  46/66 pts participated. Three dimensional 3-D temporal and spatial kinematics of reaching and grasping movements to three objects can: cylindrical grasp; screwdriver: power grasp; pen: precision grasp in a physical environment PE with and without additional haptic feedback and a 3-D virtual environment VE with haptic feedback were recorded. Participants reached grasped and transported physical and virtual objects using similar movement strategies in all conditions. Reaches made in VE were less smooth and slower compared to the PE. Arm and trunk kinematics were similar in both environments and glove conditions. For grasping stroke subjects preserved aperture scaling to object size but used wider hand apertures with longer delays between times to maximal reaching velocity and maximal grasping aperture. Wearing the glove decreased reaching velocity. Our results in a small group of subjects suggest that providing haptic information in the VE did not affect the validity of reaching and grasping movement. Small disparities in movement parameters between environments may be due to differences in perception of object distance in VE. Reach-to-grasp kinematics to smaller objects may be improved by better 3-D rendering. Comparable kinematics between environments and conditions is encouraging for the incorporation of high quality VEs in rehabilitation programs aimed at improving upper limb recovery.
