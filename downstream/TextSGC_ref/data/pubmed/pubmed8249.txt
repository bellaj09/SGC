Deep learning architectures have recently demonstrated their power in predicting DNA- and RNA-binding specificity. Existing methods fall into three classes: Some are based on convolutional neural networks CNNs others use recurrent neural networks RNNs and others rely on hybrid architectures combining CNNs and RNNs. However based on existing studies the relative merit of the various architectures remains unclear.
