This study aims to develop a Steady State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP-based Brain Computer Interface BCI system to control a wheelchair with improving accuracy as the major goal. The developed wheelchair can move in forward backward left right and stop positions. Four different flickering frequencies in the low frequency region were used to elicit the SSVEPs and were displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display LCD monitor using LabVIEW. Four colours green red blue and violet were included in the study to investigate the colour influence in SSVEPs. The Electroencephalogram EEG signals recorded from the occipital region were first segmented into 1\u2009s windows and features were extracted by using Fast Fourier Transform FFT. Three different classifiers two based on Artificial Neural Network ANN and one based on Support Vector Machine SVM were compared to yield better accuracy. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment and the accuracy was calculated by considering the number of correct detections produced while performing a pre-defined movement sequence. SSVEP with violet colour showed higher performance than green and red. The One-Against-All OAA based multi-class SVM classifier showed better accuracy than the ANN classifiers. The classification accuracy over 20 subjects varies between 75-100% while information transfer rates ITR varies from 12.13-27 bpm for BCI wheelchair control with SSVEPs elicited by violet colour stimuli and classified using OAA-SVM.
