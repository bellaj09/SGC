Interactions among cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters are main driving forces shaping context-specific chromatin structure and gene expression. Although there have been computational methods for predicting gene expression from genomic and epigenomic information most of them neglect long-range enhancer-promoter interactions due to the difficulty in precisely linking regulatory enhancers to target genes. Recently HiChIP a novel high-throughput experimental approach has generated comprehensive data on high-resolution interactions between promoters and distal enhancers. Moreover plenty of studies suggest that deep learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in epigenomic signal prediction and thus promoting the understanding of regulatory elements. In consideration of these two factors we integrate proximal promoter sequences and HiChIP distal enhancer-promoter interactions to accurately predict gene expression.
