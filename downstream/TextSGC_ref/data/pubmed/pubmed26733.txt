To propose a reliable and robust Brain-Computer Interface BCI efficient machine learning and signal processing methods have to be used. However it is often necessary to have a sufficient number of labeled brain responses to create a model. A large database that would represent all of the possible variabilities of the signal is not always possible to obtain because calibration sessions have to be short. In the case of BCIs based on the detection of event-related potentials ERPs we propose to tackle this problem by including additional deformed patterns in the training database to increase the number of labeled brain responses. The creation of the additional deformed patterns is based on two approaches: i smooth deformation fields and ii right and left shifted signals. The evaluation is performed with data from 10 healthy subjects participating in a P300 speller experiment. The results show that small shifts of the signal allow a better estimation of both spatial filters and a linear classifier. The best performance AUC=0.828  0.061 is obtained by combining the smooth deformation fields and the shifts after spatial filtering compared to AUC=0.543  0.025 without additional deformed patterns. The results support the conclusion that adding signals with small deformations can significantly improve the performance of single-trial detection when the amount of training data is limited.
