The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has a drastic impact on national healthcare systems. Given the overwhelming demand of facility capacity the impact on all healthcare sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff intensive care units and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. In addition the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending non-urgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic PCR-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally more specific aspects e.g. screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs were included in our analysis. This study offers a novel approach on informed guidance for healthcare management when a priori no scientific evidence is available.
