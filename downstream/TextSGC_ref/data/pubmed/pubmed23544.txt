This article is a methodical report on the generation of reproducible changes in brain activity in a murine model. Somatosensory evoked potentials SEP are used to generate synchronized cortical activity. After electrical stimulation of mice forelimbs the potentials were recorded with a flexible thin-film polyimide electrode structure directly from the cortex. Every registration included a simultaneous recording from both hemispheres that repeated four times to reproduce and compare the results. The SEPs in the murine model were shown to generate a very stable signal. The latency of the second positive wave P2 wave ranged between 16 and 19 ms and the N1-P2 amplitude ranged between 39 and 48 V. In addition the temperature distribution of the cortex was acquired using infrared thermography. Surface cortical temperature changed during electrical stimulation without a clear hemispheric correlation. These initial results could be a step toward a better understanding of the different synchronized cortical activities and basic methods of evaluation of various mathematical algorithms to detect them. SEP-induced activity and its thermographic cortical representation in a murine model.
