Offspring of parents with bipolar disorder OBP are at increased risk to develop bipolar disorder BD. Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity rsFC have been identified in OBP; however replication has been limited and correlation with person-level risk is unknown. A recent study found reduced rsFC between left inferior frontal gyrus IFG and clusters in the left insula LINS lentiform nucleus LENT and midcingulate cortex MCING in OBP Roberts et al. 2017; here we aim to extend these findings to at-risk youth. We scanned a subset of the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study a longitudinal study of OBP and community controls. Twenty-four OBP 20 offspring of control parents with non-bipolar psychopathology OCP and 27 healthy controls HC had acceptable rsFC data. After preprocessing steps we assessed group differences in seed-based rsFC between the IFG and target clusters LINS LENT MCING using multivariate regression. Next we tested whether rsFC correlated with person-level risk score and with other dimensional measures. We did not find group differences in rsFC between IFG and target regions. Within OBP risk score negatively correlated with IFG-LINS rsFC p\u2009= 0.002. Across groups mood lability correlated negatively with rsFC between IFG and target regions p\u2009=\u20090.0002 due to negative correlation with IFG-LINS p\u2009=\u20090.0003 and IFG-MCING p\u2009=\u20090.001 rsFC. While group-level differences were not replicated IFG-LINS rsFC was negatively correlated with a person-level risk score in OBP and with mood lability a predictor of BD across the sample. Thus IFG-LINS rsFC might constitute a risk marker within OBP for the development of BD. Intrinsic functional connectivity correlates of person-level risk for bipolar disorder in offspring of affected parents.
