Aim: This study was designed to investigate the effects of virtual reality VR through Kinect on both gross and fine motor functions and independence in daily living activities in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy USCP. Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Sixty children with USCP were randomized and split equally between the VR intervention group 10 females and 20 males with a mean age of 10.5\u2009\u20093.62 years and the traditional occupational therapy TOT intervention group 13 females and 17 males with a mean age of 10.06\u2009\u20093.24 years. Both groups were evaluated in terms of motor functioning via the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Short Form BOTMP-SF and were assessed in accordance with independence in daily activities via the WeeFunctional Independence Measure WeeFIM. Interventions were conducted for 8 weeks with the main objective of improving motor functions and independence in daily activities. Results: Total motor functions and total independence in daily lives in both groups improved after 8 weeks of intervention. A comparison between groups revealed significantly greater improvements in both gross and fine motor functions and daily activities in the VR group than in the TOT group P\u2009<\u20090.001. Conclusion: The Kinect-based VR intervention approach is important to improving motor functions and independence in daily activities of children with USCP.
