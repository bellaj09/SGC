Protein glycosylation is known to be involved in biological progresses such as cell recognition growth differentiation and apoptosis. Fucosylation\xa0of glycoproteins plays an important role for structural stability and function of N-linked glycoproteins. Although many of biological and clinical studies of protein fucosylation by fucosyltransferases has been reported structural classification of fucosylated N-glycoproteins such as core or outer isoforms remains a challenge. Here we report for the first time the classification of N-glycopeptides as core- and outer-fucosylated types using tandem mass spectrometry MS/MS and machine learning algorithms such as the deep neural network DNN and support vector machine SVM. Training and test sets of more than 800 MS/MS spectra of N-glycopeptides from the immunoglobulin gamma and alpha 1-acid-glycoprotein standards were selected for classification of the fucosylation types using supervised learning models. The best-performing model had an accuracy of more than 99% against manual characterization and area under the curve values greater than 0.99 which were calculated by probability scores from target and decoy datasets. Finally this model was applied to classify fucosylated N-glycoproteins from human plasma. A total of 82N-glycopeptides with 54 core- 24 outer- and 4 dual-fucosylation types derived from 54 glycoproteins were commonly classified as the same type in both the DNN and SVM. Specifically outer fucosylation was dominant in tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycopeptides while core fucosylation was dominant in the mono- bi-antennary and hybrid types of N-glycoproteins in human plasma. Thus the machine learning methods can be combined with MS/MS to distinguish between different isoforms of fucosylated N-glycopeptides.
