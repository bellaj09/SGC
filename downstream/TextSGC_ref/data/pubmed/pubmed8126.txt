Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized investigation of the small bowel. However this technique produces a video that is 8-10 hours long so analysis is time consuming for gastroenterologists. Deep convolutional neural networks CNNs can recognize specific images among a large variety. We aimed to develop a CNN-based algorithm to assist in the evaluation of small bowel capsule endoscopy SB-CE images. Gastroenterologist-Level Identification of Small-Bowel Diseases\xa0and Normal Variants by Capsule Endoscopy Using a Deep-Learning Model.
