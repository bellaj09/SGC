While drug combination therapies are a well-established concept in cancer treatment identifying novel synergistic combinations is challenging due to the size of combinatorial space. However computational approaches have emerged as a time- and cost-efficient way to prioritize combinations to test based on recently available large-scale combination screening data. Recently Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. However Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction which is the approach we present here termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity and conical layers to model drug synergies.
