The current trend to use Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs with mobile devices mandates the development of efficient EEG data processing methods. In this paper we demonstrate the performance of a Principal Component Analysis PCA ensemble classifier for P300-based spellers. We recorded EEG data from multiple subjects using the Emotiv neuroheadset in the context of a classical oddball P300 speller paradigm. We compare the performance of the proposed ensemble classifier to the performance of traditional feature extraction and classifier methods. Our results demonstrate the capability of the PCA ensemble classifier to classify P300 data recorded using the Emotiv neuroheadset with an average accuracy of 86.29% on cross-validation data. In addition offline testing of the recorded data reveals an average classification accuracy of 73.3% that is significantly higher than that achieved using traditional methods. Finally we demonstrate the effect of the parameters of the P300 speller paradigm on the performance of the method.
