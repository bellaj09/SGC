There is a critical need for better analytical methods to study mitochondria in normal and diseased states. Mitochondrial image analysis is typically done on still images using slow manual methods or automated methods of limited types of features. MitoMo integrated software overcomes these bottlenecks by automating rapid unbiased quantitative analysis of mitochondrial morphology texture motion and morphogenesis and advances machine-learning classification to predict cell health by combining features. Our pixel-based approach for motion analysis evaluates the magnitude and direction of motion of: 1 molecules within mitochondria 2 individual mitochondria and 3 distinct morphological classes of mitochondria. MitoMo allows analysis of mitochondrial morphogenesis in time-lapse videos to study early progression of cellular stress. Biological applications are presented including: 1 establishing normal phenotypes of mitochondria in different cell types; 2 quantifying stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion in cells treated with an environmental toxicant 3 tracking morphogenesis in mitochondria undergoing swelling and 4 evaluating early changes in cell health when morphological abnormalities are not apparent. MitoMo unlocks new information on mitochondrial phenotypes and dynamics by enabling deep analysis of mitochondrial features in any cell type and can be applied to a broad spectrum of research problems in cell biology drug testing toxicology and medicine.
