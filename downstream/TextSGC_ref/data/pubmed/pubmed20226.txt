The study of gait at self-selected speed is important. Traditional gait laboratories being relatively limited in space provide insufficient path length while treadmill TM walking compromises natural gait by imposing speed variables. Self-paced SP walking can be realized on TM using feedback-controlled belt speed. We compared over ground walking vs. SP TM in two self-selected gait speed experiments: without visual flow and while subjects were immersed in a virtual reality VR environment inducing natural visual flow. Self-selected gait speed--over ground versus self-paced treadmill walking a solution for a paradox.
