Ligand-binding proteins play key roles in many biological processes. Identification of protein-ligand binding residues is important in understanding the biological functions of proteins. Existing computational methods can be roughly categorized as sequence-based or 3D-structure-based methods. All these methods are based on traditional machine learning. In a series of binding residue prediction tasks 3D-structure-based methods are widely superior to sequence-based methods. However due to the great number of proteins with known amino acid sequences sequence-based methods have considerable room for improvement with the development of deep learning. Therefore prediction of protein-ligand binding residues with deep learning requires study. Predicting protein-ligand binding residues with deep convolutional neural networks.
