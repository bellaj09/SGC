"Prediction of kidney function and chronic kidney disease CKD through kidney ultrasound imaging has long been considered desirable in clinical practice because of its safety convenience and affordability. However this highly desirable approach is beyond the capability of human vision. We developed a deep learning approach for automatically determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR and CKD status. We exploited the transfer learning technique integrating the powerful ResNet model pretrained on an ImageNet dataset in our neural network architecture to predict kidney function based on 4505 kidney ultrasound images labeled using eGFRs derived from serum creatinine concentrations. To further extract the information from ultrasound images we leveraged kidney length annotations to remove the peripheral region of the kidneys and applied various data augmentation schemes to produce additional data with variations. Bootstrap aggregation was also applied to avoid overfitting and improve the models generalization. Moreover the kidney function features obtained by our deep neural network were used to identify the CKD status defined by an eGFR of <60\u2009ml/min/1.73\u2009m2. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.741 indicated the strong relationship between artificial intelligence AI- and creatinine-based GFR estimations. Overall CKD status classification accuracy of our model was 85.6% -higher than that of experienced nephrologists 60.3%-80.1%. Our model is the first fundamental step toward realizing the potential of transforming kidney ultrasound imaging into an effective real-time distant screening tool. AI-GFR estimation offers the possibility of noninvasive assessment of kidney function a key goal of AI-powered functional automation in clinical practice."
