"Keeping a certain level of physical activity has beneficial effects on the body itself but also surprisingly on cognition: specifically physical high-intensity intermittent aerobic exercise HIE can show improvement on cognitive executive functions. Although in some cases performing strength or aerobic training is problematic or not feasible. Immersive virtual reality IVR can induce the illusory feeling of ownership and agency over a moving virtual body therefore showing comparable physiological reactions: for example if an individual is sitting on a chair but his virtual body climbs a hill the individuals heart rate increases coherently as if he is actually walking. In this study we investigate whether this same illusion can show beneficial consequences on the body as well as on executive functions using the color-word matching Stroop task and on its neural substrates using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS." Virtual training leads to real acute physical cognitive and neural benefits on healthy adults: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
