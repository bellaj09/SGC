This article reviews research into the use of virtual reality in the study assessment and treatment of body image disturbances in eating disorders and nonclinical samples. During the last decade virtual reality has emerged as a technology that is especially suitable not only for the assessment of body image disturbances but also for its treatment. Indeed several virtual environment-based software systems have been developed for this purpose. Furthermore virtual reality seems to be a good alternative to guided imagery and in vivo exposure and is therefore very useful for studies that require exposure to life-like situations but which are difficult to conduct in the real world. Nevertheless review highlights the lack of published controlled studies and the presence of methodological drawbacks that should be considered in future studies. This article also discusses the implications of the results obtained and proposes directions for future research. The use of virtual reality in the study assessment and treatment of body image in eating disorders and nonclinical samples: a review of the literature.
