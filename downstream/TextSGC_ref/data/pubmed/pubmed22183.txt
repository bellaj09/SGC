Intracortical microelectrodes afford researchers an effective tool to precisely monitor neural spiking activity. Additionally intracortical microelectrodes have the ability to return function to individuals with paralysis as part of a brain computer interface. Unfortunately the neural signals recorded by these electrodes degrade over time. Many strategies which target the biological and/or materials mediating failure modes of this decline of function are currently under investigation. The goal of this study is to identify a precise cellular target for future intervention to sustain chronic intracortical microelectrode performance. Previous work from our lab has indicated that the Cluster of Differentiation 14/Toll-like receptor pathway CD14/TLR is a viable target to improve chronic laminar silicon intracortical microelectrode recordings. Here we use a mouse bone marrow chimera model to selectively knockout CD14 an innate immune receptor from either brain resident microglia or blood-derived macrophages in order to understand the most effective targets for future therapeutic options. Using single-unit recordings we demonstrate that inhibiting CD14 from the blood-derived macrophages improves recording quality over the 16 week long study. We conclude that targeting CD14 in blood-derived cells should be part of the strategy to improve the performance of intracortical microelectrodes and that the daunting task of delivering therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier may not be needed to increase intracortical microelectrode performance. Targeting CD14 on blood derived cells improves intracortical microelectrode performance.
