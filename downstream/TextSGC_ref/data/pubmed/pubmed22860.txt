In the present multiple case study we examined hemodynamic changes in the brain in response to motor execution ME and motor imagery MI of swallowing in dysphagia patients compared to healthy matched controls using near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS. Two stroke patients with cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere two stroke patients with lesions in the brainstem and two neurologically healthy control subjects actively swallowed saliva ME and mentally imagined to swallow saliva MI in a randomized order while changes in concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin oxy-Hb and deoxygenated hemoglobin deoxy-Hb were assessed. In line with recent findings in healthy young adults MI and ME of swallowing led to the strongest NIRS signal change in the inferior frontal gyrus in stroke patients as well as in healthy elderly. We found differences in the topographical distribution and time course of the hemodynamic response in dependence on lesion location. Dysphagia patients with lesions in the brainstem showed bilateral hemodynamic signal changes in the inferior frontal gyrus during active swallowing comparable to healthy controls. In contrast dysphagia patients with cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere showed more unilateral activation patterns during swallowing. Furthermore patients with cerebral lesions showed a prolonged time course of the hemodynamic response during MI and ME of swallowing compared to healthy controls and patients with brainstem lesions. Brain activation patterns associated with ME and MI of swallowing were largely comparable especially for changes in deoxy-Hb. Hence the present results provide new evidence regarding timing and topographical distribution of the hemodynamic response during ME and MI of swallowing in dysphagia patients and may have practical impact on future dysphagia treatment.
