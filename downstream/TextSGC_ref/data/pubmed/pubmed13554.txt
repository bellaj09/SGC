"Human reasoning is characterized by psychological essentialism Gelman in The essential child: origins of essentialism in everyday thought. Oxford University Press New York 2003: when reasoning about objects we distinguish between deep essential properties defining the objects kind and identity and merely superficial features that can be changed without altering the objects identity. To date it is unclear whether psychological essentialism is based on the acquisition of linguistic means such as kind terms and therefore uniquely human or whether it is a more fundamental cognitive capacity which might be present also in the absence of language. In the present study we addressed this question by testing whether and if so under which circumstances non-human apes also rely on psychological essentialism to identify objects. For this purpose we adapted classical verbal transformation scenarios used in research on psychological essentialism Keil in Concepts kinds and cognitive development. MIT Press Cambridge 1989 and implemented them in two nonverbal tasks: first a box task typically used to test object individuation Experiment 1 and second an object choice task typically used to test object discrimination object preferences and logical inferences Experiments 2-4. Taken together the results of the four experiments suggest that under suitable circumstances when memory and other task demands are minimized great apes engage in basic forms of essentialist reasoning. Psychological essentialism is thus possible also in the absence of language." Are apes essentialists? Scope and limits of psychological essentialism in great apes.
