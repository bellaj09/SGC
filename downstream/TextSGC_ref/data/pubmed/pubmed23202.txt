"The accuracy of brain-computer interfaces BCIs is important for effective communication and control. The mu-based BCI is one of the widely used systems of which the related methods to improve users accuracy is still poorly studied. Here we examined the way to enhance the mu-based BCI performance by rhythmic electrical stimulation on the ulnar nerve at the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency 10 Hz during the left-and right-hand motor imagery. Time-frequency analysis spectral analysis and discriminant analysis were performed on the electroencephalograph EEG data before and after the intervention of electrical stimulation in 9 healthy subjects. We found that the ERD/S on the somatosensory and motor cortex during left-or right-hand imagination was more obvious at the mu rhythm after intervention. Furthermore average classification accuracy between left-and right-hand imagery significantly increased from 78.43% to 88.17% after intervention suggesting that the electrical stimulation at alpha frequency effectively regulates the brains mu rhythm and enhances the discriminability of the left-hand and right-hand imagination tasks. These results provide evidence that the electrical stimulation at the alpha frequency is an effective way to improve the mu-based BCI performance."
