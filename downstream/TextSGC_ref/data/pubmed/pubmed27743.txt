"In brain-computer interface BCI research systems based on event-related potentials ERP are considered particularly successful and robust. This stems in part from the repeated stimulation which counteracts the low signal-to-noise ratio in electroencephalograms. Repeated stimulation leads to an optimization problem as more repetitions also cost more time. The optimal number of repetitions thus represents a data-dependent trade-off between the stimulation time and the obtained accuracy. Several methods for dealing with this have been proposed as early stopping dynamic stopping or adaptive stimulation. Despite their high potential for BCI systems at the patients bedside those methods are typically ignored in current BCI literature. The goal of the current study is to assess the benefit of these methods." Optimizing event-related potential based brain-computer interfaces: a systematic evaluation of dynamic stopping methods.
