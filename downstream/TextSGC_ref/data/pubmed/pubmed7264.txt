"Deep neural networks DNNs provide useful models of visual representational transformations. We present a method that enables a DNN student to learn from the internal representational spaces of a reference model teacher which could be another DNN or in the future a biological brain. Representational spaces of the student and the teacher are characterized by representational distance matrices RDMs. We propose representational distance learning RDL a stochastic gradient descent method that drives the RDMs of the student to approximate the RDMs of the teacher. We demonstrate that RDL is competitive with other transfer learning techniques for two publicly available benchmark computer vision datasets MNIST and CIFAR-100 while allowing for architectural differences between student and teacher. By pulling the students RDMs toward those of the teacher RDL significantly improved visual classification performance when compared to baseline networks that did not use transfer learning. In the future RDL may enable combined supervised training of deep neural networks using task constraints e.g. images and category labels and constraints from brain-activity measurements so as to build models that replicate the internal representational spaces of biological brains."
