There is a growing empirical evidence that virtual reality VR is valuable for education training entertaining and medical rehabilitation due to its capacity to represent real-life events and situations. However the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral confounds in VR environments are still poorly understood. In two experiments we examined the effect of fully immersive 3D stereoscopic presentations and less immersive 2D VR environments on brain functions and behavioral outcomes. In Experiment 1 we examined behavioral and neural underpinnings of spatial navigation tasks using electroencephalography EEG. In Experiment 2 we examined EEG correlates of postural stability and balance. Our major findings showed that fully immersive 3D VR induced a higher subjective sense of presence along with enhanced success rate of spatial navigation compared to 2D. In Experiment 1 power of frontal midline EEG FM-theta was significantly higher during the encoding phase of route presentation in the 3D VR. In Experiment 2 the 3D VR resulted in greater postural instability and modulation of EEG patterns as a function of 3D versus 2D environments. The findings support the inference that the fully immersive 3D enriched-environment requires allocation of more brain and sensory resources for cognitive/motor control during both tasks than 2D presentations. This is further evidence that 3D VR tasks using EEG may be a promising approach for performance enhancement and potential applications in clinical/rehabilitation settings.
