Virtual reality and augmented reality environments using helmet-mounted displays create a sense of immersion by closely coupling user head motion to display content. Delays in the presentation of visual information can destroy the sense of presence in the simulation environment when it causes a lag in the display response to user head motion. The effect of display lag can be minimized by predicting head orientation allowing the system to have sufficient time to counteract the delay. In this paper anew head orientation prediction technique is proposed that uses a multiple delta quaternion DQ extended Kalman filter to track angular head velocity and angular head acceleration. This method is independent of the device used for orientation measurement relying on quaternion orientation as the only measurement data. A new orientation prediction algorithm is proposed that estimates future head orientation as a function of the current orientation measurement and a predicted change in orientation using the velocity and acceleration estimates. Extensive experimentation shows that the new method improves head orientation prediction when compared to single filter DQ prediction.
