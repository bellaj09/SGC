"We present a fast and accurate non-invasive brain-machine interface BMI based on demodulating steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs in electroencephalography EEG. Our study reports an SSVEP-BMI that for the first time decodes primarily based on top-down and not bottom-up visual information processing. The experimental setup presents a grid-shaped flickering line array that the participants observe while intentionally attending to a subset of flickering lines representing the shape of a letter. While the flickering pixels stimulate the participants visual cortex uniformly with equal probability the participants intention groups the strokes and thus perceives a letter Gestalt. We observed decoding accuracy of 35.81% up to 65.83% with a regularized linear discriminant analysis; on average 2.05-fold and up to 3.77-fold greater than chance levels in multi-class classification. Compared to the EEG signals an electrooculogram EOG did not significantly contribute to decoding accuracies. Further analysis reveals that the top-down SSVEP paradigm shows the most focalised activation pattern around occipital visual areas; Granger causality analysis consistently revealed prefrontal top-down control over early visual processing. Taken together the present paradigm provides the first neurophysiological evidence for the top-down SSVEP BMI paradigm which potentially enables multi-class intentional control of EEG-BMIs without using gaze-shifting."
