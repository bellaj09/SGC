"The piriform cortex PC is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders such as epilepsy Alzheimers disease and autism. The PC consists of the anterior APC and posterior PPC parts which are different anatomically and functionally. However the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory -aminobutyric acid GABA-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus RV-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region OLF followed by the cortical subplate CTXsp isocortex cerebral nuclei CNU hippocampal formation HPF and interbrain IB whereas the midbrain MB and hindbrain HB were rarely labeled. However APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions."
