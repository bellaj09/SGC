Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging DW-MRI is of critical importance for characterizing in-vivo white matter. Models relating microarchitecture to observed DW-MRI signals as a function of diffusion sensitization are the lens through which DW-MRI data are interpreted. Numerous modern approaches offer opportunities to assess more complex intra-voxel structures. Nevertheless there remains a substantial gap between intra-voxel estimated structures and ground truth captured by 3-D histology. Deep learning reveals untapped information for local white-matter fiber reconstruction in diffusion-weighted MRI.
