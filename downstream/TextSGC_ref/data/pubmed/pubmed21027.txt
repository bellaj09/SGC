"Fully-implantable wireless intracortical Brain Machine Interfaces iBMI is one of the most promising next frontiers in the nascent field of neurotechnology. However scaling the number of channels in such systems by another 10 is difficult due to power and bandwidth requirements of the wireless transmitter. One promising solution for that is to include more processing up to the decoder in the implant so that transmission data-rate is reduced drastically. Earlier work on neuromorphic decoder chips only showed classification of discrete states. We present results for continuous state decoding using a low-power neuromorphic decoder chip termed Spike-input Extreme Learning Machine SELMA that implements a nonlinear decoder without memory and its memory-based version with time-delayed bins SELMA-bins. We have compared SELMA SELMA-bins against state-of-the-art Steady-State Kalman Filter SSKF a linear decoder with memory across two different datasets involving a total of 4 non-human primates NHPs. Results show at least a 10% 20% or more increase in the fraction of variance accounted for FVAF by SELMA SELMA-bins over SSKF across the datasets. Estimated energy consumption comparison shows SELMA SELMA-bins consuming  9 nJ/update 23 nJ/update against SSKFs  7.4 nJ/update for an iBMI with a 10 degree of freedom control. Thus SELMA yields better performance against SSKF while consuming energy in the same range as SSKF whereas SELMA-bins performs the best with moderately increased energy consumption albeit far less than energy required for raw data transmission. This paves the way for reducing transmission data rates in future scaled iBMI systems." Towards Intelligent Intracortical BMI i 2BMI: Low-Power Neuromorphic Decoders That Outperform Kalman Filters.
