In laparoscopy the digital camera offers surgeons the opportunity to receive support from image-guided surgery systems. Such systems require image understanding the ability for a computer to understand what the laparoscope sees. Image understanding has recently progressed owing to the emergence of artificial intelligence and especially deep learning techniques. However the state of the art of deep learning in gynaecology only offers image-based detection reporting the presence or absence of an anatomical structure without finding its location. A solution to the localisation problem is given by the concept of semantic segmentation giving the detection and pixel-level location of a structure in an image. The state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation are achieved by deep learning whose usage requires a massive amount of annotated data. We propose the first dataset dedicated to this task and the first evaluation of deep learning-based semantic segmentation in gynaecology.
