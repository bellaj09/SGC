Quantification of carotid plaques has been shown to be important for assessing as well as monitoring the progression and regression of carotid atherosclerosis. Various metrics have been proposed and methods of measurements ranging from manual tracing to automated segmentations have also been investigated. Of those metrics quantification of carotid plaques by measuring vessel-wall-volume VWV using the segmented media-adventitia MAB and lumen-intima LIB boundaries has been shown to be sensitive to temporal changes in carotid plaque burden. Thus semi-automatic MAB and LIB segmentation methods are required to help generate VWV measurements with high accuracy and less user interaction. Deep learning-based carotid media-adventitia and lumen-intima boundary segmentation from three-dimensional ultrasound images.
