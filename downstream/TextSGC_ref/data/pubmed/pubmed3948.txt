Fronto-parietal subnetworks were revealed to compensate for cognitive decline due to mental fatigue by community structure analysis. Here we investigate changes in topology of subnetworks of resting-state fMRI networks due to mental fatigue induced by prolonged performance of a cognitively demanding task and their associations with cognitive decline. As it is well established that brain networks have modular organization community structure analyses can provide valuable information about mesoscale network organization and serve as a bridge between standard fMRI approaches and brain connectomics that quantify the topology of whole brain networks. We developed inter- and intramodule network metrics to quantify topological characteristics of subnetworks based on our hypothesis that mental fatigue would impact on functional relationships of subnetworks. Functional networks were constructed with wavelet correlation and a data-driven thresholding scheme based on orthogonal minimum spanning trees which allowed detection of communities with weak connections. A change from pre- to posttask runs was found for the intermodule density between the frontal and the temporal subnetworks. Seven inter- or intramodule network metrics mostly at the frontal or the parietal subnetworks showed significant predictive power of individual cognitive decline while the network metrics for the whole network were less effective in the predictions. Our results suggest that the control-type fronto-parietal networks have a flexible topological architecture to compensate for declining cognitive ability due to mental fatigue. This community structure analysis provides valuable insight into connectivity dynamics under different cognitive states including mental fatigue.
