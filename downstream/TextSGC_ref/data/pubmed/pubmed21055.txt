"The significance of connectedness for well-being is well known. At the end of life however illness and body decline may challenge a persons ability of staying and feeling connected. The aim of this phenomenological study was to interpret meanings of connectedness through narrative interviews with persons admitted to inpatient palliative care in Sweden. Results involving connectedness through the body connectedness to and uncanniness toward other patients and connectedness to significant others and society are discussed. The study underscores the importance of connectedness until death. However in inpatient palliative care this is complex. Patients can co-create or challenge each others sense of connectedness through the symbolism of illness and diseased bodies. Moreover the capability of connectedness is influenced by illness spatiality atmosphere activities and resources in the care place."
