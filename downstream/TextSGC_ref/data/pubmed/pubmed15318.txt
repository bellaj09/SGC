Integrated analysis of existing radiosensitivity data obtained by the gold-standard clonogenic assay has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer cell radioresistance. However extraction of radiosensitivity data from the literature is highly labor-intensive. To aid in this task using deep convolutional neural networks CNNs and other computer technologies we developed an analysis pipeline that extracts radiosensitivity data derived from clonogenic assays from the literature. Deep learning-assisted literature mining for in vitro radiosensitivity data.
