"Authentic rehabilitation requires the active participation of patients and their involvement with opportunities for action and development. Within this framework in this article we outline the possibility of using two emerging computing and communication technologies-ambient intelligence AmI and virtual reality VR--for a new breed of rehabilitative and clinical applications based on a strategy defined as transformation of flow. Transformation of flow is a persons ability to exploit an optimal flow experience to identify and use new and unexpected psychological resources as sources of involvement. We identify the feeling of presence--the feeling of being in a world that exists outside oneself--as the theoretical link between the technology and rehabilitation. AmI and VR are used to trigger broad empowerment processes induced by a strong sense of presence leading to greater agency and control over ones actions and environment."
