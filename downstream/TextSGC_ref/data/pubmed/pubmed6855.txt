Electronic Medical Records EMRs are written in an unstructured way often using natural language. Information Extraction IE may be used for acquiring knowledge from such texts including the automatic recognition of meaningful entities through models\xa0for Named Entity Recognition NER. However while most work on the previous was made for English this experience aimed at testing different methods in Portuguese text more precisely on the domain of Neurology and take some conclusions. This paper comprised the comparison between Conditional Random Fields CRF bidirectional Long Short-term Memory - Conditional Random Fields BiLSTM-CRF and a BiLSTM-CRF with residual learning connections using not only Portuguese texts from medical journals but also texts from the Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre CHUC Neurology Service. Furthermore the performances of BiLSTM-CRF models using word embeddings WEs trained with clinical text and WEs trained with general language texts were compared. Deep learning models achieved F1-Scores of nearly 83% and 75% respectively for relaxed and strict evaluation on texts extracted from the medical journal. For texts collected from the Hospital the same achieved F1-Scores of nearly 71% and 62%. This work concludes that deep learning models outperform the shallow learning models and that in-domain WEs get better results than general language WEs even when the latter are trained with much more text than the former. Furthermore the results show that it is possible to extract information from Hospital clinical texts with models trained with clinical cases extracted from medical journals and thus openly available. Nevertheless such results still require a healthcare technician to check if the information is well extracted. Comparing Different Methods for Named Entity Recognition in Portuguese Neurology Text.
