Placebo effects are mediated by expectancy which is highly influenced by psychosocial factors of a treatment context. These factors are difficult to standardize. Furthermore dedicated placebo research often necessitates single-blind deceptive designs where biases are easily introduced. We propose a study protocol employing a virtual experimenter - a computer program designed to deliver treatment and instructions - for the purpose of standardization and reduction of biases when investigating placebo effects. A virtual experimenter to increase standardization for the investigation of placebo effects.
