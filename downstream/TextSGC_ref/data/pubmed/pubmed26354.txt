"We are frequently exposed to hand written digits 0-9 in todays modern life. Success in decoding-classification of hand written digits helps us understand the corresponding brain mechanisms and processes and assists seriously in designing more efficient brain-computer interfaces. However all digits belong to the same semantic category and similarity in appearance of hand written digits makes this decoding-classification a challenging problem. In present study for the first time augmented nave Bayes classifier is used for classification of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI measurements to decode the hand written digits which took advantage of brain connectivity information in decoding-classification. fMRI was recorded from three healthy participants with an age range of 25-30. Results in different brain lobes frontal occipital parietal and temporal show that utilizing connectivity information significantly improves decoding-classification and capability of different brain lobes in decoding-classification of hand written digits were compared to each other. In addition in each lobe the most contributing areas and brain connectivities were determined and connectivities with short distances between their endpoints were recognized to be more efficient. Moreover data driven method was applied to investigate the similarity of brain areas in responding to stimuli and this revealed both similarly active areas and active mechanisms during this experiment. Interesting finding was that during the experiment of watching hand written digits there were some active networks visual working memory motor and language processing but the most relevant one to the task was language processing network according to the voxel selection."
