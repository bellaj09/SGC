We have excellent skills to extract sex from visual assessment of human faces but assessing sex from human brain rhythms seems impossible. Using deep convolutional neural networks with unique potential to find subtle differences in apparent similar patterns we explore if brain rhythms from either sex contain sex specific information. Here we show in a ground truth scenario that a deep neural net can predict sex from scalp electroencephalograms with an accuracy of >80% p < 10-5 revealing that brain rhythms are sex specific. Further we extracted sex-specific features from the deep net filter layers showing that fast beta activity 20-25\u2009Hz and its spatial distribution is a main distinctive attribute. This demonstrates the ability of deep nets to detect features in spatiotemporal data unnoticed by visual assessment and to assist in knowledge discovery. We anticipate that this approach may also be successfully applied to other specialties where spatiotemporal data is abundant including neurology cardiology and neuropsychology.
