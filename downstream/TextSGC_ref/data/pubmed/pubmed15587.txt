Rutting has always been considered the main disease in asphalt pavement. Dealing with rutting disease would be benefitted by understanding the formation of rutting and testing the rutting performance of mixtures more reasonably. The objective of this paper is to systematically investigate the rutting mechanism by employing a self-designed rutting tester along with the corresponding numerical simulations. The deformation of different positions of the existing tracking tester was found to be inconsistent and the loading was not in line with reality. Accordingly a more practical tester was proposed: the reduced scale circular tracking RSCT tester integrates the functions of asphalt mixture fabrication and rutting monitoring. The results demonstrated that the loading of the new tester is closer to the actual situation. In addition determining the stress and displacement characteristics of particles in the asphalt mixture was found to be difficult due to the limitations of the testing methods. Therefore a two-dimensional virtual rutting test based on the RSCT was built using PFC2D Particle Flow Code 2 Dimension to investigate the mechanism of formation in rutting and to obtain the corresponding guidance. The numerical simulation showed that all particles of the specimen tended to move away from the load location. The main cause of rutting formation was the eddy current flow of asphalt mastic driven by coarse aggregates. The aggregates with diameters ranging from 9.5 to 4.75 mm were observed to have the greatest contribution to rutting deformation. Therefore the aggregate amount of these spans should be focused on in the design of mixture grading.
