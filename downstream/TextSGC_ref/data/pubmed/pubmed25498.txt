Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI based on the voluntary modulation of sensorimotor rhythms SMRs induced by motor imagery are very prominent because allow a continuous control of the external device. Nevertheless the design of a SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session i.e. without extensive training is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach which combines online adaptation techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback from the beginning of the experiment. Recently based on offline analyses we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches CSPP technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70% accuracy within one session even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control. Concurrent recordings of the SMR during a relax condition as well as the course of BCI performance indicate a clear learning effect.
