Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity rsFC have been demonstrated in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD. However such reports have primarily focused on adult participants whereas findings in adolescents with PTSD are mixed and not entirely consistent with the adult literature. Here we examined rsFC in a non-treatment seeking adolescent sample with posttraumatic stress symptoms PTSS; n\xa0=\xa059 relative to asymptomatic controls n\xa0=\xa0226. We also examined differences between trauma-exposed and non-exposed control subgroups TEC n\xa0=\xa073 and Non-TEC n\xa0=\xa0153 to examine alterations associated with more general trauma exposure. Finally we compared the PTSS and TEC groups to confirm that the reported alterations in PTSS were not driven by trauma exposure. Using a seed-based approach we examined connectivity of default-mode DMN and salience SN networks where alterations have been previously reported. Results suggest that PTSS are associated with less within-DMN connectivity and greater SN-DMN connectivity as well as altered connectivity with attention regions. Trauma exposure is associated with greater within-SN connectivity. Additionally we report findings from exploratory connectome-based analysis which demonstrate a number of topological alterations within DMN in the PTSS group. Overall our findings replicate prior reports of altered rsFC in PTSD and extend them to non-treatment seeking trauma-exposed adolescents who did or did not report PTSS. They specifically highlight SN-DMN desegregation lower within-DMN and greater within-SN connectivity as well as altered connectivity with attention regions in trauma-exposed adolescents. Future research is required to confirm that adolescents with diagnosed PTSD have similar/exacerbated connectivity patterns. Altered resting-state functional connectivity in adolescents is associated with PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure.
