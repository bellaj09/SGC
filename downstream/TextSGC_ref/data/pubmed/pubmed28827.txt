"Motor imagery one of the first investigated neural process for Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs still provides a great challenge nowadays. Aiming a better and more accurate control multiple researches have been conducted by the scientific community. Nevertheless there is still no robust and confident application developed. In order to augment the potential referring to motor imagery and to attract users interest we propose multiple motor imagery tasks in combination with different visual or auditory stimuli. We use multi-class classification for discrimination and we observe confident classification performance for the task related to users background."
