Left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF is one of the key metrics to assess the heart functionality and cardiac ultrasound echo is a standard imaging modality for EF measurement. There is an emerging interest to exploit the point-of-care ultrasound POCUS usability due to low cost and ease of access. In this work we aim to present a computationally efficient mobile application for accurate LVEF estimation. Automatic biplane left ventricular ejection fraction estimation with mobile point-of-care ultrasound using multi-task learning and adversarial training.
