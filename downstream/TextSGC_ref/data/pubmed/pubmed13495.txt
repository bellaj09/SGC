Deep learning models combining spectral and spatial features have been proven to be effective for hyperspectral image HSI classification. However most spatial feature integration methods only consider a single input spatial scale regardless of various shapes and sizes of objects over the image plane leading to missing scale-dependent information. In this paper we propose a hierarchical multi-scale convolutional neural networks CNNs with auxiliary classifiers HMCNN-AC to learn hierarchical multi-scale spectral-spatial features for HSI classification. First to better exploit the spatial information multi-scale image patches for each pixel are generated at different spatial scales. These multi-scale patches are all centered at the same central spectrum but with shrunken spatial scales. Then we apply multi-scale CNNs to extract spectral-spatial features from each scale patch. The obtained multi-scale convolutional features are considered as structured sequential data with spectral-spatial dependency and a bidirectional LSTM is proposed to capture the correlation and extract a hierarchical representation for each pixel. To better train the whole network weighted auxiliary classifiers are employed for the multi-scale CNNs and optimized together with the main loss function. Experimental results on three public HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over some state-of-the-art methods.
