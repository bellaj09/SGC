Deep learning algorithms in particular convolutional networks have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes over 300 contributions to the field most of which appeared in the last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification object detection segmentation registration and other tasks. Concise overviews are provided of studies per application area: neuro retinal pulmonary digital pathology breast cardiac abdominal musculoskeletal. We end with a summary of the current state-of-the-art a critical discussion of open challenges and directions for future research. A survey on deep learning in medical image analysis.
