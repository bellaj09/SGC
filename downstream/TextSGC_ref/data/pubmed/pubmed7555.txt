We propose a transfer learning assisted deep neural network DNN method for optical-signal-to-noise ratio OSNR monitoring and realize fast remodel to response to various system parameters changing e.g. optical launch power residual chromatic dispersion CD and bit rate. By transferring the hyper-parameters of DNN at the initial stage we can fast response to the channel variation with fewer training set size and calculations to save consumptions. For feature extraction processing we use amplitude histograms of received 56-Gb/s QPSK signals as the input for DNN at the initial stage which shows the root mean squared error RMSE of OSNR estimation is less than 0.1\u2005dB with the OSNRs ranging from 5 to 35\u2005dB. Then we change several system parameters and find superior capabilities of fast remodeling and data resource saving with the proposed method. The required training epochs have about four times reduction and the required training set size is only one-fifth compared to retraining the network without any accuracy penalty. The DNN assisted by transfer learning can save resources and will be beneficial for real-time application on OSNR estimation. Transfer learning assisted deep neural network for OSNR estimation.
