Edges tend to be over-smoothed in total variation TV regularized under-sampled images. In this paper symmetric residual convolutional neural network SR-CNN a deep learning based model was proposed to enhance the sharpness of edges and detailed anatomical structures in under-sampled cone-beam computed tomography CBCT. For training CBCT images were reconstructed using TV-based method from limited projections simulated from the ground truth CT and were fed into SR-CNN which was trained to learn a restoring pattern from under-sampled images to the ground truth. For testing under-sampled CBCT was reconstructed using TV regularization and was then augmented by SR-CNN. Performance of SR-CNN was evaluated using phantom and patient images of various disease sites acquired at different institutions both qualitatively and quantitatively using structure similarity SSIM and peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR. SR-CNN substantially enhanced image details in the TV-based CBCT across all experiments. In the patient study using real projections SR-CNN augmented CBCT images reconstructed from as low as 120 half-fan projections to image quality comparable to the reference fully-sampled FDK reconstruction using 900 projections. In the tumor localization study improvements in the tumor localization accuracy were made by the SR-CNN augmented images compared with the conventional FDK and TV-based images. SR-CNN demonstrated robustness against noise levels and projection number reductions and generalization for various disease sites and datasets from different institutions. Overall the SR-CNN-based image augmentation technique was efficient and effective in considerably enhancing edges and anatomical structures in under-sampled 3D/4D-CBCT which can be very valuable for image-guided radiotherapy.
