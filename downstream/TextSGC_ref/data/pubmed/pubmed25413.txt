Medical simulation offers the advantage of improving resident skill and comfort without impacting patient care. Five years ago we identified trends in the use of robotic and laparoscopic simulation in 2008 and 2009 at American urology residency training programs. We seek to identify the changes in the use of simulators and the presence of formal curricula in the wake of technological advances and changes in graduate medical education.
