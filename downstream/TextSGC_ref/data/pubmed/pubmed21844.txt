Near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is a non-invasive optical technique that can be used for brain-computer interfaces BCIs systems. A common challenge for BCIs is a stable and reliable classification of single-trial data especially for cognitive mental tasks. With antagonistic activation pattern recently found for mental arithmetic MA tasks an improved online classification for optical BCIs using MA should become possible. For this investigation we used the data of a previous study where we found antagonistic activation patterns focal bilateral increase of oxy-Hb in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in parallel with a oxy-Hb decrease in the medial area of the anterior prefrontal cortex in eight subjects. We used the oxy-Hb responses to search for the best antagonistic feature combination and compared it to individual features from the same regions. In addition we investigated the use of antagonistic deoxy-Hb total hemoglobin Hbtot and pairs of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb features as well as the existence of a group-related feature set. Our results indicate that the use of the antagonistic oxy-Hb features significantly increases the classification accuracy from 63.3 to 79.7%. These results support the hypothesis that antagonistic hemodynamic response patterns are a suitable control strategy for optical BCI and that only two prefrontal NIRS channels are needed for good performance.
