This article describes a decision support system the EAG tool = Effective AAA Graftmanship that assists the vascular surgeon in deciding whether a patient is fit for an endograft procedure and that assists the vascular surgeon in selecting the proper graft and in planning the endograft procedure. The EAG tool is the first step in the development of a learning environment for AAA procedures. As such the EAG tool is part of the VREST development project aiming to create a complete set of Virtual Reality Educational Surgical Tools. The EAG tool has been validated by using the expert knowledge of five experienced AAA physicians: three vascular surgeons and two interventional radiologists. In over 3000 assessments the EAG tool showed a false-positive rate of 0.2% or in other words: in only 1 out of 500 cases the EAG tool indicated the possible use of an endograft whereas the combined group of experts believed that it was not possibe. The EAG tool proved to be more prudent than the group of experts in having a false-negative rate of 3.7%. The EAG tool thus proved to be useful in daily clinical practice. Further developments are ongoing to use the EAG tool in a learning environment specifically for unexperienced physicians.
