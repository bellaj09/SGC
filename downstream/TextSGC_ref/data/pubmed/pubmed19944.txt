Virtual reality simulators combined with head-mounted displays enable highly immersive virtual reality VR for surgical skills training potentially bridging the gap between the simulation environment and real-life operating room conditions. However the increased complexity of the learning situation in immersive VR could potentially induce high cognitive load thereby inhibiting performance and learning. This study aims to compare cognitive load and performance in immersive VR and conventional VR simulation training. Cognitive load and performance in immersive virtual reality versus conventional virtual reality simulation training of laparoscopic surgery: a randomized trial.
