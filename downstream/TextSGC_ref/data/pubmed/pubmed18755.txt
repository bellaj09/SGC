Concentric tube robots have potential for use in a wide variety of surgical procedures due to their small size dexterity and ability to move in highly curved paths. Unlike most existing clinical robots the design of these robots can be developed and manufactured on a patient- and procedure-specific basis. The design of concentric tube robots typically requires significant computation and optimization and it remains unclear how the surgeon should be involved. We propose to use a virtual reality-based design environment for surgeons to easily and intuitively visualize and design a set of concentric tube robots for a specific patient and procedure. In this paper we describe a novel patient-specific design process in the context of the virtual reality interface. We also show a resulting concentric tube robot design created by a pediatric urologist to access a kidney stone in a pediatric patient.
