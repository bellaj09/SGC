In this paper a personal authentication system that can effectively identify individuals by generating unique electroencephalogram signal features in response to self-face and non-self-face photos is presented. To achieve performance stability a sequence of self-face photographs including first-occurrence position and non-first-occurrence position are taken into account in the serial occurrence of visual stimuli. Additionally a Fisher linear classification method and event-related potential technique for feature analysis is adapted to yield remarkably better outcomes than those obtained by most existing. Application of a brain-computer interface for person authentication using EEG responses to photo stimuli.
