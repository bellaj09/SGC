Primary insomnia PIs is highly prevalent and can lead to adverse socioeconomic impacts but the underlying mechanism of its complex brain network impairment remains largely unknown. Functional studies are too few and diverse in methodology which makes it difficult to glean general conclusions. To answer this question we first used graph theory-based network analyse together with seed-based functional connectivity approach to characterize the topology architecture of whole-brain functional networks associated with PIs. Forty-eight subjects with PIs and 48 age/sex/education-matched good sleepers were recruited. We found PIs is associated with altered connection properties of intra-networks within the executive control network default mode network and salience network and inter-network between auditory language comprehension center and executive control network. These complex networks were correlated with negative emotions and insomnia severity in the PIs group. Altered connection properties of these network hubs appeared to be neural risk factors for neuropsychological changes of PIs and might be used as potential neuroimaging markers to distinguish the PIs from the good sleepers. These findings highlight the role of functional connectivity in the pathophysiology of PIs and may underlie the neural mechanisms of etiology of PIs. Altered connection properties of important network hubs may be neural risk factors for individuals with primary insomnia.
