Characteristically within the resting brain there are slow fluctuations around 0.1Hz of EEG and NIRS-deoxyhemoglobin deoxy-Hb oxy-Hb signals. An interesting question is whether such slow oscillations can be related to the intention to perform a motor act. To obtain an answer we analyzed continuous blood pressure BP heart rate HR prefrontal oxy-Hb deoxy-Hb and EEG signals over sensorimotor areas in 10 healthy subjects during 5min of rest and during 10min of voluntary finger movements. Analyses of prefrontal oxy-Hb/deoxy-Hb oscillations around 0.1Hz and central EEG band power changes in the beta alpha band revealed that the positive oxy-Hb peaks preceded the central EEG beta alpha power peak by 3.60.9s in the majority of subjects. A similar relationship between prefrontal oxy-Hb and central EEG beta power was found during voluntary movements whereby the post movement beta power increase beta rebound is known to coexist with a decreased excitability of cortico-spinal neurons. Therefore we speculate that the beta power increase 3s after slow fluctuating oxy-Hb peaks during rest is indicative for a slow excitability change of central motor cortex neurons. This work provides the first evidence that initiation of finger movements at free will in relatively constant intervals around 10s could be temporally related to slow oscillations of prefrontal oxy-Hb and autonomic blood pressure in the resting brain. Does conscious intention to perform a motor act depend on slow prefrontal deoxyhemoglobin oscillations in the resting brain?
