Intracellular -synuclein -syn-rich protein aggregates called Lewy pathology LP and neuronal death are commonly found in the brains of patients with clinical Parkinson disease cPD. It is widely believed that LP appears early in the disease and spreads in synaptically coupled brain networks driving neuronal dysfunction and death. However post-mortem analysis of human brains and connectome-mapping studies show that the pattern of LP in cPD is not consistent with this simple model arguing that if LP propagates in cPD it must be gated by cell- or region-autonomous mechanisms. Moreover the correlation between LP and neuronal death is weak. In this Review we briefly discuss the evidence for and against the spreading LP model as well as evidence that cell-autonomous factors govern both -syn pathology and neuronal death.
