One of the current challenges in brain-machine interfacing is to characterize and decode upper limb kinematics from brain signals e.g. to control a prosthetic device. Recent research work states that it is possible to do so based on low frequency EEG components. However the validity of these results is still a matter of discussion. In this paper we assess the feasibility of decoding upper limb kinematics from EEG signals in center-out reaching tasks during passive and active movements. Classification of upper limb center-out reaching tasks by means of EEG-based continuous decoding techniques.
