In longitudinal electroencephalography EEG studies repeatable electrode positioning is essential for reliable EEG assessment. Conventional methods use anatomical landmarks as fiducial locations for the electrode placement. Since the landmarks are manually identified the EEG assessment is inevitably unreliable because of individual variations among the subjects and the examiners. To overcome this unreliability an augmented reality AR visualization-based electrode guidance system was proposed.
