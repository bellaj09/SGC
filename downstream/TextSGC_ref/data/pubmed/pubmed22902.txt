Force feedback gloves have a great potential in enhancing the fidelity of virtual reality and teleoperation systems. It is a challenge to develop multifinger and lightweight force feedback gloves. In this paper we propose a solution using layer jamming sheet LJS on each finger joint. In simulating free space the LJS is soft and easy to deform which allows the finger joints to move freely with a small resistance force. In simulating constrained space the LJS becomes stiff which provides resistance torques to prevent the rotation of finger joints. Possible solutions for mounting the LJS on finger joints are investigated. Mechanical models of the LJS are derived by quantifying the relationship between the bending stiffness and the pressure material and geometry of the layer. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical behavior of the LJS actuator and to validate the performance of the different design solutions in simulating free space and constrained space. Experimental results indicate the potential of the proposed joint-based LJS-actuated approach in developing lightweight force feedback gloves.
