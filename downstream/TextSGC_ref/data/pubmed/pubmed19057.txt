Background: Simulation training is strongly advocated by 24/7 risk-rich professions because swift learning curve inflection point attainment delivers earlier competence; the left-shift effect. The aim of this study was to determine the value of haptic laparoscopic virtual reality simulation by iterative benchmark exercise n\u2009=\u20098 before simulated laparoscopic appendicectomy SLA; the hypothesis was that favorable benchmark learning curve trajectories would be associated with improved SLA competence when compared with consultant expert performance. Methods: A 28-trainee cohort completed 1349 Laparoscopic Haptic Virtual Reality Skills LHVRS tasks during which 19 ergonomic variables were assessed by virtual interface including force feedback Surgicalscience.com before 153 SLAs. Primary outcome measure was SLA composite competence score related to six consultant trainer experts. Results: Of the eight LHVRS tasks the three with the steepest learning curve trajectories correlated with better median overall SLA competence scores namely tissue grasping/lifting rho\u2009=\u20090.362 P\u2009=\u2009.049 fine dissection rho\u2009=\u20090.388 P\u2009=\u2009.028 and camera navigation rho\u2009=\u20090.518 P\u2009=\u2009.007; fine dissection was the only haptic laparoscopic virtual reality simulation task that predicted a SLA score within a Youden index defined 70% of the consultant expert level area under curve AUC\u2009=\u20090.803 P\u2009=\u2009.028. A significant SLA learning curve emerged with a learning curve trajectory inflection point at the fourth SLA attempt first SLA 30.5% versus fourth SLA score 76.0% gradient 76 P\u2009=\u2009.010. Conclusion: Learning curve trajectory can be measured influenced and accelerated significantly; a pronounced left-shift effect with translational potential for enhanced shorter training time and improved patient safety.
