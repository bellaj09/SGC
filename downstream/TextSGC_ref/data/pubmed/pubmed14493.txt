"The aim of the study is to compare electroencephalographic EEG signal feature extraction methods in the context of the effectiveness of the classification of brain activities. For classification electroencephalographic signals were obtained using an EEG device from 17 subjects in three mental states relaxation excitation and solving logical task. Blind source separation employing independent component analysis ICA was performed on obtained signals. Welchs method autoregressive modeling and discrete wavelet transform were used for feature extraction. Principal component analysis PCA was performed in order to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. k-Nearest Neighbors kNN Support Vector Machines SVM and Neural Networks NN were employed for classification. Precision recall F1 score as well as a discussion based on statistical analysis were shown. The paper also contains code utilized in preprocessing and the main part of experiments."
