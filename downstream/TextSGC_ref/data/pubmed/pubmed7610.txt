Precisely segmented lung fields restrict the region-of-interest from which radiological patterns are searched and is thus an indispensable prerequisite step in any chest radiographic CADx system. Recently a number of deep learning-based approaches have been proposed to implement this step. However deep learning has its own limitations and cannot be used in resource-constrained settings. Medical systems generally have limited RAM computational power storage and no GPUs. They are thus not always suited for running deep learning-based models. Shallow learning-based models with appropriately selected features give comparable performance but with modest resources. The present paper thus proposes a shallow learning-based method that makes use of 40 radiomic features to segment lung fields from chest radiographs. A distance regularized level set evolution DRLSE method along with other post-processing steps are used to refine its output. The proposed method is trained and tested using publicly available JSRT dataset. The testing results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art deep learning-based lung field segmentation LFS methods and better than other LFS methods.
