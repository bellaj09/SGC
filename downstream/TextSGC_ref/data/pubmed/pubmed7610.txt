"Accurate segmentation of brainstem nuclei red nucleus and substantia nigra is very important in various neuroimaging applications such as deep brain stimulation and the investigation of imaging biomarkers for Parkinsons disease PD. Due to iron deposition during aging image contrast in the brainstem is very low in Magnetic Resonance MR images. Hence the ambiguity of patch-wise similarity makes the recently successful multi-atlas patch-based label fusion methods have difficulty to perform as competitive as segmenting cortical and sub-cortical regions from MR images. To address this challenge we propose a novel multi-atlas brainstem nuclei segmentation method using deep hyper-graph learning. Specifically we achieve this goal in three-fold. First we employ hyper-graph to combine the advantage of maintaining spatial coherence from graph-based segmentation approaches and the benefit of harnessing population priors from multi-atlas based framework. Second besides using low-level image appearance we also extract high-level context features to measure the complex patch-wise relationship. Since the context features are calculated on a tentatively estimated label probability map we eventually turn our hyper-graph learning based label propagation into a deep and self-refining model. Third since anatomical labels on some voxels usually located in uniform regions can be identified much more reliably than other voxels usually located at the boundary between two regions we allow these reliable voxels to propagate their labels to the nearby difficult-to-label voxels. Such hierarchical strategy makes our proposed label fusion method deep and dynamic. We evaluate our proposed label fusion method in segmenting substantia nigra SN and red nucleus RN from 3.0 T MR images where our proposed method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art label fusion methods."
