Genome-scale technologies have enabled mapping of the complex molecular networks that govern cellular behavior. An emerging theme in the analyses of these networks is that cells use many layers of regulatory feedback to constantly assess and precisely react to their environment. The importance of complex feedback in controlling the real-time response to external stimuli has led to a need for the next generation of cell-based technologies that enable both the collection and analysis of high-throughput temporal data. Toward this end we have developed a microfluidic platform capable of monitoring temporal gene expression from over 2000 promoters. By coupling the "Dynomics" platform with deep neural network DNN and associated explainable artificial intelligence XAI algorithms we show how machine learning can be harnessed to assess patterns in transcriptional data on a genome scale and identify which genes contribute to these patterns. Furthermore we demonstrate the utility of the Dynomics platform as a field-deployable real-time biosensor through prediction of the presence of heavy metals in urban water and mine spill samples based on the the dynamic transcription profiles of 1807 unique Escherichia coli promoters.
