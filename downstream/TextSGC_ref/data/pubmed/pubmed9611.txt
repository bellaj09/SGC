Retinal vessel segmentation is a critical procedure towards the accurate visualization diagnosis early treatment and surgery planning of ocular diseases. Recent deep learning-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in retinal vessel segmentation. However they usually apply global image pre-processing and take the whole retinal images as input during network training which have two drawbacks for accurate retinal vessel segmentation. First these methods lack the utilization of the local patch information. Second they overlook the geometric constraint that retina only occurs in a specific area within the whole image or the extracted patch. As a consequence these global-based methods suffer in handling details such as recognizing the small thin vessels discriminating the optic disk etc. To address these drawbacks this study proposes a Global and Local enhanced residual U-nEt GLUE for accurate retinal vessel segmentation which benefits from both the globally and locally enhanced information inside the retinal region. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method which consistently improves the segmentation accuracy over a conventional U-Net and achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art.
