Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with enormous individual and social cost. In this paper a novel virtual reality VR-based driving system was introduced to teach driving skills to adolescents with ASD. This driving system is capable of gathering eye gaze electroencephalography and peripheral physiology data in addition to driving performance data. The objective of this paper is to fuse multimodal information to measure cognitive load during driving such that driving tasks can be individualized for optimal skill learning. Individualization of ASD intervention is an important criterion due to the spectrum nature of the disorder. Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in our study and the data collected were used for systematic feature extraction and classification of cognitive loads based on five well-known machine learning methods. Subsequently three information fusion schemes-feature level fusion decision level fusion and hybrid level fusion-were explored. Results indicate that multimodal information fusion can be used to measure cognitive load with high accuracy. Such a mechanism is essential since it will allow individualization of driving skill training based on cognitive load which will facilitate acceptance of this driving system for clinical use and eventual commercialization.
