Microscopic examination of peripheral blood plays an important role in the field of diagnosis and control of major diseases. Peripheral leukocyte recognition by manual requires medical technicians to observe blood smears through light microscopy using their experience and expertise to discriminate and analyze different cells which is time-consuming labor-intensive and subjective. The traditional systems based on feature engineering often need to ensure successful segmentation and then manually extract certain quantitative and qualitative features for recognition but still remaining a limitation of poor robustness. The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply two remarkable object detection approaches Single Shot Multibox Detector and An Incremental Improvement Version of You Only Look Once. To improve recognition performance some key factors involving these object detection approaches are explored and the detection models are generated using the train set of 14700 annotated images. Finally we evaluate these detection models on test sets consisting of 1120 annotated images and 7868 labeled single object images corresponding to 11 categories of peripheral leukocytes respectively. A best mean average precision of 93.10% and mean accuracy of 90.09% are achieved while the inference time is 53 ms per image on a NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU. Deep learning approach to peripheral leukocyte recognition.
