Using an effective method to measure the brain functional connectivity is an important step to study the brain functional network. The main methods for constructing an undirected brain functional network include correlation coefficient CF partial correlation coefficient PCF mutual information MI wavelet correlation coefficient WCF and coherence CH. In this paper we demonstrate that the maximal information coefficient MIC proposed by Reshef et al. is relevant to constructing a brain functional network because it performs best in the comprehensive comparisons in consistency and robustness. Our work can be used to validate the possible new functional connection measures. MIC as an appropriate method to construct the brain functional network.
