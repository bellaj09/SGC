Virtual reality is a powerful tool in human behaviour research. However few studies compare its capacity to evoke the same emotional responses as in real scenarios. This study investigates psycho-physiological patterns evoked during the free exploration of an art museum and the museum virtualized through a 3D immersive virtual environment IVE. An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase using standardized 2D and 360 emotional stimuli to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class high/low system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension respectively in the physical museum and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum. The previously presented 360 stimuli contributed to increasing the accuracy in the virtual museum. Also the real vs. virtual classifier accuracy was 95.27% using only EEG mean phase coherency features which demonstrates the high involvement of brain synchronization in emotional virtual reality processes. These findings provide an important contribution at a methodological level and to scientific knowledge which will effectively guide future emotion elicitation and recognition systems using virtual reality.
