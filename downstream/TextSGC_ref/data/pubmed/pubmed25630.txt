"In recent years a growing number of occupational therapists have integrated video game technologies such as the Nintendo Wii into rehabilitation programs. Wiihabilitation or the use of the Wii in rehabilitation has been successful in increasing patients motivation and encouraging full body movement. The non-rehabilitative focus of Wii applications however presents a number of problems: games are too difficult for patients they mainly target upper-body gross motor functions and they lack support for task customization grading and quantitative measurements. To overcome these problems we have designed a low-cost virtual-reality based system. Our system Virtual Wiihab records performance and behavioral measurements allows for activity customization and uses auditory visual and haptic elements to provide extrinsic feedback and motivation to patients."
