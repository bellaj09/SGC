The risk involved in partial liver resections depends mainly on tumor localization invasion of central vascular structures and parenchymal function. The imaging techniques available today computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging allow us to detect precisely the extent of tumor invasion and their relationship to central vessels. The various three-dimensional reconstruction techniques are helpful with regard to a virtual planning of liver resections. The calculation of remaining liver volumes subsequent to partial hepatectomies are considered to be an essential predictive parameter in terms for the development of postoperative liver failure. In a retrospective and a later consecutive prospective clinical study we analyzed the postoperative risk in a series of 570 patients. In an univariate analysis 13 of 31 parameters showed significant values. In multivariate analysis only three parameters partial hepatic resection rate PHRR gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and prothrombin activity were independent parameters for predicting liver failure generating the most significant values for the PHRR. In our experience the most comfortable and precise technique for evaluating PHRR is the b-spline technique. Impact of virtual reality imaging on hepatic liver tumor resection: calculation of risk.
