I provide numerical evidence for the robustness of the Griffiths phase GP reported previously in dynamical threshold model simulations on a large human brain network with N=836733 connected nodes. The model with equalized network sensitivity is extended in two ways: introduction of refractory states or by randomized time-dependent thresholds. The nonuniversal power-law dynamics in an extended control parameter region survives these modifications for a short refractory state and weak disorder. In case of temporal disorder the GP shrinks and for stronger heterogeneity disappears leaving behind a mean-field type of critical transition. Activity avalanche size distributions below the critical point decay faster than in the original model but the addition of inhibitory interactions sets it back to the range of experimental values.
