High-content screening HCS technologies have enabled large scale imaging experiments for studying cell biology and for drug screening. These systems produce hundreds of thousands of microscopy images per day and their utility depends on automated image analysis. Recently deep learning approaches that learn feature representations directly from pixel intensity values have dominated object recognition challenges. These tasks typically have a single centered object per image and existing models are not directly applicable to microscopy datasets. Here we develop an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks CNNs with multiple instance learning MIL in order to classify and segment microscopy images using only whole image level annotations. Classifying and segmenting microscopy images with deep multiple instance learning.
