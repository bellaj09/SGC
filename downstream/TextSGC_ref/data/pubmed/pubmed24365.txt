Sensorimotor cortex exerts both short-term and long-term control over the spinal reflex pathways that serve motor behaviors. Better understanding of this control could offer new possibilities for restoring function after central nervous system trauma or disease. We examined the impact of ongoing sensorimotor cortex SMC activity on the largely monosynaptic pathway of the H-reflex the electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex. In 41 awake adult rats we measured soleus electromyographic EMG activity the soleus H-reflex and electrocorticographic activity over the contralateral SMC while rats were producing steady-state soleus EMG activity. Principal component analysis of electrocorticographic frequency spectra before H-reflex elicitation consistently revealed three frequency bands:  5-30 Hz low  1; 40-85 Hz and high  2; 100-200 Hz. Ongoing i.e. background soleus EMG amplitude correlated negatively with  power and positively with 1 power. In contrast H-reflex size correlated positively with  power and negatively with 1 power but only when background soleus EMG amplitude was included in the linear model. These results support the hypothesis that increased SMC activation indicated by decrease in  power and/or increase in 1 power simultaneously potentiates the H-reflex by exciting spinal motoneurons and suppresses it by decreasing the efficacy of the afferent input. They may help guide the development of new rehabilitation methods and of brain-computer interfaces that use SMC activity as a substitute for lost or impaired motor outputs.
