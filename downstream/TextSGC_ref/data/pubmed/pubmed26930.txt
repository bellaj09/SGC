Electroencephalogram based brain-computer interfaces BCIs enable stroke and motor neuron disease patients to communicate and control devices. Mindfulness meditation has been claimed to enhance metacognitive regulation. The current study explores whether mindfulness meditation training can thus improve the performance of BCI users. To eliminate the possibility of expectation of improvement influencing the results we introduced a music training condition. A norming study found that both meditation and music interventions elicited clear expectations for improvement on the BCI task with the strength of expectation being closely matched. In the main 12 week intervention study seventy-six healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: a meditation training group; a music training group; and a no treatment control group. The mindfulness meditation training group obtained a significantly higher BCI accuracy compared to both the music training and no-treatment control groups after the intervention indicating effects of meditation above and beyond expectancy effects.
