Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the application of virtual artificial intelligence AI in the prediction of functional maturation FM and pattern recognition of factors in autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula RCAVF formation. Materials and Methods: A prospective database of 266 individuals over a four-year period with n=10 variables were used to train validate and test an artificial neural network ANN. The ANN was constructed to create a predictive model and evaluate the impact of variables on the endpoint of FM. Results: The overall accuracy of the training validation testing and all data on each output matrix at detecting FM was 86.4% 82.5% 77.5% and 84.5% respectively. The results corresponded with their area under the curve for each output matrix at best sensitivity and at 1-specificity with the log-rank test p<0.01. ANN classification identified age artery and vein diameter to influence FM with an accuracy of >89%. AI has the ability of predicting with a high grade of accuracy FM and recognising patterns that influence it. Conclusion: AI is a replicable tool that could remain up to date and flexible to ongoing deep learning with further data feed ensuring substantial enhancement in its accuracy. AI could serve as a clinical decision-making tool and its application in vascular access requires further evaluation.
