The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of a virtual reality-based exercise program on fatigue in patients with end-stage renal disease ESRD who receive hemodialysis HD. In this quasi-experimental study design an experimental group  n = 32 received virtual reality training that promoted exercise and a control group  n = 32 received routine care advice on physical activities. Fatigue and physiologic parameters were assessed pretest before intervention as well as posttest 4 weeks after the onset of intervention. Our results showed that patients in the experimental group had significantly lower levels of overall fatigue reduction in vigor and motivation distress and loss of control in mood and higher hemoglobin levels compared with the control group. ANCOVA revealed that there were no differences in overall fatigue and different domains of fatigue. Exercise only increased the blood urea nitrogen BUN and creatinine levels significantly in the intervention group.
