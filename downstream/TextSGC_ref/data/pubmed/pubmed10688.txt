The intelligent inspection of power lines and other difficult-to-access structures and facilities has been greatly enhanced by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs which allow inspection in a safe efficient and high-quality fashion. This paper analyzes the characteristics of a scene containing power equipment and the operation mode of UAVs. A low-cost virtual scene is created and a training sample for the power-line components is generated quickly. Taking a vibration-damper as the main object an assembled detector based on geometrical constraint ADGC is proposed and is used to analyze the virtual dataset. The geometric positional relationship is used as the constraint and the Faster R-CNN Deformable Part Model DPM and Haar cascade classifiers are combined which allows the features of different classifiers such as contour shape and texture to be fully used. By combining the characteristics of virtual data and real data using UAV images the power components are detected by the ADGC. The result produced by the detector with relatively good performance can help expand the training set and achieve a better detection model. Moreover this method can be smoothly transferred to other power-line facilities and other power-line scenarios. An Assembled Detector Based on Geometrical Constraint for Power Component Recognition.
