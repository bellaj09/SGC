Laparoscopy has been widely used to perform abdominal surgeries as it is advantageous in that the patients experience lower post-surgical trauma shorter convalescence and less pain as compared to traditional surgery. Laparoscopic surgeries require precision; therefore it is imperative to train surgeons to reduce the risk of operation. Laparoscopic simulators offer a highly realistic surgical environment by using virtual reality technology and it can improve the training efficiency of laparoscopic surgery. This paper presents a virtual Laparoscopic surgery system. The proposed system utilizes the Visible Chinese Human VCH to construct the virtual models and simulates real-time deformation with both improved special mass-spring model and morph target animation. Meanwhile an external device that integrates two five-degrees-of-freedom 5-DOF manipulators was designed and made to interact with the virtual system. In addition the proposed system provides a modular tool based on Unity3D to define the functions and features of instruments and organs which could help users to build surgical training scenarios quickly. The proposed virtual laparoscopic training system offers two kinds of training mode skills training and surgery training. In the skills training mode the surgeons are mainly trained for basic operations such as laparoscopic camera needle grasp electric coagulation and suturing. In the surgery-training mode the surgeons can practice cholecystectomy and removal of hepatic cysts by guided or non-guided teaching. Virtual Laparoscopic Training System Based on VCH Model.
