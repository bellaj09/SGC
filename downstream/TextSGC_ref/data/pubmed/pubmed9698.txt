The purpose of this work was twofold: a To provide a robust and accurate method for image segmentation of dedicated breast CT bCT volume data sets and b to improve Hounsfield unit HU accuracy in bCT by means of a postprocessing method that uses the segmented images to correct for the low-frequency shading artifacts in reconstructed images. Shading artifact correction in breast CT using an interleaved deep learning segmentation and maximum-likelihood polynomial fitting approach.
