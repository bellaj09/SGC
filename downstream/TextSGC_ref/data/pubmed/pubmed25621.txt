In cognitive neuroscience well-controlled and highly specific paradigms have been developed to measure cognitive processes over the last decades often using computer-assisted presentation and response registration. This approach is in contrast with the traditional paper-and-pencil tests used in clinical neuropsychology which typically assess cognitive function in a less specific manner often even at the level of a cognitive domain. As a result important aspects of cognitive dysfunction may be missed during a neuropsychological assessment. This paper focuses on the main challenges that need to be overcome in order to successfully integrate experimental paradigms from cognitive neuroscience into the clinical practice of neuropsychologists.
