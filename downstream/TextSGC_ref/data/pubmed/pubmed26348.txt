Brain-computer interfaces BCI provide means of communications and control in assistive technology which do not require motor activity from the user. The goal of this study is to promote classification of two types of imaginary movements left and right hands in an EMOTIV cap based system using the Nave Bayes classifier. A preliminary analysis with respect to results obtained by other experiments in this field is also conducted. Processing of the electroencephalography EEG signals is done applying Common Spatial Pattern filters. The EPOC electrodes cap is used for EEG acquisition in two test subjects for two distinct trial formats. The channels picked are FC5 FC6 P7 and P8 of the 10-20 system and a discussion about the differences of using C3 C4 P3 and P4 positions is proposed. Dataset 3 of the BCI Competition II is also analyzed using the implemented algorithms. The maximum classification results for the proposed experiment and for the BCI Competition dataset were respectively 79% and 85% The conclusion of this study is that the picked positions for electrodes may be applied for BCI systems with satisfactory classification rates.
