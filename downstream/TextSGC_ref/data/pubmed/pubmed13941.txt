"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is an increasingly popular technology for studying brain function because it is non-invasive non-irradiating and relatively inexpensive. Further fNIRS potentially allows measurement of hemodynamic activity with high temporal resolution milliseconds and in naturalistic settings. However in comparison with other imaging modalities namely fMRI fNIRS has a significant drawback: limited sensitivity to hemodynamic changes in deep-brain regions. To overcome this limitation we developed a computational method to infer deep-brain activity using fNIRS measurements of cortical activity. Using simultaneous fNIRS and fMRI we measured brain activity in 17 participants as they completed three cognitive tasks. A support vector regression SVR learning algorithm was used to predict activity in twelve deep-brain regions using information from surface fNIRS measurements. We compared these predictions against actual fMRI-measured activity using Pearsons correlation to quantify prediction performance. To provide a benchmark for comparison we also used fMRI measurements of cortical activity to infer deep-brain activity. When using fMRI-measured activity from the entire cortex we were able to predict deep-brain activity in the fusiform cortex with an average correlation coefficient of 0.80 and in all deep-brain regions with an average correlation coefficient of 0.67. The top 15% of predictions using fNIRS signal achieved an accuracy of 0.7. To our knowledge this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of using cortical activity to infer deep-brain activity. This new method has the potential to extend fNIRS applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience research."
