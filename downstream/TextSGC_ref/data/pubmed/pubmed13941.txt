"When dealing with electrocardiography ECG the main focus relies on the classification of the hearts electric activity and deep learning has been proving its value over the years classifying the heartbeats exhibiting great performance when doing so. Following these assumptions we propose a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture with convolutional 1D layers to classify the beats into one of the 4 classes: normal atrial premature contraction premature ventricular contraction and others. Experimental results with MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database confirmed that the model is able to perform well obtaining an accuracy of 96% when using stochastic gradient descent SGD and 83% when using adaptive moment estimation Adam SGD also obtained F1-scores over 90% for the four classes proposed. A larger dataset was created and tested as unforeseen data for the trained model proving that new tests should be done to improve the accuracy of it."
