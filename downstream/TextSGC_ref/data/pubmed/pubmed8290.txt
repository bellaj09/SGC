Clinical named entity recognition CNER is a fundamental and crucial task for clinical and translation research. In recent years deep learning methods have achieved significant success in CNER tasks. However these methods depend greatly on recurrent neural networks RNNs which maintain a vector of hidden activations that are propagated through time thus causing too much time to train models. In this paper we propose a residual dilated convolutional neural network with the conditional random field RD-CNN-CRF for the Chinese CNER which makes the model asynchronous in computation and thus speeding up the training period dramatically. To be more specific Chinese characters and dictionary features are first projected into dense vector representations then they are fed into the residual dilated convolutional neural network to capture contextual features. Finally a conditional random field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags and obtain the optimal tag sequence for the entire sequence. Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset show that our proposed RD-CNN-CRF method competes favorably with state-of-the-art RNN-based methods both in terms of computational performance and training time.
