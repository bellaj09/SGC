Synthesis planning is the process of recursively decomposing target molecules into available precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis can potentially assist chemists in designing synthetic routes; however at present it is cumbersome and cannot provide satisfactory results. In this study we have developed a template-free self-corrected retrosynthesis predictor SCROP to predict retrosynthesis using transformer neural networks. In the method the retrosynthesis planning was converted to a machine translation problem from the products to molecular linear notations of the reactants. By coupling with a neural network-based syntax corrector our method achieved an accuracy of 59.0% on a standard benchmark data set which outperformed other deep learning methods by >21% and template-based methods by >6%. More importantly our method was 1.7 times more accurate than other state-of-the-art methods for compounds not appearing in the training set.
