Working memory WM crucial for successful behavioral performance in most of our everyday activities holds a central role in goal-directed behavior. As task demands increase inducing higher WM load maintaining successful behavioral performance requires the brain to work at the higher end of its capacity. Because it is depending on both external and internal factors individual WM load likely varies in a continuous fashion. The feasibility to extract such a continuous measure in time that correlates to behavioral performance during a working memory task remains unsolved. A continuous time-resolved measure decoded from EEG oscillatory activity predicts working memory task performance.
