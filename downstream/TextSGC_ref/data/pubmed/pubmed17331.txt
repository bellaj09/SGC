Current selection methods for neurosurgical residents fail to include objective measurements of bimanual psychomotor performance. Advancements in computer-based simulation provide opportunities to assess cognitive and psychomotor skills in surgically naive populations during complex simulated neurosurgical tasks in risk-free environments. This pilot study was designed to answer 3 questions: 1 What are the differences in bimanual psychomotor performance among neurosurgical residency applicants using NeuroTouch? 2 Are there exceptionally skilled medical students in the applicant cohort? and 3 Is there an influence of previous surgical exposure on surgical performance? Bimanual Psychomotor Performance in Neurosurgical Resident Applicants Assessed Using NeuroTouch a Virtual Reality Simulator.
