This study aims to investigate the network pharmacology of Chinese medicinal formulae for treatment of Alzheimers disease.Machine learning algorithms were applied to construct classifiers in predicting the active molecules against 25 key targets toward Alzheimers diseaseAD.By extensive data profiling we compiled 13 classical traditional Chinese medicineTCM formulas with clinical efficacy for AD. There were 7 Chinese herbs with a frequency of 5 or higher in our study. Based on the predicted results we built constituent-target and further construct target-target interaction network by STRINGSearch Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins and target-disease network by DAVIDDatabase for AnnotationVisualization and Integrated Discovery and gene disease database to study the synergistic mechanism of the herbal constituents in the Chinese traditional patent medicine. By prediction of blood-brain penetration and validation by TCMsp traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology and Drugbank we found 7 typical multi-target constituents which have diverse structure. The mechanism uncovered by this study may offer a deep insight into the action mechanism of TCMs for AD. The predicted inhibitors for the AD-related targets may provide a good source of new lead constituents against AD. Network pharmacology study of effective constituents of traditional Chinese medicine for Alzheimers disease treatment.
