Brain-Computer Interface BCI provides an alternate channel of interaction for people with severe motor disabilities. The Common Spatial Pattern CSP algorithm is effective in extracting discriminative features from EEG data for motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI. CSP yields signal from various locations for better performance. In this study we selected a subset of EEG channels using correlation coefficient of spectral entropy and compared the classification performance using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern FBCSP algorithm. We conducted experiments on 4 healthy subjects and one Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS patient. The results showed that the proposed channel selection method increased classification accuracy of all subjects from 1.25% to 8.22%. Optimal performance was obtained using between 13 to 24 channels and channels located over the motor cortex zone possess higher probabilities of being selected. Comparing with the channels manually selected to over the motor cortex area the correlation coefficient method is able to identify the optimal channel combination and improve the motor imagery decoding accuracy of Healthy and ALS subjects.
