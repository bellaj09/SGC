"Deep reinforcement learning DRL has excellent performance in continuous control problems and it is widely used in path planning and other fields. An autonomous path planning model based on DRL is proposed to realize the intelligent path planning of unmanned ships in the unknown environment. The model utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient DDPG algorithm through the continuous interaction with the environment and the use of historical experience data; the agent learns the optimal action strategy in a simulation environment. The navigation rules and the ships encounter situation are transformed into a navigation restricted area so as to achieve the purpose of planned path safety in order to ensure the validity and accuracy of the model. Ship data provided by ship automatic identification system AIS are used to train this path planning model. Subsequently the improved DRL is obtained by combining DDPG with the artificial potential field. Finally the path planning model is integrated into the electronic chart platform for experiments. Through the establishment of comparative experiments the results show that the improved model can achieve autonomous path planning and it has good convergence speed and stability."
