We introduce a new methodology that combines deep learning and level set for the automated segmentation of the left ventricle of the heart from cardiac cine magnetic resonance MR data. This combination is relevant for segmentation problems where the visual object of interest presents large shape and appearance variations but the annotated training set is small which is the case for various medical image analysis applications including the one considered in this paper. In particular level set methods are based on shape and appearance terms that use small training sets but present limitations for modelling the visual object variations. Deep learning methods can model such variations using relatively small amounts of annotated training but they often need to be regularised to produce good generalisation. Therefore the combination of these methods brings together the advantages of both approaches producing a methodology that needs small training sets and produces accurate segmentation results. We test our methodology on the MICCAI 2009 left ventricle segmentation challenge database containing 15 sequences for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing where our approach achieves the most accurate results in the semi-automated problem and state-of-the-art results for the fully automated challenge.
