Predicting protein function and structure from sequence is one important challenge for computational biology. For 26\u2009years most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally evolutionary information is less powerful for small families e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here. Modeling aspects of the language of life through transfer-learning protein sequences.
