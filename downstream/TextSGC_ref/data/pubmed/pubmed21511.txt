"Including supplementary information from the brain or other body parts in the control of brain-machine interfaces BMIs has been recently proposed and investigated. Such enriched interfaces are referred to as hybrid BMIs hBMIs and have been proven to be more robust and accurate than regular BMIs for assistive and rehabilitative applications. Electromyographic EMG activity is one of the most widely utilized biosignals in hBMIs as it provides a quite direct measurement of the motion intention of the user. Whereas most of the existing non-invasive EEG-EMG-hBMIs have only been subjected to offline testings or are limited to one degree of freedom DoF we present an EEG-EMG-hBMI that allows the simultaneous control of 7-DoFs of the upper limb with a robotic exoskeleton. Moreover it establishes a biologically-inspired hierarchical control flow requiring the active participation of central and peripheral structures of the nervous system. Contingent visual and proprioceptive feedback about the users EEG and EMG activity is provided in the form of velocity modulation during functional task training. We believe that training with this closed-loop system may facilitate functional neuroplastic processes and eventually elicit a joint brain and muscle motor rehabilitation. Its usability is validated during a real-time operation session in a healthy participant and a chronic stroke patient showing encouraging results for its application to a clinical rehabilitation scenario."
