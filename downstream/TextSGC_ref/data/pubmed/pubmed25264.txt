"Power changes in specific frequency bands are typical brain responses during motor planning or preparation. Many studies have demonstrated that in addition to the premotor supplementary motor and primary sensorimotor areas the prefrontal area contributes to generating such responses. However most brain-computer interface BCI studies have focused on the primary sensorimotor area and have estimated movements using postonset period brain signals. Our aim was to determine whether the prefrontal area could contribute to the prediction of voluntary movement types before movement onset. In our study electrocorticography ECoG was recorded from six epilepsy patients while performing two self-paced tasks: hand grasping and elbow flexion. The prefrontal area was sufficient to allow classification of different movements through the areas premovement signals -2.0\u2009s to 0\u2009s in four subjects. The most pronounced power difference frequency band was the beta band 13-30\u2009Hz. The movement prediction rate during single trial estimation averaged 74% across the six subjects. Our results suggest that premovement signals in the prefrontal area are useful in distinguishing different movement tasks and that the beta band is the most informative for prediction of movement type before movement onset."
