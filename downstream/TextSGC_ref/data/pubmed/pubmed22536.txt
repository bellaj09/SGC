"In this paper we demonstrate how thumb-to-finger tap interaction can be employed to perform eyes-free discrete symbolic input in virtual and augmented reality environments. Our DigiTap device is worn on the wrist to keep the hand free from any instrumentation such that tactile sense and dexterity are not impaired. DigiTap senses the jerk that is caused by a tap and takes an image sequence to detect the tap location. The device is able to recognize taps at twelve different locations on the fingers and at some positions it can even distinguish between different tap strengths. We have conducted an extended user study to evaluate users ability to interact with the device and to perform symbolic input." Sensing Thumb-to-Finger Taps for Symbolic Input in VR/AR Environments.
