Augmented reality is a technology that makes use of special glasses to combine various virtual images such as holograms and scans with reality. This technology offers important advantages for surgery in particular because stereoscopic three-dimensional images of anatomical structures can be projected almost perfectly on the immobilised patient before and during surgery. This technology also has a lot of potential when it comes to education and providing information to patients. There are still some major obstacles but it is expected that this technology will eventually find its way to virtually all operating rooms. Augmented reality glasses in the operating room.
