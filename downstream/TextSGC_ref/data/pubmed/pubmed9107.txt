This article reviews recent advances in applying natural language processing NLP to Electronic Health Records EHRs for computational phenotyping. NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis categorization novel phenotype discovery clinical trial screening pharmacogenomics drug-drug interaction DDI and adverse drug event ADE detection as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance. Often better performance is achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many advances challenges and opportunities remain for NLP-based computational phenotyping including better model interpretability and generalizability and proper characterization of feature relations in clinical narratives.
