Previous studies have shown changes in membrane properties of neurons in rat deep cerebellar nuclei DCN as a function of development but due to technical difficulties in obtaining viable DCN slices from adult animals it remains unclear whether there are learning-related alterations in the membrane properties of DCN neurons in adult rats. This study was designed to record from identified DCN cells in cerebellar slices from postnatal day 25-26 P25-26 rats that had a relatively mature sensory nervous system and were able to acquire learning as a result of tone-shock eyeblink conditioning EBC and to document resulting changes in electrophysiological properties. After electromyographic electrode implantation at P21 and inoculation with a fluorescent pseudorabies virus PRV-152 at P22-23 rats received either four sessions of paired delay EBC or unpaired stimulus presentations with a tone conditioned stimulus and a shock unconditioned stimulus or sat in the training chamber without stimulus presentations. Compared with rats given unpaired stimuli or no stimulus presentations rats given paired EBC showed an increase in conditioned responses across sessions. Whole-cell recordings of both fluorescent and nonfluorescent DCN projection neurons showed that delay EBC induced significant changes in membrane properties of evoked DCN action potentials including a reduced after-hyperpolarization amplitude and shortened latency. Similar findings were obtained in hyperpolarization-induced rebound spikes of DCN neurons. In sum delay EBC produced significant changes in the membrane properties of juvenile rat DCN projection neurons. These learning-specific changes in DCN excitability have not previously been reported in any species or task.
