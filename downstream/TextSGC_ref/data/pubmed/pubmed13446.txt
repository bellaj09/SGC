Current approaches to predicting a cardiovascular disease CVD event rely on conventional risk factors and cross-sectional data. In this study we applied machine learning and deep learning models to 10-year CVD event prediction by using longitudinal electronic health record EHR and genetic data. Our study cohort included 109 490 individuals. In the first experiment we extracted aggregated and longitudinal features from EHR. We applied logistic regression random forests gradient boosting trees convolutional neural networks CNN and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory LSTM units. In the second experiment we applied a late-fusion approach to incorporate genetic features. We compared the performance with approaches currently utilized in routine clinical practice - American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk Equation. Our results indicated that incorporating longitudinal feature lead to better event prediction. Combining genetic features through a late-fusion approach can further improve CVD prediction underscoring the importance of integrating relevant genetic data whenever available.
