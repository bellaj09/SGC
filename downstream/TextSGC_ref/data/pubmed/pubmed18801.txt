"The use of Brain-Computer Interface BCI technology in neurorehabilitation provides new strategies to overcome stroke-related motor limitations. Recent studies demonstrated the brains capacity for functional and structural plasticity through BCI. However it is not fully clear how we can take full advantage of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying recovery and how to maximize restoration through BCI. In this study we investigate the role of multimodal virtual reality VR simulations and motor priming MP in an upper limb motor-imagery BCI task in order to maximize the engagement of sensory-motor networks in a broad range of patients who can benefit from virtual rehabilitation training." Motor priming in virtual reality can augment motor-imagery training efficacy in restorative brain-computer interaction: a within-subject analysis.
