A medical annotation system for radiology images extracts clinically useful information from the images allowing the machines to infer useful abstract semantics and become capable of automatic reasoning and making diagnostic decision. It also supplies human-interpretable explanation for the images. We have implemented a computerized framework that given a liver CT image predicts radiological annotations with high accuracy in order to generate a structured report which includes predicting very specific high-level semantic content. Each report of a liver CT image is related to different inhomogeneous parts like the liver lesion and vessel. We put forward a claim that gathering all kinds of features is not suitable for filling all parts of the report. As a matter of fact for each group of annotations one should find and extract the best feature that results in the best answers for that specific annotation. To this end the main challenge is discovering the relationships between these specific semantic concepts and their association with the low-level image features. Our framework was implemented by combining a set of the state-of-the-art low-level imaging features. In addition we propose a novel feature DLBP deep local binary pattern based on LBP that incorporates multi-slice analysis in CT images and further improves the performance. In order to model our annotation system two methods were used namely multi-class support vector machine SVM and random subspace RS which is an ensemble learning method. Applying this representation leads to a high prediction accuracy of 93.1% despite its relatively low dimension in comparison with the existing works.
