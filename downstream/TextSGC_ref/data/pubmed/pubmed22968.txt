Competency-based training has gained ground in surgical training and with it assessment tools to ensure that training objectives are met. Very few assessment tools are available for evaluating performance in thoracoscopic procedures. Video recordings would provide the possibility of blinded assessment and limited rater bias. This study aimed to provide validity evidence for a newly developed and dedicated tool for assessing competency in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery VATS lobectomy. Evaluating competency in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS lobectomy performance using a novel assessment tool and virtual reality simulation.
