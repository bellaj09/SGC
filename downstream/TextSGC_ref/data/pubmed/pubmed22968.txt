We have developed an interactive docking program called VRDD. It offers various modes of displaying molecules in an immersive three-dimensional virtual reality VR environment. It allows a user to interactively perform molecular docking aided by automatic docking and side chain conformational search. Binding free energies are computed in real time and the program enables the user to explore only clash-free orientations of a ligand. VRDD also supplies visual and auditory feedback during docking and side chain search indicating the levels of atomic overlap and interaction energy. The stunning VR graphics immerse users in the scene and can maximally stimulate their design intuition. We have tested VRDD on three cases with increasing complexity: a nine-residue-long peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex MHC molecule barstar bound to barnase and an antibody bound to a hemagglutinin. Without prior knowledge combinations of hand-docking and automatic refinement led to accurate complex structures for the first two complexes. The third case for which all automatic docking algorithms failed to identify the correct complex in a previous blind test also failed for VRDD. Our results show that the combination of VR docking and automatic docking can make unique contributions to molecular modeling.
