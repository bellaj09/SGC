"The effect of the size and shape of the neck and the taper of the femoral stem on dislocation rate after revision total hip arthroplasty was examined. Design I had a large 14/16 long taper with a circular neck cross-section; a fixed 42-mm offset; and a neck that was anteverted relative to the stem. Design II was characterized by a smaller 12/14 shorter taper; a trapezoidal neck cross-section; a progressive 40-50 mm offset; and no neck anteversion relative to the stem. The stems were digitized and placed through a range of motion using virtual reality software and the cross-sectional area of the neck length of the taper and total arc of motion before impingement between the neck and liner were compared. The dislocation rate at a minimum of 2 years follow-up was 15.4% 8 of 52 for design I compared with 4.3% 2 of 46 for design II. This finding was consistent with the results of computer modeling which showed that design I had a cross-sectional area that was 32% greater and a total arc of motion that was 76% less compared with design II. The results suggest that neck and taper design may be an important factor in dislocation after revision total hip arthroplasty."
