Persistent postural perceptual dizziness PPPD is a common vestibular disorder of persistent dizziness and unsteadiness exacerbated by upright posture self-motion and exposure to complex or moving visual stimuli. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies found dysfunctional activity in the visual-vestibular cortices in patients with PPPD. Clinical studies showed that the anxiety-related personality traits of neuroticism and introversion may predispose individuals to PPPD. However the effects of these traits on brain function in patients with PPPD versus healthy controls HCs have not been studied. Brain responses to virtual reality visual motion stimulation are affected by neurotic personality traits in patients with persistent postural-perceptual dizziness.
