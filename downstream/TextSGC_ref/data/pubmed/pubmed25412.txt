Multi-channel electroencephalography recordings have shown that a visual cue indicating right hand left hand or foot motor imagery can induce a short-lived brain state in the order of about 500 ms. In the present study 10 able-bodied subjects without any motor imagery experience naive subjects were asked to imagine the indicated limb movement for some seconds. Common spatial filtering and linear single-trial classification was applied to discriminate between two conditions two brain states: right hand vs. left hand left hand vs. foot and right hand vs. foot. The corresponding classification accuracies mean +/- SD were 80.0 +/- 10.6% 83.3 +/- 10.2% and 83.6 +/- 8.8% respectively. Inspection of central mu and beta rhythms revealed a short-lasting somatotopically specific event-related desynchronization ERD in the upper mu and/or beta bands starting approximately 300 ms after the cue onset and lasting for less than 1 s. Short-lived brain state after cued motor imagery in naive subjects.
