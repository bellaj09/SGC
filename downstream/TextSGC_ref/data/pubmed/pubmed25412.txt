Transanal total mesorectal excision TME is an emerging minimally invasive approach to rectal cancer with encouraging preliminary results. However the new surgical anatomy of the bottom-up approach complicates surgical understanding and increases the risks of inadvertent injuries to crucial anatomical structures including nerves. Key elements to improve the safety and stimulate interest in such a complex technique might be robotics and image guidance to enhance the level of precision. In this editorial some of the technologies that could be used for precision TME are outlined in light of the experience of our Institute for Image-Guided Surgery. The quest for precision in transanal total mesorectal excision.
