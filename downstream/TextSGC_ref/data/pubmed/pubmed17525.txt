"Bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation STN-DBS and continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine APM-csi can provide a comparable improvement on motor function in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease PD but the mechanisms by which both therapies exert their effects are different. We analyzed the cognitive effects of APM-csi. We also compared neuropsychological effects induced by STN-DBS and APM-csi in advanced PD to ascertain the neuropsychological aspects relevant in determining the therapeutic procedure that is the most appropriate in a particular patient. We studied 9 patients treated with STN-DBS and 7 patients with APM-csi. Neuropsychological measures included Reys Auditory-Verbal Learning Stroop Trail Making phonetic verbal fluency and Judgment of Line Orientation tests. In the APM-csi group significant changes were not observed in the neuropsychological tests performance. By contrast in the STN-DBS group moderate worsening was found in phonetic verbal fluency and Stroop Naming scores that was partially reversible at long-term follow-up and did not have consequences on regular activities. Consequently these findings could be interpreted as being not relevant in deciding the most suitable treatment in a given patient."
