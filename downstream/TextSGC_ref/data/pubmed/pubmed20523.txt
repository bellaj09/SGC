The learning curve in laparoscopic surgery may be associated with higher patient risk which is unacceptable in the setting of kidney donation. Virtual reality simulators may increase the safety and efficiency of training in laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate if the results of a training session reflect the actual skill level of transplantation surgeons and whether the simulator could differentiate laparoscopic experienced transplantation surgeon from advanced trainees. Objective evaluation of minimally invasive surgical skills for transplantation. Surgeons using a virtual reality simulator.
