"Individuals with Parkinsons disease PD commonly experience freezing of gait under time constraints in narrow spaces and in the dark. One commonality between these different situations is that they may all provoke anxiety yet anxiety has never been directly examined as a cause of FOG. In this study virtual reality was used to induce anxiety and evaluate whether it directly causes FOG. Fourteen patients with PD and freezing of gait Freezers and 17 PD without freezing of gait Non-Freezers were instructed to walk in two virtual environments: i across a plank that was located on the ground LOW ii across a plank above a deep pit HIGH. Multiple synchronized motion capture cameras updated participants movement through the virtual environment in real-time while their gait was recorded. Anxiety levels were evaluated after each trial using self-assessment manikins. Freezers performed the experiment on two separate occasions in their ON and OFF state. Freezers reported higher levels of anxiety compared to Non-Freezers p < 0.001 and all patients reported greater levels of anxiety when walking across the HIGH plank compared to the LOW p < 0.001. Freezers experienced significantly more freezing of gait episodes p = 0.013 and spent a significantly greater percentage of each trial frozen p = 0.005 when crossing the HIGH plank. This finding was even more pronounced when comparing Freezers in their OFF state. Freezers also had greater step length variability in the HIGH compared to the LOW condition while the step length variability in Non-Freezers did not change. In conclusion this was the first study to directly compare freezing of gait in anxious and non-anxious situations. These results present strong evidence that anxiety is an important mechanism underlying freezing of gait and supports the notion that the limbic system may have a profound contribution to freezing in PD."
