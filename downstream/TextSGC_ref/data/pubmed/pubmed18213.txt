Automatic processes to approach smoking-related cues have been repeatedly linked to smoking status intensity of smoking and cigarette craving. Moreover recent findings suggest that targeting those tendencies directly by means of approach bias modification ABM has merit in changing maladaptive approach tendencies for drug cues and reducing drug consumption. However training effects tend to be small. Embedding the training into virtual reality VR technology could be a promising way to improve training efficacy. The present protocol describes a randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the efficacy of a newly developed VR-ABM as a means of reducing smoking-related approach biases or nicotine consumption in smokers seeking abstinence. Promoting smoking abstinence in smokers willing to quit smoking through virtual reality-approach bias retraining: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
