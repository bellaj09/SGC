Stereotactic registration is the most critical step ensuring accuracy in deep brain stimulation DBS surgery. 3D fluoroscopy XT is emerging as an alternative to CT. XT has been shown to be safe and effective for intraoperative confirmation of lead position following implantation. However there is a lack of studies evaluating the suitability of XT to be used for the more crucial step of registration and its capability of being merged to a preoperative MRI. This is the first study comparing accuracy efficiency and radiation exposure of XT- vs CT-based stereotactic registration and XT/MRI merging in deep brain stimulation. The accuracy of 3D fluoroscopy XT vs computed tomography CT registration in deep brain stimulation DBS surgery.
