Purpose: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of virtual representation of body parts on pain perception in patients with pain and in pain-free participants exposed to experimentally induced pain.Methods: Databases searched: Medline PsycInfo CINAHL and Web of Science. Studies investigating participants with clinical pain or those who were pain free and exposed to experimentally induced pain were analysed separately.Results: Eighteen clinical studies and seven experimental studies were included. Randomised controlled clinical trials showed no significant difference between intervention and control groups for pain intensity. Clinical studies with a single group pretest-posttest design showed a reduction in pain after intervention. In the studies including a sample of pain free participants exposed to experimentally induced pain there was an increase in pain threshold when the virtual arm was collocated with the real arm when it moved in synchrony with the real arm and when the colour of the stimulated part of the virtual arm became blue. Observing a virtual arm covered with iron armour reduced pain.Conclusions: The use of virtual representations of body parts to reduce pain is promising. However due to the poor methodological quality and limitations of primary studies we could not find conclusive evidence.Implications for rehabilitationVirtual reality has been increasingly used in the rehabilitation of painful and dysfunctional limbs.Virtual reality can be used to distract attention away from acute pain and may also provide corrective psychological and physiological environments.Virtual representation of body parts has been used to provide a corrective re-embodiment of painful dysmorphic body parts and primary research shows promising results.
