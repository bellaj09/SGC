"The basal ganglia typically associated with motor function are involved in human cognitive processes as demonstrated in behavioral lesion and noninvasive functional neuroimaging studies. Here we report task-contingent changes in concentrations of the neurotransmitters glutamate Glu and gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA in the globus pallidus internus GPi of two patients with Parkinsons disease undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery by utilizing in-vivo microdialysis measurements during performance of implicit and declarative memory tasks. Performance of an implicit memory task weather prediction task-WPT was associated with increased levels of glutamate and GABA in the GPi compared to their concentrations at baseline. On the other hand performance of a declarative memory task verbal learning task-VLT was associated with decreased levels of glutamate and GABA in GPi compared to baseline during the encoding and immediate recall phase with less conclusive results during the delayed recall phase. These results are in line with hypothesized changes in these neurotransmitter levels: an increase of excitatory Glu input from subthalamic nucleus STN to GPi during implicit memory task performance and a decrease of inhibitory inputs GABA from globus pallidus externus GPe and striatum to GPi during declarative memory performance. Consistent with our previous report on in-vivo neurotransmitter changes during tasks in STN these data provide corroborative evidence for the direct involvement of basal ganglia in cognitive functions and complements our model of the functional circuitry of basal ganglia in the healthy and Parkinsons disease affected brain."
