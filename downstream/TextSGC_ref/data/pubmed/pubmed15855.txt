"Nanopore sequencing is a rapidly developing third-generation sequencing technology which can generate long nucleotide reads of molecules within a portable device in real-time. Through detecting the change of ion currency signals during a DNA/RNA fragments pass through a nanopore genotypes are determined. Currently the accuracy of nanopore basecalling has a higher error rate than the basecalling of short-read sequencing. Through utilizing deep neural networks the-state-of-the art nanopore basecallers achieve basecalling accuracy in a range from 85% to 95%." Nanopore basecalling from a perspective of instance segmentation.
