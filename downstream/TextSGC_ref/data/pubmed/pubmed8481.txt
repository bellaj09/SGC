"The debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s Samuel in Science 1323429:741-742 1960. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.132.3429.741; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine MIT Press New York 1961. However in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by Deep Neural Networks and Machine Learning ML techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles-the what of AI ethics beneficence non-maleficence autonomy justice and explicability-rather than on practices the how. Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate but the AI communitys ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology the initial findings and provides a summary of future research needs."
