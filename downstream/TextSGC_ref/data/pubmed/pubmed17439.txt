The effective integration of detailed structural information with computational chemistry medicinal chemistry and informatics transforms the dream of virtual screening into reality. One of the most important technologies essential for virtual screening is an effective docking method to find molecules that efficaciously interact with their target molecules. Since an efficient docking method can be a powerful tool for virtual screening many different approaches to solving docking problems have been proposed. Docking problems have not yet been solved and none of the currently available programs are perfect in predicting all possible scenarios. Despite the limits and imperfections of the methodology currently available docking methods are very useful for drug discovery. The basic principles and limits of docking methods together with matters for attention in applying the methods are described in this paper. Docking method for drug discovery.
