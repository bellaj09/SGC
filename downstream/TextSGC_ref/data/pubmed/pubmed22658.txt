Middle-aged and older men who have sex with men MSM are one of the most underestimated populations with regard to HIV/AIDS infection despite the worldwide trend of increasing prevalence in recent years. This population also has low rates of testing although rare studies are done exclusively with middle-aged and older MSM assessing the factors associated with this prevalence. Thus based on data from an exclusive online survey with middle-aged and older MSM who use geolocation-based dating applications the purpose of the study was to analyze factors associated with not taking the HIV test among middle-aged 50 years old and older MSM in Brazil. Using a modification of time-location sampling adapted to virtual reality 412 volunteers were approached in Grindr Hornet SCRUFF and Daddyhunt. The multivariate logistic regression model was adopted to produce adjusted odds ratios ORa considering a significance level at .05. There were factors associated with not taking the test: being in a relationship ORa: 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 0.53; knowing partner through the applications ORa: 1.84; 95% CI 1.07 3.15; not knowing the serological status ORa: 5.07; 95% CI 1.88 13.67; ejaculating outside of anal cavity ORa: 1.79; 95% CI 1.04 3.05; practicing sex without penetration ORa: 2.30; 95% CI 1.17 4.50; not taking the test as a form of prevention ORa: 2.83; 95% CI 1.05 7.68; and rarely using Viagra in sexual intercourse ORa: 1.91; 95% CI 1.20 3.65. There is a blind spot in the prevalence of HIV testing in older MSM because this population is not being covered by services which compromises the overall response to HIV the goals set for universal health coverage.
