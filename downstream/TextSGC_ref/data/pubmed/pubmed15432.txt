This paper argues that simulated practice in the university setting is not just a second best to learning in the clinical area but one which offers the potential for deliberation and deep learning Eraut M. 2000.

The context of student learning in an undergraduate midwifery programme is analysed using human activity theory Engestrm Y. 2001. Expansive learning at work: toward an activity theoretical reconceptualization. Journal of Education and Work 14 133-156. The advantages of this approach to student learning as opposed to situated learning theory and the concept of legitimate peripheral participation Lave J. Wenger E. 1991. Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. Cambridge University Press New York are discussed. An activity system changes as a result of contradictions and tensions between what it purports to produce and the views of stakeholders multi-voicedness as well as its historical context Historicity of activity. A focus group with students highlights their expressed need for more simulated practice experience. The views of midwifery lecturers are sought as an alternative voice on this tension in the current programme. Qualitative differences in types of simulated experience are explored and concerns about resources are raised in the analysis. Discussion considers the value of well planned simulations in encouraging the expression of tacit understanding through a group deliberative learning process Eraut M. 2000.
