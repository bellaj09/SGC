Advances in neuroradiological planning techniques in deep brain stimulation have put the need for intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring into doubt. Moreover intraoperative monitoring prolongs surgical time and there is potential association between the use of microelectrodes and increased incidence of hemorrhagic complications. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between the anatomically planned trajectory and the final subthalamic electrode placement after electrophysiological monitoring in patients with Parkinson"s disease and its change with the increasing experience of the surgical team. Learning Curve in Anatomo-Electrophysiological Correlations in Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation.
