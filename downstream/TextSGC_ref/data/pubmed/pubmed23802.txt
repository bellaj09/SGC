There are moments in everyday life when we need to consider the thoughts and intentions of other individuals in order to act in a socially appropriate manner. Most of this mentalizing occurs spontaneously as we go about our business in the complexity of the real world. As such studying the neural basis of spontaneous mentalizing has been virtually impossible. Here we devised a means to achieve this by employing a unique combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI a detailed and interactive virtual reality simulation of a bustling familiar city and a retrospective verbal report protocol. We were able to provide insights into the content of spontaneous mentalizing events and identify the brain regions that underlie them. We found increased activity in a number of regions namely the right posterior superior temporal sulcus the medial prefrontal cortex and the right temporal pole associated with spontaneous mentalizing. Furthermore we observed the right posterior superior temporal sulcus to be consistently active during several different subtypes of mentalizing events. By contrast medial prefrontal cortex seemed to be particularly involved in thinking about agents that were visible in the environment. Our findings show that it is possible to investigate the neural basis of mentalizing in a manner closer to its true context the real world opening up intriguing possibilities for making comparisons with those who have mentalizing problems.
