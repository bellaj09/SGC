Topographic regularity is an important biological principle in brain connections that has been observed in various anatomical studies. However there has been limited research on mathematically characterizing this property and applying it in the analysis of in vivo connectome imaging data. In this work we propose a general mathematical model of topographic regularity for white matter fiber bundles based on previous neuroanatomical understanding. Our model is based on a novel group spectral graph analysis GSGA framework motivated by spectral graph theory and tensor decomposition. The GSGA provides a common set of eigenvectors for the graphs formed by topographic proximity of nearby tracts which gives rises to the group graph spectral distance or G2SD for measuring the topographic regularity of each fiber tract in a tractogram. Based on this novel model of topographic regularity in fiber tracts we then develop a tract filtering algorithm that can generally be applied to remove outliers in tractograms generated by any tractography algorithm. In the experimental results we show that our novel algorithm outperforms existing methods in both simulation data from ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge and real data from the Human Connectome Project HCP. On a large-scale dataset from 215 HCP subjects we quantitatively show our method can significantly improve the retinotopy in the reconstruction of the optic radiation bundle. The software for the tract filtering algorithm developed in this work has also been publicly released on NITRC https://www.nitrc.org/projects/connectopytool.
