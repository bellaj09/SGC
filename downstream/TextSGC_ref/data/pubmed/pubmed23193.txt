To realize a low-invasive and high accuracy BMI Brain-machine interface system we have already developed a fully-implantable wireless BMI system which consists of ECoG neural electrode arrays neural recording ASICs a Wi-Fi based wireless data transmitter and a wireless power receiver with a rechargeable battery. For accurate estimation of movement intentions it is important for a BMI system to have a large number of recording channels. In this paper we report a new multi-channel BMI system which is able to record up to 4096-ch ECoG data by multiple connections of 64-ch ASICs and time division multiplexing of recorded data. This system has an ultra-wide-band UWB wireless unit for transmitting the recorded neural signals to outside the body. By preliminary experiments with a human body equivalent liquid phantom we confirmed 4096-ch UWB wireless data transmission at 128 Mbps mode below 20 mm distance. Multichannel neural recording with a 128 Mbps UWB wireless transmitter for implantable brain-machine interfaces.
