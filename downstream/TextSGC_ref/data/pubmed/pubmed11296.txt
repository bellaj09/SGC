Molecular toxicity prediction is one of the key studies in drug design. In this paper a deep learning network based on a two-dimension grid of molecules is proposed to predict toxicity. At first the van der Waals force and hydrogen bond were calculated according to different descriptors of molecules and multi-channel grids were generated which could discover more detail and helpful molecular information for toxicity prediction. The generated grids were fed into a convolutional neural network to obtain the result. A Tox21 dataset was used for the evaluation. This dataset contains more than 12000 molecules. It can be seen from the experiment that the proposed method performs better compared to other traditional deep learning and machine learning methods.
