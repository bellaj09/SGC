Osteoporosis is an underdiagnosed condition despite effective screening modalities. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry DEXA screening although recommended in clinical guidelines remains markedly underutilized. In contrast to DEXA CT utilization is high and presents a valuable data source for opportunistic osteoporosis screening. The purpose of this study was to describe a method to simulate lumbar DEXA scores from routinely acquired CT studies using a machine-learning algorithm.
