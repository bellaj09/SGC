We propose a frame-based natural language processing NLP method that extracts cancer-related information from clinical narratives. We focus on three frames: cancer diagnosis cancer therapeutic procedure and tumor description. We utilize a deep learning-based approach bidirectional Long Short-term Memory LSTM Conditional Random Field CRF which uses both character and word embeddings. The system consists of two constituent sequence classifiers: a frame identification lexical unit classifier and a frame element classifier. The classifier achieves an F1 of 93.70 for cancer diagnosis 96.33 for therapeutic procedure and 87.18 for tumor description. These represent improvements of 10.72 0.85 and 8.04 over a baseline heuristic respectively. Additionally we demonstrate that the combination of both GloVe and MIMIC-III embeddings has the best representational effect. Overall this study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning methods to extract frame semantic information from clinical narratives.
