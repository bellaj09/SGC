Computer-assisted maxillofacial orthognathic surgery is an emerging and interdisciplinary field linking orthognathic surgery remote signal engineering and three-dimensional 3D medical imaging. Most of the computational solutions already developed make use of different specialized systems which introduce difficulties both in the information transfer from one stage to the others and in the use of such systems by surgeons. Trying to address such issue in this work we present a common computer-based system that integrates proposed modules for planning and assisting the maxillofacial surgery. With that we propose to replace the current standard orthognathic preoperative planning and to bring information from a virtual planning to the real operative field. The system prototype including three-dimensional cephalometric analysis static and dynamic virtual orthognathic planning and mixed reality transfer of information to the operation room is described and the first results obtained are presented. Towards an integrated system for planning and assisting maxillofacial orthognathic surgery.
