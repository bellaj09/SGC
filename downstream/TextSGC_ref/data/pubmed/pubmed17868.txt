Immersive stereoscopic virtual reality VR systems provide a powerful multimedia tool for a laboratory simulation of distinct scenarios including stressful situations close to reality. Thus far cortisol secretion as a neuroendocrine parameter of stress has not been evaluated within a VR paradigm. Ninety-four healthy subjects were subjected to a VR paradigm and a cognitive stress task. It was tested a if the modification of reality induced by dynamic VR as opposed to static VR can be regarded as a stressor and b if it can modify an additional cognitive stress response. In addition the impact of gender on cortisol responses was assessed. A significant cortisol increase was observed only after the combined application of both conditions but not after the dynamic VR or the cognitive stress alone. Cortisol reactivity was greater for men than for women. We conclude that dynamic VR does not affect cortisol secretion per se but increases cortisol responses in a dual task paradigm. This provides the basis for the application of VR in neuroscientific research which includes the assessment of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation. Modification of virtual reality combined with a mental task stimulates cortisol in volunteers.
