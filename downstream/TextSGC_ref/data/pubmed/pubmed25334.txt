Using functional magnetic resonance imaging technique we performed online brain mapping of gamers practiced to voluntary cognitively control their heart rate the parameter that operated a competitive virtual gameplay in the adaptive feedback loop. With the default start picture the regions of interest during the formation of optimal cognitive strategy were as follows: Brodmann areas 19 37 39 and 40 i.e. cerebellar structures vermis amygdala pyramids clivus. "Localization" concept of the contribution of the cerebellum to cognitive processes is discussed. Dynamic mapping of brain and cognitive control of virtual gameplay study by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
