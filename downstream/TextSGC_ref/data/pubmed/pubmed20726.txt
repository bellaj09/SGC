A wireless low power 64-channel data acquisition system named WIMAGINE has been designed for ElectroCorticoGram ECoG recording. This system is based on a custom integrated circuit ASIC for amplification and digitization on 64 channels. It allows the RF transmission in the MICS band of 32 ECoG recording channels among 64 channels available sampled at 1 kHz per channel with a 12-bit resolution. The device is powered wirelessly through an inductive link at 13.56 MHz able to provide 100mW 30mA at 3.3V. This integration is a first step towards an implantable device for brain activity monitoring and Brain-Computer Interface BCI applications. The main features of the WIMAGINE platform and its architecture will be presented as well as its performances and in vivo studies.
