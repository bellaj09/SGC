State-of-the-art experiments for studying neural processes underlying visual cognition often constrain sensory inputs e.g. static images and our behavior e.g. fixed eye-gaze long eye fixations isolating or simplifying the interaction of neural processes. Motivated by the non-stationarity of our natural visual environment we investigated the electroencephalography EEG correlates of visual recognition while participants overtly performed visual search in non-stationary scenes. We hypothesized that visual effects such as those typically used in human-computer interfaces may increase temporal uncertainty with reference to fixation onset of cognition-related EEG activity in an active search task and therefore require novel techniques for single-trial detection. Active visual search in non-stationary scenes: coping with temporal variability and uncertainty.
