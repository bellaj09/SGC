Recent studies have shown that a fake body part can be incorporated into human body representation through synchronous multisensory stimulation on the fake and corresponding real body part - the most famous example being the Rubber Hand Illusion. However the extent to which gross asymmetries in the fake body can be assimilated remains unknown. Participants experienced through a head-tracked stereo head-mounted display a virtual body coincident with their real body. There were 5 conditions in a between-groups experiment with 10 participants per condition. In all conditions there was visuo-motor congruence between the real and virtual dominant arm. In an Incongruent condition I where the virtual arm length was equal to the real length there was visuo-tactile incongruence. In four Congruent conditions there was visuo-tactile congruence but the virtual arm lengths were either equal to C1 double C2 triple C3 or quadruple C4 the real ones. Questionnaire scores and defensive withdrawal movements in response to a threat showed that the overall level of ownership was high in both C1 and I and there was no significant difference between these conditions. Additionally participants experienced ownership over the virtual arm up to three times the length of the real one and less strongly at four times the length. The illusion did decline however with the length of the virtual arm. In the C2-C4 conditions although a measure of proprioceptive drift positively correlated with virtual arm length there was no correlation between the drift and ownership of the virtual arm suggesting different underlying mechanisms between ownership and drift. Overall these findings extend and enrich previous results that multisensory and sensorimotor information can reconstruct our perception of the body shape size and symmetry even when this is not consistent with normal body proportions.
