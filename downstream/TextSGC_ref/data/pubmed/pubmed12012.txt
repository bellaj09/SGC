We introduce a deep learning architecture for structure-based virtual screening that generates fixed-sized fingerprints of proteins and small molecules by applying learnable atom convolution and softmax operations to each molecule separately. These fingerprints are further non-linearly transformed their inner product is calculated and used to predict the binding potential. Moreover we show that widely used benchmark datasets may be insufficient for testing structure-based virtual screening methods that utilize machine learning. Therefore we introduce a new benchmark dataset which we constructed based on DUD-E MUV and PDBBind databases. Interaction prediction in structure-based virtual screening using deep learning.
