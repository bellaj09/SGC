Event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/S is an electroencephalogram EEG feature widely used as control signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs. Nevertheless the underlying neural mechanisms and functions of ERD/S are largely unknown thus investigating them is crucial to improve the reliability of ERD/S-based BCIs. This study aimed to identify Motor Imagery MI conditions that enhance ERD/S. We investigated following three questions: 1 whether target-directed MI affects ERD/S 2 whether MI with sound imagery affects ERD/S and 3 whether ERD/S has a body part dependency of MI. Nine participants took part in the experiments of four MI conditions; they were asked to imagine right foot dorsiflexion F right foot dorsiflexion and the sound of a bass drum when the sole touched the floor FS right leg extension L and right leg extension directed toward a soccer ball LT. Statistical comparison revealed that there were significant differences between conditions L and LT in beta-band ERD and conditions F and L in beta-band ERS. These results suggest that mental rehearsal of target-directed lower limb movement without real sensory stimuli can enhance beta-band ERD; furthermore MI of foot dorsiflexion induces significantly larger beta-band ERS than that of leg extension. These findings could be exploited for the training of BCIs such as powered prosthetics for disabled person and neurorehabilitation system for stroke patients. Target-directed motor imagery of the lower limb enhances event-related desynchronization.
