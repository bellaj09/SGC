"Prediction models of post-liver transplant mortality are crucial so that donor organs are not allocated to recipients with unreasonably high probabilities of mortality. Machine learning algorithms particularly deep neural networks DNNs can often achieve higher predictive performance than conventional models. In this study we trained a DNN to predict 90-day post-transplant mortality using preoperative variables and compared the performance to that of the Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation SOFT and Balance of Risk BAR scores using United Network of Organ Sharing data on adult patients who received a deceased donor liver transplant between 2005 and 2015 n\xa0= 57544. The DNN was trained using 202 features and the best DNNs architecture consisted of 5 hidden layers with 110 neurons each. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUC of the best DNN model was 0.703 95% CI: 0.682-0.726 as compared to 0.655 95% CI: 0.633-0.678 and 0.688 95% CI: 0.667-0.711 for the BAR score and SOFT score respectively. In conclusion despite the complexity of DNN it did not achieve a significantly higher discriminative performance than the SOFT score. Future risk models will likely benefit from the inclusion of other data sources including high-resolution clinical features for which DNNs are particularly apt to outperform conventional statistical methods."
