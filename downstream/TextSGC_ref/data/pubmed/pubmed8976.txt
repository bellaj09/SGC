Protein is an essential component of the living organism. The prediction of protein-protein interactions PPIs has important implications for understanding the behavioral processes of life preventing diseases and developing new drugs. Although the development of high-throughput technology makes it possible to identify PPIs in large-scale biological experiments it restricts the extensive use of experimental methods due to the constraints of time cost false positive rate and other conditions. Therefore there is an urgent need for computational methods as a supplement to experimental methods to predict PPIs rapidly and accurately. In this paper we propose a novel approach namely CNN-FSRF for predicting PPIs based on protein sequence by combining deep learning Convolution Neural Network CNN with Feature-Selective Rotation Forest FSRF. The proposed method firstly converts the protein sequence into the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix PSSM containing biological evolution information then uses CNN to objectively and efficiently extracts the deeply hidden features of the protein and finally removes the redundant noise information by FSRF and gives the accurate prediction results. When performed on the PPIs datasets Yeast and Helicobacter pylori CNN-FSRF achieved a prediction accuracy of 97.75% and 88.96%. To further evaluate the prediction performance we compared CNN-FSRF with SVM and other existing methods. In addition we also verified the performance of CNN-FSRF on independent datasets. Excellent experimental results indicate that CNN-FSRF can be used as a useful complement to biological experiments to identify protein interactions.
