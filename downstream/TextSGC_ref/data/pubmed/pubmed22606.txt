Ergonomics in laparoscopic surgery is an unsolved problem. Deficiencies of the instrument handles are well-known and described in several reports and studies. Today virtual training modules for laparoscopic surgery are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a virtual reality VR simulator to determine the ergonomic properties of two different laparoscopic instrument handles. Ergonomic testing of two different types of handles via virtual reality simulation.
