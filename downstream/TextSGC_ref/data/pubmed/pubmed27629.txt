Retinal prostheses can restore a functional form of vision in patients affected by dystrophies of the outer retinal layer. Beyond clinical utility prostheses for the stimulation of the optic nerve the visual thalamus or the visual cortex could also serve as tools for studying the visual system. Optic-nerve stimulation is particularly promising because it directly activates nerve fibres takes advantage of the high-level information processing occurring downstream in the visual pathway does not require optical transparency and could be effective in cases of eye trauma. Here we show in anaesthetized rabbits and with support from numerical modelling that an intraneural electrode array with high mechanical stability placed in the intracranial segment of the optic nerve induces on electrical stimulation selective activation patterns in the visual cortex. These patterns are measured as electrically evoked cortical potentials via an ECoG array placed in the contralateral cortex. The intraneural electrode array should enable further investigations of the effects of electrical stimulation in the visual system and could be further developed as a visual prosthesis for blind patients. Spatially selective activation of the visual cortex via intraneural stimulation of the optic nerve.
