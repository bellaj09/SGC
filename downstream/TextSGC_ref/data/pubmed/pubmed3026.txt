"Recent studies have revealed the possible role of choroid plexus ChP in Alzheimers disease AD. T1-weighted MRI is the modality of choice for the segmentation of ChP in humans. Manual segmentation is considered the gold-standard technique but given its time-consuming nature large-scale neuroimaging studies of ChP would be impossible. In this study we introduce a lightweight segmentation algorithm based on the Gaussian Mixture Model GMM. We compared its performance against manual segmentation as well as automated segmentation by Freesurfer in three separate datasets: 1 patients with structural MRIs enhanced with contrast n\u200a=\u200a19 2 young healthy subjects n\u200a=\u200a20 and 3 patients with AD n\u200a=\u200a20. GMM outperformed Freesurfer and showed high similarity with manual segmentation. To further assess the algorithms performance in large scale studies we performed GMM segmentations in young healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project n\u200a=\u200a1067 as well as healthy controls mild cognitive impairment MCI and AD patients from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative n\u200a=\u200a509. In both datasets GMM segmented ChP more accurately than Freesurfer. To show the clinical importance of accurate ChP segmentation total AV1451 tau PET binding to ChP was measured in 108 MCI and 32 AD patients. GMM was able to reveal the higher AV1451 binding to ChP in AD compared with MCI. Our results provide evidence for the utility of the GMM in accurately segmenting ChP and show its clinical relevance in AD. Future structural and functional studies of ChP will benefit from GMMs accurate segmentation."
