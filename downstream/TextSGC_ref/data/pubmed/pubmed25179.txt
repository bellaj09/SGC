"Novel communication techniques have always been fascinating for humankind. This pilot study presents an approach to human interaction by combining direct brain-to-brain interface BBI and muscle-to-muscle interface MMI in a closed-loop pattern. In this system artificial paths data flows functionally connect natural paths nerves. The intention from one subject sender is recognized using electroencephalography EEG based brain-computer interface BCI which is sent out to trigger transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS on the other subject receiver and induce hand motion; meanwhile TMS results in a significant change on the motor evoked potentials MEP recorded by electromyography EMG of the receivers arm which triggers functional electrical stimulation FES applied to the senders arm and generates hand motion. Human-controlled loop and automatic control loop experiments were performed with 6 pairs of healthy subjects to evaluate the performance of the introduced mechanism. The results indicated that response accuracy during human-controlled experiments was 85% which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method. During the automatic control test two subjects could accomplish repetitive and reciprocal hand motion control up to 85 times consecutively." Human-to-human closed-loop control based on brain-to-brain interface and muscle-to-muscle interface.
