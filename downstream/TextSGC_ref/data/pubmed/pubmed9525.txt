The measurement of bone mineral density for osteoporosis has always been the focus of researchers because it plays an important role in bone disease diagnosis. However because of X-ray image noise and the large difference between the bone shapes of patients under the condition of low contrast existing osteoporosis diagnosis algorithms are difficult to obtain satisfactory results. This paper presents an improved osteoporosis diagnosis algorithm based on U-NET network. Firstly the bone in the original image are marked and used to construct the data set. And then by normalizing the input of each layer it can be ensured that the input data distribution of each layer is stable so that the purpose of accelerated training can be achieved. Finally the energy function is calculated by combining the value of the softmax prediction class for each pixel on the final feature map with the Cross entropy loss function and all the segmented images are extracted to obtain the diagnostic result. As the experimental results show that the improved U-net can accurately solve the influence of image interference in the process of bone mineral density measurement. The recognition rate of U-net automatic diagnosis method is above 81% and the diagnosis effect is better than other comparison methods.
