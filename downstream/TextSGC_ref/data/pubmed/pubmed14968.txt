A nonbarbiturate anesthetic consisting of ketamine HCl Ketaset and xlyazine Rompun was administered to assess the effects of anesthesia on hypothermia-induced retrograde amnesia in Long Evans hooded and Sprague-Dawley albino rats. Results from Experiment 1a indicate that this anesthetic does not attenuate retrograde amnesia and the findings from Experiment 1b suggest that awakening from Ketaset/Rompun anesthesia at normal body temperature following administration of deep body cooling does not attenuate the resulting hypothermia-induced retrograde amnesia. Experiment 2 demonstrated that various delays between training and hypothermia resulted in a temporal gradient that was the same for animals cooled while either conscious or under anesthesia. The results of Experiment 3 showed that rats made amnesic while under anesthesia did not recover the target memory if given a recooling treatment but rats that were made amnesic while conscious did recover the memory with the same reminder treatment. These findings indicate that the conscious processing of stimuli associated with hypothermia treatment is not necessary in inducing hypothermia-induced retrograde amnesia but that conscious processing is an important factor if the amnesia is to be recovered with a recooling treatment. Differential effects of Ketaset/Rompun anesthesia on hypothermia-induced retrograde amnesia and its recovery.
