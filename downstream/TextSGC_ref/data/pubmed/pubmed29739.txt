Most existing brain-computer interface BCI designs based on steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs primarily use low frequency visual stimuli e.g. <20 Hz to elicit relatively high SSVEP amplitudes. While low frequency stimuli could evoke photosensitivity-based epileptic seizures high frequency stimuli generally show less visual fatigue and no stimulus-related seizures. The fundamental objective of this study was to investigate the effect of stimulation frequency and duty-cycle on the usability of an SSVEP-based BCI system. Effect of higher frequency on the classification of steady-state visual evoked potentials.
