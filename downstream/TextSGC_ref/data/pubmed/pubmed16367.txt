The ability to confidently predict health outcomes from gene expression would catalyze a revolution in molecular diagnostics. Yet the goal of developing actionable robust and reproducible predictive signatures of phenotypes such as clinical outcome has not been attained in almost any disease area. Here we report a comprehensive analysis spanning prediction tasks from ulcerative colitis atopic dermatitis diabetes to many cancer subtypes for a total of 24 binary and multiclass prediction problems and 26 survival analysis tasks. We systematically investigate the influence of gene subsets normalization methods and prediction algorithms. Crucially we also explore the novel use of deep representation learning methods on large transcriptomics compendia such as GTEx and TCGA to boost the performance of state-of-the-art methods. The resources and findings in this work should serve as both an up-to-date reference on attainable performance and as a benchmarking resource for further research. Standard machine learning approaches outperform deep representation learning on phenotype prediction from transcriptomics data.
