RaptorX Property http://raptorx2.uchicago.edu/StructurePropertyPred/predict/ is a web server predicting structure property of a protein sequence without using any templates. It outperforms other servers especially for proteins without close homologs in PDB or with very sparse sequence profile i.e. carries little evolutionary information. This server employs a powerful in-house deep learning model DeepCNF Deep Convolutional Neural Fields to predict secondary structure SS solvent accessibility ACC and disorder regions DISO. DeepCNF not only models complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical architecture but also interdependency between adjacent property labels. Our experimental results show that tested on CASP10 CASP11 and the other benchmarks this server can obtain 84% Q3 accuracy for 3-state SS 72% Q8 accuracy for 8-state SS 66% Q3 accuracy for 3-state solvent accessibility and 0.89 area under the ROC curve AUC for disorder prediction.
