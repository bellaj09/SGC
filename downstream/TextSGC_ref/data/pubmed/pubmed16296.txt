With the expanding indications and increasing number of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation DBS postoperative MR imaging is becoming even more important in guiding clinical care and practice-based learning; important safety concerns have recently emerged however. Although phantom model studies have driven conservative recommendations regarding imaging parameters highlighted by 2 recent reports describing adverse neurological events associated with MR imaging in patients with implanted DBS systems the risks of MR imaging in such patients in clinical practice has not been well addressed. In this study the authors capitalized on their large experience with serial MR imaging 3 times per patient to use MR imaging itself and clinical outcomes to examine the safety of MR imaging in patients who underwent staged implantation of DBS electrodes for Parkinson disease tremor and dystonia. Safety of magnetic resonance imaging of deep brain stimulator systems: a serial imaging and clinical retrospective study.
