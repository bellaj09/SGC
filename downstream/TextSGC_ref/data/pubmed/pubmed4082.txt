Sleep deprivation has been reported to affect intrinsic brain connectivity notably reducing connectivity in the default mode network. Studies to date have however shown inconsistent effects in many cases lacked monitoring of wakefulness and largely included young participants. We investigated effects of sleep deprivation on intrinsic brain connectivity in young and older participants. Participants aged 20-30 final\xa0n\u2009=\u200930 and 65-75 final\xa0n\u2009=\u200923 years underwent partial sleep deprivation 3\u2009h sleep in a cross-over design with two 8-minutes eyes-open resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI runs in each session monitored by eye-tracking. We assessed intrinsic brain connectivity using independent components analysis ICA as well as seed-region analyses of functional connectivity and also analysed global signal variability regional homogeneity and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. Changes in investigated resting state networks and in regional homogeneity were not statistically significant. Younger participants had higher connectivity in most examined networks as well as higher regional homogeneity in areas including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. In conclusion we found that sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability and we speculate that this may be caused by wake-state instability.
