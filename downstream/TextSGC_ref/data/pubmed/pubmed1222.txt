The pandemic coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly spreading across the globe. In this issue of the JCI Chen and colleagues compared the clinical and immunological characteristics between moderate and severe COVID-19. The authors found that respiratory distress on admission is associated with unfavorable outcomes. Increased cytokine levels IL-6 IL-10 and TNF- lymphopenia in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased IFN- expression in CD4+ T cells are associated with severe COVID-19. Overall this study characterized the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and provides insights into immune therapeutics and vaccine design. SARS-CoV-2: a storm is raging.
