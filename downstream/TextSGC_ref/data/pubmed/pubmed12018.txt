Recently the deep learning methods have received more attention in histopathological image analysis. However the traditional deep learning methods assume that training data and test data have the same distributions which causes certain limitations in real-world histopathological applications. However it is costly to recollect a large amount of labeled histology data to train a new neural network for each specified image acquisition procedure even for similar tasks. In this paper an unsupervised domain adaptation is introduced into a typical deep convolutional neural network CNN model to mitigate the repeating of the labels. The unsupervised domain adaptation is implemented by adding two regularisation terms namely the feature-based adaptation and entropy minimisation to the object function of a widely used CNN model called the AlexNet. Three independent public epithelium-stroma datasets were used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results have demonstrated that in the epithelium-stroma classification the proposed method can achieve better performance than the commonly used deep learning methods and some existing deep domain adaptation methods. Therefore the proposed method can be considered as a better option for the real-world applications of histopathological image analysis because there is no requirement for recollection of large-scale labeled data for every specified domain. Classify epithelium-stroma in histopathological images based on deep transferable network.
