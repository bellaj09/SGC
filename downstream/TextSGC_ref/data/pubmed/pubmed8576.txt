"Pathological evaluation of tumor tissue is pivotal for diagnosis in cancer patients and automated image analysis approaches have great potential to increase precision of diagnosis and help reduce human error. In this study we utilize several computational methods based on convolutional neural networks CNN and build a stand-alone pipeline to effectively classify different histopathology images across different types of cancer. In particular we demonstrate the utility of our pipeline to discriminate between two subtypes of lung cancer four biomarkers of bladder cancer and five biomarkers of breast cancer. In addition we apply our pipeline to discriminate among four immunohistochemistry IHC staining scores of bladder and breast cancers. Our classification pipeline includes a basic CNN architecture Googles Inceptions with three training strategies and an ensemble of two state-of-the-art algorithms Inception and ResNet. Training strategies include training the last layer of Googles Inceptions training the network from scratch and fine-tunning the parameters for our data using two pre-trained version of Googles Inception architectures Inception-V1 and Inception-V3. We demonstrate the power of deep learning approaches for identifying cancer subtypes and the robustness of Googles Inceptions even in presence of extensive tumor heterogeneity. On average our pipeline achieved accuracies of 100% 92% 95% and 69% for discrimination of various cancer tissues subtypes biomarkers and scores respectively.
