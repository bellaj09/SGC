Systemic inflammation impairs mood and cognitive functions and seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies revealed altered task-related blood-oxygen-level-dependent BOLD responses during experimental endotoxemia but little is known about effects of systemic inflammation on resting-state activity of the brain. Thus we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy men receiving an intravenous injection of either low-dose 0.4 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide LPS N=20 or placebo N=25. Resting state activity was measured at baseline and 3.5h post-injection. Based on a two condition  two group design we used multi-subject independent component analysis ICA to decompose and estimate functional connectivity within resting-state networks RSNs. Seed-based analyses were applied to investigate the effect of LPS on the functional coupling for a priori-defined regions-of-interest ROIs. ICA analyses identified 13 out of 35 components displaying common RSNs. Seed based analysis revealed greater functional connectivity between the left thalamus and the cerebellum after LPS compared to placebo administration while the functional coupling between seeds within the amygdala insula and cingulate cortex and various brain regions including parieto-frontal networks was significantly reduced. Within the LPS group endotoxin-induced increases in Interleukin IL-6 were significantly associated with resting-state connectivity between the left thalamus and left precuneus as well as the right posterior cingulate cortex. In summary this exploratory study provides first evidence that systemic inflammation affects the coupling and regulation of multiple networks within the human brain at rest.
