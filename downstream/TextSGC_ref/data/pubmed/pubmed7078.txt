"Identification of minimal residual disease MRD is important in assessing the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia AML and myelodysplastic syndrome MDS. The current best clinical practice relies heavily on Flow Cytometry FC examination. However the current FC diagnostic examination requires trained physicians to perform lengthy manual interpretation on high-dimensional FC data measurements of each specimen. The difficulty in handling idiosyncrasy between interpreters along with the time-consuming diagnostic process has become one of the major bottlenecks in advancing the treatment of hematological diseases. In this work we develop an automatic MRD classifications AML MDS normal algorithm based on learning a deep phenotype representation from a large cohort of retrospective clinical data with over 2000 real patients FC samples. We propose to learn a cytometric deep embedding through cell-level autoencoder combined with specimen-level latent Fisher-scoring vectorization. Our method achieves an average AUC of 0.943 across four different hematological malignancies classification tasks and our analysis further reveals that with only half of the FC markers would be sufficient in obtaining these high recognition accuracies."
