"The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between structural connectivity and cortical demyelination in early multiple sclerosis. About 27 multiple sclerosis patients and 18 age-matched controls underwent two MRI scanning sessions. The first was done at 7T and involved acquiring quantitative T1 and T2 * high-resolution maps to estimate cortical myelination. The second was done on a Connectom scanner and consisted of acquiring high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images to compute white matter structural connectivity metrics: strength clustering and local efficiency. To further investigate the interplay between structural connectivity and cortical demyelination patients were divided into four groups according to disease-duration: 0-1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years and >3 years. ANOVA and Spearmans correlations were used to highlight relations between metrics. ANOVA detected a significant effect between disease duration and both cortical myelin p = 2  10-8  and connectivity metrics p < 10-4 . We observed significant cortical myelin loss in the shorter disease-duration cohorts 0-1 year p = .0015 and an increase in connectivity in the longer disease-duration cohort 2-3 years strength: p = .01 local efficiency: p = .002 clustering: p = .001. Moreover significant covariations between myelin estimation and white matter connectivity metrics were observed: Spearmans Rho correlation coefficients of 0.52 p = .0003 0.55 p = .0001 and 0.53 p = .0001 for strength local efficiency and clustering respectively. An association between cortical myelin loss and changes in white matter connectivity in early multiple sclerosis was detected. These changes in network organization might be the result of compensatory mechanisms in response to the ongoing cortical diffuse damage in the early stages of multiple sclerosis." Changes in structural network are associated with cortical demyelination in early multiple sclerosis.
