Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that anorexia nervosa AN symptoms emerge from failures in the relationships between spatially distributed networks that support different cognitive emotional and somatosensory functions. The 5-HTTLPR genotype has been shown to modulate all these abilities in AN as well as the connectivity patterns between brain regions that support their functioning. This study aims at exploring the presence of any difference in functional connectome properties between AN patients and healthy controls HC by means of graph theory tools. The effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on regional and global network characteristics in AN and HC was also explored. Functional Connectivity Patterns and the Role of 5-HTTLPR Polymorphism on Network Architecture in Female Patients With Anorexia Nervosa.
