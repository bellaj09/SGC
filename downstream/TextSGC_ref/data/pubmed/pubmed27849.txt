Most existing brain-computer interfaces BCIs detect specific mental activity in a so-called synchronous paradigm. Unlike synchronous systems which are operational at specific system-defined periods self-paced asynchronous interfaces have the advantage of being operational at all times. The low-frequency asynchronous switch design LF-ASD is a 2-state self-paced BCI that detects the presence of a specific finger movement in the ongoing EEG. Recent evaluations of the 2-state LF-ASD show an average true positive rate of 41% at the fixed false positive rate of 1%. This paper proposes two designs for a 3-state self-paced BCI that is capable of handling idle brain state. The two proposed designs aim at detecting right- and left-hand extensions from the ongoing EEG. They are formed of two consecutive detectors. The first detects the presence of a right- or a left-hand movement and the second classifies the detected movement as a right or a left one. In an offline analysis of the EEG data collected from four able-bodied individuals the 3-state brain-computer interface shows a comparable performance with a 2-state system and significant performance improvement if used as a 2-state BCI that is in detecting the presence of a right- or a left-hand movement regardless of the type of movement. It has an average true positive rate of 37.5% and 42.8% at false positives rate of 1% in detecting right- and left-hand extensions respectively in the context of a 3-state self-paced BCI and average detection rate of 58.1% at false positive rate of 1% in the context of a 2-state self-paced BCI. Towards development of a 3-state self-paced brain-computer interface.
