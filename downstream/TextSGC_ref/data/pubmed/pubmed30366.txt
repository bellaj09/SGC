The vestibular system provides essential information about balance and spatial orientation via the brain to other sensory and motor systems. Bilateral vestibular loss significantly reduces quality of life but vestibular implants VIs have demonstrated potential to restore lost function. However optimal electrical stimulation strategies have not yet been identified in patients. In this study we compared the two most common strategies pulse amplitude modulation PAM and pulse rate modulation PRM in patients. Characterization of pulse amplitude and pulse rate modulation for a human vestibular implant during acute electrical stimulation.
