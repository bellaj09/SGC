The development of new approaches based on wide profiling methods in studying biological and medical systems is bringing large amounts of data on a daily basis. The causes of complex diseases have been directed to the genome examination bringing formidable knowledge. We can study genome but also proteome exome transcriptome epigenome metabolome and newcomers too such as microbiome connectome and exposome. The title of this editorial is paraphrasing the famous saying of Victor Schlichter from Buenos Aires children hospital in Argentina who said "How unfair! Only one health and so many diseases". Today there is indeed a whole lot of omics. We think that we are lucky to have all the omics possible but we also wanted to stress the importance of future holistic approach in integrating the knowledge omics has rewarded us. Only one health and so many omics.
