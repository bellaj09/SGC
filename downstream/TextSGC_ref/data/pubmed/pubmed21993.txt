Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is a complex procedure used by otorhinolaryngologists to treat a host of nasal sinus pathologies. Due to the involved nasal anatomy and the nature of the procedure teaching residents to use an endoscope is challenging. Simulation labs have been helpful but intraoperative instruction can still present difficulty in communication between resident and attending physicians during the teaching process. The purpose of this is to hypothesize a method of teaching intraoperatively that can be used supplemental to or independently of virtual reality teaching.
