The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex dACC and the Supplementary Motor Area SMA are known to interact during motor coordination behavior. We previously discovered that the directional influences underlying this interaction in a visuo-motor coordination task are asymmetric with the dACCSMA influence being significantly greater than that in the reverse direction. To assess the specificity of this effect here we undertook an analysis of the interaction between dACC and SMA in two distinct contexts. In addition to the motor coordination task we also assessed these effects during a n-back working memory task. We applied directed functional connectivity analysis to these two task paradigms and also to the rest condition of each paradigm in which rest blocks were interspersed with task blocks. We report here that the previously known asymmetric interaction between dACC and SMA with dACCSMA dominating was significantly larger in the motor coordination task than the memory task. Moreover the asymmetry between dACC and SMA was reversed during the rest condition of the motor coordination task but not of the working memory task. In sum the dACCSMA influence was significantly greater in the motor task than the memory task condition and the SMAdACC influence was significantly greater in the motor rest than the memory rest condition. We interpret these results as suggesting that the potentiation of motor sub-networks during the motor rest condition supports the motor control of SMA by dACC during the active motor task condition.
