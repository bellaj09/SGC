Computed tomography CT and virtual reality VR made it possible to create internal views of the human body without actual penetration. During the last two decades several endoscopic diagnosis procedures have received virtual counter candidates. This paper presents an own concept of a virtual reality guided diagnostic tool based on magnetic resonance images representing parallel cross-sections of the investigated organ. A series of image processing methods are proposed for image quality enhancement accurate segmentation in two dimensions and three-dimensional reconstruction of detected surfaces. These techniques provide improved accuracy in image segmentation and thus they represent excellent support for three dimensional imaging. The implemented software system allows interactive navigation within the investigated volume and provides several facilities to quantify important physical properties including distances areas and volumes. Development of a virtual reality guided diagnostic tool based on magnetic resonance imaging.
