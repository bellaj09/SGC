"Adolescents having moderate to severe traumatic brain injury TBI often experience long-lasting cognitive emotional and behavioral problems. In current clinical practice rehabilitation techniques to treat cognitive abnormalities may be classified in two main categories i.e. conventional or advanced. Aim of this case study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an immersive virtual environment Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment CAREN in a young boy affected by severe TBI. A 15-year-old boy with TBI involving the right parietal-temporal region underwent two different rehabilitation trainings including standard cognitive rehabilitation alone in a usual clinical setting face-to-face intervention with a paper and pencil approach or the same cognitive program using virtual scenarios by means of CAREN. We evaluated the patients cognitive status before and after the two different trainings by using a specific psychometric battery to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral functioning such as attention abilities visuo-spatial and executive functions. Only at the end of the CAREN training we observed a significant improvement in specific cognitive and motor domains such as attention abilities visuo-executive processes emotional awareness and balance. Cognitive training using immersive Virtual Reality may be a useful tool to facilitate cognitive recovery in TBI patients."
