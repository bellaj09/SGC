For the development of the totally implantable artificial organs it is an important problem to monitor the conditions of the implantable devices especially when used in clinical cases. In this study we used position sensors for the 3-dimensional 3-D virtual reality VR system monitor an implantable artificial heart. The sensors used in the experiments were 3-space Fastrak Polhemus USA. The position sensors using electro-magnetic forces were attached to the inner actuating zone. Sensitivity of the position sensors was in the order of around 0.8 mm. By use of these VR position sensors we could easily detect the six degrees of freedom as xyz and pitch yaw roll of these sensors. Experimental evaluation using a model circulation loop and healthy adult goats was performed. Experimental results suggest that our newly developed implantable sensors for monitoring the implantable artificial heart system were useful for sensing driving condition thus possibly useful for the implantable devices for clinical usage.
