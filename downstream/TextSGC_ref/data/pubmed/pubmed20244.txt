Minimally invasive surgery procedures are getting common in surgical practice; however the new interventional procedure requires different skills compared to the conventional surgical techniques. The need for training process is very important in order to successfully and safely execute a surgical procedure. Computer-based simulators with appropriate tactile feedback device can be an efficient method for facilitating the education and training process. In addition virtual reality surgical simulators can reduce costs of education and provide realism with regard to tissues behaviour and real-time interaction. This work take into account the results of the HERMES Project HEmatology Research virtual MEdical System conceived and managed by Consorzio CETMA-Research Centre; the aim of this project is to build an integrate system in order to simulate a coronary angioplasty intervention. Computer-based simulator for catheter insertion training.
