"A cephalosomatic anastomosis CSA; also called HEAVEN: head anastomosis venture has been proposed as an option for patients with neurological impairments such as spinal cord injury SCI and terminal medical illnesses for which medicine is currently powerless. Protocols to prepare a patient for life after CSA do not currently exist. However methods used in conventional neurorehabilitation can be used as a reference for developing preparatory training. Studies on virtual reality VR technologies have documented VRs ability to enhance rehabilitation and improve the quality of recovery in patients with neurological disabilities. VR-augmented rehabilitation resulted in increased motivation towards performing functional training and improved the biopsychosocial state of patients. In addition VR experiences coupled with haptic feedback promote neuroplasticity resulting in the recovery of motor functions in neurologically-impaired individuals. To prepare the recipient psychologically for life after CSA the development of VR experiences paired with haptic feedback is proposed. This proposal aims to innovate techniques in conventional neurorehabilitation to implement preoperative psychological training for the recipient of HEAVEN. Recipients familiarity to body movements will prevent unexpected psychological reactions from occurring after the HEAVEN procedure." PROJECT HEAVEN: Preoperative Training in Virtual Reality.
