"A three-year qualitative study based on an action-research design framed within the critical genre and using a multi-method approach was used to establish how a model of critical reflective practice Van Aswegen E.J.

Reflective journals were introduced as one of the educational strategies within the model to support and sustain deep transformatory learning. A component of this larger study focused on how scaffolding deep learning through reflective writing is enhanced by supportive structures. These include critiquing feedback a mutually developed self-evaluation strategy as well as an awareness of and sensitivity to the need for student/writer-responder negotiation. Three student groups of part-time post-basic practicing South African nurses engaged in reflective writing over the period of an academic year. This article is based on their perceptions mid-way through their writing of these strategies. It reflects the story of assumptions made by educators and challenges for change. Students find reflective writing difficult and although they are willing to accept its value and engage in the process they require a regular specific and sensitive critical response from their writer-responder and follow-up supportive contact. Self-evaluation for the purposes of owning their own ideas is difficult and requires constant support and validation. Transformatory learning comes at a cost and a revisiting of the balance of power between student and educator is in order."
