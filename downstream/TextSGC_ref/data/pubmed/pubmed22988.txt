Carotid artery stenting CAS is a technically demanding procedure with a risk of periprocedural stroke. A scoring system based on anatomic criteria has been developed to facilitate patient selection for CAS. Advancements in simulation science also enable case evaluation through patient-specific virtual reality VR rehearsal on an endovascular simulator. This study aimed to validate the anatomic scoring system for CAS using the patient-specific VR technology. Improving results for carotid artery stenting by validation of the anatomic scoring system for carotid artery stenting with patient-specific simulated rehearsal.
