Late-life depression LLD in the elderly was reported to present with emotion dysregulation accompanied by high perceived loneliness. Previous research has suggested that LLD is a disorder of connectivity and is associated with aberrant network properties. On the other hand perceived loneliness is found to adversely affect the brain but little is known about its neurobiological basis in LLD. The current study investigated the relationships between the structural connectivity functional connectivity during affective processing and perceived loneliness in LLD. Loneliness in late-life depression: structural and functional connectivity during affective processing.
