Schizophrenia a neurodevelopmental disorder involves abnormalities in functional connectivity FC across distributed neural networks which are thought to antedate the emergence of psychosis. In a cohort of adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk CHR for psychosis we applied data-driven approaches to resting-state fMRI data so as to systematically characterize FC abnormalities during this period and determine whether these abnormalities are associated with psychosis risk and severity of psychotic symptoms.
