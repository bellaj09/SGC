This study aimed to design an optimal emotion recognition method using multiple physiological signal parameters acquired by bio-signal sensors for improving the accuracy of classifying individual emotional responses. Multiple physiological signals such as respiration RSP and heart rate variability HRV were acquired in an experiment from 53 participants when six basic emotion states were induced. Two RSP parameters were acquired from a chest-band respiration sensor and five HRV parameters were acquired from a finger-clip blood volume pulse BVP sensor. A newly designed deep-learning model based on a convolutional neural network CNN was adopted for detecting the identification accuracy of individual emotions. Additionally the signal combination of the acquired parameters was proposed to obtain high classification accuracy. Furthermore a dominant factor influencing the accuracy was found by comparing the relativeness of the parameters providing a basis for supporting the results of emotion classification. The users of this proposed model will soon be able to improve the emotion recognition model further based on CNN using multimodal physiological signals and their sensors.
