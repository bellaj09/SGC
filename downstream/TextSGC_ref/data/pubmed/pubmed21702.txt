Minimally invasive sublobar anatomical resection is becoming more and more popular to manage early lung lesions. Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery RATS is unique in comparison with other minimally invasive techniques. Indeed RATS is able to better integrate multiple streams of information including advanced imaging techniques in an immersive experience at the level of the robotic console. Our aim was to describe three-dimensional 3D imaging throughout the surgical procedure from preoperative planning to intraoperative assistance and complementary investigations such as radial endobronchial ultrasound R-EBUS and virtual bronchoscopy for pleural dye marking. All cases were operated using the DaVinci SystemTM. Modelisation was provided by Visible Patient Strasbourg France. Image integration in the operative field was achieved using the Tile Pro multi display input of the DaVinci console. Our experience was based on 114 robotic segmentectomies performed between January 2012 and October 2017. The clinical value of 3D imaging integration was evaluated in 2014 in a pilot study. Progressively we have reached the conclusion that the use of such an anatomic model improves the safety and reliability of procedures. The multimodal system including 3D imaging has been used in more than 40 patients so far and demonstrated a perfect operative anatomic accuracy. Currently we are developing an original virtual reality experience by exploring 3D imaging models at the robotic console level. The act of operating is being transformed and the surgeon now oversees a complex system that improves decision making.
