The prediction of brain-computer interface BCI performance is a significant topic in the BCI field. Some researches have demonstrated that resting-state data are promising candidates to achieve the goal. However so far the relationships between the resting-state networks and the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCI have not been investigated. In this paper we investigate the possible relationships between the SSVEP responses the classification accuracy of five stimulus frequencies and the closed-eye resting-state network topology. Prediction of SSVEP-based BCI performance by the resting-state EEG network.
