The thalamus is a relay center between various subcortical brain areas and the cerebral cortex with delineation of its constituent nuclei being of particular interest in many applications. While previous studies have demonstrated efficacy of connectivity-based thalamus segmentation they used approaches that do not consider the dynamic nature of thalamo-cortical interactions. In this study we explicitly exploited the dynamic variation of thalamo-cortical connections to identify different states of functional connectivity and performed state-specific thalamus parcellation. With normalized spectral clustering successively applied in temporal and spatial domains nine thalamo-cortical connectivity states were identified and the dynamic thalamus parcellation revealed finer thalamic structures with improved atlas correspondence. The present results extend our understanding of thalamo-cortical connectivity and provide a more comprehensive view of the thalamo-cortical interaction.
