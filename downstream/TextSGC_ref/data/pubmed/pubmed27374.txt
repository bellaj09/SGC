Combining visual and auditory stimuli in event-related potential ERP-based spellers gained more attention in recent years. Few of these studies notice the difference of ERP components and system efficiency caused by the shifting of visual and auditory onset. Here we aim to study the effect of temporal congruity of auditory and visual stimuli onset on bimodal brain-computer interface BCI speller. Effects of Temporal Congruity Between Auditory and Visual Stimuli Using Rapid Audio-Visual Serial Presentation.
