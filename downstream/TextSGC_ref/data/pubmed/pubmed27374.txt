"Some neurodegenerative conditions can severely limit patients capability to communicate because of the loss of muscular control. Brain-computer interfaces may help in the restoration of communication with these patients bypassing the muscular activity so that brain signals can be directly interpreted by a computer. There are many studies regarding brain-controlled spellers; however these systems do not usually leap out of the lab because of technical and economic requirements. As a consequence the potential end users do not benefit from these scientific advances in their daily life. The objective of this paper is to present a novel brain-controlled speller designed to be used by patients due to its versatility and ease of use."
