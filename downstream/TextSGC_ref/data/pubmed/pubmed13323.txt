Center-involved diabetic macular edema ci-DME is a major cause of vision loss. Although the gold standard for diagnosis involves 3D imaging 2D imaging by fundus photography is usually used in screening settings resulting in high false-positive and false-negative calls. To address this we train a deep learning model to predict ci-DME from fundus photographs with an ROC-AUC of 0.89 95% CI: 0.87-0.91 corresponding\xa0to 85% sensitivity at 80% specificity. In comparison retinal specialists have similar sensitivities 82-85% but only half the specificity 45-50% p\u2009<\u20090.001. Our model can also detect the presence of intraretinal fluid AUC: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.81-0.86 and subretinal fluid AUC 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.91. Using deep learning to make predictions via simple 2D images without sophisticated 3D-imaging equipment\xa0and with better than specialist performance has broad relevance to many other applications in medical imaging.
