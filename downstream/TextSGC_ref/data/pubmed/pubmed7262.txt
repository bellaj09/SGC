Proteins participate in various essential processes in vivo via interactions with other molecules. Identifying the residues participating in these interactions not only provides biological insights for protein function studies but also has great significance for drug discoveries. Therefore predicting protein-ligand binding sites has long been under intense research in the fields of bioinformatics and computer aided drug discovery. In this review we first introduce the research background of predicting protein-ligand binding sites and then classify the methods into four categories namely 3D structure-based template similarity-based traditional machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods. We describe representative algorithms in each category and elaborate on machine learning and deep learning-based prediction methods in more detail. Finally we discuss the trends and challenges of the current research such as molecular dynamics simulation based cryptic binding sites prediction and highlight prospective directions for the near future. Exploring the computational methods for protein-ligand binding site prediction.
