With the Internet-hype around the turn of the millenium some pioneers started initiatives of what is called E-Mental Health today. Evidence is growing since then that E-Mental Health can contribute to a better mental health care. Some approaches have proved in studies as beneficial that transfer into clinical routine can be tried out. Others showed promising results and again others indicate clearly that not all hopes will become true. In this paper we will present our experience in exploring the potential of E-Mental Health in various projects over the last 10 years and what we believe to have learnt from projects in nextdoor garden. We hope that our conclusions will initiate a discussion about the future role of E-Mental Health for mental health care and research. Internet- and media-assisted therapy.
