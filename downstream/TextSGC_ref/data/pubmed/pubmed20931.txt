The objective of this systematic review was to determine the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of VR for pain management in adults with pain. A comprehensive systematic search involving major health care databases was undertaken to identify randomized clinical trials RCTs and descriptive studies. Twenty-seven studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was strong Level 1a evidence of a greater benefit from immersive VR and limited evidence Level 2a for the effectiveness of non-immersive VR in reducing acute pain. Moreover there is limited evidence Level 2a of effectiveness of immersive VR compared to no VR for reducing chronic pain. There is currently no published study that has explored the effectiveness of non-immersive VR for chronic pain level 5. It is concluded that VR can be recommended as a standard or adjunct clinical intervention for pain management at least in the management of acute pain. Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of virtual reality for pain reduction in adults with acute or chronic pain.
