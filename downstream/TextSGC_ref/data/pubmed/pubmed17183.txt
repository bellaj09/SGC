"The quality of the interdisciplinary interface in oncological treatment between surgery pathology and radiotherapy is mainly dependent on reliable anatomical three-dimensional 3D allocation of specimen and their context sensitive interpretation which defines further treatment protocols. Computer-assisted preoperative planning CAPP allows for outlining macroscopical tumor size and margins. A new technique facilitates the 3D virtual marking and mapping of frozen sections and resection margins or important surgical intraoperative information. These data could be stored in DICOM format Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine in terms of augmented reality and transferred to communicate patients specific tumor information invasion to vessels and nerves non-resectable tumor to oncologists radiotherapists and pathologists." Virtual 3D tumor marking-exact intraoperative coordinate mapping improve post-operative radiotherapy.
