"Quantitative susceptibility mapping QSM is based on magnetic resonance imaging MRI phase measurements and has gained broad interest because it yields relevant information on biological tissue properties predominantly myelin iron and calcium in vivo. Thereby QSM can also reveal pathological changes of these key components in widespread diseases such as Parkinsons disease Multiple Sclerosis or hepatic iron overload. While the ill-posed field-to-source-inversion problem underlying QSM is conventionally assessed by the means of regularization techniques we trained a fully convolutional deep neural network - DeepQSM - to directly invert the magnetic dipole kernel convolution. DeepQSM learned the physical forward problem using purely synthetic data and is capable of solving the ill-posed field-to-source inversion on in vivo MRI phase data. The magnetic susceptibility maps reconstructed by DeepQSM enable identification of deep brain substructures and provide information on their respective magnetic tissue properties. In summary DeepQSM can invert the magnetic dipole kernel convolution and delivers robust solutions to this ill-posed problem."
