Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are systems that establish a direct connection between the human brain and a computer thus providing an additional communication channel. They are used in a broad field of applications nowadays. One important issue is the control of neuroprosthetic devices for the restoration of the grasp function in spinal-cord-injured people. In this communication an asynchronous self-paced four-class BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs was used to control a two-axes electrical hand prosthesis. During training four healthy participants reached an online classification accuracy between 44% and 88%. Controlling the prosthetic hand asynchronously the participants reached a performance of 75.5 to 217.5 s to copy a series of movements whereas the fastest possible duration determined by the setup was 64 s. The number of false negative FN decisions varied from 0 to 10 the maximal possible decisions were 34. It can be stated that the SSVEP-based BCI operating in an asynchronous mode is feasible for the control of neuroprosthetic devices with the flickering lights mounted on its surface.
