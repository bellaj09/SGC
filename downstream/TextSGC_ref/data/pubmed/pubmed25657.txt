Unobtrusive metrics that can auto-assess performance during clinical procedures are of value. Three approaches to deriving wearable technology-based metrics are explored: 1 eye tracking 2 psychophysiological measurements e.g. electrodermal activity EDA and 3 arm and hand movement via accelerometry. We also measure attentional capacity by tasking the operator with an additional task to track an unrelated object during the procedure. Wearable technology-based metrics for predicting operator performance during cardiac catheterisation.
