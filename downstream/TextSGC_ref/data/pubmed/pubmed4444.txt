The human brain is a complex system whose topological organization can be represented using connectomics. Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However given the huge complexity of this methodology toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here using MATLAB with a graphical user interface GUI we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox called BrainNet Viewer to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface nodes and edges. In addition display properties such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy flexible and quick manner and this software is freely available on the NITRC website www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/.
