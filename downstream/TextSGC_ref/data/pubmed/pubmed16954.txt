It has long been understood that assessment is an important driver for learning. However recently there has been growing recognition that this powerful driving force of assessment has the potential to undermine curricular efforts. When the focus of assessment is to categorise learners into competent or not i.e. assessment of learning rather than being a tool to promote continuous learning i.e. assessment for learning there may be unintended consequences that ultimately hinder learning. In response there has been a movement toward constructing assessment not only as a measurement problem but also as an instructional design problem and exploring more programmatic models of assessment across the curriculum. Progress testing is one form of assessment that has been introduced in part to attempt to address these concerns. However in order for any assessment tool to be successful in promoting learning careful consideration must be given to its implementation. Taking the sting out of assessment: is there a role for progress testing?
