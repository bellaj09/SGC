The finite element method FEM is among the most commonly used numerical methods for solving engineering problems. Due to its computational cost various ideas have been introduced to reduce computation times such as domain decomposition parallel computing adaptive meshing and model order reduction. In this paper we present U-Mesh: A data-driven method based on a U-Net architecture that approximates the non-linear relation between a contact force and the displacement field computed by a FEM algorithm. We show that deep learning one of the latest machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks can enhance computational mechanics through its ability to encode highly non-linear models in a compact form. Our method is applied to three benchmark examples: a cantilever beam an L-shape and a liver model subject to moving punctual loads. A comparison between our method and proper orthogonal decomposition POD is done through the paper. The results show that U-Mesh can perform very fast simulations on various geometries and topologies mesh resolutions and number of input forces with very small errors.
