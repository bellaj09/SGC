During the last two decades considerable progress has been made in the studies of brain-computer interfaces BCIs--devices in which motor signals from the brain are registered by multi-electrode arrays and transformed into commands for articial actuators such as cursors and robotic devices. This review is focused on one problem. Voluntary motor control is based on neurophysiological processes which depend heavily on the afferent innervation of skin muscles and joints. Thus invasive BCI has to be based on a bidirectional system in which motor control signals are registered by multi-channel micro-electrodes implanted in motor areas while tactile proprioceptive and other useful signals are transported back to the brain through spatial-temporal patterns of intracortical microstimulation ICMS delivered to sensory areas. In general the studies of invasive BCIs have advanced in several directions. The progress of BCIs with articial sensory feedback will not only help patients but will also expand knowledge base in the field of human cortical functions.
