The entorhinal cortex EC is a part of the hippocampal complex that is essential to learning and memory and nicotine affects memory by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs in the hippocampal complex. However it is not clear what types of neurons in the EC are sensitive to nicotine and whether they play a role in nicotine-induced memory functions. Here we have used voltage-sensitive dye imaging methods to locate the neuronal populations responsive to nicotine in entorhino-hippocampal slices and to clarify which nAChR subtypes are involved. In combination with patch-clamp methods we found that a concentration of nicotine comparable to exposure during smoking depolarized neurons in layer VI of the EC ECVI by acting through the non-alpha7 subtype of nAChRs. Neurons in the subiculum Sb; close to the deep EC layers also contain nicotine-sensitive neurons and it is known that Sb neurons project to the ECVI. When we recorded evoked EPSCs eEPSCs from ECVI neurons while stimulating the Sb near the CA1 region a low dose of nicotine not only enhanced synaptic transmission by increasing eEPSC amplitude but also enhanced plasticity by converting tetanus stimulation-induced short-term potentiation to long-term potentiation; nicotine enhanced synaptic transmission and plasticity of ECVI synapses by acting on both the alpha7 and non-alpha7 subtypes of nAChRs. Our data suggest that ECVI neurons are important regulators of hippocampal function and plasticity during smoking.
