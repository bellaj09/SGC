Artifacts caused by patient breathing and movement during PET data acquisition affect image quality. Respiratory gating is commonly used to gate the list-mode PET data into multiple bins over a respiratory cycle. Non-rigid registration of respiratory-gated PET images can reduce motion artifacts and preserve count statistics but it is time consuming. In this work we propose an unsupervised non-rigid image registration framework using deep learning for motion correction.
