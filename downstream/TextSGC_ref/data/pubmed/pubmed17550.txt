Medical image computing has become one of the most challenging fields in medical informatics. In image-based diagnostics of the future software assistance will become more and more important and image analysis systems integrating advanced image computing methods are needed to extract quantitative image parameters to characterize the state and changes of image structures of interest e.g. tumors organs vessels bones etc. in a reproducible and objective way. Furthermore in the field of software-assisted and navigated surgery medical image computing methods play a key role and have opened up new perspectives for patient treatment. However further developments are needed to increase the grade of automation accuracy reproducibility and robustness. Moreover the systems developed have to be integrated into the clinical workflow. Medical image computing for computer-supported diagnostics and therapy. Advances and perspectives.
