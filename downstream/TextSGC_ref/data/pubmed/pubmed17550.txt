In this paper we conduct a literature survey on various virtual reality VR treatments in psychiatry. We collected 36 studies that used VR to provide clinical trials or therapies for patients with psychiatric disorders. In order to gain a better understanding of the management of pain and stress we first investigate VR applications for patients to alleviate pain and stress during immersive activities in a virtual environment. VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. Moreover VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression cognition even social functions. We review empirical evidence from VR-based treatments on psychiatric illnesses such as dementia mild cognitive impairment MCI schizophrenia and autism. Through cognitive training and social skill training rehabilitation through VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Recent advances in VR technology also demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive and functional impairments in dementia. In terms of the different types of VR systems we discuss the feasibility of the technology within different stages of dementia as well as the methodological limitations. Although there is room for improvement its widespread adoption in psychiatry is yet to occur due to technical drawbacks such as motion sickness and dry eyes as well as user issues such as preoccupation and addiction. However it is worth mentioning that VR systems relatively easily deliver virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. In the future VR systems may become an innovative clinical tool for patients with specific psychiatric symptoms.
