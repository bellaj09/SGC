"Abstract-Universal Health Coverage UHC is a feasible but difficult goal. It requires an outcome-oriented transformation program plus the strong commitment and leadership of high-level politicians. It also necessitates attention to context and receptivity to change which are crucial for strategy development and delivery. Any health minister should acknowledge that it is very difficult to achieve success without public support which also translates into support for the prime minister or president of the country. It is possible to achieve major improvements to health system performance in a relatively short period of time under the right conditions. Turkey made remarkable progress in health status patient satisfaction and financial risk protection with its ten-year Health Transformation Program. Based on Turkeys transf-ormational experience nine guiding principles are proposed. These principles are invaluable to transformational leadership and overcoming challenges: assuring deep commitment to bring change using a two-pronged action approach gaining the publics support as a shield developing a comprehensive program achieving a balance between the public and private sectors obtaining and sustaining the financial protection of citizens learning from mistakes not being blinded by short-term success and focusing on outcomes."
