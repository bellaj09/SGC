In this study we investigate systematic patterns of rapidly changing sensor-level interdependencies in resting MEG data obtained from 23 children experiencing reading difficulties RD and 27 non-impaired readers NI. Three-minute MEG time series were band-passed and subjected to blind source separation BSS prior to estimating sensor interdependencies using the weighted phase synchronization measure wPLI. Dynamic sensor-level network properties were then derived for two network metrics global and local efficiency. The temporal decay of long-range temporal correlations in network metrics LRTC was quantified using the scaling exponent SE in detrended fluctuation analysis DFA plots. Having established the reliability of SE estimates as robust descriptors of network dynamics we found that RD students displayed significantly reduced a overall sensor-level network organization across all frequency bands global efficiency and b temporal correlations between sensors covering the left temporoparietal region and the remaining sensors in the 3 band local efficiency. Importantly both groups displayed scale-free global network connectivity dynamics. The direct application of DFA to MEG signals failed to reveal significant group differences. Results are discussed in relation to prior evidence for disrupted temporoparietal functional circuits for reading in developmental reading disability.
