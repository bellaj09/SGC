De novo peptide sequencing from tandem MS data is the key technology in proteomics for the characterization of proteins especially for new sequences such as mAbs. In this study we propose a deep neural network model DeepNovo for de novo peptide sequencing. DeepNovo architecture combines recent advances in convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn features of tandem mass spectra fragment ions and sequence patterns of peptides. The networks are further integrated with local dynamic programming to solve the complex optimization task of de novo sequencing. We evaluated the method on a wide variety of species and found that DeepNovo considerably outperformed state of the art methods achieving 7.7-22.9% higher accuracy at the amino acid level and 38.1-64.0% higher accuracy at the peptide level. We further used DeepNovo to automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of antibody light and heavy chains of mouse achieving 97.5-100% coverage and 97.2-99.5% accuracy without assisting databases. Moreover DeepNovo is retrainable to adapt to any sources of data and provides a complete end-to-end training and prediction solution to the de novo sequencing problem. Not only does our study extend the deep learning revolution to a new field but it also shows an innovative approach in solving optimization problems by using deep learning and dynamic programming.
