A well-constructed essay is indicative of deep strategic understanding and is considered a valid assessment tool in many dental schools. It has been suggested that constructing MCQs could be an effective learning tool for students while at the same time contribute towards a pool of well-constructed MCQs that could stand up to scrutiny at high-stakes examinations. This study aimed to compare the quality of essays written by students trained and untrained in MCQ construction. The null hypothesis was that construction of MCQs did not result in higher grades achieved in "closed-book" time-limited assessment conditions. A Test cohort n=48 of undergraduate dental students were taught and constructed MCQs during their preclinical prosthodontics course. The Control cohort n=48 consisted of students who underwent the same course 1 year prior. The same question was administered to both cohorts without the students knowledge. Answers were de-identified and randomized for grading by a blinded expert prosthodontic examiner not involved in the teaching of the students. Based on a passing grade of 50 and a maximum grade of 100 the Test cohort exhibited significantly improved essay quality scoring a mean grade of 73.08.0 compared to a mean grade of 63.611.8 achieved by the control cohort p<0.001. The null hypothesis was rejected. Under the conditions of this double-blind study MCQ-construction resulted in better essays written by students under examination conditions. MCQ-construction improves Quality of Essay Assessment among undergraduate dental students.
