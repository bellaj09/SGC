The aim of this study was to assess wayfinding abilities in individuals with Down syndrome DS. The ability to learn routes though a virtual environment VE and to make a novel shortcut between two locations was assessed in individuals with DS N=10 and control participants individually matched on mental age MA or chronological age CA. The results showed that most of the participants with DS were able to learn routes through the VE even though they needed more trials than the CA controls to reach the learning criterion. However they did not show flexible wayfinding behaviour because they were unable to find a shortcut between two known locations unlike the CA controls. The results suggest that most individuals with DS can acquire knowledge about specific routes but are unable to integrate that knowledge into a configurational understanding of the environment.
