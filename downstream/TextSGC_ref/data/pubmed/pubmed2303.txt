Cancer patients are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID-19 infection fatality due to underlying malignancy treatment-related immunosuppression or increased comorbidities. A total of 218 COVID-19 positive patients from March 18th-April 8th 2020 with a malignant diagnosis were identified. A total of 61 28% cancer patients died from COVID-19 with a case fatality rate CFR of 37% 20/54 for hematologic malignancies and 25% 41/164 for solid malignancies. 6/11 55% lung cancer patients died from COVID-19 disease. Increased mortality was significantly associated with older age multiple comorbidities need for ICU support and elevated levels of D-Dimers LDH and lactate on multivariable analysis. Age-adjusted CFRs in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients at our institution and NYC reported a significant increase in case fatality for cancer patients. These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population.
