Evidence indicates that activation of the parasympathetic nervous system PNS suppresses physiological responses associated with motion sickness. Research also shows paced breathing increases PNS activation; the current study examines the use of paced diaphragmatic breathing DB training to quell motion sickness symptoms. Healthy participants N\xa0=\xa060 were pre-screened for motion sickness susceptibility. Participants were then randomly assigned to either a control condition focusing on environmental awareness or to an experimental condition implementing paced DB. Following this participants were exposed to a virtual reality VR motion sickness experience while heart rate variability breathing rate RPM and motion sickness ratings were collected. Results demonstrated participants in the DB condition had higher PNS activation and reported fewer motion sickness symptoms during the VR experience than the participants in the control condition. Results suggest that the DB protocol can be used to significantly increase PNS tone and decrease the development of motion sickness symptoms. Use of controlled diaphragmatic breathing for the management of motion sickness in a virtual reality environment.
