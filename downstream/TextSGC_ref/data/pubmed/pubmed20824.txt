"Two studies examined mens interventions in a virtual reality situation involving child grooming. In Study 1 92 men observed an online encounter between an apparent minor and a sex offender. The results suggest that the bystander effect was stronger under computerized rather than user-assisted surveillance and when the fellow cyberbystander was unknown rather than known. In Study 2 where 100 men observed the same encounter the effect also emerged under computerized surveillance as long as the number unknown cyberbystanders was increased. Thus vesting more responsibility for security in the average netizen rather than just in the automated abuse-detection technology is cautiously suggested the relevance of which lies in increasing minors health and safety."
