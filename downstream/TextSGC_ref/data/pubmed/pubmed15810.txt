"Machine learning techniques can identify complex relationships in large healthcare datasets and build prediction models that better inform physicians in ways that can assist in patient treatment decision-making. In the domain of shoulder arthroplasty machine learning appears to have the potential to anticipate patients results after surgery but this has not been well explored." What Is the Accuracy of Three Different Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Clinical Outcomes After Shoulder Arthroplasty?
