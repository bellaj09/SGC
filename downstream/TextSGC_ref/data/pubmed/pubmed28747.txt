This chapter focuses on the interdisciplinary discussion between cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists on how actions the results of decision processes are implemented. After surveying the approaches used in action implementation research we analyze the contributions of these different approaches in more detail. Topics covered include expertise research in sports science knowledge structures neuroscientific research on motor imagery and decision making computational models in motor control robotics and brain-machine interfaces. This forms the basis for discussing central issues for interdisciplinary research on action implementation from different viewpoints. In essence most findings show the need to abandon serial frameworks of information processing suggesting a step-by-step pattern from perception evaluation and selection to execution. Instead an outlook on new approaches is given opening a route for future research in this field. How are actions physically implemented?
