Radiation therapy RT is a common treatment option for head and neck HaN cancer. An important step involved in RT planning is the delineation of organs-at-risks OARs based on HaN computed tomography CT. However manually delineating OARs is time-consuming as each slice of CT images needs to be individually examined and a typical CT consists of hundreds of slices. Automating OARs segmentation has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of RT planning. Existing anatomy autosegmentation algorithms use primarily atlas-based methods which require sophisticated atlas creation and cannot adequately account for anatomy variations among patients. In this work we propose an end-to-end atlas-free three-dimensional 3D convolutional deep learning framework for fast and fully automated whole-volume HaN anatomy segmentation.
