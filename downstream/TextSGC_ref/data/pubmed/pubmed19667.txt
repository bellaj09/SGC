Adolescents with mild traumatic brain injuries MTBI are at substantial risk for repeat injury if they return to activity too soon. Post-concussion symptoms and impaired balance are two factors that limit return to activity. Post-injury assessments that challenge activity tolerance and balance skills are needed to ensure readiness to return to activity. This cross-sectional study evaluated the Nintendo Wii as a measure of exertion heart rate HR respiration rate RR and caloric expenditure and balance testing for youth with MTBI in a clinical setting. Twenty-four youth with MTBI ages 9-18 played six Wii games. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd edition BOT-2 and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale CBM were used as balance indicators. The Wii Fit Running game demonstrated the highest caloric expenditure and HR p = .010. Frequency counts of balance loss during Wii game play did not correlate with performance on the BOT-2 or the CBM. Type number and time since injury were predictive of balance performance on the CBM p = .008. Findings provide preliminary evidence for the use of the Wii as an exertion challenge to evaluate tolerance for exercise post-concussion. Frequency count of balance loss during Wii game play however was not a valid measure of balance impairment post-MTBI. Evaluating the Nintendo Wii for assessing return to activity readiness in youth with mild traumatic brain injury.
