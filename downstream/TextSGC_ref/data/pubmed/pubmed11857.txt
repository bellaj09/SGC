For a target task where the labeled data are unavailable domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain adaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift i.e. align the global source and target distributions without considering the relationships between two subdomains within the same category of different domains leading to unsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained information. Recently more and more researchers pay attention to subdomain adaptation that focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the relevant subdomains. However most of them are adversarial methods that contain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this we present a deep subdomain adaptation network DSAN that learns a transfer network by aligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer activations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy LMMD. Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial training and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most feedforward network models by extending them with LMMD loss which can be trained efficiently via backpropagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can achieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit classification tasks.
