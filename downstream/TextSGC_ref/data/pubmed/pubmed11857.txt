In this article we propose a deep extension of sparse subspace clustering termed deep subspace clustering with L1-norm DSC-L1. Regularized by the unit sphere distribution assumption for the learned deep features DSC-L1 can infer a new data affinity matrix by simultaneously satisfying the sparsity principle of SSC and the nonlinearity given by neural networks. One of the appealing advantages brought by DSC-L1 is that when original real-world data do not meet the class-specific linear subspace distribution assumption DSC-L1 can employ neural networks to make the assumption valid with its nonlinear transformations. Moreover we prove that our neural network could sufficiently approximate the minimizer under mild conditions. To the best of our knowledge this could be one of the first deep-learning-based subspace clustering methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world data sets to show that the proposed method is significantly superior to 17 existing methods for subspace clustering on handcrafted features and raw data.
