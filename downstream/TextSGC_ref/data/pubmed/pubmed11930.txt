We evaluated SpCas9 activities at 12832 target sequences using a high-throughput approach based on a human cell library containing single-guide RNA-encoding and target sequence pairs. Deep learning-based training on this large dataset of SpCas9-induced indel frequencies led to the development of a SpCas9 activity-predicting model named DeepSpCas9. When tested against independently generated datasets our own and those published by other groups DeepSpCas9 showed high generalization performance. DeepSpCas9 is available at http://deepcrispr.info/DeepSpCas9. SpCas9 activity prediction by DeepSpCas9 a deep learning-based model with high generalization performance.
