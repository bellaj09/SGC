Electroencephalography EEG is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity and is a strong candidate for brain-computer interface BCI development. While BCIs can be used as a means of communication for individuals with severe disabilities the majority of existing studies have reported BCI evaluations by able-bodied individuals. Considering the many differences in body functions and usage scenarios between individuals with disabilities and able-bodied individuals involvement of the target population in BCI evaluation is necessary. In this review 39 studies reporting EEG-oriented BCI assessment by individuals with disabilities were identified in the past decade. With respect to participant populations a need for assessing BCI performance for the pediatric population with severe disabilities was identified as an important future direction. Acquiring a reliable communication pathway during early stages of development is crucial in avoiding learned helplessness in pediatric-onset disabilities. With respect to evaluation augmenting traditional measures of system performance with those relating to contextual factors was recommended for realizing user-centered designs appropriate for integration in real-life. Considering indicators of user state and developing more effective training paradigms are recommended for future studies of BCI involving individuals with disabilities. A review of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces as access pathways for individuals with severe disabilities.
