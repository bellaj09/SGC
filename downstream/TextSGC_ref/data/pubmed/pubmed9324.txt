In proton therapy imaging prompt gamma PG rays has the potential to verify proton dose PD distribution. Despite the fact that there is a strong correlation between the gamma-ray emission and PD they are still different in terms of the distribution and the Bragg peak BP position. In this work we investigated the feasibility of using a deep learning approach to convert PG images to PD distributions.
