Advances in computerized and imaging technology permit both students and doctors to depict the anatomy of the human pelvis more realistically than with previous methods. Further refinements outline fine pelvic structures such as the nerve plexus which may as a result be spared during major pelvic surgery thus preserving the function of the bladder neck and urethra. Dynamic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging coupled with three-dimensional depiction of the lower urinary tract and its adjacent structures enable visualization of the whole lower urinary tract and the pelvic floor musculature in both continent and incontinent women. In patients with a reconstructed lower urinary tract computer-assisted image processing shows the postoperatively altered topographical anatomy. This may be clinically useful for interpretation of unexpected findings with conventional imaging modalities postoperative morbidity and surgical planning of a lower abdominal reoperation. Examples of our own work regarding the innervation of female pelvic organs dynamic depiction of the bladder and pelvic floor musculature during straining in normal and incontinent women and the situation of female patients after undergoing an anterior pelvic exenteration with subsequent orthotopic neobladder procedure are given. In addition the data of these patients have been compiled for virtual reality endoscopy which is useful for patient consent and for teaching residents students and nurses. Virtual reality of the lower urinary tract in women.
