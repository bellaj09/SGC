"We conducted a review to determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve occupational performance in people with motor impairments after stroke as part of the American Occupational Therapy Associations Evidence-Based Practice Project. One hundred forty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Findings related to key outcomes from select interventions are presented. Results suggest that a variety of effective interventions are available to improve occupational performance after stroke. Evidence suggests that repetitive task practice constraint-induced or modified constraint-induced movement therapy strengthening and exercise mental practice virtual reality mirror therapy and action observation can improve upper-extremity function balance and mobility and/or activity and participation. Commonalities among several of the effective interventions include the use of goal-directed individualized tasks that promote frequent repetitions of task-related or task-specific movements."
