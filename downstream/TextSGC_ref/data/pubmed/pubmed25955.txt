The dynamic characteristics of human upper extremities are usually expressed by mechanical impedance. Although many studies have discussed human impedance characteristics there are no reports on control abilities of task-related impedance in skilled human hand movements. This paper proposes a virtual sports system using a virtual reality technique to examine human movements. The differences in movements between skilled and unskilled subjects are investigated through a series of experiments. Then the human impedance of a skilled player is estimated and analyzed in the preliminary phase of motion. Analysis of mechanical impedance in human arm movements using a virtual tennis system.
