Psychological stress occurs when an individual perceives that environmental demands tax or exceed his or her adaptive capacity. Its association with severe health and emotional diseases points out the necessity to find new efficient strategies to treat it. Moreover psychological stress is a very personal problem and requires training focused on the specific needs of individuals. To overcome the above limitations the INTERSTRESS project suggests the adoption of a new paradigm for e-health--Interreality--that integrates contextualized assessment and treatment within a hybrid environment bridging the physical and the virtual worlds. According to this premise the aim of this study is to investigate the advantages of using advanced technologies in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy CBT based on a protocol for reducing psychological stress. Interreality for the management and training of psychological stress: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
