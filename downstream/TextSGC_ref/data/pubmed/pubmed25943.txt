The reconstruction of patients with large deformations in the facial area should consider functional aspects as well as aesthetical ones. In this paper an integrated virtual reality system which allows bone manipulation osteotomy planning calculation of implants for soft tissue and bones combined with the calculation of the post-operative appearance is presented. It is a valuable tool for a wide range of cranio-maxillofacial surgeries. Due to the generalized approach of the underlying algorithms it is a basis for further clinical applications in other surgical fields. A VR-system supporting symmetry related cranio-maxillofacial surgery.
