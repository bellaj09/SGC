"The Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine JEET throughout its 15 years of existence has tried to provide a respected outlet for scientific knowledge concerning the inextricable links between human societies and nature food and health. Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the partially artificial and fictitious interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes along with the associated knowledge skills practices and beliefs. Little attention has been paid however to the complex interplay of social and cultural\xa0reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases\xa0to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: 1 the encroachment of human activities e.g. logging mining agricultural expansion into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and connected to the former 2 the commodification of wild animals and natural resources in general and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular a crucial role may have\xa0been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The\xa0COVID-19 pandemic\xa0will likely require\xa0ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively\xa0mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings existence."
