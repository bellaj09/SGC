"Acquired brain injuries ABI may display cognitive impairments and lead to long-term disabilities including prospective memory PM failure. Prospective memory serves to remember to execute an intended action in the future. PM problems would be a challenge to an ABI patients successful community reintegration. While retrospective memory RM has been extensively studied treatment programs for prospective memory are rarely reported. The development of a treatment program for PM which is considered timely can be cost-effective and appropriate to the patients environment. A 12-session virtual reality VR-based cognitive rehabilitation program was developed using everyday PM activities as training content. 37 subjects were recruited to participate in a pretest-posttest control experimental study to evaluate its treatment effectiveness. Results suggest that significantly better changes were seen in both VR-based and real-life PM outcome measures related cognitive attributes such as frontal lobe functions and semantic fluency. VR-based training may be well accepted by ABI patients as encouraging improvement has been shown. Large-scale studies of a virtual reality-based prospective memory VRPM training program are indicated." Virtual reality-based prospective memory training program for people with acquired brain injury.
