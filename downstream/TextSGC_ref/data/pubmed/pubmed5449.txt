Increasing efforts have been denoted to elucidating the effective connectivity EC among brain regions recruited by certain language task; however it remains unclear the impact of handedness on the EC network underlying language processing. In particularly this has not been investigated in Chinese language which shows several differences from alphabetic language. This study thereby explored the functional activity patterns and the EC network during a Chinese semantic task based on functional MRI data of healthy left handers LH and right handers RH. We found that RH presented a left lateralized activity pattern in cerebral cortex and a right lateralized pattern in cerebellum; while LH were less lateralized than RH in both cerebral and cerebellar areas. The conditional Granger causality method in deconvolved BOLD level further demonstrated more interhemispheric directional connections in LH than RH group suggesting better bihemispheric coordination and increased interhemispheric communication in LH. Furthermore we found significantly increased EC from right middle occipital gyrus to bilateral insula INS while decreased EC from left INS to left precentral gyrus in LH group comparing to RH group implying that handedness may differentiate the causal relationship of information processing in integration of visual-spatial analysis and semantic word retrieval of Chinese characters. Effect of handedness on brain activity patterns and effective connectivity network during the semantic task of Chinese characters.
