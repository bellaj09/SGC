Since exposure therapy for anxiety disorders incorporates extinction of contextual anxiety relapses may be due to reinstatement processes. Animal research demonstrated more stable extinction memory and less anxiety relapse due to vagus nerve stimulation VNS. We report a valid human three-day context conditioning extinction and return of anxiety protocol which we used to examine effects of transcutaneous VNS tVNS. Seventy-five healthy participants received electric stimuli unconditioned stimuli US during acquisition Day1 when guided through one virtual office anxiety context CTX+ but never in another safety context CTX-. During extinction Day2 participants received tVNS sham or no stimulation and revisited both contexts without US delivery. On Day3 participants received three USs for reinstatement followed by a test phase. Successful acquisition i.e. startle potentiation lower valence higher arousal anxiety and contingency ratings in CTX+ versus CTX- the disappearance of these effects during extinction and successful reinstatement indicate validity of this paradigm. Interestingly we found generalized reinstatement in startle responses and differential reinstatement in valence ratings. Altogether our protocol serves as valid conditioning paradigm. Reinstatement effects indicate different anxiety networks underlying physiological versus verbal responses. However tVNS did neither affect extinction nor reinstatement which asks for validation and improvement of the stimulation protocol.
