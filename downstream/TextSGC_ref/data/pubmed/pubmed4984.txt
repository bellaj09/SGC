Brain systems underlying human memory function have been classically investigated studying patients with selective memory impairments. The discovery of rare individuals who have highly superior autobiographical memory HSAM provides instead an opportunity to investigate the brain systems underlying enhanced memory. Here we carried out an fMRI investigation of a group of subjects identified as having HSAM. During fMRI scanning eight subjects with HSAM and 21 control subjects were asked to retrieve autobiographical memories AMs as well as non-AMs e.g. examples of animals. Subjects were instructed to signal the "access" to an AM by a key press and to continue "reliving" it immediately after. Compared with controls individuals with HSAM provided a richer AM recollection and were faster in accessing AMs. The access to AMs was associated with enhanced prefrontal/hippocampal functional connectivity. AM access also induced increased activity in the left temporoparietal junction and enhanced functional coupling with sensory cortices in subjects with HSAM compared with controls. In contrast subjects with HSAM did not differ from controls in functional activity during the reliving phase. These findings based on fMRI assessment provide evidence of interaction of brain systems engaged in memory retrieval and suggest that enhanced activity of these systems is selectively involved in enabling more efficient access to past experiences in HSAM. Enhanced brain activity associated with memory access in highly superior autobiographical memory.
