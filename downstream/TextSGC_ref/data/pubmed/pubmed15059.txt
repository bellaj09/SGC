Although deep learning algorithms have shown expert-level performance previous efforts were mostly binary classifications of limited disorders. We trained an algorithm with 220680 images of 174 disorders and validated using Edinburgh 1300 images; 10 disorders and SNU dataset 2201 images; 134 disorders. The algorithm could accurately predict malignancy suggest primary treatment options render multi-class classification among 134 disorders and improve the performance of medical professionals. The AUCs for malignancy detection were 0.9280.002 Edinburgh and 0.9370.004 SNU. The AUCs of primary treatment suggestion SNU were 0.8280.012 0.8850.006 0.8850.006 and 0.9180.006 for steroids antibiotics antivirals and antifungals. For multi-class classification the mean Top-1/Top-5 accuracies were 56.71.6%/92.01.1% Edinburgh and 44.81.2%/78.10.3% SNU. With the assistance of our algorithm the sensitivity and specificity of 47 clinicians 21 dermatologists and 26 dermatology residents for malignancy prediction SNU; 240 images improved by 12.1% p<0.0001 and 1.1% p<0.0001 respectively. The malignancy prediction sensitivity of 23 general public significantly increased by 83.8% p<0.0001. The Top-1 and 3 accuracy of 4 doctors in the multi-class classification of 134 diseases SNU; 2201 images increased by 7.0% p=0.045 and 10.1% p=0.0020 respectively. The results suggest that our algorithm may serve as an Augmented Intelligence that can empower medical professionals in diagnostic dermatology.
