"We present a study on lung squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis using quantitative TI-DIC microscopy and a deep convolutional neural network DCNN. The 2-D phase map of unstained tissue sections is first retrieved from through-focus differential interference contrast DIC images based on the transport of intensity equation TIE. The spatially resolved optical properties are then computed from the 2-D phase map via the scattering-phase theorem. The scattering coefficient   S   and the reduced scattering coefficient   S    are found to increase whereas the anisotropy factor g is found to decrease with cancer. A DCNN classifier is developed afterwards to classify the tissue using either the DIC images or 2-D optical property maps of  S    S   and g. The DCNN classifier with the optical property maps exhibits high accuracy significantly outperforming the same DCNN classifier on the DIC images. The label-free quantitative phase microscopy together with deep learning may emerge as a promising approach for in situ rapid cancer diagnosis."
