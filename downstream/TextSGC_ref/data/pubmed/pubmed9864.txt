We seek to achieve the holy grail of Bayesian inference for gravitational-wave astronomy: using deep-learning techniques to instantly produce the posterior p|D for the source parameters  given the detector data D. To do so we train a deep neural network to take as input a signal + noise dataset drawn from the astrophysical source-parameter prior and the sampling distribution of detector noise and to output a parametrized approximation of the corresponding posterior. We rely on a compact representation of the data based on reduced-order modeling which we generate efficiently using a separate neural-network waveform interpolant A.\u2009J.\u2009K. Chua C.\u2009R.

Our scheme has broad relevance to gravitational-wave applications such as low-latency parameter estimation and characterizing the science returns of future experiments.
