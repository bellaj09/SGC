"Virtual Reality VR is a powerful tool that has increasingly being used by medical field in recent years. It has been mainly used surgical training in particular laparoscopic procedures. VR can be used for the teaching of anatomy. The aim of the study is to show application of transforming 2D radiologic images into 3D model by using thresholding and segmentation and import into VR interface at an affordable cost. Four anatomy modules are created with inputs to control the rotational and translational movement of 3D models in the virtual space. These movements allow users to explore 3D models by using head tilt and gaze input. 3D models of the Circle of Willis Vertebral Aneurysm Spine and Skull are rendered in the users field of view at runtime. VR is constructed to have many potentials uses in radiology education. Visualization of 3D anatomic structures in a virtual environment give another tool for teaching to students and patients about anatomy of the body. Four anatomy modules described here demonstrate example user interaction patterns best suited for viewing contexts. Instead viewing stacked 2D images or 3D models confined to desktop applications virtual reality increases user interactivity of education. An intuitive understanding of anatomic structures in 3D space enhances the learning experience for medical students residents and patients we are treating."
