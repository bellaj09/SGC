This paper presents a comparison between two different technologies of acquisition systems BrainNet36 and Emotiv Epoc for an Independent-BCI based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP. Two stimuli separated by a viewing angle <; 1 were used. Multivariate Synchronization Index MSI technique was used as feature extractor and five subjects participated in the experiments. The class is obtained through a criterion of maxima. The left and right flicker stimuli were modulated at frequencies of 8.0 and 13.0 Hz respectively. Acquisition via BrainNet system showed better results obtaining the highest value for accuracy 100% and the highest ITR 35.18 bits/min. This Independent-BCI is based on covert attention. Comparison between wire and wireless EEG acquisition systems based on SSVEP in an Independent-BCI.
