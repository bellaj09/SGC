Providing cognitive feedback in a virtual reality simulator during training is essential for subjects to correct and learn proper techniques. In this work we have developed a framework to identify key skills and cognitive knowledge required to perform a task and methods to provide to the user. The framework was verified by implementing a test case scenario with the peg transfer task of the FLS. A framework for providing cognitive feedback in surgical simulators.
