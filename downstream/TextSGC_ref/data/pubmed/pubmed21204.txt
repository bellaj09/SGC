A Virtual Environment VE uses multiple computer-generated media to let a user experience situations that are temporally and spatially prohibiting. The information flow between the user and the VE is bidirectional and the user can influence the environment. The software development of a VE requires orchestrating multiple peripherals and computers in a synchronized way in real time. Although a multitude of useful software components for VEs exists many of these are packaged within a complex framework and can not be used separately. In this paper an architecture is presented which is designed to let multiple frameworks work together while being shielded from the application program. This architecture which is called the Virtual Environment for Nano Scale Assembly VENSA has been constructed for interfacing with an optical tweezers instrument for nanotechnology development. However this approach can be generalized for most virtual environments. Through the use of VENSA the programmer can rely on existing solutions and concentrate more on the application software design.
