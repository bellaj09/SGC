Dose from radiation exposure can be estimated from dicentric chromosome DC frequencies in metaphase cells of peripheral blood lymphocytes. We automated DC detection by extracting features in Giemsa-stained metaphase chromosome images and classifying objects by machine learning ML. DC detection involves i intensity thresholded segmentation of metaphase objects ii chromosome separation by watershed transformation and elimination of inseparable chromosome clusters fragments and staining debris using a morphological decision tree filter iii determination of chromosome width and centreline iv derivation of centromere candidates and v distinction of DCs from monocentric chromosomes MC by ML. Centromere candidates are inferred from 14 image features input to a Support Vector Machine SVM. Sixteen features derived from these candidates are then supplied to a Boosting classifier and a second SVM which determines whether a chromosome is either a DC or MC. The SVM was trained with 292 DCs and 3135 MCs and then tested with cells exposed to either low 1 Gy or high 2-4 Gy radiation dose. Results were then compared with those of 3 experts. True positive rates TPR and positive predictive values PPV were determined for the tuning parameter . At larger  PPV decreases and TPR increases. At high dose for  = 1.3 TPR = 0.52 and PPV = 0.83 while at  = 1.6 the TPR = 0.65 and PPV = 0.72. At low dose and  = 1.3 TPR = 0.67 and PPV = 0.26. The algorithm differentiates DCs from MCs overlapped chromosomes and other objects with acceptable accuracy over a wide range of radiation exposures.
