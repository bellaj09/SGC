Brain-machine interfaces BMIs use neural activity related to motion parameters to enable brain directly control external devices. Some linear and nonlinear decoding techniques have been used successfully to infer arm trajectory from neural data. Unfortunately these One stage decoding techniques can hardly get high accuracy and low computational demands at the same time. Here we introduce a Two Stage Model TSM which consists of two linear models on the basis that different motion states have different neural firing patterns when rats were doing the lever pressing task. The accuracies of the neural firing patterns classification were higher than 90% for all the three datasets. The Correlation coefficients CC between the trajectory predicted by TSM and the measured one were up to 0.89 0.85 and 0.95 for the three datasets respectively higher than those of Kalman Filter KF and Partial Least Squares Regression PLSR. The time consumption of TSM was about only 10% of that of Generalized Regression Neural Network GRNN. These results show that TSM can simultaneously get both high accuracy and low computational cost.
