"Gaze-based keyboards offer a flexible way for human-computer interaction in both disabled and able-bodied people. Besides their convenience they still lead to error-prone human-computer interaction. Eye tracking devices may misinterpret users gaze resulting in typesetting errors especially when operated in fast mode. As a potential remedy we present a novel error detection system that aggregates the decision from two distinct subsystems each one dealing with disparate data streams. The first subsystem operates on gaze-related measurements and exploits the eye-transition pattern to flag a typo. The second is a brain-computer interface that utilizes a neural response known as Error-Related Potentials ErrPs which is inherently generated whenever the subject observes an erroneous action. Based on the experimental data gathered from 10 participants under a spontaneous typesetting scenario we first demonstrate that ErrP-based Brain Computer Interfaces can be indeed useful in the context of gaze-based typesetting despite the putative contamination of EEG activity from the eye-movement artefact. Then we show that the performance of this subsystem can be further improved by considering also the error detection from the gaze-related subsystem. Finally the proposed bimodal error detection system is shown to significantly reduce the typesetting time in a gaze-based keyboard." An error-aware gaze-based keyboard by means of a hybrid BCI system.
