Anxiety and depression are associated with altered communication within global brain networks and between these networks and the amygdala. Functional connectivity studies demonstrate an effect of anxiety and depression on four critical brain networks involved in top-down attentional control fronto-parietal network; FPN salience detection and error monitoring cingulo-opercular network; CON bottom-up stimulus-driven attention ventral attention network; VAN and default mode default mode network; DMN. However structural evidence on the white matter WM connections within these networks and between these networks and the amygdala is lacking. The current study in a large healthy sample n\xa0=\xa0483 observed that higher trait anxiety-depression predicted lower WM integrity in the connections between amygdala and specific regions of the FPN CON VAN and DMN. We discuss the possible consequences of these anatomical alterations for cognitive-affective functioning and underscore the need for further theory-driven research on individual differences in anxiety and depression on brain structure.
