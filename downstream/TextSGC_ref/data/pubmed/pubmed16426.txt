Unilateral spatial neglect is a disabling condition frequently occurring after stroke. People with neglect suffer from various spatial deficits in several modalities which in many cases impair everyday functioning. A successful treatment is yet to be found. Several techniques have been proposed in the last decades but only a few showed long-lasting effects and none could completely rehabilitate the condition. Diagnostic methods of neglect could be improved as well. The disorder is normally diagnosed with pen-and-paper methods which generally do not assess patients in everyday tasks and do not address some forms of the disorder. Recently promising new methods based on virtual reality have emerged. Virtual reality technologies hold great opportunities for the development of effective assessment and treatment techniques for neglect because they provide rich multimodal and highly controllable environments. In order to stimulate advancements in this domain we present a review and an analysis of the current work. We describe past and ongoing research of virtual reality applications for unilateral neglect and discuss the existing problems and new directions for development. Uses of virtual reality for diagnosis rehabilitation and study of unilateral spatial neglect: review and analysis.
