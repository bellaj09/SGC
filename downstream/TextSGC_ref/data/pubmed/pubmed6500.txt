"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that mainly localizes to the axon to stabilize axonal microtubule structure and neuronal connectivity. Tau pathology is one of the most common proteinopathies that associates with age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease AD and various Parkinsonism. Tau protein undergoes a plethora of intra-molecular modifications and some altered forms promote the production of toxic oligomeric tau and paired helical filaments and through which further assemble into neurofibrillary tangles also known as tauopathy. In this review we will discuss the recent advances of the tauopathy research primarily focusing on its association with the early axonal manifestation of axonal transport defect axonal mitochondrial stress autophagic vesicle accumulation and the proceeding of axon destruction and the pathogenic Tau spreading across the synapse. Two alternative strategies either by targeting tau protein itself or by improving the age-related physiological decline are currently racing to find the hopeful treatment for tauopathy. Undoubtedly more studies are needed to combat this devastating condition that has already affected millions of people in our aging population."
