The objective of this study is to evaluate usefulness of mandibular reconstructions using a custom-made titanium mesh Ti-mesh tray and particulate cancellous bone and marrow PCBM. A consecutive nine patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction were enrolled in this study. They were five men and four women mean age: 53.9 years. Virtual reality simulation was performed using computer software based on the pre-operative computed tomography data. A 3-dimensional 3-D skull model was constructed using a 3-D printer. A tray was custom-made from a Ti-mesh sheet bent to adapt to the model. After PCBM harvesting from bilateral posterior ilia the tray was fixed to the host bone. New bone formation and configuration of the reconstructed mandible were assessed radiologically. Complications were recorded in each patient during the follow-up period. Patients satisfaction with post-operative facial contour was evaluated using a visual analogue scale VAS score range = 0-100. In six of nine patients excellent new bone formation was recognised and expected results were radiologically achieved. Complications occurred in four patients. These complications included Ti-mesh fracture Ti-mesh exposure in the oral cavity and delayed infection. Mean VAS score on patient satisfaction was 77.6. Although the data are preliminary the results suggest that this method is clinically useful.
