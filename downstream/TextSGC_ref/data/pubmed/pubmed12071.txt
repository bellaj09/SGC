PredMP is the first web service to our knowledge that aims at de novo prediction of the membrane protein MP 3D structure followed by the embedding of the MP into the lipid bilayer for visualization. Our approach is based on a high-throughput Deep Transfer Learning DTL method that first predicts MP contacts by learning from non-MPs and then predicts the 3D model of the MP using the predicted contacts as distance restraints. This algorithm is derived from our previous Deep Learning DL method originally developed for soluble protein contact prediction which has been officially ranked No. 1 in CASP12. The DTL framework in our approach overcomes the challenge that there are only a limited number of solved MP structures for training the deep learning model. There are three modules in the PredMP server: i The DTL framework followed by the contact-assisted folding protocol has already been implemented in RaptorX-Contact which serves as the key module for 3D model generation; ii The 1D annotation module implemented in RaptorX-Property is used to predict the secondary structure and disordered regions; and iii the visualization module to display the predicted MPs embedded in the lipid bilayer guided by the predicted transmembrane topology.
