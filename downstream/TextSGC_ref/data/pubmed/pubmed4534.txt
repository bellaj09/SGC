Resting-state fMRI rs-fMRI is receiving substantial attention for its sensitivity to functional abnormality in the brain networks of people with psychiatric and neurological disorders. However because of the variety of rs-fMRI processing methods the necessity of rs-fMRI quality assurance is increasing. Conventionally the temporal signal-to-noise ratio tSNR is generally adopted for quality examination but the tSNR does not guarantee reliable functional connectivity FC outcomes. Theoretically intrinsic FC is supposed to reflect the spontaneous synchronization of neuronal basis rather than that from thermal noise or non-neuronal physiological noise. Therefore we proposed a new quality-assurance index for rs-fMRI to estimate the physiological contributions in spontaneous oscillations PICSO. The PICSO index was designed as a voxel-wise measure for facilitating practical applications to all existing rs-fMRI data sets on the basis of two assumptions: Gaussian distributions in temporal fluctuations and ultra-slow changes of neural-based physiological fluctuations. To thoroughly validate the sensitivity of the proposed PICSO index to FC we calibrated the preprocessing steps according to phantom data and verified the relationship between the PICSO and factors that are considered to affect FC in healthy participants n = 12. Our results demonstrated that FC showed a significantly positive correlation with the PICSO. Moreover for generating robust FC outcomes directly acquiring data at a relatively large voxel size was more effective than performing smoothness on high-resolution data sets. In conclusion compared with tSNR the PICSO index is more sensitive to the resulting FC providing a practical quality-assurance indicator for all existing rs-fMRI data sets.
