"Moving from well-controlled brisk artificial stimuli to natural and less-controlled stimuli seems counter-intuitive for event-related potential ERP studies. As natural stimuli typically contain a richer internal structure they might introduce higher levels of variance and jitter in the ERP responses. Both characteristics are unfavorable for a good single-trial classification of ERPs in the context of a multi-class brain-computer interface BCI system where the class-discriminant information between target stimuli and non-target stimuli must be maximized. For the application in an auditory BCI system however the transition from simple artificial tones to natural syllables can be useful despite the variance introduced. In the presented study healthy users N = 9 participated in an offline auditory nine-class BCI experiment with artificial and natural stimuli. It is shown that the use of syllables as natural stimuli does not only improve the users ergonomic ratings; also the classification performance is increased. Moreover natural stimuli obtain a better balance in multi-class decisions such that the number of systematic confusions between the nine classes is reduced. Hopefully our findings may contribute to make auditory BCI paradigms more user friendly and applicable for patients." Natural stimuli improve auditory BCIs with respect to ergonomics and performance.
