"Computer-generated three-dimensional 3D animation is an ideal media to accurately visualize crime or accident scenes to the viewers and in the courtrooms. Based upon factual data forensic animations can reproduce the scene and demonstrate the activity at various points in time. The use of computer animation techniques to reconstruct crime scenes is beginning to replace the traditional illustrations photographs and verbal descriptions and is becoming popular in todays forensics. This article integrates work in the areas of 3D graphics computer vision motion tracking natural language processing and forensic computing to investigate the state-of-the-art in forensic visualization. It identifies and reviews areas where new applications of 3D digital technologies and artificial intelligence could be used to enhance particular phases of forensic visualization to create 3D models and animations automatically and quickly. Having discussed the relationships between major crime types and level-of-detail in corresponding forensic animations we recognized that high level-of-detail animation involving human characters which is appropriate for many major crime types but has had limited use in courtrooms could be useful for crime investigation."
