Type 2 diabetes T2D is a complex disease characterized by pancreatic islet dysfunction insulin resistance and disruption of blood glucose levels. Genome-wide association studies GWAS have identified\xa0>\xa0400 independent signals that encode genetic predisposition. More than 90% of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs localize to non-coding regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer elements indicating a strong transcriptional regulatory component to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell types that express distinct hormonal programs so each cell type may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory processes that modulate T2D-associated transcriptional circuits. Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and DNase-seq applied to islets in bulk produce aggregate profiles that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity. Single-cell ATAC-Seq in human pancreatic islets and deep learning upscaling of rare cells reveals cell-specific type 2 diabetes regulatory signatures.
