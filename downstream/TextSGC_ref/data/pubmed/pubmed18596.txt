Despite the ubiquity of interior space design there is virtually no scientific research on the influence of furnishing on the perception of interior space. We conducted two experiments in which observers were asked to estimate the spatial dimensions size of the room dimensions in meters and centimeters and to judge subjective spaciousness of various rooms. Experiment 1 used true-to-scale model rooms with a square surface area. Furnishing affected both the perceived height and the spaciousness judgments. The furnished room was perceived as higher but less spacious. In Experiment 2 rooms with different square surface areas and constant physical height were presented in virtual reality. Furnishing affected neither the perceived spatial dimensions nor the perceived spaciousness. Possible reasons for this discrepancy such as the influence of the presentation medium are discussed. Moreover our results suggest a compression of perceived height and depth with decreasing surface area of the room. The effect of furnishing on perceived spatial dimensions and spaciousness of interior space.
