Electrocorticography primarily used in a clinical context is becoming increasingly important for fundamental neuroscientific research as well as for brain-computer interfaces. Recordings from these implanted electrodes have a number of advantages over non-invasive recordings in terms of band width spatial resolution smaller vulnerability to artifacts and overall signal quality. However an unresolved issue is that signals vary greatly across electrodes. Here we examine the effect of blood vessels lying between an electrode and the cortex on signals recorded from subdural grid electrodes. Blood vessels of different sizes cover extensive parts of the cortex causing variations in the electrode-cortex connection across grids. The power spectral density of electrodes located on the cortex and electrodes located on blood vessels obtained from eight epilepsy patients is compared. We find that blood vessels affect the power spectral density of the recorded signal in a frequency-band-specific way in that frequencies between 30 and 70 Hz are attenuated the most. Here the signal is attenuated on average by 30-40% compared to electrodes directly on the cortex. For lower frequencies this attenuation effect is less pronounced. We conclude that blood vessels influence the signal properties in a non-uniform manner. The effects of blood vessels on electrocorticography.
