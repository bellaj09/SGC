The mechanisms underlying the emergence of learned motor skill representation in primary motor cortex M1 are not well understood. Specifically how motor representation in the deep output layer 5b L5b is shaped by motor learning remains virtually unknown. In rats undergoing motor skill training we detect a subpopulation of task-recruited L5b neurons that not only become more movement-encoding but their activities are also more structured and temporally aligned to motor execution with a timescale of refinement in tens-of-milliseconds. Field potentials evoked at L5b in vivo exhibit persistent long-term potentiation LTP that parallels motor performance. Intracortical dopamine denervation impairs motor learning and disrupts the LTP profile as well as the emergent neurodynamical properties of task-recruited L5b neurons. Thus dopamine-dependent recruitment of L5b neuronal ensembles via synaptic reorganization may allow the motor cortex to generate more temporally structured movement-encoding output signal from M1 to downstream circuitry that drives increased uniformity and precision of movement during motor learning.
