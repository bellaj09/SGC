A lack of effective non-contact methods for automatic fall detection which may result in the development of health and life-threatening conditions is a great problem of modern medicine and in particular geriatrics. The purpose of the present work was to investigate the advantages of utilizing a multi-bioradar system in the accuracy of remote fall detection. The proposed concept combined usage of wavelet transform and deep learning to detect fall episodes. The continuous wavelet transform was used to get a time-frequency representation of the bio-radar signal and use it as input data for a pre-trained convolutional neural network AlexNet adapted to solve the problem of detecting falls. Processing of the experimental results showed that the designed multi-bioradar system can be used as a simple and view-independent approach implementing a non-contact fall detection method with an accuracy and F1-score of 99%.
