Key issues in the epilepsy seizure prediction research are 1 the reproducibility of results 2 the inability to compare multiple approaches directly. To overcome these problems the seizure prediction challenge was organized on Kaggle.com. It aimed at establishing benchmarks on a dataset with predefined train validation and test sets. Our main objective is to analyze the competition format and to propose improvements which would facilitate a better comparison of algorithms. The second objective is to present a novel deep learning approach to seizure prediction and compare it to other commonly used methods using patient centered metrics. Towards Improved Design and Evaluation of Epileptic Seizure Predictors.
