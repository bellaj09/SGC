In contemporary muscle-computer interfaces for upper limb prosthetics there is often a trade-off between control robustness and range of executable movements. As a very low movement error rate is necessary in practical applications this often results in a quite severe limitation of controllability; a problem growing ever more salient as the mechanical sophistication of multifunctional myoelectric prostheses continues to improve. A possible remedy for this could come from the use of multi-label machine learning methods where complex movements can be expressed as the superposition of several simpler movements. Here we investigate this claim by applying a multi-labeled classification scheme in the form of a deep convolutional neural network CNN to high density surface electromyography HD-sEMG recordings. We use 16 independent labels to model the movements of the hand and forearm state representing its major degrees of freedom. By training the neural network on 16\u2009\u20098 sEMG image sequences 24 samples long with a sampling rate of 2048\u2009Hz to detect these labels we achieved a mean exact match rate of 78.7% and a mean Hamming loss of 2.9% across 14 healthy test subjects. With this we demonstrate the feasibility of highly versatile and responsive sEMG control interfaces without loss of accuracy.
