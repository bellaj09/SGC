In the past 10 years brain-computer interfaces BCIs for controlling assistive devices have seen tremendous progress with respect to reliability and learnability and numerous exemplary applications were demonstrated to be controllable by a BCI. Yet BCI-controlled applications are hardly used for patients with neurologic or neurodegenerative disease. Such patient groups are considered potential end-users of BCI specifically for replacing or improving lost function. We argue that BCI research and development still faces a translational gap i.e. the knowledge of how to bring BCIs from the laboratory to the field is insufficient. BCI-controlled applications lack usability and accessibility; both constitute two sides of one coin which is the key to use in daily life and to prevent nonuse. To increase usability we suggest rigorously adopting the user-centered design in applied BCI research and development. To provide accessibility assistive technology AT experts providers and other stakeholders have to be included in the user-centered process. BCI experts have to ensure the transfer of knowledge to AT professionals and listen to the needs of primary secondary and tertiary end-users of BCI technology. Addressing both usability and accessibility in applied BCI research and development will bridge the translational gap and ensure that the needs of clinical end-users are heard understood addressed and fulfilled. Hearing the needs of clinical users.
