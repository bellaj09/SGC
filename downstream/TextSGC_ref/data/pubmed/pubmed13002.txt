A unique challenge in predictive model building for omics data has been the small number of samples n versus the large amount of features p. This "n  p" property brings difficulties for disease outcome classification using deep learning techniques. Sparse learning by incorporating known functional relations between the biological units such as the graph-embedded deep feedforward network GEDFN model has been a solution to this issue. However such methods require an existing feature graph and potential mis-specification of the feature graph can be harmful on classification and feature selection. forgeNet: a graph deep neural network model using tree-based ensemble classifiers for feature graph construction.
