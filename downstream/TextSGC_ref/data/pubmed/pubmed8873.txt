Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography SDOCT is a non-invasive imaging modality that generates high-resolution volumetric images. This modality finds widespread usage in ophthalmology for the diagnosis and management of various ocular conditions. The volumes generated can contain 200 or more B-scans. Manual inspection of such large quantity of scans is time consuming and error prone in most clinical settings. Here we present a method for the generation of visual summaries of SDOCT volumes wherein a small set of B-scans that highlight the most clinically relevant features in a volume are extracted. The method was trained and evaluated on data acquired from age-related macular degeneration patients and "relevance" was defined as the presence of visibly discernible structural abnormalities. The summarisation system consists of a detection module where relevant B-scans are extracted from the volume and a set of rules that determines which B-scans are included in the visual summary. Two deep learning approaches are presented and compared for the classification of B-scans-transfer learning and de novo learning. Both approaches performed comparably with AUCs of 0.97 and 0.96 respectively obtained on an independent test set. The de novo network however was 98% smaller than the transfer learning approach and had a run-time that was also significantly shorter.
