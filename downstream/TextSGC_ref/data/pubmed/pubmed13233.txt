In pulmonary nodule detection the first stage candidate detection aims to detect suspicious pulmonary nodules. However detected candidates include many false positives and thus in the following stage false positive reduction such false positives are reliably reduced. Note that this task is challenging due to 1 the imbalance between the numbers of nodules and non-nodules and 2 the intra-class diversity of non-nodules. Although techniques using 3D convolutional neural networks CNNs have shown promising performance they suffer from high computational complexity which hinders constructing deep networks. To efficiently address these problems we propose a novel framework using the ensemble of 2D CNNs using single views which outperforms existing 3D CNN-based methods. Single-view 2D CNNs with fully automatic non-nodule categorization for false positive reduction in pulmonary nodule detection.
