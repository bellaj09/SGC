Three-dimensional 3D imaging and image reconstruction play a prominent role in the diagnosis treatment planning and post-therapeutic monitoring of patients with congenital heart disease. More interactive and realistic medical experiences take advantage of advanced visualization techniques like augmented mixed and virtual reality. Further 3D printing is now used in medicine. All these technologies improve the understanding of the complex morphologies of congenital heart disease. In this review article we describe the technical advantages and disadvantages of various advanced visualization techniques and their medical applications in the field of congenital heart disease. In addition unresolved issues and future perspectives of these evolving techniques are described.
