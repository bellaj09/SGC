With more readily available commercial immersive virtual reality VR technologies the potential of new feedback strategies as tools to facilitate motor rehabilitation should be investigated. Augmented feedback or error augmentation EA can easily be shown in a virtual environment. Here visual EA provided via immersive VR was tested for its effectiveness to improve bimanual symmetry in a reaching task. A single-session crossover design was used to test two training cases with or without EA. With EA the distance between hands in the forward direction was augmented. Participants were recruited from typically developing TD populations n = 12 ages 13-21 and performed in an adapted environment with an initial asymmetry between limbs. Also five participants with hemiplegic cerebral palsy CP ages 14-21 MACS I-III completed the study. Among TD participants a significantly larger change in symmetry in the adapted environment was shown after EA than training without EA F 1 10 = 9.64 p = 0.01. Each participant in the CP group also improved more after EA training 8.8-103.7% such that they achieved lower symmetry error after training with EA. As participants in both groups adapted more symmetrically with EA beneficial changes from this training method could be evaluated in future studies for longer-term functional changes.
