In recent years with the rapid development of mobile Internet and its business applications mobile advertising Click-Through Rate CTR estimation has become a hot research direction in the field of computational advertising which is used to achieve accurate advertisement delivery for the best benefits in the three-side game between media advertisers and audiences. Current research on the estimation of CTR mainly uses the methods and models of machine learning such as linear model or recommendation algorithms. However most of these methods are insufficient to extract the data features and cannot reflect the nonlinear relationship between different features. In order to solve these problems we propose a new model based on Deep Belief Nets to predict the CTR of mobile advertising which combines together the powerful data representation and feature extraction capability of Deep Belief Nets with the advantage of simplicity of traditional Logistic Regression models. Based on the training dataset with the information of over 40 million mobile advertisements during a period of 10 days our experiments show that our new model has better estimation accuracy than the classic Logistic Regression LR model by 5.57% and Support Vector Regression SVR model by 5.80%.
