"Studies have shown the potential of Virtual Reality and motion tracking devices in physical rehabilitation. This paper addresses the topic of using non-immersive Virtual Reality therapeutic games with motion tracking in physical rehabilitation and describes an exploratory study performed in collaboration with a national public Rehabilitation Center about their use to motivate patients to perform exercises relevant for balance rehabilitation. The work involved developing and adapting mini-games to track patients posture; tests with patients recovering from Spinal Cord Injury suggest that this type of games can be helpful in the recovery process namely in patients motivation for performing the therapeutic gestures." An Exploratory Study on the use of Virtual Reality in Balance Rehabilitation.
