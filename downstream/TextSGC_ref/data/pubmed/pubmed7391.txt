Precise placement of needles is a challenge in a number of clinical applications such as brachytherapy or biopsy. Forces acting at the needle cause tissue deformation and needle deflection which in turn may lead to misplacement or injury. Hence a number of approaches to estimate the forces at the needle have been proposed. Yet integrating sensors into the needle tip is challenging and a careful calibration is required to obtain good force estimates. Spatio-temporal deep learning models for tip force estimation during needle insertion.
