To change a school into a health-promoting organization organizational learning is required. The evaluation of an Austrian regional health-promoting schools network provides qualitative data on the views of the different stakeholders on learning in this network steering group network coordinator and representatives of the network schools; n = 26. Through thematic analysis and deep-structure analyses the following three forms of learning in the network were identified: A individual learning through input offered by the network coordination B individual learning between the network schools i.e. through exchange between the representatives of different schools and C learning within the participating schools i.e. organizational learning. Learning between B or within the participating schools C seems to be rare in the network; concepts of individual teacher learning are prevalent. Difficulties detected relating to the transfer of information from the network to the member schools included barriers to organizational learning such as the lack of collaboration coordination and communication in the network schools which might be effects of the school system in which the observed network is located. To ensure connectivity of the information offered by the network more emphasis should be put on linking health promotion to school development and the core processes of schools. Learning in networks: individual teacher learning versus organizational learning in a regional health-promoting schools network.
