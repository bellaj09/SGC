Detecting an anomaly or an abnormal situation from given noise is highly useful in an environment where constantly verifying and monitoring a machine is required. As deep learning algorithms are further developed current studies have focused on this problem. However there are too many variables to define anomalies and the human annotation for a large collection of abnormal data labeled at the class-level is very labor-intensive. In this paper we propose to detect abnormal operation sounds or outliers in a very complex machine along with reducing the data-driven annotation cost. The architecture of the proposed model is based on an auto-encoder and it uses the residual error which stands for its reconstruction quality to identify the anomaly. We assess our model using Surface-Mounted Device SMD machine sound which is very complex as experimental data and state-of-the-art performance is successfully achieved for anomaly detection.
