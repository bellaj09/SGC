In this research we present a semi-supervised segmentation solution using convolutional autoencoders to solve the problem of segmentation tasks having a small number of ground-truth images. We evaluate the proposed deep network architecture for the detection of nests of nevus cells in histopathological images of skin specimens is an important step in dermatopathology. The diagnostic criteria based on the degree of uniformity and symmetry of border irregularities are particularly vital in dermatopathology in order to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions. However to the best of our knowledge it is the first described method to segment the nests region. The novelty of our approach is not only the area of research but furthermore we address a problem with a small ground-truth dataset. We propose an effective computer-vision based deep learning tool that can perform the nests segmentation based on an autoencoder architecture with two learning steps. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its ability to segment nests areas with Dice similarity coefficient 0.81 sensitivity 0.76 and specificity 0.94 which is a state-of-the-art result.
