"The amygdala together with the dorsal periaqueductal gray dPAG medial hypothalamus and deep layers of the superior and inferior colliculi constitutes the encephalic aversion system which has been considered the main neural substrate for the organization of fear and anxiety. The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala BLA acts as a filter for aversive stimuli to higher structures while the central CeA and the medial MeA nuclei constitute the output for the autonomic and somatic components of the emotional reaction through major projections to the limbic and brainstem regions. Although some findings point to the distinct participation of the substance P SP and the NK1 receptors system in the different nuclei of the amygdala on the expression of emotional behaviors it is not clear if this system modulates anxiety-like responses in the distinct nuclei of the amygdala as well as the dPAG. Thus it was investigated if the injection of SP into the BLA CeA or MeA affects the expression of anxiety-like responses of rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze EPM test and if the effects are mediated by NK1 receptors. The results showed that SP and Sar-Met-SP NK1 receptor selective agonist injected into the CeA and MeA but not into the BLA caused anxiogenic-like effects in the EPM. Altogether the data indicates that the SP may mimic the effects of anxiogenic stimuli via NK1 receptor activation only in the CeA and MeA amygdalas nuclei output and may activate the neural mechanisms involved in the defensive reaction genesis. The SP/NK1 receptors system activation may be phasically involved in very specific aspects of anxiety behaviors."
