Virtual rehabilitation approaches for promoting motor recovery has attracted considerable attention in recent years. It appears to be a useful tool to provide beneficial and motivational rehabilitation conditions. Following a stroke hemiparesis is one of the most disabling impairments and therefore many affected people often show substantial deficits in walking abilities. Hence one of the major goals of stroke rehabilitation is to improve patients\ gait characteristics and hence to regain their highest possible level of walking ability. Because previous studies indicate a relationship between walking and balance ability this article proposes a stroke rehabilitation program that targets balance impairments to improve walking in stroke survivors. Most currently available stroke rehabilitation programs lack a theory-driven feasible template consistent with widely accepted motor learning principles and theories in rehabilitation. To address this hiatus we explore the potential of a set of virtual reality games specifically developed for stroke rehabilitation and ordered according to an established two-dimensional motor skill classification taxonomy. We argue that the ensuing "exergame"-based rehabilitation program warrants individually tailored balance progression in a learning environment that allows variable practice and hence optimizes the recovery of walking ability. Design considerations for a theory-driven exergame-based rehabilitation program to improve walking of persons with stroke.
