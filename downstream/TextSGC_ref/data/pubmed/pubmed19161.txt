"Psychological distress is a common consequence of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment and could further exacerbate therapy side effects. Interventions increasing treatment tolerance are crucial to improve both patients quality of life and adherence to therapies. Virtual reality VR has emerged as an effective distraction tool for different medical procedures. Here we assessed the efficacy of immersive and interactive VR in alleviating chemotherapy-related psychological distress in a cohort of Italian breast cancer patients also comparing its effects with those of music therapy MT. Thirty patients were included in the VR group 30 in the MT group and 34 in the control group consisting of patients receiving standard care during chemotherapy. Our data suggest that both VR and MT are useful interventions for alleviating anxiety and for improving mood states in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. Moreover VR seems more effective than MT in relieving anxiety depression and fatigue."
