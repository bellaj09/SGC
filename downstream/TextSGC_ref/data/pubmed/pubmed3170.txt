The unique mapping of structural brain connectivity SC and functional brain connectivity FC on cognition is currently not well understood. It is not clear whether cognition is mapped via a global connectome pattern or instead is underpinned by several sets of distributed connectivity patterns. Moreover we also do not know whether the spatial distributions of SC and FC that underlie cognition are overlapping or distinct. Here we study the relationship between SC and FC and an array of psychological tasks in 609 subjects males 269; females 340 from the Human Connectome Project. We identified several sets of connections that each uniquely map onto cognitive function. We found a small number of distributed SCs and a larger set of corticocortical and corticosubcortical FCs that express this association. Importantly the SC and FC each show unique and distinct patterns of variance across subjects as they relate to cognition. The results suggest that a complete understanding of connectome underpinnings of cognition calls for a combination of the two modalities.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Structural connectivity SC the physical white-matter inter-regional pathways in the brain and functional connectivity FC the temporal coactivations between the activity of the brain regions have each been studied extensively. Little is known however about the distribution of variance in connections as they relate to cognition. Here in a large sample of subjects N = 609 we showed that two sets of brain-behavior patterns capture the correlations between SC and FC with a wide range of cognitive tasks respectively. These brain-behavior patterns reveal distinct sets of connections within the SC and the FC network and provide new evidence that SC and FC each provide unique information for cognition.
