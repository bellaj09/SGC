The ability to rapidly learn from others by instruction is an important characteristic of human cognition. A recent study found that the rapid transfer from initial instructions to fluid behavior is supported by changes of functional connectivity between and within several large-scale brain networks and particularly by the coupling of the dorsal attention network DAN with the cingulo-opercular network CON. In the present study we extended this approach to investigate how these brain networks interact when stimulus-response mappings are altered by novel instructions. We hypothesized that residual stimulus-response associations from initial practice might negatively impact the ability to implement novel instructions. Using functional imaging and large-scale connectivity analysis we found that functional coupling between the CON and DAN was generally at a higher level during initial than reversal learning. Examining the learning-related connectivity dynamics between the CON and DAN in more detail by means of multivariate patterns analyses we identified a specific subset of connections which showed a particularly high increase in connectivity during initial learning compared to reversal learning. This finding suggests that the CON-DAN connections can be separated into two functionally dissociable yet spatially intertwined subsystems supporting different aspects of short-term task automatization.
