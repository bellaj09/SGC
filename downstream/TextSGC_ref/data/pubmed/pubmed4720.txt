"A 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation was recently generated using multimodal data in a group average of 210 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project HCP. In order to automatically and accurately identify mild cognitive impairment MCI at its two levels early MCI and late MCI Alzheimers disease AD and healthy control HC a novel joint HCP MMP method was first proposed to delineate the cortical architecture and function connectivity in a group of non healthy adults. The proposed method was applied to register a dataset of 96 resting-state functional connectomes from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI to Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative CIFTI space and parcellated brain into human connectome project multi-modal parcellation HCPMMP with 360 areas. Various network features in each node of the connectivity network were considered as the candidate features for classification.The fine-grained multi-modal based on HCP-MMP combined with machine learning in identification for EMCI LMCI AD and HC. Applying various network features including strength betweenness centrality clustering coefficient local efficiency eigenvector centrality etc we trained and tested several machine learning models. Thousands of features were processed by filter and wrapper feature selection procedures and finally there were thirty features to be selected to achieve classification accuracies of 93.8% for EMCI vs. HC 95.8% for LMCI vs. HC 95.8% for AD vs. HC and 91.7% for LMCI vs. AD respectively by using support vector machine SVM algorithm. Most of the selected features locate in the region of temporal or cingulate cortex. Compared with previous studies our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques."
