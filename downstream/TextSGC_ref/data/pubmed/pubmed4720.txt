This study aims to provide convergent understanding of the neural basis of auditory word processing efficiency using a multimodal imaging. We investigated the structural and functional correlates of word processing efficiency in healthy individuals. We acquired two structural imaging T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI during auditory word processing phonological and semantic tasks. Our results showed that better phonological performance was predicted by the greater thalamus activity. In contrary better semantic performance was associated with the less activation in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus pMTG supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis that better task performance requires less brain activation. Furthermore our network analysis revealed the semantic network including the left anterior temporal lobe ATL dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC and pMTG was correlated with the semantic efficiency. Especially this network acted as a neural efficient manner during auditory word processing. Structurally DLPFC and cingulum contributed to the word processing efficiency. Also the parietal cortex showed a significate association with the word processing efficiency. Our results demonstrated that two features of word processing efficiency phonology and semantics can be supported in different brain regions and importantly the way serving it in each region was different according to the feature of word processing. Our findings suggest that word processing efficiency can be achieved by in collaboration of multiple brain regions involved in language and general cognitive function structurally and functionally. Structural and functional correlates for language efficiency in auditory word processing.
