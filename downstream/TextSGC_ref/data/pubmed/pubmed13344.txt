Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing generates a comprehensive profiling of the gene methylation levels but is limited by a high cost. Recent studies have partitioned the genes into landmark genes and target genes and suggested that the landmark gene expression levels capture adequate information to reconstruct the target gene expression levels. This inspired us to propose that the methylation level of the promoters in landmark genes might be adequate to reconstruct the promoter methylation level of target genes which would eventually reduce the cost of promoter methylation profiling. Here we propose a deep learning model called Deep-Gene Promoter Methylation D-GPM to predict the whole-genome promoter methylation level based on the promoter methylation profile of the landmark genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA. D-GPM-15%-7000  5 the optimal architecture of D-GPM acquires the least overall mean absolute error MAE and the highest overall Pearson correlation coefficient PCC with values of 0.0329 and 0.8186 respectively when testing data. Additionally the D-GPM outperforms the regression tree RT linear regression LR and the support vector machine SVM in 95.66% 92.65% and 85.49% of the target genes by virtue of its relatively lower MAE and in 98.25% 91.00% and 81.56% of the target genes based on its relatively higher PCC respectively. More importantly the D-GPM predominates in predicting 79.86% and 78.34% of the target genes according to the model distribution of the least MAE and the highest PCC respectively.
