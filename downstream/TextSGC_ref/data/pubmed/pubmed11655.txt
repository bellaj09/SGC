Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit of light has become an indispensable tool to directly visualize biological structures in living cells at a nanometer-scale resolution. Despite advances in high-density super-resolution fluorescent techniques existing methods still have bottlenecks including extremely long execution time artificial thinning and thickening of structures and lack of ability to capture latent structures.
