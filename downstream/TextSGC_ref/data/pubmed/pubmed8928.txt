Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. The identification of cardiac diseases on conventional three-dimensional 3D CT can have many clinical applications. An automated method that can distinguish between healthy and diseased hearts could improve diagnostic speed and accuracy when the only modality available is conventional 3D CT. In this work we proposed and implemented convolutional neural networks CNNs to identify diseased hears on CT images. Six patients with healthy hearts and six with previous cardiovascular disease events received chest CT. After the left atrium for each heart was segmented 2D and 3D patches were created. A subset of the patches were then used to train separate convolutional neural networks using leave-one-out cross-validation of patient pairs. The results of the two neural networks were compared with 3D patches producing the higher testing accuracy. The full list of 3D patches from the left atrium was then classified using the optimal 3D CNN model and the receiver operating curves ROCs were produced. The final average area under the curve AUC from the ROC curves was 0.840  0.065 and the average accuracy was 78.9%  5.9%. This demonstrates that the CNN-based method is capable of distinguishing healthy hearts from those with previous cardiovascular disease.
