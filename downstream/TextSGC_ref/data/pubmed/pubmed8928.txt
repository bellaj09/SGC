Heated metal mark is an important trace to identify the cause of fire. However traditional methods mainly focus on the knowledge of physics and chemistry for qualitative analysis and make it still a challenging problem. This paper presents a case study on attribute recognition of the heated metal mark image using computer vision and machine learning technologies. The proposed work is composed of three parts. Material is first generated. According to national standards actual needs and feasibility seven attributes are selected for research. Data generation and organization are conducted and a small size benchmark dataset is constructed. A recognition model is then implemented. Feature representation and classifier construction methods are introduced based on deep convolutional neural networks. Finally the experimental evaluation is carried out. Multi-aspect testings are performed with various model structures data augments training modes optimization methods and batch sizes. The influence of parameters recognitio efficiency and execution time are also analyzed. The results show that with a fine-tuned model the recognition rate of attributes metal type heating mode heating temperature heating duration cooling mode placing duration and relative humidity are 0.925 0.908 0.835 0.917 0.928 0.805 and 0.92 respectively. The proposed method recognizes the attribute of heated metal mark with preferable effect and it can be used in practical application.
