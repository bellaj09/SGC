"Capsule networks CapsNets a new class of deep neural network architectures proposed recently by Hinton et al. have shown a great performance in many fields particularly in image recognition and natural language processing. However CapsNets have not yet been applied to drug discovery-related studies. As the first attempt we in this investigation adopted CapsNets to develop classification models of hERG blockers/nonblockers; drugs with hERG blockade activity are thought to have a potential risk of cardiotoxicity. Two capsule network architectures were established: convolution-capsule network Conv-CapsNet and restricted Boltzmann machine-capsule networks RBM-CapsNet in which convolution and a restricted Boltzmann machine RBM were used as feature extractors respectively. Two prediction models of hERG blockers/nonblockers were then developed by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet with the Doddareddys training set composed of 2389 compounds. The established models showed excellent performance in an independent test set comprising 255 compounds with prediction accuracies of 91.8 and 92.2% for Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet models respectively. Various comparisons were also made between our models and those developed by other machine learning methods including deep belief network DBN convolutional neural network CNN multilayer perceptron MLP support vector machine SVM k-nearest neighbors kNN logistic regression LR and LightGBM and with different training sets. All the results showed that the models by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet are among the best classification models. Overall the excellent performance of capsule networks achieved in this investigation highlights their potential in drug discovery-related studies."
