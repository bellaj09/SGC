"Alzheimers disease AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Deep brain stimulation DBS has been used to treat a variety of brain disorders and shows promise in alleviating cognitive symptoms in some AD patients Laxton et al 2010. We previously showed that DBS of the entorhinal cortex EC enhances spatial memory formation in normal wild-type mice Stone et al 2011. Here we tested the effects of EC-DBS on the progressive cognitive deficits in a genetically-based mouse model of AD. TgCRND8 Tg transgenic mice express human amyloid precursor protein harboring the Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations. These mice exhibit age-related increases in A production plaque deposition as well as contextual fear and spatial memory impairments. Here we found EC stimulation in young mice 6 weeks old rescued the early contextual fear and spatial memory deficits and decreased subsequent plaque load in Tg mice. Moreover stimulation in older mice 6 months old was also sufficient to rescue the memory deficits in Tg mice. The memory enhancement induced by DBS emerged gradually over the course of weeks and was both persistent and specific to hippocampal-based memories. These results provide further support for the development of novel therapeutics aimed to resolve the cognitive decline and memory impairment in AD using DBS of hippocampal afferents."
