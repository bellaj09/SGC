"Neuron morphology is recognized as a key determinant of cell type yet the quantitative profiling of a mammalian neurons complete three-dimensional 3-D morphology remains arduous when the neuron has complex arborization and long projection. Whole-brain reconstruction of neuron morphology is even more challenging as it involves processing tens of teravoxels of imaging data. Validating such reconstructions is extremely laborious. We develop TeraVR an open-source virtual reality annotation system to address these challenges. TeraVR integrates immersive and collaborative 3-D visualization interaction and hierarchical streaming of teravoxel-scale images. Using TeraVR we have produced precise 3-D full morphology of long-projecting neurons in whole mouse brains and developed a collaborative workflow for highly accurate neuronal reconstruction." TeraVR empowers precise reconstruction of complete 3-D neuronal morphology in the whole brain.
