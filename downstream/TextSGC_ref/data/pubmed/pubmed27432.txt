Implantable neural probes that are mechanically compliant with brain tissue offer important opportunities for stable neural interfaces in both basic neuroscience and clinical applications. Here we developed a Neurotassel consisting of an array of flexible and high-aspect ratio microelectrode filaments. A Neurotassel can spontaneously assemble into a thin and implantable fiber through elastocapillary interactions when withdrawn from a molten tissue-dissolvable polymer. Chronically implanted Neurotassels elicited minimal neuronal cell loss in the brain and enabled stable activity recordings of the same population of neurons in mice learning to perform a task. Moreover Neurotassels can be readily scaled up to 1024 microelectrode filaments each with a neurite-scale cross-sectional footprint of 3  1.5 m2 to form implantable fibers with a total diameter of ~100 m. With their ultrasmall sizes high flexibility and scalability Neurotassels offer a new approach for stable neural activity recording and neuroprosthetics. Elastocapillary self-assembled neurotassels for stable neural activity recordings.
