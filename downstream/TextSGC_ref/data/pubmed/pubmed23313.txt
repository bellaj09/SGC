Although the effects of several personality factors on interpersonal space i.e. social space within personal comfort area are well documented it is not clear whether they also extend to peripersonal space i.e. reaching space. Indeed no study has directly compared these spaces in relation to personality and anxiety factors even though such a comparison would help to clarify to what extent they share similar mechanisms and characteristics. The aim of the present paper was to investigate whether personality dimensions and anxiety levels are associated with reaching and comfort distances. Seventy university students 35 females were administered the Big Five Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; afterwards they had to provide reachability- and comfort-distance judgments towards human confederates while standing still passive or walking towards them active. The correlation analyses showed that both spaces were positively related to anxiety and negatively correlated with the Dynamism in the active condition. Moreover in the passive condition higher Emotional Stability was related to shorter comfort distance while higher cognitive Openness was associated with shorter reachability distance. The implications of these results are discussed. The influence of anxiety and personality factors on comfort and reachability space: a correlational study.
