"Hyoid bone movement is an important physiological event during swallowing that contributes to normal swallowing function. In order to determine the adequate hyoid bone movement clinicians conduct an X-ray videofluoroscopic swallowing study which even though it is the gold-standard technique has limitations such as radiation exposure and cost. Here we demonstrated the ability to track the hyoid bone movement using a non-invasive accelerometry sensor attached to the surface of the human neck. Specifically deep neural networks were used to mathematically describe the relationship between hyoid bone movement and sensor signals. Training and validation of the system were conducted on a dataset of 400 swallows from 114 patients. Our experiments indicated the computer-aided hyoid bone movement prediction has a promising performance when compared with human experts judgements revealing that the universal pattern of the hyoid bone movement is acquirable by the highly nonlinear algorithm. Such a sensor-supported strategy offers an alternative and widely available method for online hyoid bone movement tracking without any radiation side-effects and provides a pronounced and flexible approach for identifying dysphagia and other swallowing disorders."
