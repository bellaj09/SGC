"Purpose In this study we examined the effects of virtual reality dance exercise on the balance activities of daily living and depressive disorder status of Parkinsons disease patients. Subjects Twenty patients were assigned either the experimental group n = 10 or the control group n = 10. All participants received 30 minutes of neurodevelopment treatment and 15 minutes of functional electrical stimulation 5 times per week for 6 weeks. The experimental group additionally performed 30 minutes of dance exercise. Balance activities of daily living and depressive disorder status were assessed before and after the 6-week treatment period using the Berg balance scale the Modified Barthel Index and the Beck Depression Inventory. The paired t-test was used to detect differences before and after treatment and the independent t-test was used to detect differences between the treatment groups. Results The values for balance activities of daily living and depressive disorder status significantly differed between before and after treatment in the experimental group and significantly differed between the experimental group and control group. Conclusion Virtual reality dance exercise has a positive effect on balance activities of daily living and depressive disorder status of Parkinsons disease patients."
