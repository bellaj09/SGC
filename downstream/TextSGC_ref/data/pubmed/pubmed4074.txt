The beneficial effects of meditation on preserving age-related changes in cognitive functioning are well established. Yet the neural underpinnings of these positive effects have not been fully unveiled. This study employed a prospective longitudinal design and graph-based analysis to study how an eight-week meditation training vs. relaxation training shaped network configuration at global intermediate and local levels using graph theory in the elderly. At the intermediate level meditation training lead to decreased intra-connectivity in the default mode network DMN salience network SAN and somatomotor network SMN modules post training. Also there was decreased connectivity strength between the DMN and other modules. At a local level meditation training lowered nodal strength in the left posterior cingulate gryus bilateral paracentral lobule and middle cingulate gyrus. According to previous literature the direction of these changes is consistent with a movement towards a more self-detached viewpoint as well as more efficient processing. Furthermore our findings highlight the importance of considering brain network changes across organizational levels as well as the pace at which these changes may occur. Overall this study provides further support for short-term meditation as a potentially beneficial method of mental training for the elderly that warrants further investigation. A longitudinal study of the effect of short-term meditation training on functional network organization of the aging brain.
