In this paper we propose a new dataset for outdoor depth estimation from single and stereo RGB images. The dataset was acquired from the point of view of a pedestrian. Currently the most novel approaches take advantage of deep learning-based techniques which have proven to outperform traditional state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Nonetheless these methods require large amounts of reliable ground-truth data. Despite there already existing several datasets that could be used for depth estimation almost none of them are outdoor-oriented from an egocentric point of view. Our dataset introduces a large number of high-definition pairs of color frames and corresponding depth maps from a human perspective. In addition the proposed dataset also features human interaction and great variability of data as shown in this work. UASOL a large-scale high-resolution outdoor stereo dataset.
