"While it is often claimed that virtual reality VR training system can offer self-directed and mentor-free skill learning using the systems performance metrics PM no studies have yet provided evidence-based confirmation. This experimental study investigated what extent to which trainees achieved their self-learning with a current VR simulator and whether additional mentoring improved skill learning skill transfer and cognitive workloads in robotic surgery simulation training." Can a virtual reality surgical simulation training provide a self-driven and mentor-free skills learning? Investigation of the practical influence of the performance metrics from the virtual reality robotic surgery simulator on the skill learning and associated cognitive workloads.
