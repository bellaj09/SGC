As virtual reality expands in popularity an increasingly diverse audience is gaining exposure to immersive virtual environments IVEs. A significant body of research has demonstrated how perception and action work in such environments but most of this work has been done studying adults. Less is known about how physical and cognitive development affect perception and action in IVEs particularly as applied to preteen and teenage children. Accordingly in the current study we assess how preteens children aged 8-12 years and teenagers children aged 15-18 years respond to mismatches between their motor behavior and the visual information presented by an IVE. Over two experiments we evaluate how these individuals recalibrate their actions across functionally distinct systems of movement. The first experiment analyzed forward walking recalibration after exposure to an IVE with either increased or decreased visual flow. Visual flow during normal bipedal locomotion was manipulated to be either twice or half as fast as the physical gait. The second experiment leveraged a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the effect of recalibration on throwing movement. In the first experiment our results show no differences across age groups although subjects generally experienced a post-exposure effect of shortened distance estimation after experiencing visually faster flow and longer distance estimation after experiencing visually slower flow. In the second experiment subjects generally showed the typical prism adaptation behavior of a throwing after-effect error. The error lasted longer for preteens than older children. Our results have implications for the design of virtual systems with children as a target audience.
