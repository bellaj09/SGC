Perioperative preparations such as operating room setup patient and equipment positioning and operating port placement are essential to operative success in minimally invasive surgery. We developed an immersive virtual reality-based training system REMIS to provide residents and other health professionals with training and evaluation in these perioperative skills. Our program uses the qualities of immersive VR that are available today for inclusion in an ongoing training curriculum for surgical residents. The current application consists of a primary platform for patient positioning for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Having completed this module we can create many different simulated problems for other procedures. As a part of the simulation we have devised a computer-driven real-time data collection system to help us in evaluating trainees and providing feedback during the simulation. The REMIS program trains and evaluates surgical residents and obviates the need to use expensive operating room and surgeon time. It also allows residents to train based on their schedule and does not put patients at increased risk. The method is standardized allows for repetition if needed evaluates individual performance provides the possible complications of incorrect choices provides training in 3-D environment and has the capability of being used for various scenarios and professions.
