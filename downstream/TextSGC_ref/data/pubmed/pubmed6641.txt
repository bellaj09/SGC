A typical time series in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI exhibits autocorrelation that is the samples of the time series are dependent. In addition temporal filtering one of the crucial steps in preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images induces its own autocorrelation. While performing connectivity analysis in fMRI the impact of the autocorrelation is largely ignored. Recently autocorrelation has been addressed by variance correction approaches which are sensitive to the sampling rate. In this article we aim to investigate the impact of the sampling rate on the variance correction approaches. Toward this end we first derived a generalized expression for the variance of the sample Pearson correlation coefficient SPCC in terms of the sampling rate and the filter cutoff frequency in addition to the autocorrelation and cross-covariance functions of the time series. Through simulations we illustrated the importance of the variance correction for a fixed sampling rate. Using the real resting state fMRI data sets we demonstrated that the data sets with higher sampling rates were more prone to false positives in agreement with the existing empirical reports. We further demonstrated with single subject results that for the data sets with higher sampling rates the variance correction strategy restored the integrity of true connectivity.
