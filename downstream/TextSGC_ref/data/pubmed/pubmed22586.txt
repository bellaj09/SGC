Despite their attractive properties networked virtual environments net-VEs are notoriously difficult to design implement and test due to the concurrency real-time and networking features in these systems. Net-VEs demand high quality-of-service QoS requirements on the network to maintain natural and real-time interactions among users. The current practice for net-VE design is basically trial and error empirical and totally lacks formal methods. This paper proposes to apply a Petri net formal modeling technique to a net-VE-NICE narrative immersive constructionist/collaborative environment predict the net-VE performance based on simulation and improve the net-VE performance. NICE is essentially a network of collaborative virtual reality systems called the CAVE-CAVE automatic virtual environment. First we introduce extended fuzzy-timing Petri net EFTN modeling and analysis techniques. Then we present EFTN models of the CAVE NICE and transport layer protocol used in NICE: transmission control protocol TCP. We show the possibility analysis based on the EFTN model for the CAVE. Then by using these models and design/CPN as the simulation tool we conducted various simulations to study real-time behavior network effects and performance latencies and jitters of NICE. Our simulation results are consistent with experimental data. Modeling and performance analysis using extended fuzzy-timing Petri nets for networked virtual environments.
