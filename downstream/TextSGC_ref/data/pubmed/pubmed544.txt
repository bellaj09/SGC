Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1000000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50000 deaths. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections. However the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood. Comparative replication and immune activation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human lungs: an ex vivo study with implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
