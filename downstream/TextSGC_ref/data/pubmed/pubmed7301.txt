Deep belief network DBN is an efficient learning model for unknown data representation especially nonlinear systems. However it is extremely hard to design a satisfactory DBN with a robust structure because of traditional dense representation. In addition backpropagation algorithm-based fine-tuning tends to yield poor performance since its ease of being trapped into local optima. In this article we propose a novel DBN model based on adaptive sparse restricted Boltzmann machines AS-RBM and partial least square PLS regression fine-tuning abbreviated as ARP-DBN to obtain a more robust and accurate model than the existing ones. First the adaptive learning step size is designed to accelerate an RBM training process and two regularization terms are introduced into such a process to realize sparse representation. Second initial weight derived from AS-RBM is further optimized via layer-by-layer PLS modeling starting from the output layer to input one. Third we present the convergence and stability analysis of the proposed method. Finally our approach is tested on Mackey-Glass time-series prediction 2-D function approximation and unknown system identification. Simulation results demonstrate that it has higher learning accuracy and faster learning speed. It can be used to build a more robust model than the existing ones.
