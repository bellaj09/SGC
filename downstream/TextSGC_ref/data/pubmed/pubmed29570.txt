Electroencephalography EEG captures electrophysiological signatures of cortical events from the scalp with high-dimensional electrode montages. Usually excessive sources produce outliers and potentially affect the actual event related sources. Besides EEG manifests inherent inter-subject variability of the brain dynamics at the resting state and/or under the performance of tasks caused probably due to the instantaneous fluctuation of psychophysiological states. A wavelet coherence WC analysis for optimally selecting associative inter-subject channels is proposed here and is being used to boost performances of motor imagery MI-based inter-subject brain computer interface BCI. The underlying hypothesis is that optimally associative inter-subject channels can reduce the effects of outliers and thus eliminate dissimilar cortical patterns. The proposed approach has been tested on the dataset IVa from BCI competition III including EEG data acquired from five healthy subjects who were given visual cues to perform 280 trials of MI for the right hand and right foot. Experimental results have shown increased classification accuracy 81.79% using the WC-based selected 16 channels compared to the one 56.79% achieved using all the available 118 channels. The associative channels lie mostly around the sensorimotor regions of the brain reinforced by the previous literature describing spatial brain dynamics during sensorimotor oscillations. Apparently the proposed approach paves the way for optimised EEG channel selection that could boost further the efficiency and real-time performance of BCI systems.
