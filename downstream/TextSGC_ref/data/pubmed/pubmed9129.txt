"A system that can detect the intention to move and decode the planned movement could help all those subjects that can plan motion but are unable to implement it. In this paper motor planning activity is investigated by using electroencephalographic EEG signals with the aim to decode motor preparation phases. A publicly available database of 61-channels EEG signals recorded from 15 healthy subjects during the execution of different movements elbow flexion/extension forearm pronation/supination hand open/close of the right upper limb was employed to generate a dataset of EEG epochs preceding resting and movements onset. A novel system is introduced for the classification of premovement vs resting and of premovement vs premovement epochs. For every epoch the proposed system generates a time-frequency TF map of every source signal in the motor cortex through beamforming and Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT then all the maps are embedded in a volume and used as input to a deep CNN. The proposed system succeeded in discriminating premovement from resting with an average accuracy of 90.3% min 74.6% max 100% outperforming comparable methods in the literature and in discriminating premovement vs premovement with an average accuracy of 62.47%. The achieved results encourage to investigate motor planning at source level in the time-frequency domain through deep learning approaches."
