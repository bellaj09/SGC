Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. This paper proposes an automated glaucoma screening method using retinal fundus images via the ensemble technique to fuse the results of different classification networks and the result of each classification network was fed as an input to a simple artificial neural network ANN to obtain the final result. Three public datasets i.e. ORIGA-650 RIM-ONE R3 and DRISHTI-GS were used for training and evaluating the performance of the proposed network. The experimental results showed that the proposed network outperformed other state-of-art glaucoma screening algorithms with AUC of 0.94. Our proposed algorithms showed promising potential as a medical support system for glaucoma screening especially in low resource countries.
