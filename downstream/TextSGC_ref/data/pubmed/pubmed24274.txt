"Since the mid-1950s neurosurgery has benefited from the remarkable progress due to tremendous advances in neuroimaging techniques neuroanesthesia neurostimulation and brain-computer interfaces as well as breakthroughs in operating microscopes and surgical instruments. Yet this specialty has to do with delicate human structures and is hence considered as highly risky by insurance companies. In France although neurosurgerys casualty rate 6% is lower than in other specialties the number of legal prosecutions has increased since 2002 because of easier access to medicolegal procedures.
