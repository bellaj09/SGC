The brain can be considered as an information processing network where complex behavior manifests as a result of communication between large-scale functional systems such as visual and default mode networks. As the communication between brain regions occurs through underlying anatomical pathways it is important to define a "traffic pattern" that properly describes how the regions exchange information. Empirically the choice of the traffic pattern can be made based on how well the functional connectivity between regions matches the structural pathways equipped with that traffic pattern. In this paper we present a multimodal connectomics paradigm utilizing graph matching to measure similarity between structural and functional connectomes derived from dMRI and fMRI data at node system and connectome level. Through an investigation of the brain\s structure-function relationship over a large cohort of 641 healthy developmental participants aged 8-22 years we demonstrate that communicability as the traffic pattern describes the functional connectivity of the brain best with large-scale systems having significant agreement between their structural and functional connectivity patterns. Notably matching between structural and functional connectivity for the functionally specialized modular systems such as visual and motor networks are higher as compared to other more integrated systems. Additionally we show that the negative functional connectivity between the default mode network DMN and motor frontoparietal attention and visual networks is significantly associated with its underlying structural connectivity highlighting the counterbalance between functional activation patterns of DMN and other systems. Finally we investigated sex difference and developmental changes in brain and observed that similarity between structure and function changes with development.
