Classification systems such as ICD-10 for diagnoses or the Swiss Operation Classification System CHOP for procedure classification in the clinical treatment are essential for clinical management and information exchange. Traditionally classification codes are assigned manually or by systems that rely upon concept-based or rule-based classification methods. Such methods can reach their limit easily due to the restricted coverage of handcrafted rules and of the vocabulary in underlying terminological systems. Conventional machine learning approaches normally depend on selected features within a human annotated training set. However it is quite laborious to obtain a well labeled data set and its generation can easily be influenced by accumulative errors caused by human factors. To overcome this we will present our processing pipeline for query matching realized through neural networks within the task of medical procedure classification. The pipeline is built upon convolutional neural networks CNN and autoencoder with logistic regression. On the task of relevance determination between query and category text the autoencoder based method has achieved a micro F1 score of 70.29% while the convolutional based method has reached a micro F1 score of 60.86% with high efficiency. These two algorithms are compared in experiments with different configurations and baselines SVM logistic regression with respect to their suitability for the task of automatic encoding. Advantages and limitations are discussed. Towards automatic encoding of medical procedures using convolutional neural networks and autoencoders.
