Deep learning DL-based semantic segmentation methods have been providing state-of-the-art performance in the past few years. More specifically these techniques have been successfully applied in medical image classification segmentation and detection tasks. One DL technique U-Net has become one of the most popular for these applications. We propose a recurrent U-Net model and a recurrent residual U-Net model which are named RU-Net and R2U-Net respectively. The proposed models utilize the power of U-Net residual networks and recurrent convolutional neural networks. There are several advantages to using these proposed architectures for segmentation tasks. First a residual unit helps when training deep architectures. Second feature accumulation with recurrent residual convolutional layers ensures better feature representation for segmentation tasks. Third it allows us to design better U-Net architectures with the same number of network parameters with better performance for medical image segmentation. The proposed models are tested on three benchmark datasets such as blood vessel segmentation in retinal images skin cancer segmentation and lung lesion segmentation. The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to equivalent models including a variant of a fully connected convolutional neural network called SegNet U-Net and residual U-Net.
