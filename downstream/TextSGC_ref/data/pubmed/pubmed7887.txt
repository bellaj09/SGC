When a satellite performs complex tasks such as discarding a payload or capturing a non-cooperative target it will encounter sudden changes in the attitude and mass parameters causing unstable flying and rolling of the satellite. In such circumstances the change of the movement and mass characteristics are unpredictable. Thus the traditional attitude control methods are unable to stabilize the satellite since they are dependent on the mass parameters of the controlled object. In this paper we proposed a reinforcement learning method to re-stabilize the attitude of a satellite under such circumstances. Specifically we discretize the continuous control torque and build a neural network model that can output the discretized control torque to control the satellite. A dynamics simulation environment of the satellite is built and the deep Q Network algorithm is then performed to train the neural network in this simulation environment. The reward of the training is the stabilization of the satellite. Simulation experiments illustrate that with the iteration of training progresses the neural network model gradually learned to re-stabilize the attitude of a satellite after unknown disturbance. As a contrast the traditional PD Proportion Differential controller was unable to re-stabilize the satellite due to its dependence on the mass parameters. The proposed method adopts self-learning to control satellite attitudes shows considerable intelligence and certain universality and has a strong application potential for future intelligent control of satellites performing complex space tasks.
