Underwater inherent optical properties IOPs are the fundamental clues to many research fields such as marine optics marine biology and underwater vision. Currently beam transmissometers and optical sensors are considered as the ideal IOPs measuring methods. But these methods are inflexible and expensive to be deployed. To overcome this problem we aim to develop a novel measuring method using only a single underwater image with the help of deep artificial neural network. The power of artificial neural network has been proved in image processing and computer vision fields with deep learning technology. However image-based IOPs estimation is a quite different and challenging task. Unlike the traditional applications such as image classification or localization IOP estimation looks at the transparency of the water between the camera and the target objects to estimate multiple optical properties simultaneously. In this paper we propose a novel Depth Aided DA deep neural network structure for IOPs estimation based on a single RGB image that is even noisy. The imaging depth information is considered as an aided input to help our model make better decision. Underwater Inherent Optical Properties Estimation Using a Depth Aided Deep Neural Network.
