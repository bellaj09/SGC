Many neuroscience faculty assign readings from the textbook or primary literature to their students. What can we learn from research about how many of the students actually "do" the reading and of those who do it comprehend what they read? This article presents findings from studies on college student compliance with and comprehension of assigned readings and offers research-based strategies for motivating students to complete the readings in ways that promote deep learning. Faculty are encouraged not only to ask about the role that reading plays in undergraduate learning but also the role that they themselves play in developing college student reading proficiencies.
