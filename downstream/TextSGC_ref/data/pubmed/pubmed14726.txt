Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography EEG provides a portable low cost measure of brain dynamics it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or "components" derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects generating the event-related potential ERP. First we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features i.e. frequency decomposition time-frequency decomposition filtering based on data-driven properties i.e. blind source separation BSS and generating more abstract representations of data e.g. using deep learning. We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks including the drift diffusion model DDM and reinforcement learning RL approaches. Next we discuss ways to access associations among these measures including statistical models data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models HBMs. We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.
