Advances in computing specifically those used for simulation and games technology has allowed for exciting developments in dental and surgical education. At the same time concerns are being raised that students with relatively little training practise to improve their skill on patients with all of the inherent risks that may occur. Simulation in dentistry has been practised for many years and so the concept is not new to the profession. New tools have been developed that both enhance teaching and learning and are also useful for assessment of students and trainees. The challenge of virtual and simulated reality tools is to have the required fidelity to improve teaching and learning outcomes over the currently utilized methodology. The use of virtual reality tools in surgical education.
