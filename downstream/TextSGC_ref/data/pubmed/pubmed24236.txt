We report on a pilot study that investigates the transfer effect of systematic computer game training on performance in image guided surgery. In a group of 22 surgical novices subjects were matched and randomized into one group training with a 3-D first person shooter FPS game and one group training with a 2-D non-FPS game. We also included a control group. Subjects were tested pre- and post training in the MIST-VR and GI-Mentor surgical simulators. We found that subjects with past experience specific to FPS games were significantly better in performing the simulated endoscopy task both regarding time and efficiency of screening compared to subjects lacking FPS game experience. Furthermore subjects who underwent systematic FPS game training performed better in the MIST-VR than those training with a 2-D game. Our findings indicate a transfer effect and that experience of video games are important for training outcome in simulated surgical procedures. Video game training can become useful when designing future skills training curricula for surgeons.
