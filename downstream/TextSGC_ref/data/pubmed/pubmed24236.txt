Brain-machine interfaces BMIs must be carefully designed for closed-loop control to ensure the best possible performance. The Kalman filter KF is a recursive linear BMI algorithm which has been shown to smooth cursor kinematics and improve control over non-recursive linear methods. However recursive estimators are not without their drawbacks. Here we show that recursive decoders can decrease BMI controllability by coupling kinematic variables that the subject might expect to be unrelated. For instance a 2D neural cursor where velocity is controlled using a KF can increase the difficulty of straight reaches by linking horizontal and vertical velocity estimates. These effects resemble force fields in arm control. Analysis of experimental data from one non-human primate controlling a position/velocity KF cursor in closed-loop shows that the presence of these force-field effects correlated with decreased performance. We designed a modified KF parameter estimation algorithm to eliminate these effects. Cursor controllability improved significantly when our modifications were used in a closed-loop BMI simulator. Thus designing highly controllable BMIs requires parameter estimation techniques that carefully craft relationships between decoded variables.
