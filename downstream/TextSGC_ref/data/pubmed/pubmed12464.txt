Liver and hepatic tumor segmentation remains a challenging problem in Computer Tomography CT images analysis due to its shape variation and vague boundary. The general hypothesis says that deep learning methods produce improved results on medical image segmentation. This paper formulates the segmentation of liver tumor in CT abdominal images as a classification problem and then solves it using a cascaded classifier framework based on deep convolutional neural networks. Two deep encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks EDCNN were constructed and trained to cascade segments of both the liver and lesions in CT images with limited image quantity. In other words an EDCNN segments the liver image as the input for the training of a second EDCNN. The second EDCNN then segments the tumor regions within the liver ROI regions as predicted by the first EDCNN. Segmenting the hepatic tumor inside the liver ROI also significantly reduces false-positives. The proposed model was then tested using a public dataset 3DIRCADb and several metrics were used in order to quantitatively evaluate its performance. The proposed method produced an average DICE score of 95.22% for the test set of CT images. The proposed method was then compared with some of the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed EDCNN achieved improved performance in segmentation accuracy over some existing methods.
