One of the promising options for motion management in radiation therapy RT is the use of LINAC-compatible robotic-arm-mounted ultrasound imaging system due to its high soft tissue contrast real-time capability absence of ionizing radiation and low cost. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel deep learning-based real-time motion tracking strategy for ultrasound image-guided RT. Attention-aware fully convolutional neural network with convolutional long short-term memory network for ultrasound-based motion tracking.
