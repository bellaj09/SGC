Geometric features such as the topological and manifold properties are utilized to extract geometric properties. Geometric methods that exploit the applications of geometrics e.g. geometric features are widely used in computer graphics and computer vision problems. This review presents a literature review on geometric concepts geometric methods and their applications in human-related analysis e.g. human shape analysis human pose analysis and human action analysis. This review proposes to categorize geometric methods based on the scope of the geometric properties that are extracted: object-oriented geometric methods feature-oriented geometric methods and routine-based geometric methods. Considering the broad applications of deep learning methods this review also studies geometric deep learning which has recently become a popular topic of research. Validation datasets are collected and method performances are collected and compared. Finally research trends and possible research topics are discussed.
