Among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia approximately 20%-33% are recognized as treatment-resistant schizophrenia TRS patients. These TRS patients suffer more severely from the disease but struggle to benefit from existing antipsychotic treatments. A few recent studies suggested that schizophrenia may be caused by impaired synaptic plasticity that manifests as functional dysconnectivity in the brain however few of those studies focused on the functional connectivity changes in the brains of TRS groups. In this study we compared the whole brain connectivity variations in TRS patients their unaffected siblings and healthy controls. Connectivity network features between and within the 116 automated anatomical labeling AAL brain regions were calculated and compared using maps created with three contrasts: patient vs. control patient vs. sibling and sibling vs. Three dysconnectivity patterns in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings.
