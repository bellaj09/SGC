Vortex modeling can produce attractive visual effects of dynamic fluids which are widely applicable for dynamic media computer games special effects and virtual reality systems. However it is challenging to effectively simulate intensive and fine detailed fluids such as smoke with fast increasing vortex filaments and smoke particles. The authors propose a novel vortex filaments in grids scheme in which the uniform grids dynamically bridge the vortex filaments and smoke particles for scalable fine smoke simulation with macroscopic vortex structures. Using the vortex model their approach supports the trade-off between simulation speed and scale of details. After computing the whole velocity external control can be easily exerted on the embedded grid to guide the vortex-based smoke motion. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of using the proposed scheme for a visually plausible smoke simulation with macroscopic vortex structures.
