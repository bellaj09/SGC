In recent years the detection of voluntary motor intentions from electroencephalogram EEG has been used for triggering external devices in closed-loop brain-computer interface BCI research. Movement-related cortical potentials MRCP a type of slow cortical potentials have been recently used for detection. In order to enhance the efficacy of closed-loop BCI systems based on MRCPs a manifold method called Locality Preserving Projection followed by a linear discriminant analysis LDA classifier LPP-LDA is proposed in this paper to detect MRCPs from scalp EEG in real time. In an online experiment on nine healthy subjects LPP-LDA statistically outperformed the classic matched filter approach with greater true positive rate 79  11% versus 68  10%; p = 0.007 and less false positives 1.4  0.8/min versus 2.3  1.1/min; p = 0.016 . Moreover the proposed system performed detections with significantly shorter latency 315  165 ms versus 460  123 ms; p = 0.013 which is a fundamental characteristics to induce neuroplastic changes in closed-loop BCIs following the Hebbian principle. In conclusion the proposed system works as a generic brain switch with high accuracy low latency and easy online implementation. It can thus be used as a fundamental element of BCI systems for neuromodulation and motor function rehabilitation. Enhanced low-latency detection of motor intention from EEG for closed-loop brain-computer interface applications.
