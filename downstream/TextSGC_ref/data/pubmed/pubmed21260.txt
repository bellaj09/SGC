"Virtual reality exposure VRE has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of anxiety disorders including social phobia. Presence or the level of connection an individual feels with the virtual environment is widely discussed as a critical construct both for the experience of anxiety within a virtual environment and for a successful response to VRE. Two published studies show that whereas generalized presence relates to fear ratings during VRE it does not relate to treatment response. However presence has been conceptualized as multidimensional with three primary factors spatial presence involvement and realness. These factors can be linked to other research on the facilitation of fear during exposure inhibitors of treatment response e.g. distraction and more recent theoretical discussions of the mechanisms of exposure therapy such as Boutons description of expectancy violation. As such one or more of these components of presence may be more strongly associated with the experience of fear during VRE and treatment response than the overarching construct. The current study N=41 evaluated relations between three theorized components of presence fear ratings during VRE and treatment response for VRE for social phobia. Results suggest that total presence and realness subscale scores were related to in-session peak fear ratings. However only scores on the involvement subscale significantly predicted treatment response. Implications of these findings are discussed." Does engagement with exposure yield better outcomes? Components of presence as a predictor of treatment response for virtual reality exposure therapy for social phobia.
