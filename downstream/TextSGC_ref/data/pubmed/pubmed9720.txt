We present a machine learning-based method for tomographic reconstruction of dense layered objects with range of projection angles limited to Formula: see text Whereas previous approaches to phase tomography generally require 2 steps first to retrieve phase projections from intensity projections and then to perform tomographic reconstruction on the retrieved phase projections in our work a physics-informed preprocessor followed by a deep neural network DNN conduct the 3-dimensional reconstruction directly from the intensity projections. We demonstrate this single-step method experimentally in the visible optical domain on a scaled-up integrated circuit phantom. We show that even under conditions of highly attenuated photon fluxes a DNN trained only on synthetic data can be used to successfully reconstruct physical samples disjoint from the synthetic training set. Thus the need for producing a large number of physical examples for training is ameliorated. The method is generally applicable to tomography with electromagnetic or other types of radiation at all bands.
