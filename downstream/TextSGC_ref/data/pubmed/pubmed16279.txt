Virtual reality VR technology is altering the health care environment and is changing the options that are available to therapists. This study describes how a haptic device was used as a cinematic assessment utility. Three chronic stroke inpatients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital with left hemisphere damage were assessed. The patients were administered by the box and block manual dexterity test. For comparisons a reference group was added to the study. Several parameters including time speed and movement of the right upper extremity were extracted and evaluated. The results indicate that the system shows potential as an assessment device. The feasibility study setup is working well as is the assessment method. Further research testing refinement of the exercises and use of VR and haptics within neurological rehabilitation are suggested. Virtual reality and haptics as an assessment device in the postacute phase after stroke.
