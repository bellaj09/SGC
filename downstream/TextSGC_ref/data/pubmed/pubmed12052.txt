Multi-atlas segmentation approach is one of the most widely-used image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. There are two major challenges in this category of methods i.e. atlas selection and label fusion. In this paper we propose a novel multi-atlas segmentation method that formulates multi-atlas segmentation in a deep learning framework for better solving these challenges. The proposed method dubbed deep fusion net DFN is a deep architecture that integrates a feature extraction subnet and a non-local patch-based label fusion NL-PLF subnet in a single network. The network parameters are learned by end-to-end training for automatically learning deep features that enable optimal performance in a NL-PLF framework. The learned deep features are further utilized in defining a similarity measure for atlas selection. By evaluating on two public cardiac MR datasets of SATA-13 and LV-09 for left ventricle segmentation our approach achieved 0.833 in averaged Dice metric ADM on SATA-13 dataset and 0.95 in ADM for epicardium segmentation on LV-09 dataset comparing favorably with the other automatic left ventricle segmentation methods. We also tested our approach on Cardiac Atlas Project CAP testing set of MICCAI 2013 SATA Segmentation Challenge and our method achieved 0.815 in ADM ranking highest at the time of writing.
