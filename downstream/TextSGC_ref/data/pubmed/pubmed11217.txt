Successful outcomes of surgical cancer resection necessitate negative cancer-free surgical margins. Currently tissue samples are sent to pathology for diagnostic confirmation. Hyperspectral imaging HSI is an emerging non-contact optical imaging technique. A reliable optical method could serve to diagnose and biopsy specimens in real-time. Using convolutional neural networks CNNs as a tissue classifier we developed a method to use HSI to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo surgical specimens collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Training and testing on samples from different patients the CNN can distinguish squamous cell carcinoma SCCa from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the curve AUC of 0.82 81% accuracy 81% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Additionally normal oral tissues can be sub-classified into epithelium muscle and glandular mucosa using a decision tree method with an average AUC of 0.94 90% accuracy 93% sensitivity and 89% specificity. After separately training on thyroid tissue the CNN differentiates between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95 92% accuracy 92% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Moreover the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multi-nodular goiter MNG with an AUC of 0.93 87% accuracy 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from benign MNG with an AUC of 0.91 86% accuracy 86% sensitivity and 86% specificity. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multi-category diagnostic information for normal head-and-neck tissue SCCa and thyroid carcinomas. More patient data are needed in order to fully investigate the proposed technique to establish reliability and generalizability of the work.
