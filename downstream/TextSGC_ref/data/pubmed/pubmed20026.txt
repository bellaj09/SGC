Important challenges confronting DOD/military medical care are that of maintaining or increasing quality of care and increasing the effectiveness of treatments for warriors diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD secondary to their combat deployments to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. Virtual Reality Graded Exposure Therapy with Arousal Control VR-GET has demonstrated a positive treatment effectiveness resulting in significant reductions of PTSD symptom severity. This positive treatment effectiveness has been maintained for up to 22 weeks after VR-GET therapy was completed. A robust methodology for the assessment of Virtual Reality efficacy suggests that the ideal time for follow-up begins at twelve months. Others have suggested that follow-up should occur between two and four years post treatment. In this report we describe the outcome of VR-GET for the treatment of combat-related PTSD with three warriors between five and seven years following their having completed treatment. Virtual reality graded exposure therapy with arousal control for the treatment of combat related posttraumatic stress disorder: a follow up case series.
