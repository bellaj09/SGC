"Neuromodulation consists in altering brain activity to restore mental and physical functions in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain and spinal cord injuries. This can be achieved by delivering electrical stimulation that excites or inhibits neural tissue by using electrical signals in the brain to move computer cursors or robotic arms or by displaying brain activity to subjects who regulate that activity by their own responses to it. As enabling prostheses deep-brain stimulation and brain-computer interfaces BCIs are forms of extended embodiment that become integrated into the individuals conception of himself as an autonomous agent. In BCIs and neurofeedback the success or failure of the techniques depends on the interaction between the learner and the trainer. The restoration of agency and autonomy through neuromodulation thus involves neurophysiological psychological and social factors." Neuromodulation agency and autonomy.
