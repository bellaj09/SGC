Considerable progress has been made in the development of three-dimensional temporal bone virtual reality simulators. However very little attention has been paid to interactive simulation of middle ear surgery including myringotomy. As the development of technical skills for middle ear surgery has a steep learning curve this poses inherent risks to patients during the skills acquisition phase. The benefit of simulation training in the acquisition of surgical skills has been demonstrated with previous low-fidelity models. Tactile sensation is an important feedback mechanism in middle ear surgery so a three-dimensional virtual reality myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback was developed at The University of Western Ontario. Development and face validity testing of a three-dimensional myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback.
