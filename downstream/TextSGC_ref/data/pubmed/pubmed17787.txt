Investigators have looked at the effect of night call on surgical residents but not at learning of laparoscopic skills. The Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality MIST-VR tests 6 tasks similar to a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We hypothesized that night call would impair laparoscopic performance and that skills would not improve but rather deteriorate after night call. Seventeen volunteers were tested before and after night call. Data collected included economy of movement time and number of errors for each hand/foot. A paired Student t test was used for statistical analysis. On the first 2 tasks there was an improvement in all parameters post-call with significance reached in 5 of 18 parameters P<or=.05. In the "running of the bowel\\ 8 of 9 parameters were significantly improved P<or=.05. In the final task 9 of 11 parameters showed a deterioration post-call but only economy of movement of the foot was significant P<or=.05. Most parameters 16 showed improvement rather than deterioration post-call which is consistent with learning of laparoscopic skills despite lack of sleep from night call. Night call does not impair learning of laparoscopic skills.
