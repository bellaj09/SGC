"Assimilating the diagnosis complete spinal cord injury SCI takes time and is not easy as patients know that there is no cure at the present time. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs can facilitate daily living. However inter-subject variability demands measurements with potential user groups and an understanding of how they differ to healthy users BCIs are more commonly tested with. Thus a three-class motor imagery MI screening left hand right hand feet was performed with a group of 10 able-bodied and 16 complete spinal-cord-injured people paraplegics tetraplegics with the objective of determining what differences were present between the user groups and how they would impact upon the ability of these user groups to interact with a BCI." Motor imagery-induced EEG patterns in individuals with spinal cord injury and their impact on brain-computer interface accuracy.
