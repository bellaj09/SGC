Fear reactions in phobic patients can be activated by specific perceptual cues C or by conceptual fear-related information I. An earlier study with spider phobic participants documented that perceptual stimuli are particularly potent to trigger fear responses. Because fear of spiders is activated by very circumscribed stimuli we set out to investigate whether another phobia with more contextual fear-elicitation i.e. a situational phobia would yield similar patterns. Thus we investigate the two paths of fear activation cues vs. information and fear reduction during exposure in claustrophobic patients. Influence of perceptual cues and conceptual information on the activation and reduction of claustrophobic fear.
