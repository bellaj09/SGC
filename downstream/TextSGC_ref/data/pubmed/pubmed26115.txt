The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain computer interfaces BCIs for rehabilitation of gait. While the feasibility of a closed-loop BCI system for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a virtual reality BCI-VR environment has yet to be demonstrated. In this study we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography EEG during treadmill walking to control the walking movements of a virtual avatar. Moreover virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations which involved cortical adaptations. These findings have implications for the development of BCI-VR systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI system.
