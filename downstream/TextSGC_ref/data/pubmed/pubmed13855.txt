Automatic extraction of adverse drug effect ADE mentions from biomedical texts is a challenging research problem that has attracted significant attention from the pharmacovigilance and biomedical text mining communities. Indeed deep learning based methods have recently been employed to solve this issue with great success. However they fail to effectively identify the boundary of mentions. In this paper we propose a weighted online recurrent extreme learning machine WOR-ELM based method to overcome this drawback. An adverse drug effect mentions extraction method based on weighted online recurrent extreme learning machine.
