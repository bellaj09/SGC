Optical technologies offering electrically tunable optical power have found a broad range of applications from head-mounted displays for virtual and augmented reality applications to microscopy. In this paper we present a novel design and prototype of a digitally switchable multi-focal lens MFL that offers the capability of rapidly switching the optical power of the system among multiple foci. It consists of a freeform singlet and a customized programmable optical shutter array POSA. Time-multiplexed multiple foci can be obtained by electrically controlling the POSA to switch the light path through different segments of the freeform singlet rapidly. While this method can be applied to a broad range of imaging and display systems we experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype for a multi-foci imaging system.
