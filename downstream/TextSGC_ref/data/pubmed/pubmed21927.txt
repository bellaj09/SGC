Loss of vision alters the day to day life of blind individuals and may impose a significant burden on their family and the economy. Cortical visual prosthetics have been shown to have the potential of restoring a useful degree of vision via stimulation of primary visual cortex. Due to current advances in electrode design and wireless power and data transmission development of these prosthetics has gained momentum in the past few years and multiple sites around the world are currently developing and testing their designs. In this review we briefly outline the visual prosthetic approaches and describe the history of cortical visual prosthetics. Next we focus on the state of the art of cortical visual prosthesis by briefly explaining the design of current devices that are either under development or in the clinical testing phase. Lastly we shed light on the challenges of each design and provide some potential solutions. Brain Machine Interfaces for Vision Restoration: The Current State of Cortical Visual Prosthetics.
