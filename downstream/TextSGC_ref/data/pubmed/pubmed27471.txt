Electrodes serve as the first critical interface to the biological organ system. In neuroprosthetic applications for example electrodes interface to the tissue for either signal recording or tissue stimulation. In this review we consider electrodes for recording neural activity. Recording electrodes serve as wiretaps into the neural tissues providing readouts of electrical activity. These signals give us valuable insights into the organization and functioning of the nervous system. The recording interfaces have also shown promise in aiding treatment of motor and sensory disabilities caused by neurological disorders. Recent advances in fabrication technology have generated wide interest in creating tiny high-density electrode interfaces for neural tissues. An ideal electrode should be small enough and be able to achieve reliable and conformal integration with the structures of the nervous system. As a result the existing electrode designs are being shrunk and packed to form small form factor interfaces to tissue. Here an overview of the historic and state-of-the-art electrode technologies for recording neural activity is presented first with a focus on their development road map. The fact that the dimensions of recording electrode sites are being scaled down from micron to submicron scale to enable dense interfaces is appreciated. The current trends in recording electrode technologies are then reviewed. Current and future considerations in electrode design including the use of inorganic nanostructures and biologically inspired or biocomapatible materials are discussed along with an overview of the applications of flexible materials and transistor transduction schemes. Finally we detail the major technical challenges facing chronic use of reliable recording electrode technology.
