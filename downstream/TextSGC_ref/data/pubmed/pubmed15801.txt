Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration AMD is a highly effective advance in the retinal armentarium. OCT offering 3-dimensional imaging of the retina is widely used to guide treatment. Although poor outcomes reported from clinical practice are multifactorial availability of reliable reproducible and quantitative evaluation tools to accurately measure the fluid response that is a "VEGF meter" may be a better means of monitoring and treating than the current purely qualitative evaluation used in clinical practice.
