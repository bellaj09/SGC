As a typical cyber-physical system 3D printing has developed very fast in recent years. There is a strong demand for mass customization such as printing dental crowns. However the accuracy of the 3D printed objects is low compared with traditional methods. The main reason is that the model to be printed is arbitrary and usually the quantity is small. The deformation is affected by the shape of the object and there is a lack of a universal method for the error compensation. It is neither easy nor economical to perform the compensation manually. In this paper we present a framework for the automatic error compensation. We obtain the shape by technologies such as 3D scanning. And we use the "3D deep learning" method to train a deep neural network. For a specific task such as dental crown printing the network can learn the function of deformation when a large amount of data is used for training. To the best of our knowledge this is the first application of the deep neural network to the error compensation in 3D printing. And we propose the "inverse function network" to compensate for the error. We use four types of deformations of the dental crowns to verify the performance of the neural network: 1 translation; 2 scaling up; 3 scaling down; and 4 rotation. The convolutional AutoEncoder structure is employed for the end-to-end learning. The experiments show that the network can predict and compensate for the error well. By introducing the new method we can improve the accuracy with little need for increasing the hardware cost. A Learning-Based Framework for Error Compensation in 3D Printing.
