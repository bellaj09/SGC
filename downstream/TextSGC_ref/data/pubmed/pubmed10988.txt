The cardiac radiation dose is an important predictor of cardiac toxicity and overall survival OS for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC. However radiation-induced cardiac toxicity among patients with early-stage NSCLC who have undergone stereotactic ablative radiotherapy SABR has been less well-characterized. Our objective was to assess the associations between cardiac radiation dosimetry and OS in patients with early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR.
