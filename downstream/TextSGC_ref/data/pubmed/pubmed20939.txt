In our protocol for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorders we use Virtual reality VR to facilitate emotional regulation and the relaxation process. Using a biofeedback biomonitoring system GSR HR Thermal the patient is made aware of his or her reactions through the modification of some features of the VR environment in real time. Using mental exercises the patient learns to control these physiological parameters and using the feedback provided by the virtual environment is able to gauge his or her success. To test this concept we planned a randomized controlled trial NCT00602212 including three groups of 15 patients each for a total of 45 patients: 1 the VR group 2 the non-VR group and 3 the waiting list WL group. The use of biofeedback in clinical virtual reality: the intrepid project.
