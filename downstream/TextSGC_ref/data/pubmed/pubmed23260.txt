Pulse!! The Virtual Clinical Learning Lab at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi in collaboration with the United States Navy has developed a model for research and technological development that they believe is an essential element in the future of military and civilian medical education. The Pulse!! project models a strategy for providing cross-disciplinary expertise and resources to educational governmental and business entities challenged with meeting looming health care crises. It includes a three-dimensional virtual learning platform that provides unlimited repeatable immersive clinical experiences without risk to patients and is available anywhere there is a computer. Pulse!! utilizes expertise in the fields of medicine medical education computer science software engineering physics computer animation art and architecture. Lab scientists collaborate with the commercial virtual-reality simulation industry to produce research-based learning platforms based on cutting-edge computer technology. Pulse!!: a model for research and development of virtual-reality learning in military medical education and training.
