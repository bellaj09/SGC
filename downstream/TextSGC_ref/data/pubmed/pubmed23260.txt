The time between the onset of subsequent auditory or visual stimuli - also known as stimulus onset asynchrony SOA - determines many of the event-related potential characteristics of the resulting evoked brain signals. Specifically the SOA value influences the performance of an individual subject in brain-computer interface BCI applications like spellers. In the past subject-specific optimization of the SOA was rarely considered in BCI studies. Our research strives to reduce the time requirements of individual BCI stimulus parameter optimization. This work contributes to this goal in two ways. First we show that even the classification performance on extremely reduced training data subsets reveals the influence of SOA. Second we show that these noisy estimates are sufficient to make decisions for individual choices of the SOA that transfer to good classification performance on large training data sets. Thus our work contributes to individually tailored SOA selection procedures for BCI users. Extremely Reduced Data Sets Indicate Optimal Stimulation Parameters for Classification in Brain-Computer Interfaces.
