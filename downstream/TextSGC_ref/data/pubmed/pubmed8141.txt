"Prognostication for comatose patients after cardiac arrest is a difficult but essential task. Currently visual interpretation of electroencephalogram EEG is one of the main modality used in outcome prediction. There is a growing interest in computer-assisted EEG interpretation either to overcome the possible subjectivity of visual interpretation or to identify complex features of the EEG signal. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network CNN to predict functional outcome based on 19-channel-EEG recorded from 267 adult comatose patients during targeted temperature management after CA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC on the test set was 0.885. Interestingly model architecture and fine-tuning only played a marginal role in classification performance. We then used gradient-weighted class activation mapping Grad-CAM as visualization technique to identify which EEG features were used by the network to classify an EEG epoch as favorable or unfavorable outcome and also to understand failures of the network. Grad-CAM showed that the network relied on similar features than classical visual analysis for predicting unfavorable outcome suppressed background epileptiform transients. This study confirms that CNNs are promising models for EEG-based prognostication in comatose patients and that Grad-CAM can provide explanation for the models decision-making which is of utmost importance for future use of deep learning models in a clinical setting."
