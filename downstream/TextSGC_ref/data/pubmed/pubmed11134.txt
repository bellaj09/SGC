A lightweight convolutional deep neural networks CNNs based modulation format identification MFI scheme in 2D Stokes planes for polarization domain multiplexing PDM fiber communication system is proposed and demonstrated. Influences of the learning rate of CNN is discussed. Experimental verifications are performed for the PDM system at a symbol rate of 28GBaud. Six modulation formats are identified with a trained CNN from images of received signals. They are PDM-BPSK PDM-QPSK PDM-8PSK PDM-16QAM PDM-32QAM and PDM-64QAM. By taking advantage of computer vision the results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification performance over the existing techniques.
