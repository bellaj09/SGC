Spectrum sensing is one of the technologies that is used to solve the current problem of low utilization of spectrum resources. However when the signal-to-noise ratio is low current spectrum sensing methods cannot well-handle a situation in which the prior information of the licensed user signal is lacking. In this paper a blind spectrum sensing method based on deep learning is proposed that uses three kinds of neural networks together namely convolutional neural networks long short-term memory and fully connected neural networks. Experiments show that the proposed method has better performance than an energy detector especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. At the same time this paper also analyzes the effect of different long short-term memory layers on detection performance and explores why the deep-learning-based detector can achieve better performance.
