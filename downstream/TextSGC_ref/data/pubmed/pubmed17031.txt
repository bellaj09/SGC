Virtual reality offers a good possibility for the implementation of real-life tasks in a laboratory-based training or testing scenario. Thus a computerized training in a driving simulator offers an ecological valid training approach. Visual attention had an influence on driving performance so we used the reverse approach to test the influence of a driving training on visual attention and executive functions. Thirty-seven healthy older participants mean age: 71.46\u2009\u20094.09; gender: 17 men and 20 women took part in our controlled experimental study. We examined transfer effects from a four-week driving training three times per week on visual attention executive function and motor skill. Effects were analyzed using an analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Therefore main factors were group and time to show training-related benefits of our intervention. Results revealed improvements for the intervention group in divided visual attention; however there were benefits neither in the other cognitive domains nor in the additional motor task. Thus there are no broad training-induced transfer effects from such an ecologically valid training regime. This lack of findings could be addressed to insufficient training intensities or a participant-induced bias following the cancelled randomization process.
