It is known that over 98% of the human genome is non-coding and 93% of disease associated variants are located in these regions. Therefore understanding the function of these regions is important. However this task is challenging as most of these regions are not well understood in terms of their functions. In this paper we introduce a novel computational model based on deep neural networks called DQDNN for quantifying the function of non-coding DNA regions. This model combines convolution layers for capturing regularity motifs at multiple scales and recurrent layers for capturing long term dependencies between the captured motifs. In addition we show that integrating evolutionary information with raw genomic sequences improves the performance of the predictor significantly. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art ones using raw genomics sequences only and also by integrating evolutionary information with raw genomics sequences. More specifically the proposed model improves 96.9% and 98% of the targets in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the precision-recall curve respectively. In addition the proposed model improved the prioritization of functional variants of expression quantitative trait loci eQTLs compared with the state-of-the-art models.
