Deep convolutional networks CNN can achieve impressive results on RGB scene recognition thanks to large datasets such as Places. In contrast RGB-D scene recognition is still underdeveloped in comparison due to two limitations of RGB-D data we address in this paper. The first limitation is the lack of depth data for training deep learning models. Rather than fine tuning or transferring RGB-specific features we address this limitation by proposing an architecture and a twostep training approach that directly learns effective depth-specific features using weak supervision via patches. The resulting RGBD model also benefits from more complementary multimodal features. Another limitation is the short range of depth sensors typically 0.5m to 5.5m resulting in depth images not capturing distant objects in the scenes that RGB images can. We show that this limitation can be addressed by using RGB-D videos where more comprehensive depth information is accumulated as the camera travels across the scenes. Focusing on this scenario we introduce the ISIA RGB-D video dataset to evaluate RGB-D scene recognition with videos. Our video recognition architecture combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks RNNs that are trained in three steps with increasingly complex data to learn effective features i.e. patches frames and sequences. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art performances on RGB-D image NYUD2 and SUN RGB-D and video ISIA RGB-D scene recognition. Learning Effective RGB-D Representations for Scene Recognition.
