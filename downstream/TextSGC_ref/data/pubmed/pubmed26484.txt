In this study a robust method is developed for frequency-specific electroencephalogram EEG phase extraction using the analytic representation of the EEG. Based on recent theoretical findings in this area it is shown that some of the phase variations-previously associated to the brain response-are systematic side-effects of the methods used for EEG phase calculation especially during low analytical amplitude segments of the EEG. Robust electroencephalogram phase estimation with applications in brain-computer interface systems.
