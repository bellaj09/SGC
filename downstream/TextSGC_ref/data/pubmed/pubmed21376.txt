"The successful navigation of social interactions depends on a range of cognitive faculties-including the ability to achieve joint attention with others to share information and experiences. We investigated the influence that intention monitoring processes have on gaze-following response times during joint attention. We employed a virtual reality task in which 16 healthy adults engaged in a collaborative game with a virtual partner to locate a target in a visual array. In the Search task the virtual partner was programmed to engage in non-communicative gaze shifts in search of the target establish eye contact and then display a communicative gaze shift to guide the participant to the target. In the NoSearch task the virtual partner simply established eye contact and then made a single communicative gaze shift towards the target i.e.\xa0there were no non-communicative gaze shifts in search of the target. Thus only the Search task required participants to monitor their partners communicative intent before responding to joint attention bids. We found that gaze following was significantly slower in the Search task than the NoSearch task. However the same effect on response times was not observed when participants completed non-social control versions of the Search and NoSearch tasks in which the avatars gaze was replaced by arrow cues. These data demonstrate that the intention monitoring processes involved in differentiating communicative and non-communicative gaze shifts during the Search task had a measurable influence on subsequent joint attention behaviour. The empirical and methodological implications of these findings for the fields of autism and social neuroscience will be discussed."
