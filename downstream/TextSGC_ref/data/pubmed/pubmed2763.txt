We investigated the influence of the apolipoprotein E-4 allele APOE-4 on longitudinal age-related changes in brain functional connectivity FC and cognition in view of mixed cross-sectional findings. One hundred and twenty-two healthy older adults aged 58-79; 25 APOE-4 carriers underwent task-free fMRI scans at baseline. Seventy-eight 16 carriers had at least one follow-up every 2 years. Changes in intra- and internetwork FCs among the default mode DMN executive control ECN and salience SN networks as well as cognition were quantified using linear mixed models. Cross-sectionally APOE-4 carriers had lower functional connectivity between the ECN and SN than noncarriers. Carriers also showed a stronger age-dependent decrease in visuospatial memory performance. Longitudinally carriers had steeper increase in inter-ECN-DMN FC indicating loss of functional segregation. The longitudinal change in processing speed performance was not moderated by APOE-4 genotype but the brain-cognition association was. In younger elderly faster loss of segregation was correlated with greater decline in processing speed regardless of genotype. In older elderly such relation remained for noncarriers but reversed for carriers. APOE-4 may alter aging by accelerating the change in segregation between high-level cognitive systems. Its modulation on the longitudinal brain-cognition relationship was age-dependent. Functional segregation loss over time is moderated by APOE genotype in healthy elderly.
