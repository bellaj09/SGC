The use of computers or machines in medicine dates back to the 1960s. Deep learning software programming is a subset of artificial intelligence AI based on the ability of a machine to learn from data and adaptively change. Deep learning is creating the next industrial revolution across the economy by replacing repetitive low-skilled tasks with learning algorithms. In medicine image-based fields such as radiology dermatology and pathology have seen an increase in the number of studies using deep learning. However given the current lack of standardized data sets to train these machines it is difficult to predict if the present results eventually will be translated to real-life clinical settings. Is artificial intelligence going to replace dermatologists?
