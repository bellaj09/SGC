Recent advances in machine learning have given rise to deep learning which uses hierarchical layers to build models offering the ability to advance value-based healthcare by better predicting patient outcomes and costs of a given treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of 2 common deep learning models traditional multilayer perceptron MLP and the newer dense neural network DenseNet in predicting outcomes for primary total hip arthroplasty THA and total knee arthroplasty TKA as a foundation for future musculoskeletal studies seeking to utilize machine learning.
