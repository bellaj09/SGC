The purpose of this study was to investigate students\ conceptions of and approaches to learning science in two different forms: internet-assisted instruction and traditional face-to-face only instruction. The participants who took part in the study were 79 college students enrolled in a physiology class in north Taiwan. In all 46 of the participants were from one class and 33 were from another class. Using a quasi-experimental research approach the class of 46 students was assigned to be the "internet-assisted instruction group" whereas the class of 33 students was assigned to be the "traditional instruction group." The treatment consisted of a series of online inquiry activities. To explore the effects of different forms of instruction on students\ conceptions of and approaches to learning science two questionnaires were administered before and after the instruction: the Conceptions of Learning Science Questionnaire and the Approaches to Learning Science Questionnaire. Analysis of covariance results revealed that the students in the internet-assisted instruction group showed less agreement than the traditional instruction group in the less advanced conceptions of learning science such as learning as memorizing and testing. In addition the internet-assisted instruction group displayed significantly more agreement than the traditional instruction group in more sophisticated conceptions such as learning as seeing in a new way. Moreover the internet-assisted instruction group expressed more orientation toward the approaches of deep motive and deep strategy than the traditional instruction group. However the students in the internet-assisted instruction group also showed more surface motive than the traditional instruction group did.
