We propose a combination of blind source separation BSS and independent component analysis ICA signal decomposition into artifacts and nonartifacts with support vector machines SVMs automatic classification that are designed for online usage. In order to select a suitable BSS/ICA method three ICA algorithms JADE Infomax and FastICA and one BSS algorithm AMUSE are evaluated to determine their ability to isolate electromyographic EMG and electrooculographic EOG artifacts into individual components. An implementation of the selected BSS/ICA method with SVMs trained to classify EMG and EOG artifacts which enables the usage of the method as a filter in measurements with online feedback is described. This filter is evaluated on three BCI datasets as a proof-of-concept of the method. Online artifact removal for brain-computer interfaces using support vector machines and blind source separation.
