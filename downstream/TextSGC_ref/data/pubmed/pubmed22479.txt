Virtual reality VR-based rehabilitation has been reported to have beneficial effects on upper extremity function in stroke survivors; however there is limited information about its effects on distal upper extremity function and health-related quality of life HRQoL. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of VR-based rehabilitation combined with standard occupational therapy on distal upper extremity function and HRQoL and compare the findings to those of amount-matched conventional rehabilitation in stroke survivors. Effects of virtual reality-based rehabilitation on distal upper extremity function and health-related quality of life: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.
