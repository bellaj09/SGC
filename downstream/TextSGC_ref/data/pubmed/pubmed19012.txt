Given the incidence of stroke the need has arisen to consider more self-managed rehabilitation approaches. A promising technology is Virtual Reality VR. Thus far however it is not clear what the benefits of VR systems are when compared to conventional methods. Here we investigated the clinical impact of one such system the Rehabilitation Gaming System RGS on the recovery time course of acute stroke. RGS combines concepts of action execution and observation with an automatic individualization of training. Virtual reality based rehabilitation speeds up functional recovery of the upper extremities after stroke: a randomized controlled pilot study in the acute phase of stroke using the rehabilitation gaming system.
