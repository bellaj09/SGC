Virtual reality VR-based paradigms use visual stimuli that can modulate visuo-motor networks leading to the stimulation of brain circuits. The aims of this study were to compare the changes in blood-oxygenation level dependent BOLD signal when watching and imitating moving real RH and virtual hands VH in 11 healthy participants HP. No differences were found between the observation of RH or VH making this VR-based experiment a promising tool for rehabilitation protocols. VH-imitation involved more the ventral premotor cortex vPMC as part of the mirror neuron system MNS compared to execution and VH-observation conditions. The dorsal-anterior Precuneus da-Pcu as part of the Precuneus/posterior Cingulate Cortex Pcu/pCC complex a key node of the Default Mode Network DMN was also less deactivated and therefore more involved. These results may reflect the dual visuo-motor roles for the vPMC and the implication of the da-Pcu in the reallocation of attentional and neural resources for bimodal task management. The ventral Pcu/pCC was deactivated regardless of the condition confirming its role in self-reference processes. Imitation of VH stimuli can then modulate the activation of specific areas including those belonging to the MNS and the DMN. Action observation or imitation of virtual hand movement affect differently regions of the mirror neuron system and the default mode network.
