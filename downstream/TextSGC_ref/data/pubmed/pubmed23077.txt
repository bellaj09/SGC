Neurofeedback NF is often criticized because of the lack of empirical evidence of its specificity. Our present study thus focused on the specificity of NF on three levels: band specificity cognitive specificity and baseline specificity. Ten healthy middle-aged individuals performed ten sessions of SMR sensorimotor rhythm 12-15Hz NF training. A second group N=10 received feedback of a narrow gamma band 40-43Hz. Effects of NF on EEG resting measurements tonic EEG and cognitive functions memory intelligence were evaluated using a pre-post design. Both training groups were able to linearly increase the target training frequencies either SMR or gamma indicating the trainability of these EEG frequencies. Both NF training protocols led to nonspecific changes in other frequency bands during NF training. While SMR NF only led to concomitant changes in slower frequencies gamma training affected nearly the whole power spectrum. SMR NF specifically improved memory functions. Gamma training showed only marginal effects on cognitive functions. SMR power assessed during resting measurements significantly increased after SMR NF training compared to a pre-assessment indicating specific effects of SMR NF on baseline/tonic EEG. The gamma group did not show any pre-post changes in their EEG resting activity. In conclusion SMR NF specifically affects cognitive functions cognitive specificity and tonic EEG baseline specificity while increasing SMR during NF training nonspecifically affects slower EEG frequencies as well band non-specificity. Gamma NF was associated with nonspecific effects on the EEG power spectrum during training which did not lead to considerable changes in cognitive functions or baseline EEG activity.
