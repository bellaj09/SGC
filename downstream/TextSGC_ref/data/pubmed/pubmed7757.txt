Accurate prediction of non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC prognosis after surgery remains challenging. The Cox proportional hazard PH model is widely used however there are some limitations associated with it. In this study we developed novel neural network models called binned time survival analysis DeepBTS models using 30 clinico-pathological features of surgically resected NSCLC patients training cohort n\u2009=\u20091022; external validation cohort n\u2009=\u2009298. We employed the root-mean-square error in the supervised learning model s- DeepBTS or negative log-likelihood in the semi-unsupervised learning model su-DeepBTS as the loss function. The su-DeepBTS algorithm achieved better performance C-index\u2009=\u20090.7306; AUC\u2009=\u20090.7677 than the other models Cox PH: C-index\u2009=\u20090.7048 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.7390; s-DeepBTS: C-index\u2009=\u20090.7126 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.7420. The top 14 features were selected using su-DeepBTS model as a selector and could distinguish the low- and high-risk groups in the training cohort p\u2009=\u20091.86\u2009\u200910-11 and validation cohort p\u2009=\u20091.04\u2009\u200910-10. When trained with the optimal feature set for each model the su-DeepBTS model could predict the prognoses of NSCLC better than the traditional model especially in stage I patients. Follow-up studies using combined radiological pathological imaging and genomic data to enhance the performance of our model are ongoing.
