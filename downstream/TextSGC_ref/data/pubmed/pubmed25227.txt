In the traditional P300 brain-computer interface BCI system the electroencephalogram EEG signals can only provide limited information with a low signal-to-noise ratio. A BCI paradigm under visual stimulus was proposed in our study aiming to effectively activate the related brain areas and response signal while dealing with specific cognitive task mental arithmetic task so as to enhance the EEG signals. The result was compared with the traditional P300 counting task paradigm. Then the collected EEG data were preprocessed including extracting signal features with coherent averaging method and analyzing the influences of different experimental paradigms on main components of event related potential ERP. In the improved paradigm experiments the average increasing rate of P300 amplitude was 6. 83MV 73. 94%. The brain activity from 400ms was more active and lasted longer. Besides unlike traditional counting task mental arithmetic task appeared to have apparent activation at 650ms. The results showed that the improved paradigm could activate the related brain areas better and enhance the characteristics of signal. This provides a new system paradigm for BCI. A study of brain-computer interface paradigm based on mental arithmetic.
