"Muscle fat infiltration MFI of the deep cervical spine extensors has been observed in cervical spine conditions using time-consuming and rater-dependent manual techniques. Deep learning convolutional neural network CNN models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in segmentation tasks. Here we train and test a CNN for muscle segmentation and automatic MFI calculation using high-resolution fat-water images from 39 participants 26 female average\u2009=\u200931.7\u2009\u20099.3 years 3 months post whiplash injury. First we demonstrate high test reliability and accuracy of the CNN compared to manual segmentation. Then we explore the relationships between CNN muscle volume CNN MFI and clinical measures of pain and neck-related disability. Across all participants we demonstrate that CNN muscle volume was negatively correlated to pain R\u2009=\u2009-0.415 p\u2009=\u20090.006 and disability R\u2009=\u2009-0.286 p\u2009=\u20090.045 while CNN MFI tended to be positively correlated to disability R\u2009=\u20090.214 p\u2009=\u20090.105. Additionally CNN MFI was higher in participants with persisting pain and disability p\u2009=\u20090.049. Overall CNNs may improve the efficiency and objectivity of muscle measures allowing for the quantitative monitoring of muscle properties in disorders of and beyond the cervical spine."
