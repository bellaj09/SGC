The effect of Type 2 Diabetes T2D on brain health is poorly understood. This study aims to quantify the association between T2D and perfusion in the brain. T2D is a very common metabolic disorder that can cause long term damage to the renal and cardiovascular systems. Previous research has discovered the shape volume and white matter microstructures in the brain to be significantly impacted by T2D. We propose a fully-connected deep neural network to classify the regional Cerebral Blood Flow into low or high levels given 16 clinical measures as predictors. The clinical measures include diabetes renal cardiovascular and demographics measures. Our model enables us to discover any nonlinear association which might exist between the input features and target. Moreover our end-to-end architecture automatically learns the most relevant features and combines them without the need for applying a feature selection method. We achieved promising classification performance. Furthermore in comparison with six 6 classical machine learning algorithms and six 6 alternative deep neural networks similarly tuned for the task our proposed model outperformed all of them.
