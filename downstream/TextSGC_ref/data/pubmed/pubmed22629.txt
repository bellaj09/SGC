Access to medical care during long duration space missions is extremely important. Numerous unanticipated medical problems will need to be addressed promptly and efficiently. Although telemedicine provides a convenient tool for remote diagnosis and treatment it is impractical due to the long delay between data transmission and reception to Earth. While a well-trained surgeon-internist-astronaut would be an essential addition to the crew the vast number of potential medical problems necessitate instant access to computerized skill-enhancing and diagnostic tools. A functional prototype of a virtual reality based surgical training and assistance tool was created at our center using low-power small lightweight components that would be easy to transport on a space mission. The system consists of a tracked head-mounted display a computer system and a number of tracked surgical instruments. The software provides a real-time surgical simulation system with integrated monitoring and information retrieval and a voice input/output subsystem. Initial medical content for the system has been created comprising craniofacial hand inner ear and general anatomy as well as information on a number of surgical procedures and techniques. One surgical specialty in particular microsurgery was provided as a full simulation due to its long training requirements significant impact on result due to experience and likelihood for need. However the system is easily adapted to realistically simulate a large number of other surgical procedures. By providing a general system for surgical simulation and assistance the astronaut-surgeon can maintain their skills acquire new specialty skills and use tools for computer-based surgical planning and assistance to minimize overall crew and mission risk.
