Correlations in brain activity between two areas functional connectivity have been shown to relate to their underlying structural connections. We examine the possibility that functional connectivity also reflects short-term changes in synaptic efficacy. We demonstrate that paired transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS near ventral premotor cortex PMv and primary motor cortex M1 with a short 8-ms inter-pulse interval evoking synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and which strengthens interregional connectivity between the two areas in a pattern consistent with Hebbian plasticity leads to increased functional connectivity between PMv and M1 as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. Moreover we show that strengthening connectivity between these nodes has effects on a wider network of areas such as decreasing coupling in a parallel motor programming stream. A control experiment revealed that identical TMS pulses at identical frequencies caused no change in fMRI-measured functional connectivity when the inter-pulse-interval was too long for Hebbian-like plasticity. Causal manipulation of functional connectivity in a specific neural pathway during behaviour and at rest.
