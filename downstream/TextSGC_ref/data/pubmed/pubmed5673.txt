Automatic segmentation of the prostate on CT images has many applications in prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy. However prostate CT image segmentation is challenging because of the low contrast of soft tissue on CT images. In this paper we propose an automatic segmentation method by combining a deep learning method and multi-atlas refinement. First instead of segmenting the whole image we extract the region of interesting ROI to delete irrelevant regions. Then we use the convolutional neural networks CNN to learn the deep features for distinguishing the prostate pixels from the non-prostate pixels in order to obtain the preliminary segmentation results. CNN can automatically learn the deep features adapting to the data which are different from some handcrafted features. Finally we select some similar atlases to refine the initial segmentation results. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 92 prostate CT images. Experimental results show that our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 86.80% as compared to the manual segmentation. The deep learning based method can provide a useful tool for automatic segmentation of the prostate on CT images and thus can have a variety of clinical applications.
