Awe is described as an a "epistemic emotion" because it is hypothesised to make gaps in one\s knowledge salient. However no empirical evidence for this yet exists. Awe is also hypothesised to be an antecedent to interest in science because science is one way to fill those knowledge gaps. Results from four pre-registered studies N\u2009=\u20091518 indicate that manipulating awe through online Studies 1a 1b and 1c and virtual reality Study 2 videos led to greater awareness of knowledge gaps. Awareness of knowledge gaps was consistently associated with greater science interest and to choosing tickets to a science museum over tickets to an art museum Study 1b. These effects were not consistently observed on nor moderated by other measures related to cognition religion and spirituality. However exploratory analyses showed that science interest was better predicted by positive emotions than by awe. Still these results provide the first empirical evidence of awe as an "epistemic emotion" by demonstrating its effects on awareness of knowledge gaps. These findings are also extended to the effects of awe on science interest as one possible outcome of awareness of knowledge gaps. "Oh the things you dont know: awe promotes awareness of knowledge gaps and science interest."
