Microsatellite instability determines whether patients with gastrointestinal cancer respond exceptionally well to immunotherapy. However in clinical practice not every patient is tested for MSI because this requires additional genetic or immunohistochemical tests. Here we show that deep residual learning can predict MSI directly from H&E histology which is ubiquitously available. This approach has the potential to provide immunotherapy to a much broader subset of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Deep learning can predict microsatellite instability directly from histology in gastrointestinal cancer.
