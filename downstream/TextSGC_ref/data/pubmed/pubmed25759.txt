Advances in network and imaging technology coupled with the availability of 3-D datasets such as the Visible Human provide a unique opportunity for developing information systems in anatomy that can deliver relevant knowledge directly to the clinician researcher or educator. A software framework is described for developing such a system within a distributed architecture that includes spatial and symbolic anatomy information resources Web and custom servers and authoring and end-user client programs. The authoring tools have been used to create 3-D atlases of the brain knee and thorax that are used both locally and throughout the world. For the one and a half year period from June 1995-January 1997 the on-line atlases were accessed by over 33000 sites from 94 countries with an average of over 4000 "hits" per day and 25000 hits per day during peak exam periods. The atlases have been linked to by over 500 sites and have received at least six unsolicited awards by outside rating institutions. The flexibility of the software framework has allowed the information system to evolve with advances in technology and representation methods. Possible new features include knowledge-based image retrieval and tutoring dynamic generation of 3-D scenes and eventually real-time virtual reality navigation through the body. Such features when coupled with other on-line biomedical information resources should lead to interesting new ways for managing and accessing structural information in medicine.
