Protein-protein interactions PPIs play crucial roles in almost all cellular processes. Although a large amount of PPIs have been verified by high-throughput techniques in the past decades currently known PPIs pairs are still far from complete. Furthermore the wet-lab experiments based techniques for detecting PPIs are time-consuming and expensive. Hence it is urgent and essential to develop automatic computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs. In this paper a sequence-based approach called DNN-LCTD is developed by combining deep neural networks DNNs and a novel local conjoint triad description LCTD feature representation. LCTD incorporates the advantage of local description and conjoint triad thus it is capable to account for the interactions between residues in both continuous and discontinuous regions of amino acid sequences. DNNs can not only learn suitable features from the data by themselves but also learn and discover hierarchical representations of data. When performing on the PPIs data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNN-LCTD achieves superior performance with accuracy as 93.12% precision as 93.75% sensitivity as 93.83% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC as 97.92% and it only needs 718 s. These results indicate DNN-LCTD is very promising for predicting PPIs. DNN-LCTD can be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics study.
