Treating binge eating disorders is not easy: the disordered eating is usually combined with a patient who is overweight and often obese. As underlined by the current literature treatment outcome must focus at a minimum on the binge eating characterizing this disorder on weight changes and preferably also changes in co-morbid psychopathology. To address these issues cognitive behavioral therapy CBT is still considered the best approach. However if we check the results of follow-up studies different authors reported some relapse in the frequency of binge eating and small weight gains over the follow-up period. This paper describes the 6-month follow-up outcome of the Experiential Cognitive Therapy ECT a multi factorial treatment for binge eating disorders including virtual reality therapy. These results are compared in a randomized controlled trial n = 36 with the ones obtained by CBT and nutritional groups only. The results showed that 77% of the ECT group quit binging after 6 months versus 56% for the CBT sample and 22% for the nutritional group sample. Moreover the ECT sample reported better scores in most psychometric tests including EDI-2 and body image scores. Six-month follow-up of in-patient experiential cognitive therapy for binge eating disorders.
