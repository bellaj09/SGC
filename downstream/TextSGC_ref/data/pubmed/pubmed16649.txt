"This study set out to ascertain whether the context in which anatomy is learnt made a difference to students perceptions of learning. An Approach to Learning Inventory ASSIST and a 31-item Anatomy Learning Experience Questionnaire ALE were administered to 224 students 77 dental 132 medical and 19 speech and language as a multi-site study. Results revealed that 45% adopted a strategic 39% a deep and 14% a surface approach. Trends between professions are similar for a deep or strategic approach both ~ 40%. However a surface approach differed between professions 7% dentistry 16% medicine 26% speech and language science. Dental students responded more to being able to use their knowledge than did other groups P = 0.0001. Medical students found the dissecting environment an intimidating one and subsequently reported finding online resources helpful P = 0.015 and P = 0.003 respectively. Speech and language science students reported that they experienced greater difficulties with learning anatomy; they reported finding the amount to learn daunting P = 0.007 struggled to remember what they did last semester P = 0.032 and were not confident in their knowledge base P = 0.0001. All students responded strongly to the statement I feel that working with cadaveric material is an important part of becoming a doctor/dentist/health care professional. A strong response to this statement was associated with students adopting a deep approach P = 0.0001. This study has elucidated that local curriculum factors are important in creating an enabling learning environment. There are also a number of generic issues that can be identified as being inherent in the learning of anatomy as a discipline and are experienced across courses different student groups and institutions." The context of learning anatomy: does it make a difference?
