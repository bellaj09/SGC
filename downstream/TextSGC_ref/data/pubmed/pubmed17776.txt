The development of associative memory during childhood may be influenced by metacognitive factors. Here one aspect of metamemory function--belief in strategy efficacy-was tested for a role in the effective use of encoding strategies. A sample of 61 children and adults 8-25 years of age completed an associative recognition memory test and were assessed on belief in the efficacy of encoding strategies. Independent of age belief ratings identified two factors: "deep" and "shallow" encoding strategies. Although the strategy factor structure was stable across age adolescents and adults were more likely to prefer using a deep encoding strategy whereas children were equally likely to prefer a shallow strategy. Belief ratings of deep encoding strategies increased with age and critically accounted for better associative recognition. "Thats a good one! Belief in efficacy of mnemonic strategies contributes to age-related increase in associative memory."
