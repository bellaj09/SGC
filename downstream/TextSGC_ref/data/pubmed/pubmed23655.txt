We developed a Virtual Reality Driving Simulator in order to safely evaluate and improve the driving ability of the handicapped. The Virtual Environment consists of 18 sections e.g. a speed limited road a strait road a curved road a left turn course etc and each section is linked naturally. For the interface of our driving simulator an actual car was adapted for realism and then connected to a computer. We also equipped it with hand control driving devices especially adapted for the handicapped. A beam projector was used so that the subjects could see the virtual scene on a large screen which was set in front of them. The subjects selected for this trial were 10 normal drivers with valid driving licenses and 15 patients with thoracicor lumber cord injuries who had prior driving experience. For evaluation 5 driving skills were measured including average speed steering stability centerline violations traffic signal violations and driving time in various road conditions such as strait and curved roads. The normal subjects manipulated the gas pedal and the brake with their feet while the patients manipulated a hand control with their hands. After they finished driving the whole course the participants answered the questions such as "How realistic did the Virtual Reality Driving Simulator seeme to you?" and "How much was your fear reduced". The five driving skills measured between the two groups normal vs. handicapped did not show any significant differences p > 0.05. And in the three kinds of road conditions a speed limited road and roads with a sharp curve and left-hand turn the average speed of the handicapped group was 45.6 Km less than 61.2 Km p<0.05 of the normal group. In all 11 patients 73% reported that their fear of driving was reduced. Furthermore their average score on the degree of realism question was 51.5%.
