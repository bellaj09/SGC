"Biomedical event extraction is a crucial task in biomedical text mining. As the primary forum for international evaluation of different biomedical event extraction technologies BioNLP Shared Task represents a trend in biomedical text mining toward fine-grained information extraction IE. The fourth series of BioNLP Shared Task in 2016 BioNLP-ST16 proposed three tasks in which the Bacteria Biotope event extraction BB task has been put forward in the earlier BioNLP-ST. Deep learning methods provide an effective way to automatically extract more complex features and achieve notable results in various natural language processing tasks." Biomedical event extraction based on GRU integrating attention mechanism.
