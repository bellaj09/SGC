Since most of P300 brain-computer interface BCI methods have assumed visual events they are not always suitable for the BCI with auditory events and feature extraction methods appropriate for auditory P300 BCI are required. This study proposed ensemble convoluted feature extraction for affective auditory P300 BCI which took advantage of auditory responses elicited by different affective sounds. The proposed method was compared to feature extraction method that uses the canonical correlation analysis in addition to the traditional method. Those methods were evaluated on the dataset recorded from the improved affective auditory P300 BCI system. The mean online classification accuracy was 84.1% when using the traditional feature. The offline analysis showed that the proposed ensemble convolution feature extraction achieved significantly higher accuracy 86.75% than the traditional method. The propose feature extraction may effective for the multi-channel time-series BCI that is featured by different stimuli.
