We hypothesized that simulation based practice will results in skill improvement on trocar insertion task. Novices junior trainees and surgeons inserted a trocar into a simulated abdomen. The depth of penetration plunge was the similar for novice and junior trainees p=.98 and exceeded that observed for practicing surgeons p<.05. Trocar insertion may be an important variable to consider for surgical skill training. To date no virtual reality VR trainers allow for practice of this skill. We will present a prototype of a VR trainer designed. Trocar insertion: the neglected task of VR simulation.
