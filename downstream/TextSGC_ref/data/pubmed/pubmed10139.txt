Artificial intelligence AI is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning ML big data and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects CHDs that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks ML natural language processing and deep learning not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture analysis and interpretation both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.
