"This article explored the perspectives of 25 patients regarding virtual reality VR-based rehabilitation following knee surgery and identified the important factors that allowed patients to immerse themselves in rehabilitation. Qualitative analysis of data collected via open-ended questionnaire and quantitative analysis of data from physical assessments and surveys were conducted. In the open-ended questionnaire the majority of participants mentioned level of difficulty as the most common reason for selecting both the most and the least immersive exercise programs. Quantitative analysis showed that participants experienced a high level of flow 3.9 +/- 0.3 out of 5.0 and a high rate of expectation of therapeutic effect 96% and intention of exercise adherence 96%. Further participants with more severe pain or physical dysfunction tended to have more positive experiences e.g. Difficulty-Skill Balance Clear Goals and Transformation of Time leading to high levels of flow during VR-based rehabilitation. In conclusion VR-based games are potentially acceptable as a motivational rehabilitation tool for patients following knee surgery. However to best meet patients needs it might be useful to equip a VR program with varied levels of difficulty taking into account the severity of the individuals knee injury. Additionally severe pain or physical dysfunction might act as an indication rather than a contraindication for VR-based rehabilitation."
