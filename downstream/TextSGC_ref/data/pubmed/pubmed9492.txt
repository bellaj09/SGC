Fine spatiotemporal mapping of PM2.5 concentration in urban areas is of great significance in epidemiologic research. However both the diversity and the complex nonlinear relationships of PM2.5 influencing factors pose challenges for accurate mapping. To address these issues we innovatively combined social sensing data with remote sensing data and other auxiliary variables which can bring both natural and social factors into the modeling; meanwhile we used a deep learning method to learn the nonlinear relationships. The geospatial analysis methods were applied to realize effective feature extraction of the social sensing data and a grid matching process was carried out to integrate the spatiotemporal multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on this research strategy we finally generated hourly PM2.5 concentration data at a spatial resolution of 0.01. This method was successfully applied to the central urban area of Wuhan in China which the optimal result of the 10-fold cross-validation R2 was 0.832. Our work indicated that the real-time check-in and traffic index variables can improve both quantitative and mapping results. The mapping results could be potentially applied for urban environmental monitoring pollution exposure assessment and health risk research.
