Diffusion MRI has been widely used to assess brain tissue microstructure. However the conventional diffusion tensor imaging DTI is inadequate for characterizing fiber direction or fiber density in voxels with crossing fibers in brain white matter. The constrained spherical deconvolution CSD technique has been proposed to measure the complex fiber orientation distribution FOD using a single high b-value b\u202f\u202f3000\u202fs/mm2 to derive the intra-axonal volume fraction Vin from the calculated FOD. Recently the spherical mean technique SMT was developed to fit Vin directly from a multi-compartment model with multi-shell b-values. Although different numbers of b-values are needed in the two techniques both methods have been suggested to be related to the spherical mean diffusion weighted signal S. The current study compared the two techniques on the same high-quality Human Connectome Project diffusion data and investigated the relation between S and Vin systematically. At high b-values b\u202f\u202f3000\u202fs/mm2 S is linearly related to Vin and S provides similar contrast with Vin in white matter. At low b-values b\u202f~\u202f1000\u202fs/mm2 the linear relation between S and Vin is sensitive to the variations of intrinsic diffusivity. These results demonstrate that S measured with the typical b-value of 1000\u202fs/mm2 is not an indicator of Vin and previous DTI studies acquired with b\u202f=\u202f1000\u202fs/mm2 cannot be re-analyzed to provide Vin-weighted contrast.
