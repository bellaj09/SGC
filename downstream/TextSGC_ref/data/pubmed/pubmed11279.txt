Wildlife conservation and the management of human-wildlife conflicts require cost-effective methods of monitoring wild animal behavior. Still and video camera surveillance can generate enormous quantities of data which is laborious and expensive to screen for the species of interest. In the present study we describe a state-of-the-art deep learning approach for automatically identifying and isolating species-specific activity from still images and video data.We used a dataset consisting of 8368 images of wild and domestic animals in farm buildings and we developed an approach firstly to distinguish badgers from other species binary classification and secondly to distinguish each of six animal species multiclassification. We focused on binary classification of badgers first because such a tool would be relevant to efforts to manage Mycobacterium bovis the cause of bovine tuberculosis transmission between badgers and cattle.We used two deep learning frameworks for automatic image recognition. They achieved high accuracies in the order of 98.05% for binary classification and 90.32% for multiclassification. Based on the deep learning framework a detection process was also developed for identifying animals of interest in video footage which to our knowledge is the first application for this purpose.The algorithms developed here have wide applications in wildlife monitoring where large quantities of visual data require screening for certain species.
