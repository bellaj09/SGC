"In patients with unilateral upper limb paralysis from strokes and other brain lesions strategies for functional recovery may eventually include brain-machine interfaces BMIs using control signals from residual sensorimotor systems in the damaged hemisphere. When voluntary movements of the contralateral limb are not possible due to brain pathology initial training of such a BMI may require use of the unaffected ipsilateral limb. We conducted an offline investigation of the feasibility of decoding ipsilateral upper limb movements from electrocorticographic ECoG recordings in three patients with different lesions of sensorimotor systems associated with upper limb control. We found that the first principal component PC of unconstrained naturalistic reaching movements of the upper limb could be decoded from ipsilateral ECoG using a linear model. ECoG signal features yielding the best decoding accuracy were different across subjects. Performance saturated with very few input features. Decoding performances of 0.77 0.73 and 0.66 median Pearsons r between the predicted and actual first PC of movement using nine signal features were achieved in the three subjects. The performance achieved here with small numbers of electrodes and computationally simple decoding algorithms suggests that it may be possible to control a BMI using ECoG recorded from damaged sensorimotor brain systems."
