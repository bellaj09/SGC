"Brain-computer interface BCI is a system that can create direct connection between brain activity and external devices. In the past 20 years important achievements of research on BCI have been made. Now there are lots of research methods based on electroencephalic signals and researchers are trying to make the BCI system possess the characteristics of real-time and become more natural and practical. This paper presents an overview of real-time and stimulating way to EEG-based BCI research. Through the discussions on the applications of DSP in BCI system in signal preprocessing and in algorithm optimization the high lights in real-time research are pointed out. In the discussions about the way to produce EEG signals in BCI the researchers suggested that the imaging movement be the most ideal way in that it will reduce the discomfort in stimulation by application of the virtual reality technology in BCI system thus it will be conducive to improvement in the performance of BCI system." Development of practicality of EEG-based brain-computer interface.
