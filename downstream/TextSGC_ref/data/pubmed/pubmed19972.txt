Therapy for public speaking phobia using virtual reality exposure VRE has focused on distress arousal rather than distress habituation. Understanding habituation will help optimise session duration making treatment more affordable and accessible. This pilot study utilised within-speech repeated measures to examine distress habituation during three brief public speaking scenarios in a non-clinical sample n = 19; 18-76 years. VRE elicited significant distress in all three scenarios. Although within-scenario distress habituation was not observed between-scenario habituation was partially supported. An increase in distress during the second scenario indicated that three consecutive speech performances were critical in achieving habituation. Brief repeated VRE scenarios using an agent audience were effective in eliciting public speaking distress as well as habituation. Public speaking anxiety decreases within repeated virtual reality training sessions.
