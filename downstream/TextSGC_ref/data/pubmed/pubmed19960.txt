Low back and pelvic pain is one of the most frequently reported disorders in pregnancy however etiology and pathology of this problem have not been fully determined. The relationship between back pain experienced during pregnancy and posture remains unclear. It is challenging to measure reliably postural and spinal changes at the time of pregnancy since most imaging studies cannot be used due to the radiation burden. 3D shape measurement or surface topography ST systems designed for posture evaluation could potentially fill this void. A pilot study was conducted to test the potential of monitoring the change of spine curvatures and posture during pregnancy using surface topography. A single case was studied to test the methodology and preliminarily assess the usefulness of the procedure before performing a randomized trial. The apparatus used in this study was metrologically tested and utilized earlier in scoliosis screening. Monitoring of spine curvatures and posture during pregnancy using surface topography - case study and suggestion of method.
