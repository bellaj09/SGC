Eye movements generate electric signals which a user can employ to control his/her environment and communicate with others. This paper presents a review of previous studies on such electric signals that is electrooculograms EOGs from the perspective of human-computer interaction HCI. EOGs represent one of the easiest means to estimate eye movements by using a low-cost device and have been often considered and utilized for HCI applications such as to facilitate typing on a virtual keyboard moving a mouse or controlling a wheelchair. The objective of this study is to summarize the experimental procedures of previous studies and provide a guide for researchers interested in this field. In this work the basic characteristics of EOGs associated measurements and signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms are briefly reviewed and various applications reported in the existing literature are listed. It is expected that EOGs will be a useful source of communication in virtual reality environments and can act as a valuable communication tools for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
