We analysed the placebo response at the single-neuron level in the thalamus of Parkinson patients to see the differences between first-time administration of placebo and administration after pharmacological pre-conditioning. When the placebo was given for the first time it induced neither clinical improvement as assessed through muscle rigidity reduction at the wrist nor neuronal changes in thalamic neurons. However if placebo was given after two three or four prior administrations of an anti-Parkinson drug apomorphine it produced both clinical and neuronal responses. Both the magnitude and the duration of these placebo responses depended on the number of prior exposures to apomorphine according to the rule: the greater the number of previous apomorphine administrations the larger the magnitude and the longer the duration of the clinical and neuronal placebo responses. These findings show that learning plays a crucial role in the placebo response and suggest that placebo non-responders can be turned into placebo responders with important clinical implications.
