Performance of motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces MI BCIs greatly depends on how to extract the features. Various versions of filter-bank based common spatial pattern have been proposed and used in MI BCIs. Filter-bank based common spatial pattern has more number of features compared with original common spatial pattern. As the number of features increases the MI BCIs using filter-bank based common spatial pattern can face overfitting problems. In this study we used eigenvector centrality feature selection method wavelet packet decomposition common spatial pattern and kernel extreme learning machine to improve the performance of MI BCIs and avoid overfitting problems. Furthermore the computational speed was improved by using kernel extreme learning machine. Motor imagery EEG classification with optimal subset of wavelet based common spatial pattern and kernel extreme learning machine.
