More than other medical discipline radiology is marked by technical innovation and continuous development as well as the optimization of the underlying physical principles. In this respect several trends that will crucially change and develop radiology over the next decade can be observed. Through the use of ever faster computer tomography which also shows an ever-decreasing radiation exposure the "workhorse" of radiology will have an even greater place and displace conventional Xray techniques further. In addition hybrid imaging which is based on a combination of nuclear medicine and radiological techniques keywords: PET/CT PET/MRI will become much more established and in particular will improve oncological imaging further allowing increasingly individualized imaging for specific tracers and techniques of functional magnetic resonance imaging for a particular tumour. Future radiology will be strongly characterized by innovations in the software and Internet industry which will enable new image viewing and processing methods and open up new possibilities in the context of the organization of radiological work. The future of radiology: What can we expect within the next 10 years?.
