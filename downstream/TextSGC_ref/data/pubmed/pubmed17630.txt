"The ability to successfully navigate obstacles in our environment requires integration of visual information about the environment with estimates of our bodys state. Previous studies have used partial occlusion of the visual field to explore how information about the body and impending obstacles are integrated to mediate a successful clearance strategy. However because these manipulations often remove information about both the body and obstacle it remains to be seen how information about the lower extremities alone is utilized during obstacle crossing. Here we used an immersive virtual reality VR interface to explore how visual feedback of the lower extremities influences obstacle crossing performance. Participants wore a head-mounted display while walking on treadmill and were instructed to step over obstacles in a virtual corridor in four different feedback trials. The trials involved: 1 No visual feedback of the lower extremities 2 an endpoint-only model 3 a link-segment model and 4 a volumetric multi-segment model. We found that the volumetric model improved success rate placed their trailing foot before crossing and leading foot after crossing more consistently and placed their leading foot closer to the obstacle after crossing compared to no model. This knowledge is critical for the design of obstacle negotiation tasks in immersive virtual environments as it may provide information about the fidelity necessary to reproduce ecologically valid practice environments."
