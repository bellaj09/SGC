"Artificial intelligence AI particularly deep learning algorithms is gaining extensive attention for its excellent performance in image-recognition tasks. They can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical image characteristics and achieve an increased accuracy for diagnosis with higher efficiency. AI is widely used and getting increasingly popular in the medical imaging of the liver including radiology ultrasound and nuclear medicine. AI can assist physicians to make more accurate and reproductive imaging diagnosis and also reduce the physicians workload. This article illustrates basic technical knowledge about AI including traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms especially convolutional neural networks and their clinical application in the medical imaging of liver diseases such as detecting and evaluating focal liver lesions facilitating treatment and predicting liver treatment response. We conclude that machine-assisted medical services will be a promising solution for future liver medical care. Lastly we discuss the challenges and future directions of clinical application of deep learning techniques." Artificial intelligence in medical imaging of the liver.
