When visual evoked potentials VEPs are deployed in brain-computer interfaces BCIs the emphasis is put on stimulus design. In the case of transient VEPs TVEPs brain responses are never treated individually i.e. on a single-trial ST basis due to their poor signal quality. Therefore their main characteristic which is the emergence during early latencies remains unexplored. Exploiting the temporal patterning of transient VEP signals: a statistical single-trial methodology with implications to brain-computer interfaces BCIs.
