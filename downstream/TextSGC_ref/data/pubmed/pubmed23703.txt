"The present investigation with a virtual reality set-up aimed to study attentional orienting within a three-dimensional visual world. Near and far stimuli were used. Half of the subjects were provided with a virtual representation of their body whereas half were not. Results showed a different distribution of attentional resources in the two conditions suggesting a dissociation between attentional systems controlling the proximal and the distal visual space. In particular attention was focused close to the subjects body when a virtual representation of it was present whereas attention was focused away from the body when a virtual representation of the body was not present."
