To explore whether individualized visual training improves the visual acuity and visual field defects of patients with glaucoma. Patients with established primary glaucoma who visited the glaucoma clinic of Beijing Shijitan Hospital Capital Medical University from January 2018 to April 2018 were recruited. The binocular visual perception examination was performed by using the visual perception examination system and a personalized training program was developed according to the relevant threshold conditions between the eyes of the patients. The binocular visual perception training session for 20 minutes for two sessions was completed at home by using a virtual reality helmet. The visual function intraocular pressure and Octopus visual field were examined before and at the first month and the third month after training. Seven patients completed the study. None of the seven patients has fine stereopsis four of them have large stereopsis and two patients are without large stereopsis. The visual acuity at 3 months after training was significantly improved compared with that before training. The mean defect value after 1 month of training was significantly lower than that before training and it was further decreased after 3 months. Similarly the mean sensitivity value was significantly increased in both follow-ups after training. There was no significant difference in loss variance after 1 and 3 months of training when compared with that before training p\u2009>\u20090.05. Our small prospective observational study indicated that individualized visual perception training can improve the visual function and improve the visual field in patients with glaucoma and a large sample size study is warranted to further assess the value of this novel treatment.
