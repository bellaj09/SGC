For a brain-computer interface BCI system a calibration procedure is required for each individual user before he/she can use the BCI. This procedure requires approximately 20-30 min to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder. It is therefore an interesting topic to build a calibration-free or subject-independent BCI. In this article we construct a large motor imagery MI-based electroencephalography EEG database and propose a subject-independent framework based on deep convolutional neural networks CNNs. The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days resulting in 21600 trials for the MI task. In our framework we formulated the discriminative feature representation as a combination of the spectral-spatial input embedding the diversity of the EEG signals as well as a feature representation learned from the CNN through a fusion technique that integrates a variety of discriminative brain signal patterns. To generate spectral-spatial inputs we first consider the discriminative frequency bands in an information-theoretic observation model that measures the power of the features in two classes. From discriminative frequency bands spectral-spatial inputs that include the unique characteristics of brain signal patterns are generated and then transformed into a covariance matrix as the input to the CNN. In the process of feature representations spectral-spatial inputs are individually trained through the CNN and then combined by a concatenation fusion technique. In this article we demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our subject-independent or calibration-free model outperforms that of subject-dependent models using various methods common spatial pattern CSP common spatiospectral pattern CSSP filter bank CSP FBCSP and Bayesian spatio-spectral filter optimization BSSFO.
