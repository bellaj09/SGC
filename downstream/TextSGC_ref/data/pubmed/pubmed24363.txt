"Decoding brain activity of corresponding highlevel tasks may lead to an independent and intuitively controlled Brain-Computer Interface BCI. Most of todays BCI research focuses on analyzing the electroencephalogram EEG which provides only limited spatial and temporal resolution. Derived electrocorticographic ECoG signals allow the investigation of spatially highly focused task-related activation within the high-gamma frequency band making the discrimination of individual finger movements or complex grasping tasks possible. Common spatial patterns CSP are commonly used for BCI systems and provide a powerful tool for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction. This work focused on the discrimination of i three complex hand movements as well as ii hand movement and idle state. Two subjects S1 and S2 performed single `open `peace and `fist hand poses in multiple trials. Signals in the high-gamma frequency range between 100 and 500 Hz were spatially filtered based on a CSP algorithm for i and ii. Additionally a manual feature selection approach was tested for i. A multi-class linear discriminant analysis LDA showed for i an error rate of 13.89 % / 7.22 % and 18.42 % / 1.17 % for S1 and S2 using manually / CSP selected features where for ii a two class LDA lead to a classification error of 13.39 % and 2.33 % for S1 and S2 respectively."
