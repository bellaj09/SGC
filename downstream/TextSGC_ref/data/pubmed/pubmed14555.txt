Glaucoma is a serious eye disease that can cause permanent blindness and is difficult to diagnose early. Optic disc OD and optic cup OC play a pivotal role in the screening of glaucoma. Therefore accurate segmentation of OD and OC from fundus images is a key task in the automatic screening of glaucoma. In this paper we designed a U-shaped convolutional neural network with multi-scale input and multi-kernel modules MSMKU for OD and OC segmentation. Such a design gives MSMKU a rich receptive field and is able to effectively represent multi-scale features. In addition we designed a mixed maximum loss minimization learning strategy MMLM for training the proposed MSMKU. This training strategy can adaptively sort the samples by the loss function and re-weight the samples through data enhancement thereby synchronously improving the prediction performance of all samples. Experiments show that the proposed method has obtained a state-of-the-art breakthrough result for OD and OC segmentation on the RIM-ONE-V3 and DRISHTI-GS datasets. At the same time the proposed method achieved satisfactory glaucoma screening performance on the RIM-ONE-V3 and DRISHTI-GS datasets. On datasets with an imbalanced distribution between typical and rare sample images the proposed method obtained a higher accuracy than existing deep learning methods.
