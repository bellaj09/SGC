Traditional booths where sensory evaluation usually takes place are highly controlled and therefore have limited ecological validity. Since virtual reality VR is substantially interactive and engaging it has the potential to be applied in sensory science. In this preliminary study three chocolate types milk white and dark were evaluated under three contextual settings including sensory booths control and two VR environments 360-degree videos using VR headsets: i a pleasant sightseeing tour and ii a live music concert. Untrained participants n = 67 were asked to rate their liking and the intensity of different chocolate attributes based on the 9-point hedonic scale and just-about-right-scale JAR. Emotions were evaluated using the check-all-that-apply CATA method. Results showed that there were no significant effects of context type on the tasting experience; however there were significant effects of chocolate type. Milk and white chocolates were preferred over dark chocolate irrespective of the context type. Additionally more positive emotions were elicited for the dark chocolate in the "virtual live concert" environment. Dark chocolate under the other two environments was associated with negative emotional terms such as "bored" and "worried." In terms of more reliable and ecologically valid sensory responses further research is needed to match suitable VR environments to different chocolate types.
