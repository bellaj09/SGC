The Supernumerary robotic limbs are a recently introduced class of wearable robots that differently from traditional prostheses and exoskeletons aim at adding extra effectors i.e. arms legs or fingers to the human user rather than substituting or enhancing the natural ones. However it is still undefined whether the use of supernumerary robotic limbs could specifically lead to neural modifications in brain dynamics. The illusion of owning the part of body has been already proven in many experimental observations such as those relying on multisensory integration e.g. rubber hand illusion prosthesis and even on virtual reality. In this paper we present a description of a novel magnetic compatible supernumerary robotic finger together with preliminary observations from two functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI experiments in which brain activity was measured before and after a period of training with the robotic device and during the use of the novel MRI-compatible version of the supernumerary robotic finger. Results showed that the usage of the MR-compatible robotic finger is safe and does not produce artifacts on MRI images. Moreover the training with the supernumerary robotic finger recruits a network of motor-related cortical regions i.e. primary and supplementary motor areas hence the same motor network of a fully physiological voluntary motor gestures.
