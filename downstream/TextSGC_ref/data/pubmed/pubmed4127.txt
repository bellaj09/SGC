We study external electrical perturbations and their responses in the brain dynamic network of the Caenorhabditis elegans soil worm given by the connectome of its large somatic nervous system. Our analysis is inspired by a realistic experiment where one stimulates externally specific parts of the brain and studies the persistent neural activity triggered in other cortical regions. In this work we perturb groups of neurons that form communities identified by the walktrap community detection method by trains of stereotypical electrical Poissonian impulses and study the propagation of neural activity to other communities by measuring the corresponding dynamic ranges and Steven law exponents. We show that when one perturbs specific communities keeping the rest unperturbed the external stimulations are able to propagate to some of them but not to all. There are also perturbations that do not trigger any response. We found that this depends on the initially perturbed community. Finally we relate our findings for the former cases with low neural synchronization self-criticality and large information flow capacity and interpret them as the ability of the brain network to respond to external perturbations when it works at criticality and its information flow capacity becomes maximal.
