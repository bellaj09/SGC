"Previous studies have shown that the dorsal premotor cortex PMd neurons are relevant to reaching as well as grasping. In order to investigate their specific contribution to reaching and grasping respectively we design two experimental paradigms to separate these two factors. Two monkeys are instructed to reach in four directions but grasp the same object and grasp four different objects but reach in the same direction. Activities of the neuron ensemble in PMd of the two monkeys are collected while performing the tasks. Mutual information MI is carried out to quantitatively evaluate the neurons tuning property in both tasks. We find that there exist neurons in PMd that are tuned only to reaching tuned only to grasping and tuned to both tasks. When applied with a support vector machine SVM the movement decoding accuracy by the tuned neuron subset in either task is quite close to the performance by full ensemble. Furthermore the decoding performance improves significantly by adding the neurons tuned to both tasks into the neurons tuned to one property only. These results quantitatively distinguish the diversity of the neurons tuned to reaching and grasping in the PMd area and verify their corresponding contributions to BMI decoding."
