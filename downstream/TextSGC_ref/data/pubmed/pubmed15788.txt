"Bovine rectal palpation is a necessary skill for a veterinary student to learn. However lack of resources and welfare issues currently restrict the amount of training available to students in this procedure. Here we present a virtual reality based teaching tool -- the Bovine Rectal Palpation Simulator -- that has been developed as a supplement to existing training methods. When using the simulator the student palpates virtual objects representing the bovine reproductive tract receiving feedback from a PHANToM haptic device inside a fibreglass model of a cow while the teacher follows the students actions on the monitor and gives instruction. We present a validation experiment that compares the performance of a group of traditionally trained students with a group whose training was supplemented with a simulator training session. The subsequent performance in the real task when examining cows for the first time was assessed with the results showing a significantly better performance for the simulator group."
