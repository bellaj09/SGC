With recent significant improvements in artificial intelligence AI especially in the field of deep learning an increasing number of studies have evaluated the use of AI in endoscopy to detect and diagnose gastrointestinal GI lesions. The present review summarizes current publications on the use of AI in GI endoscopy and focuses on the challenges and future of AI-aided systems. We expect AI to provide an effective and practical method for endoscopists in lesion detection and characterization as well as in quality control in endoscopy. However so far most studies have remained at the preclinical stage. More attention should be paid in the future to the use of AI in real-life clinical applications. Application of artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal endoscopy.
