"During social interactions decision-making involves mutual reciprocity-each individuals choices are simultaneously a consequence of and antecedent to those of their interaction partner. Neuroeconomic research has begun to unveil the brain networks underpinning social decision-making but we know little about the patterns of neural connectivity within them that give rise to reciprocal choices. To investigate this the present study measured the behaviour and brain function of pairs of individuals N\u2009=\u200966 whilst they played multiple rounds of economic exchange comprising an iterated ultimatum game. During these exchanges both players could attempt to maximise their overall monetary gain by reciprocating their opponents prior behaviour-they could promote generosity by rewarding it and/or discourage unfair play through retaliation. By adapting a model of reciprocity from experimental economics we show that players choices on each exchange are captured accurately by estimating their expected utility EU as a reciprocal reaction to their opponents prior behaviour. We then demonstrate neural responses that map onto these reciprocal choices in two brain regions implicated in social decision-making: right anterior insula AI and anterior/anterior-mid cingulate cortex aMCC. Finally with behavioural Dynamic Causal Modelling we identified player-specific patterns of effective connectivity between these brain regions with which we estimated each players choices with over 70% accuracy; namely bidirectional connections between AI and aMCC that are modulated differentially by estimates of EU from our reciprocity model. This input-state-output modelling procedure therefore reveals systematic brain-behaviour relationships associated with the reciprocal choices characterising interactive social decision-making."
