Augmented reality AR is a technology which enables users to see the real world with virtual objects superimposed upon or composited with it. AR simulators have been developed and used in human medicine but not in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to develop an AR intravenous IV injection simulator to train veterinary and pre-veterinary students to perform canine venipuncture. Computed tomographic CT images of a beagle dog were scanned using a 64-channel multidetector. The CT images were transformed into volumetric data sets using an image segmentation method and were converted into a stereolithography format for creating 3D models. An AR-based interface was developed for an AR simulator for IV injection. Veterinary and pre-veterinary student volunteers were randomly assigned to an AR-trained group or a control group trained using more traditional methods n = 20/group; n = 8 pre-veterinary students and n = 12 veterinary students in each group and their proficiency at IV injection technique in live dogs was assessed after training was completed. Students were also asked to complete a questionnaire which was administered after using the simulator. The group that was trained using an AR simulator were more proficient at IV injection technique using real dogs than the control group P  0.01. The students agreed that they learned the IV injection technique through the AR simulator. Although the system used in this study needs to be modified before it can be adopted for veterinary educational use AR simulation has been shown to be a very effective tool for training medical personnel. Using the technology reported here veterinary AR simulators could be developed for future use in veterinary education.
