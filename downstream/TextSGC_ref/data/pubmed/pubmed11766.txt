"Nanophotonics the field that merges photonics and nanotechnology has in recent years revolutionized the field of optics by enabling the manipulation of light-matter interactions with subwavelength structures. However despite the many advances in this field the design fabrication and characterization has remained widely an iterative process in which the designer guesses a structure and solves the Maxwells equations for it. In contrast the inverse problem i.e. obtaining a geometry for a desired electromagnetic response remains a challenging and time-consuming task within the boundaries of very specific assumptions. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a novel Deep Neural Network trained with thousands of synthetic experiments is not only able to retrieve subwavelength dimensions from solely far-field measurements but is also capable of directly addressing the inverse problem. Our approach allows the rapid design and characterization of metasurface-based optical elements as well as optimal nanostructures for targeted chemicals and biomolecules which are critical for sensing imaging and integrated spectroscopy applications."
