An anatomical model in wax made by Tramond middle of the 19th century represented the cranial nerves of a left hemicranium. The aim of the study was to verify its anatomical veracity to realize a tri-dimensional visualization by computer and finally to numerize and to diffuse it to the general public in the purpose of culture on the internet. The model belonged to the Delmas Orfila and Rouvire Museum Paris Descartes university. It represented the cranial nerves especially the facial and the trigeminal nerves and their branches. To perform the photographic rotation every 5 along 360 we used a special device made of two identical superimposed marble disks linked by a ball bearing. A digital camera and the Quick Time Virtual Reality software were used. Seventy-two pictures were shot. This wax was realized with a great morphological accuracy from a true cranium as a support for the cranial nerves. The work of numerization and its free diffusion on the Internet permitted to deliver to everybody the images of this sample of the collection of the Orfila Museum the pieces of which were evacuated on December 2009 after its closure.
