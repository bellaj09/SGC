Helicobacter pylori HP-associated chronic gastritis can cause mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia both of which increase the risk of gastric cancer. The accurate diagnosis of HP infection during routine medical checks is important. We aimed to develop a convolutional neural network CNN which is a machine-learning algorithm similar to deep learning capable of recognizing specific features of gastric endoscopy images. The goal behind developing such a system was to detect HP infection early thus preventing gastric cancer. Deep learning analyzes Helicobacter pylori infection by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy images.
