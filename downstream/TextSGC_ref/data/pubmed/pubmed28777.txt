The dramatic development of brain machine interfaces has enhanced the use of human brain signals conveying mental action for controlling external actuators. This chapter will outline current evidences that the rhythmic electroencephalographic activity of the brain is sensitive to microgravity environment. Experiments performed in the International Space Station have shown significant changes in the power of the astronauts\ alpha and mu oscillations in resting condition and other adaptive modifications in the beta and gamma frequency range during the immersion in virtual navigation. In this context the dynamic aspects of the resting or default condition of the awaken brain the influence of the "top-down" dynamics and the possibility to use a more constrained configuration by a new somatosensory-evoked potential gating approach are discussed in the sense of future uses of brain computing interface in space mission. Although the state of the art of the noninvasive BCI approach clearly demonstrates their ability and the great expectance in the field of rehabilitation for the restoration of defective communication between the brain and external world their future application in space mission urgently needs a better understanding of brain neurophysiology in particular in aspects related to neural network rhythmicity in microgravity. Adaptive changes of rhythmic EEG oscillations in space implications for brain-machine interface applications.
