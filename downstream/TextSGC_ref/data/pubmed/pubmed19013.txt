Alignment correction of the lower limb by medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy HTO is an efficient technique but loss of correction and hardware failure can occur owing to inadequate fixation. A surgical technique using opposite screw insertion was previously applied for salvage of the lateral hinge fracture but evidence for its utility as a protective strategy was unclear.
