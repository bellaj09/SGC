Restorative brain-computer interfaces BCI are increasingly used to provide feedback of neuronal states in a bid to normalize pathological brain activity and achieve behavioral gains. However patients and healthy subjects alike often show a large variability or even inability of brain self-regulation for BCI control known as BCI illiteracy. Although current co-adaptive algorithms are powerful for assistive BCIs their inherent class switching clashes with the operant conditioning goal of restorative BCIs. Moreover due to the treatment rationale the classifier of restorative BCIs usually has a constrained feature space thus limiting the possibility of classifier adaptation. In this context we applied a Bayesian model of neurofeedback and reinforcement learning for different threshold selection strategies to study the impact of threshold adaptation of a linear classifier on optimizing restorative BCIs. For each feedback iteration we first determined the thresholds that result in minimal action entropy and maximal instructional efficiency. We then used the resulting vector for the simulation of continuous threshold adaptation. We could thus show that threshold adaptation can improve reinforcement learning particularly in cases of BCI illiteracy. Finally on the basis of information-theory we provided an explanation for the achieved benefits of adaptive threshold setting.
