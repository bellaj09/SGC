Electrooculography EOG signals can be used to control human-computer interface HCI systems if properly classified. The ability to measure and process these signals may help HCI users to overcome many of the physical limitations and inconveniences in daily life. However there are currently no effective multidirectional classification methods for monitoring eye movements. Here we describe a classification method used in a wireless EOG-based HCI device for detecting eye movements in eight directions. This device includes wireless EOG signal acquisition components wet electrodes and an EOG signal classification algorithm. The EOG classification algorithm is based on extracting features from the electrical signals corresponding to eight directions of eye movement up down left right up-left down-left up-right and down-right and blinking. The recognition and processing of these eight different features were achieved in real-life conditions demonstrating that this device can reliably measure the features of EOG signals. This system and its classification procedure provide an effective method for identifying eye movements. Additionally it may be applied to study eye functions in real-life conditions in the near future.
