Nursing department students are expected to correctly grasp the entire concept of nursing through their education. The authors created a movie of a Nightingale ward virtual ward hereafter with an architectural computer design software for education. The students\ reaction to the virtual ward was categorized into three viewpoints: that of nurses of patients and of nurses and patients in common. Most of the reactions in each viewpoint were: "easy to observe patients" in the nurses\ viewpoint; "no privacy" in the patients\ viewpoint; and "wide room" in the common viewpoint respectively. These reactions show the effectiveness of using a virtual ward in nursing education. Because these reactions are characteristics of a Nightingale ward and even students who have generally less experiences recognized these characteristics from the both viewpoints of nurses and patients.
