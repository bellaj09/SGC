Computer aided diagnosis using artificial intelligent techniques made tremendous improvement in medical applications especially for easy detection of tumor area tumor type and grades. This paper presents automatic glioma tumor grade identification from magnetic resonant images using Wndchrm tool based classifier Weighted Neighbour Distance using Compound Heirarchy of Algorithms Representing Morphology and VGG-19 deep convolutional neural network DNN. For experimentation DICOM images are collected from reputed government hospital and the proposed intelligent system categorized the tumor into four grades such as low grade glioma oligodendroglioma anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma multiform. After preprocessing features are extracted optimized and then classified using Windchrm tool where the most significant features are selected on the basis of Fisher score. In the case of DNN classifier data augmentation is also performed before applying the images into the deep learning network. The performance of the classifiers are analysed with various measures such as accuracy precision sensitivity specificity and F1-score. The results showed reasonably good performance with a maximum classification accuracy of 92.86% for the Wndchrm classifier and 98.25% for VGG-19 DNN classifier. The results are also compared with similar recent works and the proposed system is found to have better performance. Glioma Tumor Grade Identification Using Artificial Intelligent Techniques.
