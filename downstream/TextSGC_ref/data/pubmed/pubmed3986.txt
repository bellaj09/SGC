"Brain stimulation a therapy increasingly used for neurological and psychiatric disease traditionally is divided into invasive approaches such as deep brain stimulation DBS and noninvasive approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these approaches is unknown therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression Parkinsons disease obsessive-compulsive disorder essential tremor addiction pain minimally conscious states and Alzheimers disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities optimizing treatment and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation." Resting-state networks link invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation across diverse psychiatric and neurological diseases.
