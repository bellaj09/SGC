We propose a virtual reality VR model reproducing a house environment where color modification of target places obtainable by home automation in a real ambient was tested by means of a P3b paradigm. The target place bathroom door was designed to be recognized during a virtual wayfinding in a realistic reproduction of a house environment. Different color and luminous conditions easily obtained in the real ambient from a remote home automation control were applied to the target and standard places all the doors being illuminated in white W and only target doors colored with a green G or red R spotlight. Three different Virtual Environments VE were depicted as the bathroom was designed in the aisle A living room L and bedroom B. EEG was recorded from 57 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects in the 60-80\xa0year age range O-old group and 12 normal cases in the 20-30\xa0year age range Y-young group. Testing a novel method for improving wayfinding by means of a P3b Virtual Reality Visual Paradigm in normal aging.
