Purpose: There is no significant evidence of both biological and motivational effects between virtual reality exercises to traditional/conventional exercise. The aim of this study is to assess the biological and motivational effects of aerobic exercises with virtual reality and traditional exercise methods. Methods: 20 students participated as control and 60 students were divided randomly and equally into two groups virtual reality exercise group VRE and traditional exercise group TE. Two groups completed the exercise training. Tests were applied to the three groups at the beginning and in the end of the study. An activity monitor and pulse oximeter were used to measure energy expenditure during exercises. Results: After eight weeks the data from pulse oximeter showed no statistical significance between the exercise groups. The active energy expenditure PAL and step counts were statistically significant in TE group. There was a statistically significant increase in the sleep quality of the TE group p =\xa0.000. There was no statistical significance among the anxiety scores of all groups. In the spring semester there was a statistically significant increase in both VRE and TE groups compared to the fall semester p <\xa0.05. Conclusion: The virtual reality exercises produce greater motivational effects whereas traditional exercises bring greater physical improvements. The Biological and Motivational Effects of Aerobic Exercise with Virtual Reality.
