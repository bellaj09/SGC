This paper presents telemedicine as an extension of a teleradiology framework through tools for virtual surgery. To classify the described methods and applications the research field of virtual reality VR is broadly reviewed. Differences with respect to technical equipment methodological requirements and areas of application are pointed out. Desktop VR augmented reality and virtual reality are differentiated and discussed in some typical contexts of diagnostic support surgical planning therapeutic procedures simulation and training. Visualization techniques are compared as a prerequisite for virtual reality and assigned to distinct levels of immersion. The advantage of a hybrid visualization kernel is emphasized with respect to the desktop VR applications that are subsequently shown. Moreover software design aspects are considered by outlining functional openness in the architecture of the host system. Here a teleradiology workstation was extended by dedicated tools for surgical planning through a plug-in mechanism. Examples of recent areas of application are introduced such as liver tumor resection planning diagnostic support in heart surgery and craniofacial surgery planning. In the future surgical planning systems will become more important. They will benefit from improvements in image acquisition and communication new image processing approaches and techniques for data presentation. This will facilitate preoperative planning and intraoperative applications. Virtual surgery in a tele-radiology framework.
