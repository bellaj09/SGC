Higher classification accuracy is more desirable for brain computer interface BCI applications. The accuracy can be achieved by appropriate selection of relevant features. In this paper a new scheme is proposed based on six different nonlinear features. These features include Sample entropy SampEn Composite permutation entropy index CPEI Approximate entropy ApEn Fractal dimension FD Hurst exponent H and Hjorth parameters complexity and mobility. These features are decision variables for classification of physiological conditions: Eyes Open EO Eyes Closed EC Game Playing 2D GP2D Game playing 3D active GP3DA and Game playing 3D passive GP3DP. Results show that the scheme can successfully classify the conditions with an accuracy of 88.9%. EEG classification of physiological conditions in 2D/3D environments using neural network.
