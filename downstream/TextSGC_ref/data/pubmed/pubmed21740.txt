The self-paced control paradigm enables users to operate brain-computer interfaces BCI in a more natural way: no longer is the machine in control of the timing and speed of communication but rather the user is. This is important to enhance the usability flexibility and response time of a BCI. In this work we show how subjects after performing cue-based feedback training smiley paradigm learned to navigate self-paced through the "freeSpace" virtual environment VE. Similar to computer games subjects had the task of picking up items by using the following navigation commands: rotate left rotate right and move forward  three classes. Since the self-paced control paradigm allows subjects to make voluntary decisions on time type and duration of mental activity no cues or routing directives were presented. The BCI was based only on three bipolar electroencephalogram channels and operated by motor imagery. Eye movements electrooculogram and electromyographic artifacts were reduced and detected online. The results of three able-bodied subjects are reported and problems emerging from self-paced control are discussed. Toward self-paced brain-computer communication: navigation through virtual worlds.
