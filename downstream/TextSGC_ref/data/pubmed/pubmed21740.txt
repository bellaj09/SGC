Functional imaging studies have implicated the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in cue-guided spatial navigation but also many other regions. Furthermore little is known about de-activations that take place during performance of navigation tasks something that is of interest given that the hippocampus is a component of the default mode network which de-activates during attention-demanding tasks. In this study 22 healthy subjects underwent whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI while they navigated toward a previously learned goal in a virtual reality environment. At a threshold of p<0.05 corrected the subjects showed a pattern of widespread cortical activations including the parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortex and also parts of the frontal temporal and occipital cortex. Hippocampal activation however was restricted to the posterior portion of the structure bilaterally. De-activations were seen in the medial frontal cortex and other regions of the default mode network but not in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. The findings support the involvement of the hippocampus in cue-guided navigation but suggest that its posterior regions are particularly important. Cue-guided spatial navigation is associated with de-activation in some but not all parts of the default mode network.
