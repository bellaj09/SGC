"A self-paced treadmill automatically adjusts speed in real-time to match the users walking speed potentially enabling more natural gait than fixed-speed treadmills. This research examined walking speed changes for able-bodied and transtibial amputee populations on a self-paced treadmill in a multi-terrain virtual environment and examined gait differences between fixed and self-paced treadmill speed conditions. Twelve able-bodied AB individuals and 12 individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation TT walked in a park-like virtual environment with level slopes and simulated uneven terrain scenarios. Temporal-spatial and range-of-motion parameters were analyzed. Within the self-paced condition all participants significantly varied walking speed p<0.001 across different walking activities. Compared to level walking participants reduced speed for uphill and hilly activities p<0.001. TT also reduced speed downhill p<0.001. Generally differences in temporal-spatial and range-of-motion parameters between fixed and self-paced speed conditions were no longer significantly different with a speed covariate. However for uphill walking both groups decreased stride length during self-paced trials and increased stride length during fixed-speed trials to maintain the constant speed p<0.01. The results from this study demonstrated self-paced treadmill mode is important for virtual reality systems with multiple movement scenarios in order to elicit more natural gait across various terrain. Fixed-speed treadmills may induce gait compensations to maintain the fixed speed."
