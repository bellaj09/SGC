Virtual Reality VR technology is a relatively new application to rehabilitation medicine yet it offers considerable potential to achieve significant successes in assessment treatment and improved outcome thereby increasing our knowledge of neuroplasticity. The capabilities of VR are especially evident in neurological rehabilitation where cognitive and behavioural problems often interact with physical impairments to reduce the overall level of functioning and interaction. The need for effective interventions in neurological rehabilitation demands communication and collaboration between disciplines. This paper presents some of the current areas of the clinical applications of VR emphasising the link between experimental evidence on recovery after brain damage and the clinical problems encountered in a ward setting.
