With the emerging interest in local field potentials LFPs as input signals for brain-machine interfaces there is a need for integrated circuits capable of amplifying spikes and LFPs. A two-stage complementary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS amplifier-filter has been implemented with 0.18-m CMOS for simultaneous multimodal recording of extracellular unit spikes and LFPs. For the frequency tuning and the reduction of the 1/f noise it employs a switched-capacitor technique. The filter bandwidth is reconfigurable by using a different sampling clock frequency. The prototype amplifier has gains of 19.1 dB and 37.5 dB for low-pass only filter and cascaded filter respectively. With a 100-kHz sampling frequency the equivalent input noise spectral density is 38.8 nV/Hz while the total power consumption is 69 W with a 1.6-V supply including clock generation and biasing occupying an area of 44  148 m2. A tunable biquad switched-capacitor amplifier-filter for neural recording.
