"This paper presents a preprocessing technique for improving the classification of electroencephalographic EEG data in brain-computer interfaces BCI for the case of realistic measuring conditions such as low signal-to-noise ratio SNR reduced number of measuring electrodes and reduced amount of data used to train the classifier. The proposed method is based on a linear minimum mean squared error LMMSE spatial filter specifically designed to improve the SNR of the signals before being classified. The design parameters of the spatial filter are obtained through an optimized version of Fishers linear discriminant FLD whose area under the receiver operating characteristics ROC curve is maximized. The combination of the spatial filter and the optimized FLD increases the SNR and changes the spatial distribution of the measured signals. As a result the signals can be more easily discriminated by means of a simple sign detector or threshold-based classifier. A series of experiments on simulated EEG data compare the performance of the proposed classification scheme to the performance of the Mahalanobis distance-based classifier which is widely used in BCI systems. Numerical results show that the proposed preprocessing technique enhances the classifiers performance even for low SNR conditions and few measurements while the Mahalanobis classifier is not reliable under such realistic operating conditions. Furthermore real EEG data from a self-paced key typing experiment is used to demonstrate the applicability of the preprocessing technique. The proposed method has the potential of improving the efficiency of real-life BCI systems as well as reducing the computational complexity associated with their implementation."
