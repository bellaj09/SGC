Cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension as well as the cardiovascular treatment with Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers ARBs are claimed once again as mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS during the COVID-19 outbreak due to Cov-2 epidemics. In vitro studies are available to support the eventual role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in both the promotion and antagonism of the disease. The available literature indeed presents contrasting results all concentrated in experimental models. Evidence in humans is lacking that those mechanisms are\xa0actually occurring in the present COVID-19 outbreak. Here we present the reasoned statement of the Italian Society of Hypertension to maintain ongoing antihypertensive treatments. Furthermore the Italian Society of Hypertension presents its own initiative to investigate the issue using an online questionnaire to collect relevant data in human disease. Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibition in Cardiovascular Patients at the Time of COVID19: Much Ado for Nothing? A Statement of Activity from the Directors of the Board and the Scientific Directors of the Italian Society of Hypertension.
