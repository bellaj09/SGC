"Skin plays an important role in mediating our interactions with the world. Recreating the properties of skin using electronic devices could have profound implications for prosthetics and medicine. The pursuit of artificial skin has inspired innovations in materials to imitate skins unique characteristics including mechanical durability and stretchability biodegradability and the ability to measure a diversity of complex sensations over large areas. New materials and fabrication strategies are being developed to make mechanically compliant and multifunctional skin-like electronics and improve brain/machine interfaces that enable transmission of the skins signals into the body. This Review will cover materials and devices designed for mimicking the skins ability to sense and generate biomimetic signals." Pursuing prosthetic electronic skin.
