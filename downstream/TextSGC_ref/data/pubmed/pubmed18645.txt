"Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgical systems enable procedures with reduced pain recovery time and scarring compared to traditional surgery. While these improvements benefit a large number of patients safe access to diseased sites is not always possible for specialized patient groups including pediatric patients due to their anatomical differences. We propose a patient-specific design paradigm that leverages the surgeons expertise to design and fabricate robots based on preoperative medical images. The components of the patient-specific robot design process are a virtual reality design interface enabling the surgeon to design patient-specific tools 3-D printing of these tools with a biodegradable polyester and an actuation and control system for deployment. The designed robot is a concentric tube robot a type of continuum robot constructed from precurved elastic nesting tubes. We demonstrate the overall patient-specific design workflow from preoperative images to physical implementation for an example clinical scenario: nonlinear renal access to a pediatric kidney. We also measure the systems behavior as it is deployed through real and artificial tissue. System integration and successful benchtop experiments in ex vivo liver and in a phantom patient model demonstrate the feasibility of using a patient-specific design workflow to plan fabricate and deploy personalized flexible continuum robots."
