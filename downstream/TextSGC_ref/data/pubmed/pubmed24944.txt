The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and suitability of virtual reality VR as a pain distraction for pediatric intravenous i.v. placement. Twenty children 12 boys 8 girls requiring i.v. placement for a magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography MRI/CT scan were randomly assigned to two conditions: 1 VR distraction using Street Luge 5DT presented via a head-mounted display or 2 standard of care topical anesthetic with no distraction. Children their parents and nurses completed self-report questionnaires that assessed numerous health-related outcomes. Responses from the Faces Pain Scale-Revised indicated a fourfold increase in affective pain within the control condition; by contrast no significant differences were detected within the VR condition. Significant associations between multiple measures of anticipatory anxiety affective pain i.v. pain intensity and measures of past procedural pain provided support for the complex interplay of a multimodal assessment of pain perception. There was also a sufficient amount of evidence supporting the efficacy of Street Luge as a pediatric pain distraction tool during i.v. placement: an adequate level of presence no simulator sickness and significantly more child- parent- and nurse-reported satisfaction with pain management. VR pain distraction was positively endorsed by all reporters and is a promising tool for decreasing pain and anxiety in children undergoing acute medical interventions. However further research with larger sample sizes and other routine medical procedures is warranted. Effectiveness of virtual reality for pediatric pain distraction during i.v. placement.
