Previous brain-computer interface BCI research has largely focused on single neuroimaging modalities such as near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography TCD. However multimodal brain-computer interfaces which combine signals from different brain modalities have been suggested as a potential means of improving the accuracy of BCI systems. In this paper we compare the classification accuracies attainable using NIRS signals alone TCD signals alone and a combination of NIRS and TCD signals. Nine able-bodied subjects mean age=25.7 were recruited and simultaneous measurements were made with NIRS and TCD instruments while participants were prompted to perform a verbal fluency task or to remain at rest within the context of a block-stimulus paradigm. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis the verbal fluency task was classified at mean accuracies of 76.19.9% 79.410.3% and 86.56.0% using NIRS TCD and NIRS-TCD systems respectively. In five of nine participants classification accuracies with the NIRS-TCD system were significantly higher p<0.05 than with NIRS or TCD systems alone. Our results suggest that multimodal neuroimaging may be a promising method of improving the accuracy of future brain-computer interfaces.
