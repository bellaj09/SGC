Simulation training in endovascular surgery provides opportunities for trainees to practice and learn from non-patient based experience. Several types of endovascular simulators are available commercially. Previous studies on endovascular simulation training can be categorized into trials in which only a simulator was used when measuring performance metrics or "trials within simulation"; patient specific procedure rehearsals; and randomized controlled trials RCTs or translational studies.
