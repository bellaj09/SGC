The brain computer interface BCI can be used to control external devices directly through electroencephalogram EEG information. A multi-linear principal component analysis MPCA framework was used for the limitations of tensor form of multichannel EEG signals processing based on traditional principal component analysis PCA and two-dimensional principal component analysis 2DPCA. Based on MPCA we used the projection of tensor-matrix to achieve the goal of dimensionality reduction and features exaction. Then we used the Fisher linear classifier to classify the features. Furthermore we used this novel method on the BCI competition II dataset 4 and BCI competition N dataset 3 in the experiment. The second-order tensor representation of time-space EEG data and the third-order tensor representation of time-space-frequency BEG data were used. The best results that were superior to those from other dimensionality reduction methods were obtained by much debugging on parameter P and testQ. For two-order tensor the highest accuracy rates could be achieved as 81.0% and 40.1% and for three-order tensor the highest accuracy rates were 76.0% and 43.5% respectively.
