Persecutory delusions are a major psychiatric problem and are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes. Our theoretical model views these delusions as unfounded threat beliefs which persist due to defence behaviours e.g. avoidance that prevent disconfirmatory evidence being processed. The treatment implications are that patients need to 1 go into feared situations and 2 not use defence behaviours. This enables relearning of safety and hence paranoia diminution. However this is very difficult for patients due to their severe anxiety. A solution is to use virtual reality VR social situations which are graded in difficulty and which patients find much easier to enter. We have now automated the provision of cognitive therapy within VR using an avatar coach so that a therapist is not required and the treatment is scalable. In the THRIVE trial the automated VR cognitive treatment will be tested against a VR control condition. It will contribute to our wider programme of work developing VR for patients with psychosis.
