High-throughput genomic technologies yield about 20000 variants in the protein-coding exome of each individual. A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes CDG server which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.
