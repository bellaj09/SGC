A new model has been established in the domestic pig for neural prosthetic device development and testing. To this end we report on a complete neural prosthetic developmental system using a wireless sensor as the implant a pig as the animal model and a novel data acquisition paradigm for actuator control. A new type of stereotactic frame with clinically-inspired fixations pins that place the pig brain in standard surgical plane was developed and tested with success during the implantation of the microsystem. The microsystem implanted was an ultra-low power 12.5 mW 16-channel intracortical/epicranial device transmitting broadband 40 kS/s data over a wireless infrared telemetric link. Pigs were implanted and neural data was collected over a period of 5 weeks clearly showing single unit spiking activity. Developing implantable neuroprosthetics: a new model in pig.
