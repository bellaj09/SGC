"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic region is an established therapy for advanced Parkinsons disease PD. However patients often require time-intensive post-operative management to balance their coupled stimulation and medication treatments. Given the large and complex parameter space associated with this task we propose that clinical decision support systems CDSS based on machine learning algorithms could assist in treatment optimization."
