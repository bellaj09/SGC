The oddball protocol is often used in brain-computer interfaces BCIs to induce P300 ERPs although recently some issues have been shown to detrimentally effect its performance. In this paper we study a new periodic protocol and explore whether it can compete with the standard oddball protocol within the context of a BCI mouse. We found that the new protocol consistently and significantly outperforms the standard oddball protocol in relation to information transfer rates 33 bits/min for the former and 22 bits/min for the latter measured at 90% accuracy as well as P300 amplitudes. Furthermore we performed a comparison of two periodic protocols with two less conventional oddball-like protocols that reveals the importance of the interactions between task and sequence in determining the success of a protocol. Novel protocols for P300-based brain-computer interfaces.
