Human driving behaviors are personalized and unique and the automobile fingerprint of drivers could be helpful to automatically identify different driving behaviors and further be applied in fields such as auto-theft systems. Current research suggests that in-vehicle Controller Area Network-BUS CAN-BUS data can be used as an effective representation of driving behavior for recognizing different drivers. However it is difficult to capture complex temporal features of driving behaviors in traditional methods. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework by fusing convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism which is more suitable for time series CAN-BUS sensor data. The proposed method can automatically learn features of driving behaviors and model temporal features without professional knowledge in features modeling. Moreover the method can capture salient structure features of high-dimensional sensor data and explore the correlations among multi-sensor data for rich feature representations of driving behaviors. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well in the real world driving behavior identification task outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
