We propose a novel approach for measuring the stationarity level of multichannel time-series. This measure is based on stationarity definition over time-varying spectra and aims to quantify the relationship between local single-channel dynamics and global multichannel dynamics stationarity. With the purpose of separate among several motor/imagery tasks we asssume that movement imagination implies an increase on the EEG variability consequently as discriminant features we first compute the non-stationary components of input signals and we further obtain its stationary level throughout the proposed measure. To assess the separability level of the proposed features we employ the t-student test. Obtained results evidence that our measure is able to accurately detect brain areas projected on the scalp where motor tasks are performed. Entropy-based multichannel measure of stationarity for characterization of motor imagery patterns.
