Inspired by the outstanding performance of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs nowadays modern computer-aided detection CAD systems for CT lung nodules generally delve into 2D or 3D CNNs directly without considering traditional image preprocessing techniques. However detection of large pulmonary nodules and masses are computationally challenging especially for 3D CNNs. In this paper we examine the possibility of using volume visualized CT thin-slab images with 2D CNNs to reduce computation complexity and improve CAD performance. We tested 4 types of images: original 2D CT 2D projection of thin slabs mixture by arranging original and projection in different color channels and mixture by the pixelwise maximum intensity of original CT and projection. We evaluated these images on a dataset of 30 CT scans with 30 different-sized nodules and masses on GoogLeNet via a transfer learning and cross validation paradigm. We found that projection visualization alone had a better or equal area-under curve score for all the different-sized nodules and masses. However mixture by the maximum of CT and projection demonstrated a preferred performance with a true positive rate of 0.8 and a false positive rate of 0.046 in detecting large nodules and masses.
