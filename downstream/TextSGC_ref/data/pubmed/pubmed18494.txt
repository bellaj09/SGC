Current approaches to food volume estimation require the person to carry a fiducial marker e.g. a checkerboard card to be placed next to the food before taking a picture. This procedure is inconvenient and post-processing of the food picture is time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. These problems keep people from using the smartphone for self-administered dietary assessment. The current bioengineering study presents a novel smartphone-based imaging approach to table-side estimation of food volume which overcomes current limitations. Image-based food portion size estimation using a smartphone without a fiducial marker.
