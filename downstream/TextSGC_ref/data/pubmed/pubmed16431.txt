"In recent days deep learning technologies have achieved tremendous success in computer vision-related tasks with the help of large-scale annotated dataset. Obtaining such dataset for medical image analysis is very challenging. Working with the limited dataset and small amount of annotated samples makes it difficult to develop a robust automated disease diagnosis model. We propose a novel approach to generate synthetic medical images using generative adversarial networks GANs. Our proposed model can create brain PET images for three different stages of Alzheimers disease-normal control NC mild cognitive impairment MCI and Alzheimers disease AD."
