"Understanding the visiospatial aspects of anatomic structures is one of the most important aspects of studying gross anatomy. In this paper we are describing a tool that self-constructs 3D virtual body structures VBS right in-front-of your-eyes. Furthermore manipulation capabilities such as translucent visualization interactive rotation translation and scaling incorporated into VBS facilitate fundamental learning experience that leads one to build 3D models in the mind providing a validation of computer-assisted individual learning. Creating 3-D virtual body structures from actual human data has long been a dream of many computer scientists and Medical doctors. Now with the advances in computer hardware and software technologies our Virtual Body Structure technique and the Visible Human project that dream is becoming a reality."
