When the brain is stimulated for example by sensory inputs or goal-oriented tasks the brain initially responds with activities in specific areas. The subsequent pattern formation of functional networks is constrained by the structural connectivity SC of the brain. The extent to which information is processed over short- or long-range SC is unclear. Whole-brain models based on long-range axonal connections for example can partly describe measured functional connectivity dynamics at rest. Here we study the effect of SC on the network response to stimulation. We use a human whole-brain network model comprising long- and short-range connections. We systematically activate each cortical or thalamic area and investigate the network response as a function of its short- and long-range SC. We show that when the brain is operating at the edge of criticality stimulation causes a cascade of network recruitments collapsing onto a smaller space that is partly constrained by SC. We found both short- and long-range SC essential to reproduce experimental results. In particular the stimulation of specific areas results in the activation of one or more resting-state networks. We suggest that the stimulus-induced brain activity which may indicate information and cognitive processing follows specific routes imposed by structural networks explaining the emergence of functional networks. We provide a lookup table linking stimulation targets and functional network activations which potentially can be useful in diagnostics and treatments with brain stimulation.
