Manual ultrasound US-based methods are adapted for lumen diameter LD measurement to estimate the risk of stroke but they are tedious error prone and subjective causing variability. We propose an automated deep learning DL-based system for lumen detection. The system consists of a combination of two DL systems: encoder and decoder for lumen segmentation. The encoder employs a 13-layer convolution neural network model CNN for rich feature extraction. The decoder employs three up-sample layers of fully convolution network FCN for lumen segmentation. Three sets of manual tracings were used during the training paradigm leading to the design of three DL systems. Cross-validation protocol was implemented for all three DL systems. Using the polyline distance metric the precision of merit for three DL systems over 407 US scans was 99.61% 97.75% and 99.89% respectively. The Jaccard index and Dice similarity of DL lumen segmented region against three ground truth GT regions were 0.94 0.94 and 0.93 and 0.97 0.97 and 0.97 respectively. The corresponding AUC for three DL systems was 0.95 0.91 and 0.93. The experimental results demonstrated superior performance of proposed deep learning system over conventional methods in literature.
