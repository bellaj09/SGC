An integrated environment for the analysis of chemical bonding based on immersive virtual reality is presented. Using a multiscreen stereoscopic projection system researchers are cast into the world of atoms and molecules where they can visualize at a human scale the electron charge rearrangement computed via state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods occurring on bond formation throughout the molecular region. Thanks to specifically designed features such a virtual laboratory couples the immediacy of an immersive experience with a powerful recently developed method yielding quantitative spatially detailed pictures of the several charge flows involved in the formation of a chemical bond. By means of two case studies on organometallic complexes we show how familiar concepts in coordination chemistry such as donation and back-donation charge flows can be effectively identified and quantified to predict experimental observables.
