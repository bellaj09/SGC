Implicit racial biases are one of the most vexing problems facing current society. These split-second judgments are not only widely prevalent but also are notoriously difficult to overcome. Perhaps most concerning implicit racial biases can have consequential impacts on decisions in the courtroom where scholars have been unable to provide a viable mitigation strategy. This article examines the influence of a short virtual reality paradigm on implicit racial biases and evaluations of legal scenarios. After embodying a black avatar in the virtual world participants produced significantly lower implicit racial bias scores than those who experienced a sham version of the virtual reality paradigm. Additionally these participants more conservatively evaluated an ambiguous legal case rating vague evidence as less indicative of guilt and rendering more Not Guilty verdicts. As the first experiment of its kind this study demonstrates the potential of virtual reality to address implicit racial bias in the courtroom setting. The impact of virtual reality on implicit racial bias and mock legal decisions.
