Machine learning and deep learning are rapidly finding applications in the medical imaging field. In this paper we address the long-standing problem of metal artifacts in computed tomography CT images by training a dual-stream deep convolutional neural network for streak removal. While many metal artifact reduction methods exist even state-of-the-art algorithms fall short in some clinical applications. Specifically proton therapy planning requires high image quality with accurate tumor volumes to ensure treatment success. We explore a dual-stream deep network structure with residual learning to correct metal streak artifacts after a first-pass by a state-of-the-art interpolation-based algorithm NMAR. We provide the network with a mask of the streaks in order to focus attention on those areas. Our experiments compare a mean squared error loss function with a perceptual loss function to emphasize preservation of image features and texture. Both visual and quantitative metrics are used to assess the resulting image quality for metal implant cases. Success may be due to the duality of information processing with one network stream performing local structure correction while the other stream provides an attention mechanism to destreak effectively. This study shows that image-domain deep learning can be highly effective for metal artifact reduction MAR and highlights the benefits and drawbacks of different loss functions for solving a major CT reconstruction challenge.
