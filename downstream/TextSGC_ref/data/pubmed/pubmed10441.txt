Blood analysis is an indispensable means of detection in criminal investigation customs security and quarantine anti-poaching of wildlife and other incidents. Detecting the species of blood is one of the most important analyses. In order to classify species by analyzing Raman spectra of blood a recognition method based on deep learning principle is proposed in this paper. This method can realize multi-identification blood species by constructing a one-dimensional convolution neural network and establishing a Raman spectra database containing 20 kinds of blood. The network model is obtained through training and then is employed to predict the testing set data. The average accuracy of blind detection is more than 97%. In this paper we try to increase the diversity of data to improve the robustness of the model optimize the network and adjust the hyperparameters to improve the recognition ability of the model. The evaluation results show that the deep learning model has high recognition performance to distinguish the species of blood. Blood species identification based on deep learning analysis of Raman spectra.
