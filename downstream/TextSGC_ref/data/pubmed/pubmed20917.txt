"Significant proportion of psychological problems related to combat stress in recent large peacekeeping operations underscores importance of effective methods for strengthening the stress resistance of military personnel. Adaptive control of virtual reality VR stimulation based on estimation of the subjects emotional state from physiological signals may enhance existing stress inoculation training SIT. Physiology-driven adaptive VR stimulation can tailor the progress of stressful stimuli delivery to the physiological characteristics of each individual which is indicated for improvement in stress resistance. Therefore following an overview of SIT and its applications in the military setting generic concept of physiology-driven adaptive VR stimulation is presented in the paper. Toward the end of the paper closed-loop adaptive control strategy applicable to SIT is outlined." Stress inoculation training supported by physiology-driven adaptive virtual reality stimulation.
