Brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation during awake craniotomy is now a standard procedure that reduces the risk of permanent neurologic deficits. Virtual reality technology immerses the patient in a virtually controlled interactive world offering a unique opportunity to develop innovative tasks for perioperative mapping of complex cognitive functions. The objective of this prospective single-center study was to evaluate the tolerance and safety of a virtual reality headset VRH and immersive virtual experiences in patients undergoing awake craniotomy and brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation.
