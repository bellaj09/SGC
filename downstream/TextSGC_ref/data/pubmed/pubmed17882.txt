"Objective To compare the values of elasticity imagingEIand Virtual Touch TM tissue imaging and quantificationVTIQin diagnosing thyroid nodules and explore the factors influencing the accuracy of these two techniques.Methods Totally 62 patients who were planned to receive surgery for thyroid nodules underwent conventional ultrasoundEIand VTIQ examinations.EI patterns were scored according to the degree and distribution of strainthe strain of nodule and surrounding normal reference tissue were measuredand then strain index was calculated.Shear wave velocity in nodules were obtained under VTIQ mode.Results The nodules were malignant in 40 patients and benign in 22 patients.When the strain score of 3 was regarded as malignantthe diagnostic sensitivityspecificityand accuracy of EI in detecting thyroid nodules were 90.00%31.82%and 69.32%respectively.Receiver operating characteristic curve results showed that the area under curves of EI-SI and VTIQ methods for diagnosing thyroid nodules was 77.8%95%CI:0.64-0.91P=0.000and 74.3%95%CI:0.62-0.87P=0.002respectively.Thyroid nodules characteristics locationP=0.04and sizeP=0.02were correlated with the diagnostic accuracy of EI.The accuracy of SI and VTIQ were not affected by thyroid nodules characteristicsP>0.05.Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of EI for thyroid nodules is related to nodules characteristics.EI combined with semi-quantitative SI and quantitative VTIQ can effectively improve the diagnostic capability for thyroid nodules."
