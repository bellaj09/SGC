The hybrid brain computer interface hBCI could provide higher information transfer rate than did the classical BCIs. It included more than one brain-computer or human-machine interact paradigms such as the combination of the P300 and SSVEP paradigms. Research firstly constructed independent subsystems of three different paradigms and tested each of them with online experiments. Then we constructed a serial hybrid BCI system which combined these paradigms to achieve the functions of typing letters moving and clicking cursor and switching among them for the purpose of browsing webpages. Five subjects were involved in this study. They all successfully realized these functions in the online tests. The subjects could achieve an accuracy above 90% after training which met the requirement in operating the system efficiently. The results demonstrated that it was an efficient system capable of robustness which provided an approach for the clinic application. An online hybrid brain-computer interface combining multiple physiological signals for webpage browse.
