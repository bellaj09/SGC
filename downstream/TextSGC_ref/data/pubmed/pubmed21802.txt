The computer-aided craniofacial reconstruction CFR technique has been widely used in the fields of criminal investigation archaeology anthropology and cosmetic surgery. The evaluation of craniofacial reconstruction results is important for improving the effect of craniofacial reconstruction. Here we used the sparse principal component analysis SPCA method to evaluate the similarity between two sets of craniofacial data. Compared with principal component analysis PCA SPCA can effectively reduce the dimensionality and simultaneously produce sparse principal components with sparse loadings thus making it easy to explain the results. The experimental results indicated that the evaluation results of PCA and SPCA are consistent to a large extent. To compare the inconsistent results we performed a subjective test which indicated that the result of SPCA is superior to that of PCA. Most importantly SPCA can not only compare the similarity of two craniofacial datasets but also locate regions of high similarity which is important for improving the craniofacial reconstruction effect. In addition the areas or features that are important for craniofacial similarity measurements can be determined from a large amount of data. We conclude that the craniofacial contour is the most important factor in craniofacial similarity evaluation. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusions of psychological experiments on face recognition and our subjective test. The results may provide important guidance for three- or two-dimensional face similarity evaluation analysis and face recognition.
