This study investigated changes in intra- and inter-regional functional connectivity FC in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa RP by using regional homogeneity ReHo and FC methods. Sixteen RP individuals and 14 healthy controls HCs underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans fMRI. A combined ReHo and FC method was conducted to evaluate synchronization of brain activity. Compared with HCs RP individuals had significantly lower ReHo values in the bilateral lingual gyrus/cerebellum posterior lobe LGG/CPL. In FC analysis the RP group showed decreased positive FC relative to the HC group from bilateral LGG/CPL to bilateral LGG/cuneus CUN and to left postcentral gyrus PosCG. In contrast the RP group showed increased negative FC relative to the HC group from bilateral LGG/CPL to bilateral thalamus and decreased negative FC from bilateral LGG/CPL to right middle frontal gyrus MFG and to left inferior parietal lobule IPL. Moreover ReHo values of the bilateral LGG/CPL showed negative correlations with the duration of RP. FC values of the bilateral LGG/CPL-left IPL showed negative correlations with best-corrected visual acuity BCVA of the right eye and left eye in RP individuals. Our results reveal reduced synchronicity of neural activity changes in the primary visual area in RP individuals. Moreover RP individuals showed intrinsic visual network disconnection and reorganization of the retino-thalamocortical pathway and dorsal visual stream suggesting impaired visuospatial and stereoscopic vision. Altered intra- and inter-regional functional connectivity of the visual cortex in individuals with peripheral vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa.
