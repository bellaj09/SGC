The combination of graph theoretical approaches and neuroimaging data provides a powerful way to explore the characteristics of brain network. Recently the temporal variability of spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity has attracted wide attention. Thus it is essential to evaluate the reliability of functional network connectivity and properties from the dynamic perspective. However previous test-retest TRT studies have explored this reliability with a static point of view. In this study using a large rs-fMRI dataset from Human Connectome Project HCP we investigated TRT reliability of functional connectivity and graph metrics derived from the most commonly used method- sliding window at three time intervals short: 72 seconds middle: 15 minutes and long: >24 hours. The results revealed that reliable connectivities and related brain regions are mainly distributed in primary cortex such as visual area and sensorimotor area and default mode network. Notably connectivity strength and global efficiency have better reliability than other metrics. Finally short scan time interval and long scan duration can increase the TRT reliability of metrics. Findings of present study provide important guidance for searching reliable network markers in future research.
