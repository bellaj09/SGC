Social media is a useful platform to share health-related information due to its vast reach. This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction ADR mentions from social media particularly from Twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text as compared to more technical and formal medical reports.
