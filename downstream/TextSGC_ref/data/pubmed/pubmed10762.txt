"The neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis CAD for Alzheimers disease AD has shown its effectiveness in recent years. In general the multimodal neuroimaging-based CAD always outperforms the approaches based on a single modality. However single-modal neuroimaging is more favored in clinical practice for diagnosis due to the limitations of imaging devices especially in rural hospitals. Learning using privileged information LUPI is a new learning paradigm that adopts additional privileged information PI modality to help to train a more effective learning model during the training stage but PI itself is not available in the testing stage. Since PI is generally related to the training samples it is then transferred to the learned model. In this work a LUPI-based CAD framework for AD is proposed. It can flexibly perform a classifier- or feature-level LUPI in which the information is transferred from the additional PI modality to the diagnosis modality. A thorough comparison has been made among three classifier-level algorithms and five feature-level LUPI algorithms. The experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that all classifier-level and deep learning based feature-level LUPI algorithms can improve the performance of a single-modal neuroimaging-based CAD for AD by transferring PI.
