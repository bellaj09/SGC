A brain-computer interface BCI based on motor imagery EEG uses information extracted from the electroencephalography signals generated by a person who intends to perform any action. One of the most important issues of current research is how to detect automatically whether the user intends to send some message to a certain device. This study presents a proposal based on a hierarchical structured system for recognising intentional and non-intentional mental tasks on a BCI system by applying machine learning techniques to the EEG signals. First-level clustering is performed to distinguish between intentional control IC and non-intentional control NC state patterns. Then the patterns recognised as IC are passed on to a second stage where supervised learning techniques are used to classify them. In BCI applications it is critical to correctly classify NC states with a low false positive rate FPR to avoid undesirable effects. According to the literature we selected a maximum FPR of 10%. Under these conditions our proposal achieved an average test accuracy of 66.6% with an 8.2% FPR for the BCI competition IIIa dataset. The main contribution of this paper is the hierarchical approach based on machine learning paradigms which performs intentional and non-intentional discrimination and depending on the case classifies the intended command selected by the user. A hierarchical architecture for recognising intentionality in mental tasks on a brain-computer interface.
