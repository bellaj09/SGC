Most EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI paradigms include specific electrode positions. As the structures and activities of the brain vary with each individual contributing channels should be chosen based on original records of BCIs. Phase measurement is an important approach in EEG analyses but seldom used for channel selections. In this paper the phase locking and concentrating value-based recursive feature elimination approach PLCV-RFE is proposed to produce robust-EEG channel selections in a P300 speller. The PLCV-RFE deriving from the phase resetting mechanism measures the phase relation between EEGs and ranks channels by the recursive strategy. Data recorded from 32 electrodes on 9 subjects are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the PLCV-RFE substantially reduces channel sets and improves recognition accuracies significantly. Moreover compared with other state-of-the-art feature selection methods SSNRSF and SVM-RFE the PLCV-RFE achieves better performance. Thus the phase measurement is available in the channel selection of BCI and it may be an evidence to indirectly support that phase resetting is at least one reason for ERP generations.
