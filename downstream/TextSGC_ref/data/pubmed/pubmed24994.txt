This article details the design of a co-created evidence-based biofeedback therapy game addressing the research question: is the biofeedback implementation efficient effective and engaging for promoting quality movement during a therapy game focused on hand gestures? First we engaged nine young people with Cerebral Palsy CP as design partners to co-create the biofeedback implementation. A commercially available tap-controlled game was converted into a gesture-controlled game with added biofeedback. The game is controlled by forearm electromyography and inertial sensors. Changes required to integrate biofeedback are described in detail and highlight the importance of closely linking movement quality to short- and long-term game rewards. After development 19 participants 8-17\xa0years old with CP played the game at home for 4\xa0weeks. Participants played 17\xa0\xa09 min/day 4\xa0\xa01 day/week. The biofeedback implementation proved efficient i.e. participants reduced compensatory arm movements by 10.2\xa0\xa04.0% effective i.e. participants made higher quality gestures over time and engaging i.e. participants consistently chose to review biofeedback. Participants found the game usable and enjoyable. Biofeedback design in therapy games should consider principles of motor learning best practices in video game design and user perspectives. Design recommendations for integrating biofeedback into therapy games are compiled in an infographic to support interdisciplinary knowledge sharing.
