"This paper describes a study protocol to investigate the use of immersive virtual reality as a treatment for amputees phantom limb pain. This work builds upon prior research using mirror box therapy to induce vivid sensations of movement originating from the muscles and joints of amputees phantom limbs. The present project transposes movements of amputees anatomical limbs into movements of a virtual limb presented in the phenomenal space of their phantom limb. It is anticipated that the protocol described here will help reduce phantom limb pain." Immersive virtual reality as a rehabilitative technology for phantom limb experience: a protocol.
