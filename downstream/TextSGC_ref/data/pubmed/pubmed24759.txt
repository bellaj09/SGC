In this paper we describe a multiplayer brain-computer interface BCI based on the classic game of checkers using steady-state visually evoked potentials SSVEPs. Previous research in BCI gaming focuses mainly on the production of software-based games using a computer screen--few hardware-based BCI games using a physical board have been developed. Hardware-based games can present a unique set of challenges when compared to software-based games. Depending on where the user is sitting some stimuli might be farther away from the player at a steeper viewing angle conflated with competing stimuli or occluded by physical barriers. In our game we light squares on a checkerboard with flickering LEDs to elicit SSVEP responses in the subjects. When a subject attends to a particular square the resulting SSVEPs are classified and a robot arm moves the selected piece. In a set of pilot experiments we investigated the ability of two subjects to use the SSVEP-based hardware game platform and assessed how interstimulus distance interstimulus angle distance between target stimulus and subject number of competing stimuli and visual occlusions of the stimuli influence classification accuracy.
