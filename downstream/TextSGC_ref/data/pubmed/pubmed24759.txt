The use of robotic systems for colorectal resections is well documented but robotic surgery is not yet established as a substitute for all laparoscopic colorectal procedures. The features of the new-generation robotic system seem to be well suited for proper mesorectal excision with the identification and preservation of autonomic pelvic nerves. Proper training in the use of robotic skills is essential. A lifelike patient simulator for teaching robotic colorectal surgery: how to acquire skills for robotic rectal dissection.
