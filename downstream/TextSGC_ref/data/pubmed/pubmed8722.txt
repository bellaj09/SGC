The classification and recognition technology of underwater acoustic signal were always an important research content in the field of underwater acoustic signal processing. Currently wavelet transform Hilbert-Huang transform and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients are used as a method of underwater acoustic signal feature extraction. In this paper a method for feature extraction and identification of underwater noise data based on CNN and ELM is proposed. An automatic feature extraction method of underwater acoustic signals is proposed using depth convolution network. An underwater target recognition classifier is based on extreme learning machine. Although convolution neural networks can execute both feature extraction and classification their function mainly relies on a full connection layer which is trained by gradient descent-based; the generalization ability is limited and suboptimal so an extreme learning machine ELM was used in classification stage. Firstly CNN learns deep and robust features followed by the removing of the fully connected layers. Then ELM fed with the CNN features is used as the classifier to conduct an excellent classification. Experiments on the actual data set of civil ships obtained 93.04% recognition rate; compared to the traditional Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Hilbert-Huang feature recognition rate greatly improved.
