The aim of this study was to explore how people use egocentric i.e. with respect to their body and allocentric i.e. with respect to another element in the environment references in combination with coordinate metric or categorical abstract spatial information to identify a target element. Participants were asked to memorize triads of 3D objects or 2D figures and immediately or after a delay of 5\xa0s they had to verbally indicate what was the object/figure: 1 closest/farthest to them egocentric coordinate task; 2 on their right/left egocentric categorical task; 3 closest/farthest to another object/figure allocentric coordinate task; 4 on the right/left of another object/figure allocentric categorical task. Results showed that the use of 2D figures favored categorical judgments over the coordinate ones with either an egocentric or an allocentric reference frame whereas the use of 3D objects specifically favored egocentric coordinate judgments rather than the allocentric ones. Furthermore egocentric judgments were more accurate than allocentric judgments when the response was Immediate rather than delayed and 3D objects rather than 2D figures were used. This pattern of results is discussed in the light of the functional roles attributed to the frames of reference and spatial relations by relevant theories of visuospatial processing. Frames of reference and categorical/coordinate spatial relations in a "what was where" task.
