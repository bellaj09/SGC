"Brain tumor detection depicts a tough job because of its shape size and appearance variations. In this manuscript a deep learning model is deployed to predict input slices as a tumor unhealthy/non-tumor healthy. This manuscript employs a high pass filter image to prominent the inhomogeneities field effect of the MR slices and fused with the input slices. Moreover the median filter is applied to the fused slices. The resultant slices quality is improved with smoothen and highlighted edges of the input slices. After that based on these slices intensity a 4-connected seed growing algorithm is applied where optimal threshold clusters the similar pixels from the input slices. The segmented slices are then supplied to the fine-tuned two layers proposed stacked sparse autoencoder SSAE model. The hyperparameters of the model are selected after extensive experiments. At the first layer 200 hidden units and at the second layer 400 hidden units are utilized. The testing is performed on the softmax layer for the prediction of the images having tumors and no tumors. The suggested model is trained and checked on BRATS datasets i.e. 2012challenge and synthetic 2013 and 2013 Leaderboard 2014 and 2015 datasets. The presented model is evaluated with a number of performance metrics which demonstrates the improved performance." Brain Tumor Detection by Using Stacked Autoencoders in Deep Learning.
