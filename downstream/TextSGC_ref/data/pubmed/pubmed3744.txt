Healthy aging has been associated with a decrease in functional network specialization. Importantly variability of alterations of functional connectivity is especially high across older adults. Whole-brain functional network reorganization though and its impact on cognitive performance within particularly the older generation is still a matter of debate. We assessed resting state functional connectivity RSFC in 772 older adults 55-85 years 421 males using a graph-theoretical approach. Results show overall age-related increases of between- and decreases of within-network RSFC. With similar phenomena observed in young to middle-aged adults i.e. that RSFC reorganizes towards more pronounced functional network integration the current results amend such evidence for the old age. The results furthermore indicate that RSFC reorganization in older adults particularly pertain to early sensory networks e.g. visual and sensorimotor network. Importantly RSFC differences of these early sensory networks were found to be a relevant mediator in terms of the age-related cognitive performance differences. Further we found systematic sex-related network differences with females showing patterns of more segregation i.e. default mode and ventral attention network and males showing a higher integrated network system particularly for the sensorimotor network. These findings underpin the notion of sex-related connectivity differences possibly facilitating sex-related behavioral functioning.
