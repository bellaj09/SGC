Decades of technological developments have populated the field of brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics with several replacement strategies neural modulation treatments and rehabilitation techniques to improve the quality of life for patients affected by sensory and motor disabilities. This field is now quickly expanding thanks to advances in neural interfaces machine learning techniques and robotics. Despite many clinical successes and multiple innovations in animal models brain-machine interfaces remain mainly confined to sophisticated laboratory environments indicating a necessary step forward in the used technology. Interestingly Elon Musk and Neuralink have recently presented a new brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels fast implantation and advanced signal processing. Here how their work takes part in the context of the restoration of sensory-motor functions through neuroprostheses is commented. The Connection Between the Nervous System and Machines: Commentary.
