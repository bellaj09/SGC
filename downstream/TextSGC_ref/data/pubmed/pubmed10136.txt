Sparse coding has been widely applied to learning-based single image super-resolution SR and has obtained promising performance by jointly learning effective representations for low-resolution LR and high-resolution HR image patch pairs. However the resulting HR images often suffer from ringing jaggy and blurring artifacts due to the strong yet ad hoc assumptions that the LR image patch representation is equal to is linear with lies on a manifold similar to or has the same support set as the corresponding HR image patch representation. Motivated by the success of deep learning we develop a data-driven model coupled deep autoencoder CDA for single image SR. CDA is based on a new deep architecture and has high representational capability. CDA simultaneously learns the intrinsic representations of LR and HR image patches and a big-data-driven function that precisely maps these LR representations to their corresponding HR representations. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CDA for single image SR compared to other state-of-the-art methods on Set5 and Set14 datasets.
