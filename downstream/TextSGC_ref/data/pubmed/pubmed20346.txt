"Simulation of the behaviour of elastic objects in real time is one of the present objectives of computer graphics. One of its fields of application lies in virtual reality mainly in surgery simulation systems. Models used for the construction of objects with deformable behaviour in computer graphics are known as deformable models. These have two conflicting characteristics: interactivity and movement realism. The deformable models developed up till now have promoted one characteristic to the detriment of the other. In this paper a new approach is proposed based on boundary element methods BEM. This is characterised by a positive equilibrium between speed and realism and great robustness. These properties along with the experimental results described in this paper permit one to assert that establishing deformable models with BEM is a reliable method to model objects in virtual reality environments for surgery simulation. In addition to that the required elasticity parameters could be obtained experimentally through the use of a pigs liver." A new approach for the real-time simulation of tissue deformations in surgery simulation.
