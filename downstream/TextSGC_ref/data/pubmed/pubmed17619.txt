This article presents in the form of an analytic narrative review a complete picture of the state-of-the-art challenges and perspectives in the field of information and communication technology ICT-based neurocognitive interventions for older adults. The narrative particularly focuses on applications aimed at mild cognitive impairment and similar age-related cognitive deficits which are analyzed in the context of the brain training controversy. Clarifying considerations are provided about the nature and present extent of the brain training debate regarding the possible influence it has on the support received by research and development initiatives dealing with innovative computerized neurocognitive interventions. It is recommended that because of the preliminary nature of most data currently available in this area further research initiatives must be supported in the quest for better effectiveness of computer-based interventions intended for age-related cognitive impairment. The conclusion suggests that advanced ICT-based tools such as virtual and augmented reality technologies are the most fitting platforms for applying nonpharmacological computerized neurocognitive interventions. Computerized neurocognitive interventions in the context of the brain training controversy.
