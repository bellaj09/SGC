ncRNA-protein interactions ncRPIs play an important role in a number of cellular processes such as post-transcriptional modification transcriptional regulation disease progression and development. Since experimental methods are expensive and time-consuming to identify the ncRPIs we proposed a computational method Deep Mining ncRNA-Protein Interactions DM-RPIs for identifying the ncRPIs. In order to descending dimension and excavating hidden information from k-mer frequency of RNA and protein sequences using the Deep Stacking Auto-encoders Networks DSANs model refined the raw data. Three common machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine SVM Random Forest RF and Convolution Neural Network CNN were separately trained as individual predictors and then the three individual predictors were integrated together using stacked ensembling strategy. Based on the RPI2241 dataset DM-RPI obtains an accuracy of 0.851 precision of 0.852 sensitivity of 0.873 specificity of 0.826 and MCC of 0.701 which is promising and pioneering for the prediction of ncRPIs.
