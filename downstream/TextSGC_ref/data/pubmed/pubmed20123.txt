Mobile phones are increasingly associated with accidents while walking. Little is known however about the impact of phone messaging on the actual perception of other pedestrians. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the detection of approaching pedestrians is affected by the sensory modality text or audio of phone messages in young vs. older adults. Phone messages affect the detection of approaching pedestrians in healthy young and older adults immersed in a virtual community environment.
