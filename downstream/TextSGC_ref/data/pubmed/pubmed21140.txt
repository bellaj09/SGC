Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of repetitive task practice by using robotic-assisted gait training RAGT devices including Lokomat for the treatment of lower limb paresis. Virtual reality VR has proved to be a valuable tool to improve neurorehabilitation training. The aim of our pilot randomized clinical trial was to understand the neurophysiological basis of motor function recovery induced by the association between RAGT by using Lokomat device and VR an animated avatar in a 2D VR by studying electroencephalographic EEG oscillations. The role of virtual reality in improving motor performance as revealed by EEG: a randomized clinical trial.
