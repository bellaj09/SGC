"In modern digital applications users often interact with virtual representations of themselves or others called avatars. We examined how these avatars and their perspectives influence stimulus-response compatibility in a Simon task. Participants responded to light/dark blue stimuli with left/right key presses in the presence of a task-irrelevant avatar. Changes in stimulus-response compatibility were used to quantify changes in the mental representation of the task and perspective taking toward this avatar. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that perspective taking for an avatar occurred in orthogonal stimulus-response mappings causing a compatibility effect from the avatars point of view. In the following two experiments we introduced a larger variety of angular disparities between the participant and avatar. In Experiment 3 the Simon effect with lateralized stimulus positions remained largely unaffected by the avatar pointing toward an absence of perspective taking. In Experiment 4 after avatar hand movements were added in order to strengthen the participants sense of agency over the avatar a spatial compatibility effect from the avatars perspective was observed again and hints of the selective use of perspective taking on a trial-by-trial basis were found. Overall the results indicate that users can incorporate the perspective of an avatar into their mental representation of a situation even when this perspective is unnecessary to complete a task but that certain contextual requirements have to be met."
