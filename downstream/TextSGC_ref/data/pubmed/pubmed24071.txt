Children with severe physical impairments require a variety of access options to augmentative and alternative communication AAC and computer technology. Access technologies have continued to develop allowing children with severe motor control impairments greater independence and access to communication. This article will highlight new advances in access technology including eye and head tracking scanning and access to mainstream technology as well as discuss future advances. Considerations for clinical decision-making and implementation of these technologies will be presented along with case illustrations. Access to augmentative and alternative communication: new technologies and clinical decision-making.
