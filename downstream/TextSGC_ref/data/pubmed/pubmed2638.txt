Ubiquitous variability between individuals in visual perception is difficult to standardize and has thus essentially been ignored. Here we construct a quantitative psychophysical measure of illusory rotary motion based on the Pinna-Brelstaff figure PBF in 73 healthy volunteers and investigate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying perceptual variation using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. We acquired fMRI data from a subset of 42 subjects during spontaneous and 3 stimulus conditions: expanding PBF expanding modified-PBF illusion-free and expanding modified-PBF with physical rotation. Brain-wide graph analysis of stimulus-evoked functional connectivity patterns yielded a functionally segregated architecture containing 3 discrete hierarchical networks commonly shared between rest and stimulation conditions. Strikingly communication efficiency and strength between 2 networks predominantly located in visual areas robustly predicted individual perceptual differences solely in the illusory stimulus condition. These unprecedented findings demonstrate that stimulus-dependent not spontaneous dynamic functional integration between distributed brain networks contributes to perceptual variability in humans.
