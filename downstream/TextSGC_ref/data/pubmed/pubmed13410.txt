"Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in the ICU. It is challenging to manage because individual patients respond differently to treatment. Thus tailoring treatment to the individual patient is essential for the best outcomes. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by applying a mixture-of-experts framework to personalize sepsis treatment. The mixture model selectively alternates between neighbor-based kernel and deep reinforcement learning DRL experts depending on patients current history. On a large retrospective cohort this mixture-based approach outperforms physician kernel only and DRL-only experts."
