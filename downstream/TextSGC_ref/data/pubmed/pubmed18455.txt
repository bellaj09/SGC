Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in which patients have difficulties related to inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity. Those patients are in need of a psychological therapy use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT to enhance the way they think and behave. This type of therapy is mostly common in treating patients with anxiety and depression but also is useful in treating autism obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. A major limitation of traditional CBT is that therapists may face difficulty in optimizing patients\ neuropsychological stimulus following a specified treatment plan. Other limitations include availability accessibility and level-of-experience of the therapists. Hence this paper aims to design and simulate a generic cognitive model that can be used as an appropriate alternative treatment to traditional CBT we term as "AR-Therapist." This model takes advantage of the current developments of augmented reality to engage patients in both real and virtual game-based environments.
