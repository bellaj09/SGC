Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains ~79000 brain-active enhancers sets of Hi-C linkages and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci QTLs; and further QTLs associated with chromatin splicing and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression with >88% reconstruction accuracy. It also allows building of a gene regulatory network linking genome-wide association study variants to genes e.g. 321 for schizophrenia. We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model which improves disease prediction by ~6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive functional genomic resource and integrative model for the human brain.
