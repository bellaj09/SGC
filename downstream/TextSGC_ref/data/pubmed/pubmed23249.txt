Imaging is a keystone in understanding and delivery of craniofacial health care. Recent developments in imaging have brought forth many diverse technologies and approaches. This review provides the current status of methods in craniofacial imaging and discusses future needs and directions. New developments in three-dimensional dental and skeletal imaging as well as three-dimensional facial image acquisition and animation of jaw movement and facial expression are reviewed. Visualization and convergence of the data from these technologies for construction of patient-specific models is described. Insights on how these technologies and approaches could impact research education as well as the future of craniofacial health care will be discussed. Current status and future needs in craniofacial imaging.
