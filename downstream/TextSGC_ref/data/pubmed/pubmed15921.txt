Anxiety and stress are very common symptoms of patients facing a forthcoming surgery. However limited time and resources within healthcare systems make the provision of stress relief interventions difficult to provide. Research has shown that provision of preoperative stress relief and educational resources can improve health outcomes and speed recovery. Information and Communication Technology ICT can be a valuable tool in providing stress relief and educational support to patients and family before but also after an operation enabling better self-management and self-empowerment. To this direction this paper reports on the design of a novel technical infrastructure for a resilience support tool for improving the health condition of patients during the care path using Virtual Reality VR. The designed platform targets among others at improving the knowledge on the patient data effectiveness and adherence to treatment as well as providing for effective communication channels between patients and clinicians. iSupport: Building a Resilience Support Tool for Improving the Health Condition of the Patient During the Care Path.
