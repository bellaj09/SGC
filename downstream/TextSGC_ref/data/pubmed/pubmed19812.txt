"One of the most important aspects in neuromotor rehabilitation is the need of feedback for patients. The rehabilitation systems efficiency relies on the therapists judgment; the therapist tells the patient whether he/she is performing the exercises correctly. This process may be quite subjective because it depends on the therapists personal opinion. On the other hand recent studies have shown that vibrotactile biofeedback can improve the effectiveness of interaction as it is a very helpful tool in the physiological process of neuromotor rehabilitation."
