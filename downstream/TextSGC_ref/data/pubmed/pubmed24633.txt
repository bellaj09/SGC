Bi-directional brain-computer interfaces BCIs require simultaneous stimulation and recording to achieve closed-loop operation. It is therefore important that the interface be able to distinguish between neural signals of interest and stimulation artifacts. Current bi-directional BCIs address this problem by temporally multiplexing stimulation and recording. This approach however is suboptimal in many BCI applications. Alternative artifact mitigation methods can be devised by investigating the mechanics of artifact propagation. To characterize stimulation artifact behaviors we collected and analyzed electrocorticography ECoG data from eloquent cortex mapping. Ratcheting and phase-locking of stimulation artifacts were observed as well as dipole-like properties. Artifacts as large as 1100 V appeared as far as 15-37 mm away from the stimulating channel when stimulating at 10 mA. Analysis also showed that the majority of the artifact power was concentrated at the stimulation pulse train frequency 50 Hz and its super-harmonics 100 150 200 Hz. Lower frequencies 0-32 Hz experienced minimal artifact contamination. These findings could inform the design of future bi-directional ECoG-based BCIs.
