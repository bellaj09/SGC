Classification of plants based on a multi-organ approach is very challenging. Although additional data provide more information that might help to disambiguate between species the variability in shape and appearance in plant organs also raises the degree of complexity of the problem. Despite promising solutions built using deep learning enable representative features to be learned for plant images the existing approaches focus mainly on generic features for species classification disregarding the features representing plant organs. In fact plants are complex living organisms sustained by a number of organ systems. In our approach we introduce a hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network HGO-CNN which takes into account both organ and generic information combining them using a new feature fusion scheme for species classification. Next instead of using a CNN-based method to operate on one image with a single organ we extend our approach. We propose a new framework for plant structural learning using the recurrent neural network-based method. This novel approach supports classification based on a varying number of plant views capturing one or more organs of a plant by optimizing the contextual dependencies between them. We also present the qualitative results of our proposed models based on feature visualization techniques and show that the outcomes of visualizations depict our hypothesis and expectation. Finally we show that by leveraging and combining the aforementioned techniques our best network outperforms the state of the art on the PlantClef2015 benchmark.
