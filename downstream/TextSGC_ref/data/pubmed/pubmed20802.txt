Brain-computer interfaces BCIs can serve as muscle independent communication aids. Persons who are unable to control their eye muscles e.g. in the completely locked-in state or have severe visual impairments for other reasons need BCI systems that do not rely on the visual modality. For this reason BCIs that employ auditory stimuli were suggested. In this study a multiclass BCI spelling system was implemented that uses animal voices with directional cues to code rows and columns of a letter matrix. To reveal possible training effects with the system 11 healthy participants performed spelling tasks on 2 consecutive days. In a second step the system was tested by a participant with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS in two sessions. In the first session healthy participants spelled with an average accuracy of 76% 3.29 bits/min that increased to 90% 4.23 bits/min on the second day. Spelling accuracy by the participant with ALS was 20% in the first and 47% in the second session. The results indicate a strong training effect for both the healthy participants and the participant with ALS. While healthy participants reached high accuracies in the first session and second session accuracies for the participant with ALS were not sufficient for satisfactory communication in both sessions. More training sessions might be needed to improve spelling accuracies. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the auditory BCI with healthy users and stresses the importance of training with auditory multiclass BCIs especially for potential end-users of BCI with disease.
