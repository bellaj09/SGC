Drawing the map of neuronal circuits at microscopic resolution is important to explain how brain works. Recent progresses in fluorescence labeling and imaging techniques have enabled measuring the whole brain of a rodent like a mouse at submicron-resolution. Considering the huge volume of such datasets automatic tracing and reconstruct the neuronal connections from the image stacks is essential to form the large scale circuits. However the first step among which automated location the soma across different brain areas remains a challenge. Here we addressed this problem by introducing L1 minimization model. We developed a fully automated system NeuronGlobalPositionSystem NeuroGPS that is robust to the broad diversity of shape size and density of the neurons in a mouse brain. This method allows locating the neurons across different brain areas without human intervention. We believe this method would facilitate the analysis of the neuronal circuits for brain function and disease studies.
