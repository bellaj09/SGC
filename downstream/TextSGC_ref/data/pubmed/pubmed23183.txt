"The role of a brain-computer interface BCI is to discern a users intended message or action by extracting and decoding relevant information from brain signals. Stimulus-driven BCIs such as the P300 speller rely on detecting event-related potentials ERPs in response to a user attending to relevant or target stimulus events. However this process is error-prone because the ERPs are embedded in noisy electroencephalography EEG data representing a fundamental problem in communication of the uncertainty in the information that is received during noisy transmission. A BCI can be modeled as a noisy communication system and an information-theoretic approach can be exploited to design a stimulus presentation paradigm to maximize the information content that is presented to the user. However previous methods that focused on designing error-correcting codes failed to provide significant performance improvements due to underestimating the effects of psycho-physiological factors on the P300 ERP elicitation process and a limited ability to predict online performance with their proposed methods. Maximizing the information rate favors the selection of stimulus presentation patterns with increased target presentation frequency which exacerbates refractory effects and negatively impacts performance within the context of an oddball paradigm. An information-theoretic approach that seeks to understand the fundamental trade-off between information rate and reliability is desirable."
