Development has not necessarily been guided by evidence for educational improvement. On reviewing 34 years of literature Issenberg et al identified ten features of high-fidelity medical simulators that facilitate learning. This study compares cadaveric temporal bone CTB simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg VT virtual reality simulator in addressing these features." Evaluating the effectiveness of the Voxel-Man TempoSurg virtual reality simulator in facilitating learning mastoid surgery.
