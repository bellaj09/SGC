The estimation of functional connectivity structure from functional neuroimaging data is an important step toward understanding the mechanisms of various brain diseases and building relevant biomarkers. Yet such inferences have to deal with the low signal-to-noise ratio and the paucity of the data. With at our disposal a steadily growing olume of publicly available neuroimaging data it is however possible to improve the estimation procedures involved in connectome mapping. In this work we propose a novel learning scheme for functional connectivity based on sparse Gaussian graphical models that aims at minimizing the bias induced by the regularization used in the estimation by carefully separating the estimation of the model support from the coefficients. Moreover our strategy makes it possible to include new data with a limited computational cost. We illustrate the physiological relevance of he learned prior that can be identified as a functional connectivity atlas based on an experiment on 46 subjects of the Human Connectome Dataset. Deriving a multi-subject functional-connectivity atlas to inform connectome estimation.
