Due to the existence of multiple rotating parts in the planetary gearbox-such as the sun gear planet gears planet carriers and its unique planetary motion etc.-the vibration signals generated under multiple fault conditions are time-varying and nonstable thus making fault diagnosis difficult. In order to solve the problem of planetary gearbox composite fault diagnosis an improved particle swarm optimization variational mode decomposition IPVMD and improved convolutional neural network I-CNN are proposed. The method takes as input the spectrum of the original vibration signal that contains rich information. First the automatic feature extraction of signal spectrum is performed by I-CNN while a classifier is used to diagnose the fault modes. Second the composite fault signal is decomposed into multiple single fault signals by adaptive variational mode and the signal is decomposed as a model input to diagnose the single fault component. Finally a complete intelligent diagnosis of planetary gearboxes is conducted. Through experimental verification the composite fault diagnosis method combining IPVMD and I-CNN will diagnose the composite fault and effectively diagnose the sub-fault included in the composite fault.
