Deep learning DL architectures have opened new horizons in medical image analysis attaining unprecedented performance in tasks such as tissue classification and segmentation as well as prediction of several clinical outcomes. In this paper we propose and evaluate a novel three-dimensional 3-D convolutional neural network CNN designed for tissue classification in medical imaging and applied for discriminating between primary and metastatic liver tumors from diffusion weighted MRI DW-MRI data. The proposed network consists of four consecutive strided 3-D convolutional layers with 3  3  3 kernel size and rectified linear unit ReLU as activation function followed by a fully connected layer with 2048 neurons and a Softmax layer for binary classification. A dataset comprising 130 DW-MRI scans was used for the training and validation of the network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first DL solution for the specific clinical problem and the first 3-D CNN for cancer classification operating directly on whole 3-D tomographic data without the need of any preprocessing step such as region cropping annotating or detecting regions of interest. The classification performance results 83% 3-D versus 69.6% and 65.2% 2-D demonstrated significant tissue classification accuracy improvement compared to two 2-D CNNs of different architectures also designed for the specific clinical problem with the same dataset. These results suggest that the proposed 3-D CNN architecture can bring significant benefit in DW-MRI liver discrimination and potentially in numerous other tissue classification problems based on tomographic data especially in size-limited disease-specific clinical datasets.
