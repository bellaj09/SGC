We present a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit GPGPU based real-time traffic sign detection and recognition method that is robust against illumination changes. There have been many approaches to traffic sign recognition in various research fields; however previous approaches faced several limitations when under low illumination or wide variance of light conditions. To overcome these drawbacks and improve processing speeds we propose a method that 1 is robust against illumination changes 2 uses GPGPU-based real-time traffic sign detection and 3 performs region detecting and recognition using a hierarchical model. This method produces stable results in low illumination environments. Both detection and hierarchical recognition are performed in real-time and the proposed method achieves 0.97 F1-score on our collective dataset which uses the Vienna convention traffic rules Germany and South Korea. Real-time traffic sign recognition based on a general purpose GPU and deep-learning.
