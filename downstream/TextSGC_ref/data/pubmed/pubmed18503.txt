Many patients with psychosis experience everyday social situations as anxiety-provoking. The fears can arise for example from paranoia hallucinations social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality VR. It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients using cognitive techniques in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real but the learning made transfers to the real world.
