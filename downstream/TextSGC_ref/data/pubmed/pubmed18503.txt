To compare the effect of simulator functional fidelity manikin vs a Dynamic Haptic Robotic Trainer DHRT and personalized feedback on surgical resident self-efficacy and self-ratings of performance during ultrasound-guided internal jugular central venous catheterization IJ CVC training. In addition we seek to explore how self-ratings of performance compare to objective performance scores generated by the DHRT system. Investigating the Effect of Simulator Functional Fidelity and Personalized Feedback on Central Venous Catheterization Training.
