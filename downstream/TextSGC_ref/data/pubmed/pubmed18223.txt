We aim at reconstructing superficial vessels of the brain. Ultimately they will serve to guide the deformation methods to compensate for the brain shift. A pipeline for three-dimensional 3-D vessel reconstruction using three mono-complementary metal-oxide semiconductor cameras has been developed. Vessel centerlines are manually selected in the images. Using the properties of the Hessian matrix the centerline points are assigned direction information. For correspondence matching a combination of methods was used. The process starts with epipolar and spatial coherence constraints geometrical constraints followed by relaxation labeling and an iterative filtering where the 3-D points are compared to surfaces obtained using the thin-plate spline with decreasing relaxation parameter. Finally the points are shifted to their local centroid position. Evaluation in virtual phantom and experimental images including intraoperative data from patient experiments shows that with appropriate camera positions the error estimates root-mean square error and mean error are Formula: see text.
