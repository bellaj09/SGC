\xa0The emerging market of cardiac handheld ultrasound US is on the rise. Despite the advantages in ease of access and the lower cost a gap in image quality can still be observed between the echocardiography echo data captured by point-of-care ultrasound POCUS compared to conventional cart-based US which limits the further adaptation of POCUS. In this work we aim to present a machine learning solution based on recent advances in adversarial training to investigate the feasibility of translating POCUS echo images to the quality level of high-end cart-based US systems. Cardiac point-of-care to cart-based ultrasound translation using constrained CycleGAN.
