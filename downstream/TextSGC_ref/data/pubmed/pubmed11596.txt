Multiple sclerosis MS is a white matter WM disease characterized by the formation of WM lesions which can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR MRI pulse sequence is used clinically and in research for the detection of WM lesions. However in clinical settings some MRI pulse sequences could be missed because of various constraints. The use of the three-dimensional fully convolutional neural networks is proposed to predict FLAIR pulse sequences from other MRI pulse sequences. In addition the contribution of each input pulse sequence is evaluated with a pulse sequence-specific saliency map. This approach is tested on a real MS image dataset and evaluated by comparing this approach with other methods and by assessing the lesion contrast in the synthetic FLAIR pulse sequence. Both the qualitative and quantitative results show that this method is competitive for FLAIR synthesis.
