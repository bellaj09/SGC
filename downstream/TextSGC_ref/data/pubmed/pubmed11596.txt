Convolutional neural networks CNNs have been shown to be powerful tools to assist with object detection and-like a human observer-may be trained based on a relatively small cohort of reference subjects. Rapid accurate organ recognition in medical imaging permits a variety of new quantitative diagnostic techniques. In the case of therapy with targeted radionuclides it may permit comprehensive radiation dose analysis in a manner that would often be prohibitively time-consuming using conventional methods.
