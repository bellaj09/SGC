"The Utah on-line Virtual Lab is a JAVA program run dynamically off a database. It is embedded in StatCenter www.psych.utah.edu/learn/statsampler.html an on-line collection of tools and text for teaching and learning statistics. Instructors author a statistical virtual reality that simulates theories and data in a specific research focus area by defining independent predictor and dependent variables and the relations among them. Students work in an on-line virtual environment to discover the principles of this simulated reality: They go to a library read theoretical overviews and scientific puzzles and then go to a lab design a study collect and analyze data and write a report. Each students design and data analysis decisions are computer-graded and recorded in a database; the written research report can be read by the instructor or by other students in peer groups simulating scientific conventions."
