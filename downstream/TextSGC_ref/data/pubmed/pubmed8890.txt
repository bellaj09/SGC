Identifying medical persona from a social media post is critical for drug marketing pharmacovigilance and patient recruitment. Medical persona classification aims to computationally model the medical persona associated with a social media post. We present a novel deep learning model for this task which consists of two parts: Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs which extract highly relevant features from the sentences of a social media post and average pooling which aggregates the sentence embeddings to obtain task-specific document embedding. We compare our approach against standard baselines such as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency TF-IDF averaged word embedding based methods and popular neural architectures such as CNN-Long Short Term Memory CNN-LSTM and Hierarchical Attention Networks HANs. Our model achieves an improvement of 19.7% for classification accuracy and 20.1% for micro F1 measure over the current state-of-the-art. We eliminate the need for manual labeling by employing a distant supervision based method to obtain labeled examples for training the models. We thoroughly analyze our model to discover cues that are indicative of a particular persona. Particularly we use first derivative saliency to identify the salient words in a particular social media post. A distant supervision based approach to medical persona classification.
