"Our group has developed a relatively low-cost virtual reality VR system for rehabilitation of the upper limb following stroke. Our system is immersive in that the participant views a representation of their arm and hand reaching and retrieving objects in the virtual environment VE through a head-mounted display HMD. This is thought to increase the participants sense of presence in the VE and may lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes. However use of immersion particularly with our low-cost system may increase the incidence of side effects reported. Therefore the aim of this project was to assess the interaction of healthy users and those following stroke in terms of their experience of presence in the VE and the rate of self-reported side effects. Differences in rates of perceived exertion levels of enjoyment and sense of control between both groups were also explored."
