"Impairments in social communication SC predominate among the core diagnostic features of autism spectrum disorders ASDs. Neuroimaging has revealed numerous findings of atypical activity and connectivity of social brain networks yet no consensus view on crucial developmental causes of SC deficits has emerged. Aside from methodological challenges the deeper problem concerns the clinical label of ASD. While genetic studies have not comprehensively explained the causes of nonsyndromic ASDs they highlight that the clinical label encompasses many etiologically different disorders. The question of how potential causes and etiologies converge onto a comparatively narrow set of SC deficits remains. Only neuroimaging designs searching for subtypes within ASD cohorts rather than conventional group level designs can provide translationally informative answers."
