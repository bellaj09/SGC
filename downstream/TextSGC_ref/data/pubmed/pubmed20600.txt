Rehabilitation programs designed to develop skill in upper extremity UE function after stroke require progressive practice that engage and challenge the learner. Virtual realty VR provides a unique environment where the presentation of stimuli can be controlled systematically for optimal challenge by adapting task difficulty as performance improves. We describe four VR tasks that were developed and tested to improve arm and hand movement skills for individuals with hemiparesis. Intervention to enhance skilled arm and hand movements after stroke: A feasibility study using a new virtual reality system.
