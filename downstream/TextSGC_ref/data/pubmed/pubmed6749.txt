Deep learning is a significant step forward for developing autonomous tasks. One of its branches computer vision allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks CNNs. Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20\xa0min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell PSC settings including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future. Deep Learning Neural Networks Highly Predict Very Early Onset of Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation.
