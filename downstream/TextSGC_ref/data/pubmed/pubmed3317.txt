The relationships between structural and functional measures of the human brain remain largely unknown. A majority of our limited knowledge regarding structure-function associations has been obtained through comparisons between specific groups of patients and healthy controls. Unfortunately a direct and complete view of the associations across multiple structural and functional metrics in normal population is missing. We filled this gap by learning cross-individual co-variance among structural and functional measures using large-scale neuroimaging datasets. A discover-confirm scheme was applied to two independent samples N\xa0=\xa0184 and N\xa0=\xa0340 of multi-modal neuroimaging datasets. A data mining tool gRAICAR was employed in the discover stage to generate quantitative and unbiased hypotheses of the co-variance among six functional and six structural imaging metrics. These hypotheses were validated using an independent dataset in the confirm stage. Fifteen multi-metric co-variance units representing different co-variance relationships among the 12 metrics were reliable across the two sets of neuroimaging datasets. The reliable co-variance units were summarized into a database where users can select any location on the cortical map of any metric to examine the co-varying maps with the other 11 metrics. This database characterized the six functional metrics based on their co-variance with structural metrics and provided a detailed reference to connect previous findings using different metrics and to predict maps of unexamined metrics. Gender age and handedness were associated to the co-variance units and a sub-study of schizophrenia demonstrated the usefulness of the co-variance database. Brain structure-function associations identified in large-scale neuroimaging data.
