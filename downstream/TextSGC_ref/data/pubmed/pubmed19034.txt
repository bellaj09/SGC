The use of virtual reality VR systems within physical rehabilitation clinical practice and research is rapidly developing highlighting the need for consensus as to the meaning and relevance of the label "VR therapy." The purpose of this communication is to argue that explicit examination of the inferences underlying this label and discussion regarding the role of clinicians in VR implementation are required. In this vein we propose what we consider to be a more relevant label and discuss the need for evidence to support knowledge translation initiatives for therapists interested in integrating VR systems within clinical practice. When is virtual reality "therapy"?
