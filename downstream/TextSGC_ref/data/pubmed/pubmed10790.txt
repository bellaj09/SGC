Protein redesign and engineering has become an important task in pharmaceutical research and development. Recent advances in technology have enabled efficient protein redesign by mimicking natural evolutionary mutation selection and amplification steps in the laboratory environment. For any given protein the number of possible mutations is astronomical. It is impractical to synthesize all sequences or even to investigate all functionally interesting variants. Recently there has been an increased interest in using machine learning to assist protein redesign since prediction models can be used to virtually screen a large number of novel sequences. However many state-of-the-art machine learning models especially deep learning models have not been extensively explored. Moreover only a small selection of protein sequence descriptors have been considered. In this work the performance of prediction models built using an array of machine learning methods and protein descriptor types including two novel single amino acid descriptors and one structure based 3-dimensional descriptor are benchmarked. The predictions were evaluated on a diverse collection of public and proprietary data sets using a variety of evaluation metrics. The results of this comparison suggest that Convolution Neural Network models built with amino acid property descriptors are the most widely applicable to the types of protein redesign problems faced in the pharmaceutical industry.
