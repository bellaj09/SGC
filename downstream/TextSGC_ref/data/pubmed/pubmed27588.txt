"Leg amputees suffer the lack of sensory feedback from a prosthesis which is connected to their low confidence during walking falls and low mobility. Electrical peripheral nerve stimulation ePNS of upper-limb amputees residual nerves has shown the ability to restore the sensations from the missing limb via intraneural TIME and epineural FINE neural interfaces. Physiologically plausible stimulation protocols targeting lower limb sciatic nerve hold promise to induce sensory feedback restoration that should facilitate close-to-natural sensorimotor integration and therefore walking corrections. The sciatic nerve innervating the foot and lower leg has very different dimensions in respect to upper-limb nerves. Therefore there is a need to develop a computational model of its behavior in response to the ePNS." A computational model to design neural interfaces for lower-limb sensory neuroprostheses.
