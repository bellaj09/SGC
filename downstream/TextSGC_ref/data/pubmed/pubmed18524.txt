"Endoscopic sinus and skull base surgeries are minimally invasive surgical techniques that reduce postoperative symptoms and complications and enhance patients quality of life. However to ensure excellent surgical outcomes after such interventions intimate familiarity with important landmarks and high-level endoscope manipulation skills are essential. Cadaver training is one possible option but cadavers are expensive scarce and nonreusable and cadaver work requires specialized equipment and staff. In addition it is difficult to mimic specific diseases using cadavers. Virtual reality simulators can create a computerized environment in which the patients anatomy is reproduced and interaction with endoscopic handling and realistic haptic feedback is possible. Moreover they can be used to present scenarios that improve trainees skills and confidence. Therefore virtual simulator training can be implemented at all levels of surgical education. This review introduces the current literature on virtual reality training for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgeons and discusses the direction of future developments."
