Conventional brain-computer interface BCI systems have been facing two fundamental challenges: the lack of high detection performance and the control command problem. To this end the researchers have proposed a hybrid brain-computer interface hBCI to address these challenges. This paper mainly discusses the research progress of hBCI and reviews three types of hBCI namely hBCI based on multiple brain models multisensory hBCI and hBCI based on multimodal signals. By analyzing the general principles paradigm designs experimental results advantages and applications of the latest hBCI system we found that using hBCI technology can improve the detection performance of BCI and achieve multidegree/multifunctional control which is significantly superior to single-mode BCIs.
