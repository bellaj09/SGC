Segmentation of human brain using structural MRI is a key step of processing in imaging neuroscience. The methods have undergone a rapid development in the past two decades and are now widely available. This non-technical review aims at providing an overview and basic understanding of the most common software. Starting with the basis of structural MRI contrast in brain and imaging protocols the concepts of voxel-based and surface-based segmentation are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the typical contrast features and morphological constraints of cortical and sub-cortical grey matter. In addition to the use for voxel-based morphometry basic applications in quantitative MRI cortical thickness estimations and atrophy measurements as well as assignment of cortical regions and deep brain nuclei are briefly discussed. Finally some fields for clinical applications are given. Segmentation of human brain using structural MRI.
