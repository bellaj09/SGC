Carotid artery stenting CAS remains an appealing intervention to reduce the stroke risk because of its minimal invasive nature. Nevertheless landmark randomised controlled trials have not been able to resolve the controversies surrounding this complex procedure as the peri-operative stroke risk in a non-selected patient population still seems to be higher after CAS in comparison to carotid endarterectomy. What is more these trials have highlighted that patient outcome after CAS is influenced by patient- and operator-dependant factors. The CAS procedure exhibits a definitive learning curve resulting in higher complication rates if the procedure is performed by inexperienced interventionists or in low-volume centres. This article will outline strategies to improve the performance of physicians carrying out the CAS procedure by means of proficiency-based training credentialing virtual reality rehearsal and optimal patient selection.
