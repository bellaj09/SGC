Clinical network neuroscience the study of brain network topology in neurological and psychiatric diseases has become a mainstay field within clinical neuroscience. Being a multidisciplinary group of clinical network neuroscience experts based in The Netherlands we often discuss the current state of the art and possible avenues for future investigations. These discussions revolve around questions like "How do dynamic processes alter the underlying structural network?" and "Can we use network neuroscience for disease classification?" This opinion paper is an incomplete overview of these discussions and expands on ten questions that may potentially advance the field. By no means intended as a review of the current state of the field it is instead meant as a conversation starter and source of inspiration to others. The road ahead in clinical network neuroscience.
