Recently developed methods of protein contact prediction a crucially important step for protein structure prediction depend heavily on deep neural networks DNNs and multiple sequence alignments MSAs of target proteins. Protein sequences are accumulating to an increasing degree such that abundant sequences to construct an MSA of a target protein are readily obtainable. Nevertheless many cases present different ends of the number of sequences that can be included in an MSA used for contact prediction. The abundant sequences might degrade prediction results but opportunities remain for a limited number of sequences to construct an MSA. To resolve these persistent issues we strove to develop a novel framework using DNNs in an end-to-end manner for contact prediction.
