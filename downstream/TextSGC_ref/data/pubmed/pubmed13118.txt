Histopathological classification of gastric and colonic epithelial tumours is one of the routine pathological diagnosis tasks for pathologists. Computational pathology techniques based on Artificial intelligence AI would be of high benefit in easing the ever increasing workloads on pathologists especially in regions that have shortages in access to pathological diagnosis services. In this study we trained convolutional neural networks CNNs and recurrent neural networks RNNs on biopsy histopathology whole-slide images WSIs of stomach and colon. The models were trained to classify WSI into adenocarcinoma adenoma and non-neoplastic. We evaluated our models on three independent test sets each achieving area under the curves AUCs up to 0.97 and 0.99 for gastric adenocarcinoma and adenoma respectively and 0.96 and 0.99 for colonic adenocarcinoma and adenoma respectively. The results demonstrate the generalisation ability of our models and the high promising potential of deployment in a practical histopathological diagnostic workflow system.
