Perfect channel state information CSI is required in most of the classical physical-layer security techniques while it is difficult to obtain the ideal CSI due to the time-varying wireless fading channel. Although imperfect CSI has a great impact on the security of MIMO communications deep learning is becoming a promising solution to handle the negative effect of imperfect CSI. In this work we propose two types of deep learning-based secure MIMO detectors for heterogeneous networks where the macro base station BS chooses the null-space eigenvectors to prevent information leakage to the femto BS. Thus the bit error rate of the associated user is adopted as the metric to evaluate the system performance. With the help of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs the macro BS obtains the refined version from the imperfect CSI. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms. The impacts of system parameters such as the correlation factor of imperfect CSI the normalized doppler frequency the number of antennas is investigated in different setup scenarios. The results show that considerable performance gains can be obtained from the deep learning-based detectors compared with the classical maximum likelihood algorithm.
