"Anxiety is the most under-recognized nonmotor symptom of Parkinsons disease PD yet it is unclear whether motor impairment exacerbates anxiety observed in PD or vice versa. The current study examined: 1 whether movement i.e. walking vs. standing elevates distress in PD; 2 how dopaminergic treatment influences anxiety specifically while walking; and 3 whether these responses are worse in PD patients with gait impairments compared to those without."
