Regulatory guidance for schizophrenia cognition clinical trials requires that the assessment of cognitive change is accompanied by a functionally meaningful endpoint. However currently available measures are challenged by resistance to change psychometric weaknesses and for interview-based assessments dependence upon the presence of an informant. The aims of the current study were to: 1 assess the validity sensitivity and reliability of the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool VRFCAT as a measure of functional capacity; 2 determine the association between performance on the VRFCAT and performance on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery MCCB; and 3 compare the metrics of the VRFCAT with the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment UPSA. 167 patients with schizophrenia and 166 healthy controls completed the VRFCAT UPSA and the MCCB at baseline. The VRFCAT and UPSA were completed again at follow-up. The VRFCAT MCCB and UPSA were very sensitive to impairment in schizophrenia d=1.16 to 1.22. High test-retest reliability was demonstrated for VRFCAT total completion time and the UPSA total score in patients ICC=0.81 and 0.78 respectively. The UPSA demonstrated significant practice effects in patients d=0.35 while the VRFCAT did not d=-0.04. VRFCAT total completion time was correlated with both UPSA r=-0.56 p<0.0001 for patients and -0.58 p<0.0001 for controls and MCCB Composite r=-0.57 p<0.0001 for patients and -0.68 p<0.0001 for controls. The VRFCAT is a highly reliable and sensitive measure of functional capacity with associations to the UPSA and MCCB. These results provide encouraging support for a computerized functional capacity assessment for use in schizophrenia. Validation of a Computerized test of Functional Capacity.
