The current treatment for ambulation after spinal cord injury SCI is to substitute the lost behavior with a wheelchair; however this can result in many co-morbidities. Thus novel solutions for the restoration of walking such as brain-computer interfaces BCI and functional electrical stimulation FES devices have been sought. This study reports on the first electroencephalogram EEG based BCI-FES system for overground walking and its performance assessment in an individual with paraplegia due to SCI. The results revealed that the participant was able to purposefully operate the system continuously in real time. If tested in a larger population of SCI individuals this system may pave the way for the restoration of overground walking after SCI. Brain-computer interface driven functional electrical stimulation system for overground walking in spinal cord injury participant.
