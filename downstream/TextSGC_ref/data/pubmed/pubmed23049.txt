"Action observation AO generates event-related desynchronization ERD suppressions in the human brain by activating partial regions of the human mirror neuron system hMNS. The activation of the hMNS response to AO remains controversial for several reasons. Therefore this study investigated the activation of the hMNS response to a speed factor of AO by controlling the movement speed modes of a humanoid robots arm movements. Since hMNS activation is reflected by ERD suppressions electroencephalography EEG with BCI analysis methods for ERD suppressions were used as the recording and analysis modalities. Six healthy individuals were asked to participate in experiments comprising five different conditions. Four incremental-speed AO tasks and a motor imagery MI task involving imaging of the same movement were presented to the individuals. Occipital and sensorimotor regions were selected for BCI analyses. The experimental results showed that hMNS activation was higher in the occipital region but more robust in the sensorimotor region. Since the attended information impacts the activations of the hMNS during AO the pattern of hMNS activations first rises and subsequently falls to a stable level during incremental-speed modes of AO. The discipline curves suggested that a moderate speed within a decent inter-stimulus interval ISI range produced the highest hMNS activations. Since a brain computer/machine interface BCI builds a path-way between human and computer/mahcine the discipline curves will help to construct BCIs made by patterns of action observation AO-BCI. Furthermore a new method for constructing non-invasive brain machine brain interfaces BMBIs with moderate AO-BCI and motor imagery BCI MI-BCI was inspired by this paper."
