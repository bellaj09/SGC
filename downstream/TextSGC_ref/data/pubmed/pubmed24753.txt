Representation of movement in the motor cortex M1 has been widely studied in brain-machine interfaces BMIs. The electromyogram EMG has greater bandwidth than the conventional kinematic variables such as position velocity and is functionally related to the discharge of cortical neurons. As the stochastic information of EMG is derived from the explicit spike time structure point process PP methods will be a good solution for decoding EMG directly from neural spike trains. Previous studies usually assume linear or exponential tuning curves between neural firing and EMG which may not be true.
