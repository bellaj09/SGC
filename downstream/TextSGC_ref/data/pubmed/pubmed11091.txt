Obsessive compulsive disorder OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by repeated unwanted thoughts and behaviors. Individuals with this condition often experience significant emotional distress secondary to their symptoms. Additionally impairments in attention/concentration processing speed and executive functions are typically observed. The exact pathology of OCD remains unknown; consequently it can be difficult to treat patients with severe symptomatology. Deep brain stimulation DBS may be a viable treatment option for individuals who do not respond to medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy.
