Recent progress towards understanding circuit function has capitalized on tools from network science to parsimoniously describe the spatiotemporal architecture of neural systems. Such tools often address systems topology divorced from its physical instantiation. Nevertheless for embedded systems such as the brain physical laws directly constrain the processes of network growth development and function. We review here the rules imposed by the space and volume of the brain on the development of neuronal networks and show that these rules give rise to a specific set of complex topologies. These rules also affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can emerge from the system and thereby inform our understanding of network dysfunction in disease. We close by discussing new tools and models to delineate the effects of spatial embedding. Spatial Embedding Imposes Constraints on Neuronal Network Architectures.
