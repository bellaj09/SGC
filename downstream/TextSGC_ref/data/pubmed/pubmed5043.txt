Brain parcellation is often a prerequisite for network analysis due to the statistical challenges computational burdens and interpretation difficulties arising from the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Predominant approaches are largely unimodal with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI being the primary modality used. These approaches thus neglect other brain attributes that relate to brain organization. In this paper we propose an approach for integrating fMRI and diffusion MRI dMRI data. Our approach introduces a nonlinear mapping between the connectivity values of two modalities and adaptively balances their weighting based on their voxel-wise test-retest reliability. An efficient region level extension that additionally incorporates structural information on gyri and sulci is further presented. To validate we compare multimodal parcellations with unimodal parcellations and existing atlases on the Human Connectome Project data. We show that multimodal parcellations achieve higher reproducibility comparable/higher functional homogeneity and comparable/higher leftout data likelihood. The boundaries of multimodal parcels are observed to align to those based on cyto-architecture and subnetworks extracted from multimodal parcels matched well with established brain systems. Our results thus show that multimodal information improves brain parcellation. Multimodal Brain Parcellation Based on Functional and Anatomical Connectivity.
