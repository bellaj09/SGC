Conditioned fear CF is one of the most frequently used behavioral paradigms; however little work has mapped changes in cerebral perfusion during CF in the rat-the species which has dominated CF research. Adult rats carrying an implanted minipump were exposed to a tone controls n = 8 or a tone conditioned in association with footshocks CS group n = 9. During reexposure to the tone 24 h later animals were injected intravenously by remote activation with 14C-iodoantipyrine using the pump. Significant group differences in regional CBF-related tissue radioactivity CBF-TR were determined by region-of-interest analysis of brain autoradiographs as well as in the reconstructed three-dimensional brain by statistical parametric mapping SPM. CS animals demonstrated significantly greater fear-enhanced increases in CBF-TR in auditory cortex than controls. The lateral amygdala was activated whereas the basolateral/basomedial and central amygdala were deactivated. In the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex CBF-TR increased significantly ventrally but not dorsally. Significant activations were noted in medial striatum and the thalamic midline and intralaminar nuclei. However the ventrolateral/dorsolateral striatum and its afferents from motor and somatosensory cortex were deactivated consistent with the behavioral immobility seen during CF. Significant activations were also noted in the lateral septum periaqueductal gray and deep mesencephalic nucleus/tegmental tract. Our results show that auditory stimuli endowed with aversive properties through conditioning result in significant redistribution of cerebral perfusion. SPM is a useful tool in the brain mapping of complex rodent behaviors in particular the changes in activation patterns in limbic thalamic motor and cortical circuits during CF.
