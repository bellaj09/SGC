This paper presents a conceptual framework of a virtual reality therapy to assist individuals especially lung cancer patients or those with breathing disorders to regulate their breath through real-time analysis of respiration movements using a smartphone. Virtual reality technology is an attractive means for medical simulations and treatment particularly for patients with cancer. The theories methodologies and approaches and real-world dynamic contents for all the components of this virtual reality therapy VRT via a conceptual framework using the smartphone will be discussed. The architecture and technical aspects of the offshore platform of the virtual environment will also be presented. Augmenting breath regulation using a mobile driven virtual reality therapy framework.
