"One of the ways in which brain computer interfaces can be used is neurofeedback NF. Subjects use their brain activation to control an external device and with this technique it is also possible to learn to control aspects of the brain activity by operant conditioning. Beneficial effects of NF training on seizure occurrence have been described in epileptic patients. Little research has been done about differentiating NF effectiveness by type of epilepsy particularly whether idiopathic generalized seizures are susceptible to NF. In this experiment seizures that manifest themselves as spike-wave discharges SWDs in the EEG were reinforced during 10 sessions in 6 rats of the WAG/Rij strain an animal model for absence epilepsy. EEGs were recorded before and after the training sessions. Reinforcing SWDs let to decreased SWD occurrences during training; however the changes during training were not persistent in the post-training sessions. Because behavioural states are known to have an influence on the occurrence of SWDs it is proposed that the reinforcement situation increased arousal which resulted in fewer SWDs. Additional tests supported this hypothesis. The outcomes have implications for the possibility to train SWDs with operant learning techniques." Does arousal interfere with operant conditioning of spike-wave discharges in genetic epileptic rats?
