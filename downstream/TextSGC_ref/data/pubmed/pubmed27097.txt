The P3 is an important event-related potential that can be used to identify neural activity related to the cognitive processes of the human brain. However the relationships especially the functional correlations between resting-state brain activity and the P3 have not been well established. In this study we investigated the relationships between P3 properties i.e. amplitude and latency and resting-state brain networks. The results indicated that P3 amplitude was significantly correlated with resting-state network topology and in general larger P3 amplitudes could be evoked when the resting-state brain network was more efficient. However no significant relationships were found for the corresponding P3 latency. Additionally the long-range connections between the prefrontal/frontal and parietal/occipital brain regions which represent the synchronous activity of these areas were functionally related to the P3 parameters especially P3 amplitude. The findings of the current study may help us better understand inter-subject variation in the P3 which may be instructive for clinical diagnosis cognitive neuroscience studies and potential subject selection for brain-computer interface applications.
