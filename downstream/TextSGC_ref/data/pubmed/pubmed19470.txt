Emotions can modulate the encoding and recollection of personal events. In the present study we investigated the effects of different emotional states pleasant neutral or anxious on episodic memory formation in a virtual reality VR setting. Emotional states were induced by pleasant neutral or anxiety-inducing movie clips prior to the presentation of specific events in a VR scenario. Episodic memory performance of healthy participants in whom an anxious emotional state had been induced was inferior to those of the neutral and pleasant conditions. In the anxious condition participants were particularly impaired regarding their memory for the location of events. A correlational analysis indicated that high levels of negative arousal were associated with poor memory for the temporal and spatial context of events. In contrast high levels of happiness were associated with better memory for the spatial context of events. Our data provide evidence that emotional arousal can modulate memory for what happened where and when. The impact of different emotional states on the memory for what where and when features of specific events.
