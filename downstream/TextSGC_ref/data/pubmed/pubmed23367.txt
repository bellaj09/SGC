This article examines recent combat veterans\ experiences of "first-person shooter" FPS gaming and its relationship to posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. Current PTSD treatment approaches increasingly use virtual reality VR technologies which have many similarities with FPS games. To explore these similarities this article presents six case studies from recently separated veterans in New York City who reported both current PTSD symptoms and regular use of combat-themed FPS games. In open-ended interviews participants discussed a range of benefits as well as the importance of regulating use and avoiding particular contextual dimensions of gaming to maintain healthy gaming habits. Findings demonstrate the need for more comprehensive study and dissemination of best-practices information about FPS gaming in the context of combat-related PTSD symptomatology.
