The basic question this research addressed was how does simulator sickness vary with simulated motion frequency? Participants were 11 women and 19 men 20 to 63 years of age. A visual self-motion frequency response curve was determined using a Chattecx posture platform with a VR4 head-mounted display HMD or a back-projected dome. That curve and one for vestibular self-motion specify a frequency range in which vestibular and visual motion stimuli could produce conflicting self-motion cues. Using a rotating chair and the HMD a third experiment supported p < .01 the hypothesis that conflicting cues at the frequency of maximum "crossover" between the curves about 0.06 Hz would be more likely to evoke simulator sickness than would conflicting cues at a higher frequency. Actual or potential applications of this work include a preliminary design guidance curve that indicates the frequency range of simulated motion that is likely to evoke simulator or virtual reality sickness; for simulators intended to operate in this frequency range appropriate simulator sickness interventions should be considered during the design process. "Conflicting" motion cues to the visual and vestibular self-motion systems around 0.06 Hz evoke simulator sickness.
