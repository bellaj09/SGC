Auditory scene analysis requires the listener to parse the incoming flow of acoustic information into perceptual "streams" such as sentences from a single talker in the midst of background noise. Behavioral and neural data show that the formation of streams is not instantaneous; rather streaming builds up over time and can be reset by sudden changes in the acoustics of the scene. Here we investigated the effect of changes induced by voluntary head motion on streaming. We used a telepresence robot in a virtual reality setup to disentangle all potential consequences of head motion: changes in acoustic cues at the ears changes in apparent source location and changes in motor or attentional processes. The results showed that self-motion influenced streaming in at least two ways. Right after the onset of movement self-motion always induced some resetting of perceptual organization to one stream even when the acoustic scene itself had not changed. Then after the motion the prevalent organization was rapidly biased by the binaural cues discovered through motion. Auditory scene analysis thus appears to be a dynamic process that is affected by the active sensing of the environment. Effects of self-motion on auditory scene analysis.
