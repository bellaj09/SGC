We introduce two ways of testing the robustness of conclusions from studies comparing virtual screening methods: alternative "global goodness" metrics and sensitivity analysis. While the robustness tests cannot eliminate all biases in virtual screening comparisons they are useful as a "reality check" for any given study. To illustrate this we apply them to a set of enrichments published in McGaughey et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2007 47 1504-1519 where 11 target protein/ligand combinations are tested on 2D and 3D similarity methods plus docking. The major conclusions in that paper for instance that ligand-based methods are better than docking methods hold up. However some minor conclusions such as Glide being the best docking method do not. Alternative global goodness metrics and sensitivity analysis: heuristics to check the robustness of conclusions from studies comparing virtual screening methods.
