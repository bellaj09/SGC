"Latest target recognition methods that are equipped with learning from the subjects calibration data represented by the extended canonical correlation analysis eCCA and the ensemble task-related component analysis eTRCA can achieve extra high performance in the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs however their performance deteriorate drastically if the calibration trials are insufficient. This paper develops a new scheme to learn from limited calibration data." Learning across multi-stimulus enhances target recognition methods in SSVEP-based BCIs.
