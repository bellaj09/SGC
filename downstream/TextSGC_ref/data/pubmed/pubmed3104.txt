"This paper describes novel methods for constructing the intrinsic geometry of the human brain connectome using dimensionality-reduction techniques. We posit that the high-dimensional complex geometry that represents this intrinsic topology can be mathematically embedded into lower dimensions using coupling patterns encoded in the corresponding brain connectivity graphs. We tested both linear and nonlinear dimensionality-reduction techniques using the diffusion-weighted structural connectome data acquired from a sample of healthy subjects. Results supported the nonlinearity of brain connectivity data as linear reduction techniques such as the multidimensional scaling yielded inferior lower-dimensional embeddings. To further validate our results we demonstrated that for tractography-derived structural connectome more influential regions such as rich-club members of the brain are more centrally mapped or embedded. Further abnormal brain connectivity can be visually understood by inspecting the altered geometry of these three-dimensional 3D embeddings that represent the topology of the human brain as illustrated using simulated lesion studies of both targeted and random removal. Last in order to visualize brains intrinsic topology we have developed software that is compatible with virtual reality technologies thus allowing researchers to collaboratively and interactively explore and manipulate brain connectome data."
