In this paper the altitude and velocity tracking control of a generic hypersonic flight vehicle HFV is considered. A novel adaptive terminal sliding mode controller ATSMC with strictly lower convex function based nonlinear disturbance observer SDOB is proposed for the longitudinal dynamics of HFV in presence of both parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. First for the sake of enhancing the anti-interference capability SDOB is presented to estimate and compensate the equivalent disturbances by introducing a strictly lower convex function. Next the SDOB based ATSMC SDOB-ATSMC is proposed to guarantee the system outputs track the reference trajectory. Then stability of the proposed control scheme is analyzed by the Lyapunov function method. Compared with other HFV control approaches key novelties of SDOB-ATSMC are that a novel SDOB is proposed and drawn into the virtual control laws to compensate the disturbances and that several adaptive laws are used to deal with the differential explosion problem. Finally it is illustrated by the simulation results that the new method exhibits an excellent robustness and a better disturbance rejection performance than the convention approach.
