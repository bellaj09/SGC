"The connectome-wide association studies exploring association between brain connectome and disease phenotypes have suffered from massive number of comparisons. In this paper we propose to apply a multivariate distance-based analytic framework on brain white matter WM structural networks invaded by Alzheimers disease AD. Eighty-three subjects including patients with AD amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI and healthy subjects were scanned with dMRI. By constructing WM structural network for each individual we used both multivariate and traditional univariate statistical models to complimentarily analyze network pattern and fiber strength changes due to AD. WM connections linked with several brain structures were found significantly changed between AD group and normal controls. No significant findings were observed between aMCI group and normal controls. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of the combined connectome-based analytic framework in detecting abnormalities of structural brain network."
