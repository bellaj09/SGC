The Kalman filter KF is an extremely powerful and versatile tool for signal processing that has been applied extensively in various fields. We introduce a novel Kalman-based analysis procedure that encompasses robustness towards outliers Kalman smoothing and real-time conversion from non-uniformly sampled inputs to a constant output rate. These features have been mostly treated independently so that not all of their benefits could be exploited at the same time. Here we present a coherent analysis procedure that combines the aforementioned features and their benefits. To facilitate utilization of the proposed methodology and to ensure optimal performance we also introduce a procedure to calculate all necessary parameters. Thereby we substantially expand the versatility of one of the most widely-used filtering approaches taking full advantage of its most prevalent extensions. The applicability and superior performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated using simulated and real data. The possible areas of applications for the presented analysis procedure range from movement analysis over medical imaging brain-computer interfaces to robot navigation or meteorological studies. A robust Kalman framework with resampling and optimal smoothing.
