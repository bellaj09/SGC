Fiber orientation is the key information in diffusion tractography. Several deconvolution methods have been proposed to obtain fiber orientations by estimating a fiber orientation distribution function ODF. However the L 2 regularization used in deconvolution often leads to false fibers that compromise the specificity of the results. To address this problem we propose a method called diffusion decomposition which obtains a sparse solution of fiber ODF by decomposing the diffusion ODF obtained from q-ball imaging QBI diffusion spectrum imaging DSI or generalized q-sampling imaging GQI. A simulation study a phantom study and an in-vivo study were conducted to examine the performance of diffusion decomposition. The simulation study showed that diffusion decomposition was more accurate than both constrained spherical deconvolution and ball-and-sticks model. The phantom study showed that the angular error of diffusion decomposition was significantly lower than those of constrained spherical deconvolution at 30 crossing and ball-and-sticks model at 60 crossing. The in-vivo study showed that diffusion decomposition can be applied to QBI DSI or GQI and the resolved fiber orientations were consistent regardless of the diffusion sampling schemes and diffusion reconstruction methods. The performance of diffusion decomposition was further demonstrated by resolving crossing fibers on a 30-direction QBI dataset and a 40-direction DSI dataset. In conclusion diffusion decomposition can improve angular resolution and resolve crossing fibers in datasets with low SNR and substantially reduced number of diffusion encoding directions. These advantages may be valuable for human connectome studies and clinical research. Sparse solution of fiber orientation distribution function by diffusion decomposition.
