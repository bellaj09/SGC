In this paper two mHealth applications are introduced which can be employed as the terminals of bigdata based health service to collect information for electronic medical records EMRs. The first one is a hybrid system for improving the user experience in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber by 3D stereoscopic virtual reality glasses and immersive perception. Several HMDs have been tested and compared. The second application is a voice interactive serious game as a likely solution for providing assistive rehabilitation tool for therapists. The recorder of the voice of patients could be analysed to evaluate the long-time rehabilitation results and further to predict the rehabilitation process.
