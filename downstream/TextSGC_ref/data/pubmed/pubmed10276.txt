Ferroelectric HfZrOx Fe-HZO with a larger remnant polarization Pr is achieved by using a poly-GeSn film as a channel material as compared with a poly-Ge film because of the lower thermal expansion that induces higher stress. Then two-stage interface engineering of junctionless poly-GeSn Sn of 5.1% ferroelectric thin-film transistors Fe-TFTs based on HZO was employed to improve the reliability characteristics. With stage I of NH3 plasma treatment on poly-GeSn and subsequent stage II of Ta2O5 interfacial layer growth the interfacial quality between Fe-HZO and the poly-GeSn channel is greatly improved which in turn enhances the reliability performance in terms of negligible Pr degradation up to 106 cycles 2.7 MV/1 ms and 96% Pr after a 10 year retention at 85 C. Furthermore to emulate the synapse plasticity of the human brain for neuromorphic computing besides manifesting the capability of short-term plasticity the devices also exhibit long-term plasticity with the characteristics of analog conductance G states of 80 levels >6 bit small linearity for potentiation and depression of -0.83 and 0.62 high symmetry and moderate Gmax/Gmin of 9.6. By employing deep neural network the neuromorphic system with poly-GeSn Fe-TFT synaptic devices achieves 91.4% pattern recognition accuracy. In addition the learning algorithm of spike-timing-dependent plasticity based on spiking neural network is demonstrated as well. The results are promising for on-chip training making it possible to implement neuromorphic computing by monolithic 3D ICs based on poly-GeSn Fe-TFTs.
