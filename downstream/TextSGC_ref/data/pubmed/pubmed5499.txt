Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD and conditions involving excessive eating eg obesity binge/loss of control eating are increasingly prevalent within pediatric populations and correlational and some longitudinal studies have suggested inter-relationships between these disorders. In addition a number of common neural correlates are emerging across conditions eg functional abnormalities within circuits subserving reward processing and executive functioning. To explore this potential cross-condition overlap in neurobehavioral underpinnings we selectively review relevant functional neuroimaging literature specifically focusing on studies probing i reward processing ii response inhibition and iii emotional processing and regulation and we outline 3 specific shared neurobehavioral circuits. Based on our review we also identify gaps within the literature that would benefit from further research. Overlapping neurobehavioral circuits in ADHD obesity and binge eating: evidence from neuroimaging research.
