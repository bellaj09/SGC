Due to the occult anatomic location of the nasopharynx and frequent presence of adenoid hyperplasia the positive rate for malignancy identification during biopsy is low thus leading to delayed or missed diagnosis for nasopharyngeal malignancies upon initial attempt. Here we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence tool to detect nasopharyngeal malignancies under endoscopic examination based on deep learning. Development and validation of an endoscopic images-based deep learning model for detection with nasopharyngeal malignancies.
