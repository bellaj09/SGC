Bronchoscopy inspection as a follow-up procedure next to the radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment design for lung disease patients. When performing bronchoscopy doctors have to make a decision immediately whether to perform a biopsy. Because biopsies may cause uncontrollable and life-threatening bleeding of the lung tissue thus doctors need to be selective with biopsies. In this paper to help doctors to be more selective on biopsies and provide a second opinion on diagnosis we propose a computer-aided diagnosis CAD system for lung diseases including cancers and tuberculosis TB. Based on transfer learning TL we propose a novel TL method on the top of DenseNet: sequential fine-tuning SFT. Compared with traditional fine-tuning FT methods our method achieves the best performance. In a data set of recruited 81 normal cases 76 TB cases and 277 lung cancer cases SFT provided an overall accuracy of 82% while other traditional TL methods achieved an accuracy from 70% to 74%. The detection accuracy of SFT for cancers TB and normal cases are 87% 54% and 91% respectively. This indicates that the CAD system has the potential to improve lung disease diagnosis accuracy in bronchoscopy and it may be used to be more selective with biopsies.
