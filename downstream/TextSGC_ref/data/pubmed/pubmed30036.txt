Impaired locomotion is a frequent and major source of disability in patients with neurological conditions. Different neuroimaging methods have been used to understand the brain substrates of locomotion in various neurological diseases mainly in Parkinson\s disease during actual walking and while resting using mental imagery of gait or brain-behavior correlation analyses. These studies using structural i.e. MRI or functional i.e. functional MRI or functional near infra-red spectroscopy brain imaging electrophysiology i.e. EEG non-invasive brain stimulation i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation or molecular imaging methods i.e. PET or SPECT reveal extended brain networks involving both grey and white matters in key cortical i.e. prefrontal cortex and subcortical basal ganglia and cerebellum regions associated with locomotion. However the specific roles of the various pathophysiological mechanisms encountered in each neurological condition on the phenotype of gait disorders still remains unclear. After reviewing the results of individual brain imaging techniques across the common neurological conditions such as Parkinson\s disease dementia stroke or multiple sclerosis we will discuss how the development of new imaging techniques and computational analyses that integrate multivariate correlations in "large enough datasets" might help to understand how individual pathophysiological mechanisms express clinically as an abnormal gait. Finally we will explore how these new analytic methods could drive our rehabilitative strategies. Brain imaging of locomotion in neurological conditions.
