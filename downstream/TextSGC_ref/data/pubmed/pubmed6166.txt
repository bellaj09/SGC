"Huntingtons disease HD is an inherited brain disorder characterized by progressive motor cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. It is caused by abnormally large trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine CAG repeat expansions on exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene. CAG repeat length CAG-RL inversely correlates with an earlier age of onset. Region-based studies have shown that HD gene mutation carrier HDgmc individuals CAG-RL 36 present functional connectivity alterations in subcortical SC and default mode networks. In this analysis we expand on previous HD studies by investigating associations between CAG-RL and connectivity in the whole brain as well as between CAG-dependent connectivity and motor and cognitive performances. We used group-independent component analysis on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of 261 individuals 183\u2009HDgmc and 78 healthy controls from the PREDICT-HD study to obtain whole-brain resting state networks RSNs. Regression analysis was applied within and between RSNs connectivity functional network connectivity FNC to identify CAG-RL associations. Connectivity within the putamen RSN is negatively correlated with CAG-RL. The FNC between putamen and insula decreases with increasing CAG-RL and also shows significant associations with motor and cognitive measures. The FNC between calcarine and middle frontal gyri increased with CAG-RL. In contrast FNC in other visual VIS networks declined with increasing CAG-RL. In addition to observed effects in SC areas known to be related to HD our study identifies a strong presence of alterations in VIS regions less commonly observed in previous reports and provides a step forward in understanding FNC dysfunction in HDgmc."
