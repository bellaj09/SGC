"Antimicrobial resistance AMR is a major threat to global public health because it makes standard treatments ineffective and contributes to the spread of infections. It is important to understand AMRs biological mechanisms for the development of new drugs and more rapid and accurate clinical diagnostics. The increasing availability of whole-genome SNP single nucleotide polymorphism information obtained from whole-genome sequence data along with AMR profiles provides an opportunity to use feature selection in machine learning to find AMR-associated mutations. This work describes the use of a supervised feature selection approach using deep neural networks to detect AMR-associated genetic factors from whole-genome SNP data."
