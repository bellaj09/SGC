Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI is widely used in both scientific research and clinical practice in in-vivo studies of the human brain. While a number of post-processing packages have been developed fully automated processing of dMRI datasets remains challenging. Here we developed a MATLAB toolbox named "Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges" PANDA for fully automated processing of brain diffusion images. The processing modules of a few established packages including FMRIB Software Library FSL Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab PSOM Diffusion Toolkit and MRIcron were employed in PANDA. Using any number of raw dMRI datasets from different subjects in either DICOM or NIfTI format PANDA can automatically perform a series of steps to process DICOM/NIfTI to diffusion metrics e.g. fractional anisotropy FA and mean diffusivity MD that are ready for statistical analysis at the voxel-level the atlas-level and the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics TBSS-level and can finish the construction of anatomical brain networks for all subjects. In particular PANDA can process different subjects in parallel using multiple cores either in a single computer or in a distributed computing environment thus greatly reducing the time cost when dealing with a large number of datasets. In addition PANDA has a friendly graphical user interface GUI allowing the user to be interactive and to adjust the input/output settings as well as the processing parameters. As an open-source package PANDA is freely available at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/. This novel toolbox is expected to substantially simplify the image processing of dMRI datasets and facilitate human structural connectome studies.
