The first use of a surface coil to obtain a 31P NMR spectrum from an intact rat by Ackerman and colleagues initiated a revolution in magnetic resonance imaging MRI and spectroscopy MRS. Today we take it for granted that one can detect signals in regions external to an RF coil; at the time however this concept was most unusual. In the approximately four decade long period since its introduction this simple idea gave birth to an increasing number of innovations that has led to transformative changes in the way we collect data in an in vivo magnetic resonance experiment particularly with MRI of humans. These innovations include spatial localization and/or encoding based on the non-uniform B1 field generated by the surface coil leading to new spectroscopic localization methods image acceleration and unique RF pulses that deal with B1 inhomogeneities and even reduce power deposition. Without the surface coil many of the major technological advances that define the extraordinary success of MRI in clinical diagnosis and in biomedical research as exemplified by projects like the Human Connectome Project would not have been possible. RF pulse methods for use with surface coils: Frequency-modulated pulses and parallel transmission.
