Recently introduced effective connectivity methods allow for the in-vivo investigation of large-scale functional interactions between brain regions. However dynamic causal modeling the most widely used technique to date typically captures only a few predefined regions of interest. In this study we present an alternative computational approach to infer effective connectivity within the entire connectome and show its performance on a developmental cohort with emerging language capacities. The novel approach provides new opportunities to quantify effective connectivity changes in the human brain. A new computational approach to estimate whole-brain effective connectivity from functional and structural MRI applied to language development.
