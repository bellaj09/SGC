Network science and engineering provide a flexible and generalizable tool set to describe and manipulate complex systems characterized by heterogeneous interaction patterns among component parts. While classically applied to social systems these tools have recently proven to be particularly useful in the study of the brain. In this review we describe the nascent use of these tools to understand human cognition and we discuss their utility in informing the meaningful and predictable perturbation of cognition in combination with the emerging capabilities of neurofeedback. To blend these disparate strands of research we build on emerging conceptualizations of how the brain functions as a complex network and how we can develop and target interventions or modulations as a form of network control. We close with an outline of current frontiers that bridge neurofeedback connectomics and network control theory to better understand human cognition. A network engineering perspective on probing and perturbing cognition with neurofeedback.
