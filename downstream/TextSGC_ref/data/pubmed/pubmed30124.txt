"One of the goals of biomaterials science is to reverse engineer aspects of human and nonhuman physiology. Similar to the bodys regulatory mechanisms such devices must transduce changes in the physiological environment or the presence of an external stimulus into a detectable or therapeutic response. This review is a comprehensive evaluation and critical analysis of the design and fabrication of environmentally responsive cell-material constructs for bioinspired machinery and biomimetic devices. In a bottom-up analysis we begin by reviewing fundamental principles that explain materials responses to chemical gradients biomarkers electromagnetic fields light and temperature. Strategies for fabricating highly ordered assemblies of material components at the nano to macro-scales via directed assembly lithography 3D printing and 4D printing are also presented. We conclude with an account of contemporary material-tissue interfaces within bioinspired and biomimetic devices for peptide delivery cancer theranostics biomonitoring neuroprosthetics soft robotics and biological machines."
