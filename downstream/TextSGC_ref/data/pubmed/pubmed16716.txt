"Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of forniceal deep brain stimulation DBS for improvement of memory in Alzheimers patients and forniceal DBS has been shown to improve learning and memory in a mouse model of Rett syndrome RTT an intellectual disability disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2. The mechanism of DBS benefits has been elusive however so we assessed changes in gene expression splice isoforms DNA methylation and proteome following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and mice lacking Mecp2. We found that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function cell survival and neurogenesis and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with Major Depressive Disorder suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders." Forniceal deep brain stimulation induces gene expression and splicing changes that promote neurogenesis and plasticity.
