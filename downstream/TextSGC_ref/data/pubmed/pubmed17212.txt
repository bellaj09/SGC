Lesions in the interpositus-dentate region of the cerebellum impair short-term or concurrent TAL. In this type of learning animals must discriminate between two flavor stimuli presented at the same time one of which is associated with an aversive product. The task is learned by the control animals and within this group the animals that acquire it adequately enough 15/22 70% criterion retain the learned taste discrimination when they are subjected to it again after being lesioned in the interpositus-dentate region. These results suggest that the deep nuclei are essential in the concurrent TAL acquisition process but not in its retention. Retention of concurrent taste aversion learning after electrolytic lesioning of the interpositus-dentate region of the cerebellum.
