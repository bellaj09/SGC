Concern regarding the quality of surgical training in obstetrics and gynecology residency programs is focusing attention on competency based education. Because open surgical skills cannot necessarily be translated into laparoscopic skills and with minimally invasive  surgery becoming standard in operative gynecology the discrepancy in training between obstetrics and gynecology will widen. Training on surgical simulators with virtual reality may improve surgical skills. However before incorporation into training programs for gynecology residents the validity  of such instruments needs to first be established. We sought to prove the construct validity of a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator the SurgicalSimTM by showing its ability to distinguish between surgeons with different laparoscopic experience. A surgical virtual reality simulator distinguishes between expert gynecologic laparoscopic surgeons and perinatologists.
