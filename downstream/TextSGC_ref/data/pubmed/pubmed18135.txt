We have developed a program for microarray data analysis which features the false discovery rate for testing statistical significance and the principal component analysis using the singular value decomposition method for detecting the global trends of gene-expression patterns. Additional features include analysis of variance with multiple methods for error variance adjustment correction of cross-channel correlation for two-color microarrays identification of genes specific to each cluster of tissue samples biplot of tissues and corresponding tissue-specific genes clustering of genes that are correlated with each principal component PC three-dimensional graphics based on virtual reality modeling language and sharing of PC between different experiments. The software also supports parameter adjustment gene search and graphical output of results. The software is implemented as a web tool and thus the speed of analysis does not depend on the power of a client computer. A web-based tool for principal component and significance analysis of microarray data.
