The aim of the present study was to obtain comprehensive microRNA miRNA profiles of type I Ishikawa ISK and type II HEC-1B human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines utilizing the latest high-throughput sequencing techniques. RNA was extracted from ISK and HEC-1B cell lines. Sequencing results were obtained from a next-generation sequencing platform. Using the miRBase database and a series of software pipelines miRNA expression was analyzed in the ISK and HEC-1B cell lines. It was revealed that the type and quantity of miRNAs in the two cell types varied significantly; 34 miRNAs were upregulated and 105 miRNAs were downregulated in HEC-1B cells compared with those of ISK cells. Furthermore it was observed that the expression pattern of the miRNA miR-17-92 cluster differed between the two cell types and the expression levels of the miR-200 family in ISK cells were markedly increased compared with those of HEC-1B cells. The present study therefore identified potential novel biomarkers which may be useful in the differentiation between type I and type II endometrial cancer and also revealed miRNA alterations that may be associated with endometrial cancer and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms. MicroRNA heterogeneity in endometrial cancer cell lines revealed by deep sequencing.
