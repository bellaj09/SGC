Pain by definition is a subjective experience and as such its presence has usually been based on a self-report. However limitations of self-reports for pain diagnostics particularly for legal and insurance purposes has led some to consider a brain-imaging-based objective measure of pain. This review will provide an overview of 1 differences between pain and nociception 2 intersubject variability in pain perception and the associated brain structures and functional circuits and 3 capabilities and limitations of current brain-imaging technologies. I then discuss how these factors impact objective proxies of pain. Finally the ethical privacy and legal implications of a brain-imaging-based objective measure of pain are considered as potential future technological developments necessary to create a so-called "painometer test." Legal and ethical issues of using brain imaging to diagnose pain.
