"Recent success stories in automated object or face recognition partly fuelled by deep learning artificial neural network ANN architectures have led to the advancement of biometric research platforms and to some extent the resurrection of Artificial Intelligence AI. In line with this general trend inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications such as identification of childrens emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward with several challenges arising for both science e.g. methodology underpinned by psychology and technology e.g. the iMotions biometric research platform. In this paper we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: a the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System IAPS b the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms c the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables. These are related to both automatically and interactively captured responses of participants to a sample of IAPS pictures."
