An important component of processing medical texts is the identification of synonymous words or phrases. Synonyms can inform learned representations of patients or improve linking mentioned concepts to medical ontologies. However medical synonyms can be lexically similar "dilated RA" and "dilated RV" or dissimilar "cerebrovascular accident" and "stroke"; contextual information can determine if 2 strings are synonymous. Medical professionals utilize extensive variation of medical terminology often not evidenced in structured medical resources. Therefore the ability to discover synonyms especially without reliance on training data is an important component in processing training notes. The ability to discover synonyms from models trained on large amounts of unannotated data removes the need to rely on annotated pairs of similar words. Models relying solely on non-annotated data can be trained on a wider variety of texts without the cost of annotation and thus may capture a broader variety of language. Learning unsupervised contextual representations for medical synonym discovery.
