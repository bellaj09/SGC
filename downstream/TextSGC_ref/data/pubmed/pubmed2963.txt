"Neuroimaging studies have linked inter-individual variability in the brain to individualized personality traits. However only one or several aspects of personality have been effectively predicted based on brain imaging features. The objective of this study was to construct a reliable prediction model of personality in a large sample by using connectome-based predictive modeling CPM a recently developed machine learning approach. High-quality resting-state fMRI data of 810 healthy young participants from the Human Connectome Project dataset were used to construct large-scale brain networks. Personality traits of the five-factor model FFM were assessed by the NEO Five Factor Inventory. We found that CPM successfully and reliably predicted all the FFM personality factors agreeableness openness conscientiousness and neuroticism other than extraversion in novel individuals. At the neural level we found that the personality-associated functional networks mainly included brain regions within default-mode frontoparietal executive-control visual and cerebellar systems. Although different feature selection thresholds and parcellation strategies did not significantly influence the prediction results some findings lost significance after controlling for confounds including age gender intelligence and head motion. Our finding of robust personality prediction from an individuals unique functional connectome may help advance the translation of brain connectivity fingerprinting into real-world personality psychological settings."
