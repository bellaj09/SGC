Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs the brain responses to repetitive visual stimulation RVS are widely utilized in neuroscience. Their high signal-to-noise ratio and ability to entrain oscillatory brain activity are beneficial for their applications in brain-computer interfaces investigation of neural processes underlying brain rhythmic activity steady-state topography and probing the causal role of brain rhythms in cognition and emotion. This paper aims at analyzing the space and time EEG dynamics in response to RVS at the frequency of stimulation and ongoing rhythms in the delta theta alpha beta and gamma bands. Neural dynamics during repetitive visual stimulation.
