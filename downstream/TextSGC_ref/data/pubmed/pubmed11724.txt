Mismatch between invasive mechanical ventilation and the requirements of patients results in patient-ventilator asynchrony PVA which is associated with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Although the efficiency of the available approaches for automatically detecting various types of PVA from the ventilator waveforms is unsatisfactory the feasibility of powerful deep learning approaches in addressing this problem has not been investigated. Detection of patient-ventilator asynchrony from mechanical ventilation waveforms using a two-layer long short-term memory neural network.
