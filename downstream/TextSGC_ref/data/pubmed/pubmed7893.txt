Melanoma is a fatal form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed. Computer-aided diagnosis systems powered by convolutional neural networks CNNs can improve diagnostic accuracy and save lives. CNNs have been successfully used in both skin lesion segmentation and classification. For reasons heretofore unclear previous works have found image segmentation to be conflictingly both detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the target lesion. Ostensibly segmenting a target skin lesion will remove inessential information non-lesion skin and artifacts to aid in classification. Our results indicate that segmentation border enlargement produces to a certain degree better results across all metrics of interest when using a convolutional based classifier built using the transfer learning paradigm. Consequently preprocessing methods which produce borders larger than the actual lesion can potentially improve classifier performance more than both perfect segmentation using dermatologist created ground truth masks and no segmentation altogether.
