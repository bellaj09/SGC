Problems of neurological rehabilitation are considered based on two levels of the International Classification of Functioning ICF-Body Structures and Function level and Activity level-and modulating factors related to the individual and the environment. Specifically at the Body Structures and Function level problems addressed include spasticity muscle weakness disordered muscle activation patterns and disruptions in coordinated movement. At the Activity level deficits in multi-joint and multi-segment upper limb reaching movements are reviewed. We address how physiologically well established principles in the control of actions Threshold Control and Referent Control as outlined in the Equilibrium-Point theory can help advance the understanding of underlying deficits that may limit recovery at each level. Principles of Motor Recovery After Neurological Injury Based on a Motor Control Theory.
