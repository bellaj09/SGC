Endovascular aortic repair EVAR is a minimal-invasive technique that prevents life-threatening rupture in patients with aortic pathologies by implantation of an endoluminal stent graft. During the endovascular procedure device navigation is currently performed by fluoroscopy in combination with digital subtraction angiography. This study presents the current iterative process of biomedical engineering within the disruptive interdisciplinary project Nav EVAR which includes advanced navigation image techniques and augmented reality with the aim of reducing side effects namely radiation exposure and contrast agent administration and optimising visualisation during EVAR procedures. This article describes the current prototype developed in this project and the experiments conducted to evaluate it. Navigation and visualisation with HoloLens in endovascular aortic repair.
