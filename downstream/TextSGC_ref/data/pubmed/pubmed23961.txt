In the process of transforming and upgrading of traditional Chinese medicine TCM intelligent manufacturingthe TCM enterprises lack systematic and in-depth research on intelligent manufacturing of TCMleading to insufficient understanding of relevant conceptsdevelopment directiondevelopment content and other aspectsto some extentcausing fuzzy and chaotic phenomena. The theoretical modelas a higher expression level of scientific thinkinghas the function of interpretation and predictionand can provide theoretical basis as well as guide for scientific research. Thereforethis article aims to construct a theoretical model of TCM intelligent manufacturing based on the concept of flexible production and intelligent equipment for some unhealthy phenomena in the development process of TCM intelligent manufacturing. In the TCM intelligent manufacturing systemwith theory model as the corethe new-generation information technology was integrated with the TCM manufacturing technology to realize the integration of informationization and industrilization as well as the landing of theoretical model. Thena 3 D simulation model was established to provide a visual environment for intelligent manufacturing of TCM and simulate the virtual reality throughout the TCM intelligent manufacturing process. The new theoretical model in this paperto a certain extentcan play a guiding role in the development of TCM intelligent manufacturingand can also provide reference for the realization of TCM intelligent manufacturing. Construction of theoretical model of traditional Chinese medicine intelligent manufacturing.
