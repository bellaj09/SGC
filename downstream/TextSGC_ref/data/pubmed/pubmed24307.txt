Electroencephalogram EEG recordings aroused as inputs of a motor imagery based BCI system. Eye blinks contaminate the spectral frequency of the EEG signals. Independent Component Analysis ICA has been already proved for removing these artifacts whose frequency band overlap with the EEG of interest. However already ICA developed methods use a reference lead such as the ElectroOculoGram EOG to identify the ocular artifact components. In this study artifactual components were identified using an adaptive thresholding by means of Kmeans clustering. The denoised EEG signals have been fed into a feature extraction algorithm extracting the band power the coherence and the phase locking value and inserted into a linear discriminant analysis classifier for a motor imagery classification. Kmeans-ICA based automatic method for ocular artifacts removal in a motorimagery classification.
