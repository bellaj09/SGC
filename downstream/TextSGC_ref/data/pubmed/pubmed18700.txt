In visual perception change blindness describes the phenomenon that persons viewing a visual scene may apparently fail to detect significant changes in that scene. These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality VR systems providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems i.e. a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system i.e. a head-mounted display and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt and yet significant changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.
