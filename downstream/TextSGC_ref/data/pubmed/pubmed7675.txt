High-performance ligand-based virtual screening VS models have been developed using various computational methods including the deep neural network DNN method. There are high expectations for exploration of the advanced capabilities of DNN to improve VS performance and this capability has been optimally achieved using large data training datasets. However their ability to screen large compound libraries has not been evaluated. There is a need for developing and evaluating ligand-based large data DNN VS models for large compound libraries. In this study we developed ligand-based large data DNN VS models for inhibitors of six anticancer targets using 0.5\u2005M training compounds. The developed VS models were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation achieving 77.9-97.8\u2009% sensitivity 99.9-100\u2009% specificity 0.82-0.98 Matthews correlation coefficient and 0.98-0.99 area under the curve outperforming random forest models. Moreover DNN VS models developed by pre-2015 inhibitors identified 50\u2009% of post-2015 inhibitors with a 0.01-0.09\u2009% false positive rate in screening 89\u2005M PubChem compounds also outperforming previous models. Experimental assays of the selected virtual hits of the EGFR inhibitor model led to reasonable novel structures of EGFR inhibitors. Our results confirmed the usefulness of the large data DNN model as a ligand-based VS tool to screen large compound libraries.
