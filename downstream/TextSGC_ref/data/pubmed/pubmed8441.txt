Face recognition functions are today exploited through biometric sensors in many applications from extended security systems to inclusion devices; deep neural network methods are reaching in this field stunning performances. The main limitation of the deep learning approach is an inconvenient relation between the accuracy of the results and the needed computing power. When a personal device is employed in particular many algorithms require a cloud computing approach to achieve the expected performances; other algorithms adopt models that are simple by design. A third viable option consists of model oracle distillation. This is the most intriguing among the compression techniques since it permits to devise of the minimal structure that will enforce the same I/O relation as the original model. In this paper a distillation technique is applied to a complex model enabling the introduction of fast state-of-the-art recognition capabilities on a low-end hardware face recognition sensor module. Two distilled models are presented in this contribution: the former can be directly used in place of the original oracle while the latter incarnates better the end-to-end approach removing the need for a separate alignment procedure. The presented biometric systems are examined on the two problems of face verification and face recognition in an open set by using well-agreed training/testing methodologies and datasets.
