Convergence insufficiency may be treated by visual exercises designed to increase convergence while maintaining single clear binocular vision. However compliance with treatment is problematic as patients often cease treatment when symptoms start to improve and before treatment is complete. The purpose of the present study was to assess the feasibility of using gamification of vision training to: a treat convergence insufficiency; and b improve compliance to treatment in comparison to a conventional treatment over a six-week treatment period. Treatment and compliance with virtual reality and anaglyph-based training programs for convergence insufficiency.
