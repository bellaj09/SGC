There is conflict regarding the benefits of greater amounts of intensive upper limb rehabilitation in the early period post-stroke. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of providing intensive therapy during the early period post-stroke and to develop a randomized control trial that is currently in process. Specifically the study investigated whether an additional 8\u2009h of specialized intensive 200-300 separate hand or arm movements per hour virtual reality VR/robotic based upper limb training introduced within 1-month post-stroke resulted in greater improvement in impairment and behavior and distinct changes in cortical reorganization measured via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation TMS compared to that of a control group. Intensive virtual reality and robotic based upper limb training compared to usual care and associated cortical reorganization in the acute and early sub-acute periods post-stroke: a feasibility study.
