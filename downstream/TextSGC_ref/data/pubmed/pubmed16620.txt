"Several computational models have been developed in order to improve the outcome of Vein Graft Bypasses in response to arterial occlusions and they all share a common property: their accuracy relies on a winning choice of the coefficients value related to biological functions that drive them. Our goal is to optimize the retrieval of these unknown coefficients on the base of experimental data and accordingly as biological experiments are noisy in terms of statistical analysis and the models are typically stochastic and complex this work wants first to elucidate which experimental measurements might be sufficient to retrieve the targeted coefficients and second how many specimens would constitute a good dataset to guarantee a sufficient level of accuracy. Since experiments are often costly and time consuming the planning stage is critical to the success of the operation and on the base of this consideration the present work shows how thanks to an ad hoc use of a computational model of vascular adaptation it is possible to estimate in advance the entity and the quantity of resources needed in order to efficiently reproduce the experimental reality."
