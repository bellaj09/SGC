"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs provide high rates of accuracy and information transfer rate but need users attention to flickering visual stimuli. This quickly leads to eye-fatigue when the flickering frequency is in the low-frequency range. High-frequency flickering stimuli >30 Hz have been proposed with significantly lower eye-fatigue. However SSVEP responses in this frequency range are remarkably weaker leading to doubts about usability of high-frequency stimuli to develop efficient BCI systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a practical SSVEP Speller can be developed with Repetitive Visual Stimuli in the high-frequency range."
