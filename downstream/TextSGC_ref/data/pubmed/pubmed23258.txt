In order to improve the accuracy of classification with small amount of motor imagery training data on the development of brain-computer interface BCD systems we proposed an analyzing method to automatically select the characteristic parameters based on correlation coefficient analysis. Throughout the five sample data of dataset IV a from 2005 BCI Competition we utilized short-time Fourier transform STFT and correlation coefficient calculation to reduce the number of primitive electroencephalogram dimension then introduced feature extraction based on common spatial pattern CSP and classified by linear discriminant analysis LDA. Simulation results showed that the average rate of classification accuracy could be improved by using correlation coefficient feature selection method than those without using this algorithm. Comparing with support vector machine SVM optimization features algorithm the correlation coefficient analysis can lead better selection parameters to improve the accuracy of classification.
