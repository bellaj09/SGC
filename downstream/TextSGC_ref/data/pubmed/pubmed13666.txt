Multistage processing of automated breast ultrasound lesions recognition is dependent on the performance of prior stages. To improve the current state of the art we propose the use of end-to-end deep learning approaches using fully convolutional networks FCNs namely FCN-AlexNet FCN-32s FCN-16s and FCN-8s for semantic segmentation of breast lesions. We use pretrained models based on ImageNet and transfer learning to overcome the issue of data deficiency. We evaluate our results on two datasets which consist of a total of 113 malignant and 356 benign lesions. To assess the performance we conduct fivefold cross validation using the following split: 70% for training data 10% for validation data and 20% testing data. The results showed that our proposed method performed better on benign lesions with a top "mean Dice" score of 0.7626 with FCN-16s when compared with the malignant lesions with a top mean Dice score of 0.5484 with FCN-8s. When considering the number of images with Dice score > 0.5  89.6% of the benign lesions were successfully segmented and correctly recognised whereas 60.6% of the malignant lesions were successfully segmented and correctly recognized. We conclude the paper by addressing the future challenges of the work. Breast ultrasound lesions recognition: end-to-end deep learning approaches.
