"Social information processing SIP skills are critical for developing and maintaining peer relationships. Building on existing assessment techniques Virtual Environment for SIP VESIPTM  a simulation-based assessment that immerses children in social decision-making scenarios was developed. This study presents preliminary evidence of VESIPs usefulness for measuring SIP skills in children with and without autism spectrum disorders ASD. Twenty-one children with ASD and 29 control children participated. It was hypothesized that a children 8-12 years old with and without ASD would understand and interact effectively with VESIP; b VESIP scores would be reliable in both populations; and c children with ASD would score lower on SIP domains than typically developing peers. Results supported these hypotheses. Finally response bias was also evaluated showing that children with ASD have different problem-solving strategies than their peers. VESIP has great potential as a scalable assessment of SIP strengths and challenges in children with and without ASD.
