Animal studies suggest that time delay between acquisition and retrieval of contextual anxiety increases generalization. Moreover such generalization is prevented by preexposure to the context CTX presumably due to an improved representation of such context. We investigated whether preexposure and time-passing modulate generalization of contextual anxiety in humans. On Day 1 42 participants preexposure group explored two virtual offices while 41 participants no-preexposure group explored a virtual stadium. On Day 2 24 h later all participants learned to associate one office CTX+ with unpredictable unconditioned stimuli USs and another office CTX- with safety. On Day 3 either 24 h recent test or 2 wk remote test later participants revisited CTX- and CTX+ without USs as well as a generalization context G-CTX. Results revealed successfully conditioned anxiety and anxiety generalization for ratings G-CTX was as aversive as CTX+ was while safety generalization was found for startle responses G-CTX elicited startle attenuation as CTX- did. Time between learning and testing enhanced generalization as reflected by comparable startle responses to all three offices in the remote test. Contextual preexposure facilitated extinction of explicit conditioned anxiety assessed with ratings. These results suggest that memory trace of a context degrades with passage of time in humans like in animals and consequently anxiety generalization enhances. After context preexposure high cognitive processes seem to be crucially involved in facilitating extinction or safety learning. Effects of context preexposure and delay until anxiety retrieval on generalization of contextual anxiety.
