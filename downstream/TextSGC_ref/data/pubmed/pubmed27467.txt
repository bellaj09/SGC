The research on brain computer interfaces BCIs has become a hotspot in recent years because it offers benefit to disabled people to communicate with the outside world. Steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCIs are more widely used because of higher signal to noise ratio and greater information transfer rate compared with other BCI techniques. In this paper a multiple signal classification based method was proposed for multi-dimensional SSVEP feature extraction. 2-second data epochs from four electrodes achieved excellent accuracy rates including idle state detection. In some asynchronous mode experiments the recognition accuracy reached up to 100%. The experimental results showed that the proposed method attained good frequency resolution. In most situations the recognition accuracy was higher than canonical correlation analysis which is a typical method for multi-channel SSVEP signal processing. Also a virtual keyboard was successfully controlled by different subjects in an unshielded environment which proved the feasibility of the proposed method for multi-dimensional SSVEP signal processing in practical applications.
