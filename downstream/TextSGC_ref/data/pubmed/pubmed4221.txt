Cortical high-frequency oscillations HFOs; 100-500 Hz play a critical role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy; however whether they represent a true epileptogenic process remains largely unknown. HFOs have been recorded in the human cortex but their network dynamics during the transitional period from interictal to ictal phase remain largely unknown. We sought to determine the high-frequency network dynamics of these oscillations in patients with epilepsy who were undergoing intracranial electroencephalographic recording for seizure localization. High-frequency brain networks undergo modular breakdown during epileptic seizures.
