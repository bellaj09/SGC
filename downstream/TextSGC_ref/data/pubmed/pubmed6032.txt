Lung cancer is the most common cancer among men and the third most common among women in the world. Many diagnostic techniques have been introduced to diagnose lung cancer. Positron emission tomography PET/computed tomography CT examination is an image diagnostic method that performs automatic detection and distinction of lung lesions. In addition pathological examination by biopsy is performed for lesions that are suspected of being malignant and appropriate treatment methods are applied according to the diagnosis results. Currently lung cancer diagnosis is performed through coordination between respiratory radiation and pathological diagnosis experts but there are some tasks such as image diagnosis that require a large amount of time and effort to complete. Therefore we developed a decision support system using PET/CT and microscopic images at the time of image diagnosis which leads to appropriate treatment. In this chapter we introduce the proposed system using deep learning and radiomic techniques. Decision Support System for Lung Cancer Using PET/CT and Microscopic Images.
