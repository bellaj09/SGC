"Purpose: To examine the feasibility and efficacy of a combined motor-cognitive training using virtual reality to enhance behavior cognitive function and dual-tasking in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD. Methods: Fourteen non-medicated school-aged children with ADHD received 18 training sessions during 6\xa0weeks. Training included walking on a treadmill while negotiating virtual obstacles. Behavioral symptoms cognition and gait were tested before and after the training and at 6-weeks follow-up. Results: Based on parental report there was a significant improvement in childrens social problems and psychosomatic behavior after the training. Executive function and memory were improved post-training while attention was unchanged. Gait regularity significantly increased during dual-task walking. Long-term training effects were maintained in memory and executive function. Conclusion: Treadmill-training augmented with virtual-reality is feasible and may be an effective treatment to enhance behavior cognitive function and dual-tasking in children with ADHD."
