DNA methylation DNAm is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression programs that can be altered by environmental exposures aging and in pathogenesis. Traditional analyses that associate DNAm alterations with phenotypes suffer from multiple hypothesis testing and multi-collinearity due to the high-dimensional continuous interacting and non-linear nature of the data. Deep learning analyses have shown much promise to study disease heterogeneity. DNAm deep learning approaches have not yet been formalized into user-friendly frameworks for execution training and interpreting models. Here we describe MethylNet a DNAm deep learning method that can construct embeddings make predictions generate new data and uncover unknown heterogeneity with minimal user supervision. MethylNet: an automated and modular deep learning approach for DNA methylation analysis.
