The global burden of cancer severe diagnostic bottlenecks in underserved regions and underfunded health care systems are fueling the need for inexpensive rapid and treatment-informative diagnostics. On the basis of advances in computational optics and deep learning we have developed a low-cost digital system termed AIDA artificial intelligence diffraction analysis for breast cancer diagnosis of fine needle aspirates. Here we show high accuracy >90% in i recognizing cells directly from diffraction patterns and ii classifying breast cancer types using deep-learning-based analysis of sample aspirates. The image algorithm is fast enabling cellular analyses at high throughput 3 s per 1000 cells and the unsupervised processing allows use by lower skill health care workers. AIDA can perform quantitative molecular profiling on individual cells revealing intratumor molecular heterogeneity and has the potential to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. The system could be further developed for other cancers and thus find widespread use in global health. Computational Optics Enables Breast Cancer Profiling in Point-of-Care Settings.
