Human activity recognition HAR which is important in context awareness services needs to occur continuously in daily life owing to which an energy-efficient method is needed. However because human activities have a longer cycle than HAR methods which have analysis cycles of a few seconds continuous classification of human activities using these methods is computationally and energy inefficient. Therefore we propose segment-level change detection to identify activity change with very low computational complexity. Additionally a fully convolutional network FCN with a high recognition rate is used to classify the activity only when activity change occurs. We compared the accuracy and energy consumption of the proposed method with that of a method based on a convolutional neural network CNN by using a public dataset on different embedded platforms. The experimental results showed that although the recognition rate of the proposed FCN model is similar to that of the CNN model the former requires only 10% of the network parameters of the CNN model. In addition our experiments to measure the energy consumption on the embedded platforms showed that the proposed method uses as much as 6.5 times less energy than the CNN-based method when only HAR energy consumption is compared.
