Longitudinal observation of single unit neural activity from large numbers of cortical neurons in awake and mobile animals is often a vital step in studying neural network behaviour and towards the prospect of building effective brain-machine interfaces BMIs. These recordings generate enormous amounts of data for transmission and storage and typically require offline processing to tease out the behaviour of individual neurons. Our aim was to create a compact system capable of: 1 reducing the data bandwidth by circa 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greatly improving battery lifetime and enabling low power wireless transmission in future versions; 2 producing real-time low-latency spike sorted data; and 3 long term untethered operation. Compact standalone platform for neural recording with real-time spike sorting and data logging.
