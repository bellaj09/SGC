The clinical application of robotic-assisted surgery RAS is rapidly increasing. The da Vinci Surgical System is currently the only commercially available RAS system. The skills necessary to perform robotic surgery are unique from those required for open and laparoscopic surgery. A validated laparoscopic surgical skills curriculum fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery or FLS has transformed the way surgeons acquire laparoscopic skills. There is a need for a similar skills training and assessment tool specific for robotic surgery. Based on previously published data and expert opinion we developed a robotic skills curriculum. We sought to evaluate this curriculum for evidence of construct validity ability to discriminate between users of different skill levels. Validation of a virtual reality-based robotic surgical skills curriculum.
