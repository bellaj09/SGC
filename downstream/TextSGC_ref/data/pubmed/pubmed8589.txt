"We propose a fully automatic technique to obtain aberration free quantitative phase imaging in digital holographic microscopy DHM based on deep learning. The traditional DHM solves the phase aberration compensation problem by manually detecting the background for quantitative measurement. This would be a drawback in real time implementation and for dynamic processes such as cell migration phenomena. A recent automatic aberration compensation approach using principle component analysis PCA in DHM avoids human intervention regardless of the cells motion. However it corrects spherical/elliptical aberration only and disregards the higher order aberrations. Traditional image segmentation techniques can be employed to spatially detect cell locations. Ideally automatic image segmentation techniques make real time measurement possible. However existing automatic unsupervised segmentation techniques have poor performance when applied to DHM phase images because of aberrations and speckle noise. In this paper we propose a novel method that combines a supervised deep learning technique with convolutional neural network CNN and Zernike polynomial fitting ZPF. The deep learning CNN is implemented to perform automatic background region detection that allows for ZPF to compute the self-conjugated phase to compensate for most aberrations."
