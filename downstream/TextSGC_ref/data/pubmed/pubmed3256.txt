Diffuse axonal injury DAI is characterized by diffuse white matter WM disruption caused by shearing forces acting on the brain. Cortical atrophy can be accompanied by WM disruption which is assumed to reflect the loss of neuron cell bodies in gray matter GM regions adjacent to disrupted WM. It remains unclear whether WM disruption leads to regional GM alteration in DAI. The aim of the present study was to assess WM disruption and corresponding GM alterations in patients with DAI using a connectome-based approach. Twenty-four patients and 24 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging DTI. Deterministic fiber tracking was conducted to investigate structural connectivity between the corpus callosum CC and each pre-defined regional cortical area. We calculated 85\u2009\u200985 connectivity matrices for fractional anisotropy FA. Group comparisons were conducted to identify abnormal connectivity in patients. Further the regional cortical volume of each connectivity matrix was compared between patients and controls. Finally correlation analyses between the matrices and regional cortical volumes were performed within the patient group. Connectome analyses revealed that compared with controls patients exhibited a FA reduction in connectivity via CC to 32 cortical regions including the frontal parietal and occipital cortices. Among these regions GM volume was reduced in 19 of 32 regions. There were no significant correlations between WM disruption in which abnormal connectivity was identified and the corresponding GM alterations. These results suggest that GM pathology is at least in part independent of the corresponding WM damage in DAI.
