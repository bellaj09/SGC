Stimulus-locked response-locked and ERP-locked averaging are effective methods for reducing artifacts in ERP analysis. However they suffer from a magnifying-glass effect: they increase the resolution of specific ERPs at the cost of blurring other ERPs. Here we propose an extremely simple technique-binning trials based on response times and then averaging-which can significantly alleviate the problems of other averaging methods. We have empirically evaluated the technique in an experiment where the task requires detecting a target in the presence of distractors. We have also studied the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of averages with and without binning. Results indicate that the method produces clearer representations of ERPs than either stimulus-locked and response-locked averaging revealing finer details of ERPs and helping in the evaluation of the amplitude and latency of ERP waves. The method is applicable to within-subject and between-subject averages. Reaction-time binning: a simple method for increasing the resolving power of ERP averages.
