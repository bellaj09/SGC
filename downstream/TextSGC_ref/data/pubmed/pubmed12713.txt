Lack of treatment adherence can lead to life-threatening health complications for people with type 2 diabetes T2D. Recent improvements and availability in continuous glucose monitoring CGM technology have enabled various possibilities to monitor diabetes treatment. Detection of missed once-daily basal insulin injections can be used to provide feedback to patients thus improving their diabetes management. In this study we explore how machine learning ML based on CGM data can be used for detecting adherence to once-daily basal insulin injections. Machine Learning-Based Adherence Detection of Type 2 Diabetes Patients on Once-Daily Basal Insulin Injections.
