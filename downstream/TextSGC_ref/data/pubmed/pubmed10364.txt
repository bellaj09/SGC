Air pollutant concentration forecasting is an effective method of protecting public health by providing an early warning against harmful air pollutants. However existing methods of air pollutant concentration prediction fail to effectively model long-term dependencies and most neglect spatial correlations. In this paper a novel long short-term memory neural network extended LSTME model that inherently considers spatiotemporal correlations is proposed for air pollutant concentration prediction. Long short-term memory LSTM layers were used to automatically extract inherent useful features from historical air pollutant data and auxiliary data including meteorological data and time stamp data were merged into the proposed model to enhance the performance. Hourly PM2.5 particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5\xa0m concentration data collected at 12 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing City from Jan/01/2014 to May/28/2016 were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed LSTME model. Experiments were performed using the spatiotemporal deep learning STDL model the time delay neural network TDNN model the autoregressive moving average ARMA model the support vector regression SVR model and the traditional LSTM NN model and a comparison of the results demonstrated that the LSTME model is superior to the other statistics-based models. Additionally the use of auxiliary data improved model performance. For the one-hour prediction tasks the proposed model performed well and exhibited a mean absolute percentage error MAPE of 11.93%. In addition we conducted multiscale predictions over different time spans and achieved satisfactory performance even for 13-24\xa0h prediction tasks MAPE\xa0=\xa031.47%.
