We investigated whether functional neuroimaging of quiet "rest" can reveal the neural correlates of conscious thought. Using resting-state functional MRI we measured functional connectivity during a resting scan that immediately followed performance of a finger tapping motor sequence task. Self-reports of the amount of time spent thinking about the task during the resting scan correlated with connectivity between regions of the motor network activated during task performance. Thus thinking about a task is associated with coordinated activity in brain regions responsible for that task\s performance. More generally this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the combination of functional connectivity MRI and self-reports to examine the neural correlates of thought. Thinking About a Task Is Associated with Increased Connectivity in Regions Activated by Task Performance.
