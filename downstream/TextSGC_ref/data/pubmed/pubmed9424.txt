Skin melanoma is one of the major health problems in many countries. Dermatologists usually diagnose melanoma by visual inspection of moles. Digital hair removal can provide a non-invasive way to remove hair and hair-like regions as a pre-processing step for skin lesion images. Hair removal has two main steps: hair segmentation and hair gaps inpainting. However hair segmentation is a challenging task which requires manual tuning of thresholding parameters. Hard-coded threshold leads to over-segmentation false positives which in return changes the textural integrity of lesions and or under-segmentation false negatives which leaves hair traces and artefacts which affect subsequent diagnosis. Additionally dermal hair exhibits different characteristics: thin; overlapping; faded; occluded and overlaid on textured lesions.
