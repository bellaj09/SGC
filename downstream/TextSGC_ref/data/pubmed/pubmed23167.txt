Research into brain-computer interfaces BCIs which spell words using brain signals has revealed that a desktop version of such a speller the edges paradigm offers several advantages: This edges paradigm outperforms the benchmark row-column paradigm in terms of accuracy bitrate and user experience. It has remained unknown whether these advantages prevailed with a new version of the edges paradigm designed for a mobile device. This paper investigated and evaluated in a rolling wheelchair a mobile BCI which implemented the edges paradigm on small displays with which visual crowding tends to occur. How the mobile edge paradigm outperforms the mobile row-column paradigm has implications for understanding how principles of visual neurocognition affect BCI speller use in a mobile context. This investigation revealed that all the advantages of the edges paradigm over the row-column paradigm prevailed in this setting. However the reduction in adjacent errors for the edges paradigm was unprecedentedly limited to horizontal adjacent errors. The interpretation offered is that dimensional constraints of visual interface design on a smartphone thus affected the neurocognitive processes of crowding.
