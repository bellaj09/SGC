"Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT with exposure exercises is considered as the gold-standard psychological intervention. New psychotherapeutic modalities have emerged in the last decade and among them mindfulness has been rapidly adopted by therapists. The adoption rate is slower for the use of virtual reality VR to conduct exposure. The goal of the present position paper is to contrast for the treatment of anxiety disorders the weight of empirical evidences supporting the use of exposure in VR with the use of mindfulness-based therapy MBT. Based on the most recent meta-analyses we found that CBT with exposure conducted in VR was more thoroughly researched and supported than MBT receiving validation from roughly twice as many studies with high control i.e. randomized active controls with clinical samples. However this conclusion is nuanced by reviewing gaps in the literature for both therapies. Potential factors influencing clinicians choice of treatment and suggestions for future research directions are proposed."
