It is widely acknowledged that single image super-resolution SISR methods play a critical role in recovering the missing high-frequencies in an input low-resolution image. As SISR is severely ill-conditioned image priors are necessary to regularize the solution spaces and generate the corresponding high-resolution image. In this paper we propose an effective SISR framework based on the enhanced non-local similarity modeling and learning-based multi-directional feature prediction ENLTV-MDFP. Since both the modeled and learned priors are exploited the proposed ENLTV-MDFP method benefits from the complementary properties of the reconstruction-based and learning-based SISR approaches. Specifically for the non-local similarity-based modeled prior enhanced non-local total variation ENLTV it is characterized via the decaying kernel and stable group similarity reliability schemes. For the learned prior multi-directional feature prediction prior MDFP it is learned via the deep convolutional neural network. The modeled prior performs well in enhancing edges and suppressing visual artifacts while the learned prior is effective in hallucinating details from external images. Combining these two complementary priors in the MAP framework a combined SR cost function is proposed. Finally the combined SR problem is solved via the split Bregman iteration algorithm. Based on the extensive experiments the proposed ENLTV-MDFP method outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms visually and quantitatively.
