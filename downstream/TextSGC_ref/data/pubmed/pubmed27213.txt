"Objective: Previous studies have shown that the performance of the famous face P300-speller was better than that of the classical row/column flashing P300-speller. Furthermore in some studies the brain was more active when responding to ones own face than to a famous face and a self-face stimulus elicited larger amplitude event-related potentials ERPs than did a famous face. Thus we aimed to study the role of the self-face paradigm on further improving the performance of the P300-speller system with the famous face P300-speller paradigm as the control paradigm. Methods: We designed two facial P300-speller paradigms based on the self-face and a famous face Ming Yao a sports star; the famous face spelling paradigm with a neutral expression. Results: ERP amplitudes were significantly greater in the self-face than in the famous face spelling paradigm at the parietal area from 340 to 480 ms P300 from 480 to 600 ms P600f and at the fronto-central area from 700 to 800 ms. Offline and online classification results showed that the self-face spelling paradigm accuracies were significantly higher than those of the famous face spelling paradigm at superposing first two times P < 0.05. Similar results were found for information transfer rates P < 0.05. Conclusions: The self-face spelling paradigm significantly improved the performance of the P300-speller system. This has significant practical applications for brain-computer interfaces BCIs and could avoid infringement issues caused by using images of other peoples faces."
