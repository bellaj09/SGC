Despite advances in the new science of connectomics which aims to comprehensively map neural connections at both structural and functional levels techniques to directly study the function of white matter tracts in vivo in humans have proved elusive. Direct electrical stimulation DES mapping of the subcortical fibres offers a unique opportunity to investigate the functional connectivity of the brain. This original method permits real-time anatomo-functional correlations especially with regard to neural pathways in awake patients undergoing brain surgery. In this article the goal is to review new insights gained from axonal DES into the functional connectivity underlying the sensorimotor visuospatial language and sociocognitive systems. Interactions between these neural networks and multimodal systems such as working memory attention executive functions and consciousness can also be investigated by axonal stimulation. In this networking model of conation and cognition brain processing is not conceived as the sum of several subfunctions but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel-though partially overlapping-subnetworks. This hodotopical account supported by axonal DES improves our understanding of neuroplasticity and its limitations. The clinical implications of this paradigmatic shift from localizationism to hodotopy in the context of brain surgery neurology neurorehabilitation and psychiatry are discussed.
