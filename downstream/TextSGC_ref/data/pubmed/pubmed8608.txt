"In recent years quantitative analysis of root growth has become increasingly important as a way to explore the influence of abiotic stress such as high temperature and drought on a plants ability to take up water and nutrients. Segmentation and feature extraction of plant roots from images presents a significant computer vision challenge. Root images contain complicated structures variations in size background occlusion clutter and variation in lighting conditions. We present a new image analysis approach that provides fully automatic extraction of complex root system architectures from a range of plant species in varied imaging set-ups. Driven by modern deep-learning approaches RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task convolutional neural network architecture. The network also locates seeds first order and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image extracting accurate architectures without user interaction."
