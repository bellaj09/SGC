Post-traumatic stress disorder is a concerning psychobehavioral disorder thought to emerge from the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. For soldiers exposed to combat the risk of developing this disorder is twofold and diagnosis is often late when much sequela has set in. To be able to identify and diagnose in advance those at "risk" of developing post-traumatic stress disorder would greatly taper the gap between late sequelae and treatment. Therefore this study sought to determine whether the transcriptome can be used to track the development of post-traumatic stress disorder in this unique and susceptible cohort of individuals. Gene expression levels in peripheral blood samples from 85 Canadian infantry soldiers n = 58 participants negative for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and n = 27 participants with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder following return from deployment to Afghanistan were determined using RNA sequencing technology. Count-based gene expression quantification normalization and differential analysis with thorough correction for confounders revealed genes associated to PTSD; LRP8 and GOLM1 These preliminary results provide a proof-of-principle for the diagnostic utility of blood-based gene expression profiles for tracking symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers returning from tour. It is also the first to report transcriptome-wide expression profiles alongside a post-traumatic symptom checklist.
