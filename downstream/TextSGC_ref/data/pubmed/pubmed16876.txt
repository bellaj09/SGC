We investigate the accuracy with which the haptic sharpness perception of a virtual edge is matched to that of a real edge and the effect of the virtual surface stiffness on the match. The perceived sharpness of virtual edges was estimated in terms of the point of subjective equality PSE when participants matched the sharpness of virtual edges to that of real edges with a radius of 0.5 2.5 and 12.5 mm over a virtual stiffness range of 0.6 to 3.0 N/mm. The perceived sharpness of a real and a virtual edge of the same radius was significantly different under all but one of the experimental conditions and there was a significant effect of virtual surface stiffness on the accuracy of the match. The results suggest that the latter is presumably due to a constant penetration force employed by the participants that influenced the penetration depth and perceived sharpness of virtual edges at different surface stiffness levels. Our findings provide quantitative relations for appropriately offsetting the radii of virtual edges in order to achieve the desired perceived sharpness of virtual edges.
