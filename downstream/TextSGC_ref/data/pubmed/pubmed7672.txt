Skin disease is the most common problem between people. Due to pollution and deployment of ozone layer harmful UV rays of sun burn the skin and develop various types of skin diseases. Nowadays machine learning and deep learning algorithms are generally used for diagnosis for various kinds of diseases. In this study we have applied three feature extraction techniques univariate feature selection feature importance and correlation matrix with heat map to find the optimum data subset of erythemato-squamous disease. Four classification techniques Gaussian Nave Bayesian NB decision tree DT support vector machine SVM and random forest are used for measuring the performance of model. Stacking ensemble technique is then applied to enhance the prediction performance of the model. The proposed method used for measuring the performance of the model. It is finding that the optimal subset of the erythemato-squamous disease is performed well in the case of correlation and heat map feature selection techniques. The mean value slandered deviation root mean square error kappa statistical error and area under receiver operating characteristics and accuracy are calculated for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model. The feature selection techniques applied with staking ensemble technique gives the better result as compared to individual machine learning techniques. The obtained results show that the performance of proposed model is higher than previous results obtained by researchers.
