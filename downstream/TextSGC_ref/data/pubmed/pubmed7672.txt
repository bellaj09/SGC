Deep-learning algorithms typically fall within the domain of supervised artificial intelligence and are designed to "learn" from annotated data. Deep-learning models require large diverse training datasets for optimal model convergence. The effort to curate these datasets is widely regarded as a barrier to the development of deep-learning systems. We developed RIL-Contour to accelerate medical image annotation for and with deep-learning. A major goal driving the development of the software was to create an environment which enables clinically oriented users to utilize deep-learning models to rapidly annotate medical imaging. RIL-Contour supports using fully automated deep-learning methods semi-automated methods and manual methods to annotate medical imaging with voxel and/or text annotations. To reduce annotation error RIL-Contour promotes the standardization of image annotations across a dataset. RIL-Contour accelerates medical imaging annotation through the process of annotation by iterative deep learning AID. The underlying concept of AID is to iteratively annotate train and utilize deep-learning models during the process of dataset annotation and model development. To enable this RIL-Contour supports workflows in which multiple-image analysts annotate medical images radiologists approve the annotations and data scientists utilize these annotations to train deep-learning models. To automate the feedback loop between data scientists and image analysts RIL-Contour provides mechanisms to enable data scientists to push deep newly trained deep-learning models to other users of the software. RIL-Contour and the AID methodology accelerate dataset annotation and model development by facilitating rapid collaboration between analysts radiologists and engineers.
