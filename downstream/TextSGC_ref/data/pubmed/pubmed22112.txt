Development of neural prostheses over the past few decades has produced a number of clinically relevant brain-machine interfaces BMIs such as the cochlear prostheses and deep brain stimulators. Current research pursues the restoration of communication or motor function to individuals with neurological disorders. Efforts in the field such as the BrainGate trials have already demonstrated that such interfaces can enable humans to effectively control external devices with neural signals. However a number of significant issues regarding BMI performance device capabilities and surgery must be resolved before clinical use of BMI technology can become widespread. This chapter reviews challenges to clinical translation and discusses potential solutions that have been reported in recent literature with focuses on hardware reliability state-of-the-art decoding algorithms and surgical considerations during implantation. Current challenges to the clinical translation of brain machine interface technology.
