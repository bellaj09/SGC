Cloud based Interactive Visualization of Tractography Brain Connectome CIVILITY is an interactive visualization tool of brain connectome in the cloud. This application submits tasks to remote computing grids were the CIVILITY-tractography pipeline is deployed. The application will list the running tasks for the user and once a task is completed the brain connectome is visualized using Hierarchical Edge Bundling. The analysis pipeline uses FSL tools bedpostx and probtrackx2 to generate a triangular matrix indicating the connectivity strength between different regions in the brain. This work is motivated by medical applications in which expensive computational tasks such as brain connectivity is needed and to provide a state of the art visualization tool of Brain Connectome. This work does not contribute any novelty with respect to the visualization methodology is rather a new resource for the neuroimaging community. This work is submitted to the SPIE Biomedical Applications in Molecular Structural and Functional Imaging conference. The source code of this application is available in NITRC.
