"One broad goal of biomedical informatics is to generate fully-synthetic faithfully representative electronic health records EHRs to facilitate data sharing between healthcare providers and researchers and promote methodological research. A variety of methods existing for generating synthetic EHRs but they are not capable of generating unstructured text like emergency department ED chief complaints history of present illness or progress notes. Here we use the encoder-decoder model a deep learning algorithm that features in many contemporary machine translation systems to generate synthetic chief complaints from discrete variables in EHRs like age group gender and discharge diagnosis. After being trained end-to-end on authentic records the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that appears to preserve the epidemiological information encoded in the original record-sentence pairs. As a side effect of the models optimization goal these synthetic chief complaints are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings and they include none of the personally identifiable information PII that was in the training data suggesting that this model may be used to support the de-identification of text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial networks GANs our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs allowing healthcare providers to share faithful representations of multimodal medical data without compromising patient privacy. This is an important advance that we hope will facilitate the development of machine-learning methods for clinical decision support disease surveillance and other data-hungry applications in biomedical informatics."
