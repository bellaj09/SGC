"Brain parcellation divides the brains spatial domain into small regions which are represented by nodes within the network analysis framework. While template-based parcellations are widely used the parcels on the template do not necessarily match individuals functional nodes. A new method is developed to overcome the inconsistent network analysis results by by-passing the difficulties of parcellating the brain into functionally meaningful areas. First roughly equal-sized parcellations are obtained. Second these random parcellations are applied to individual subjects multiple times and a pseudo-bootstrap PBS of the network is obtained for statistical inferences. It was found that the variation of mean global network metrics from PBS sampling is smaller compared with inter-subject variation or within-subject variation between two diffusion MRI scans. Using the mean global network metrics from PBS sampling the intra-class correlation is always higher than the average obtained from using a single random parcellation. As one application the PBS method was tested on the Human Connectome Project resting state dataset to identify individuals across scan sessions based on the mean functional connectivity FC-a trivial network property that has little information about the connectivity between nodes. An accuracy rate of 90% was achieved by simply finding the maximum correlation of mean FC of PBS samples between two scan sessions."
