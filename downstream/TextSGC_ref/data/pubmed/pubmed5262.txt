Segmentation based tracing algorithms detect the extent and borders of an object in a given frame IZ by propagating results from frames I1  z < Z. Although application specific tracers have been forthcoming techniques that automatically adapt across applications have been less explored. We approach this problem by learning a prior model on topological dynamics that encourages segmentation transitions across frames that are most likely for a given application. Further we augment a generic tracing technique with a locality sensitive prior derived from dense optic flow fields for deformation guidance. The proposed approach comprises two stages where the generic tracer initially yields multiple segmentation transitions when its parameters are perturbed and the learnt topology prior subsequently propagates high scoring segmentations. Because the learnt topology model wraps around a generic tracer and adapts it by setting its free parameters the need for careful parameter tuning is completely obviated. Through extensive experimental validation in surveillance biological and medical image datasets we verify the applicability of the proposed model while demonstrating good tracing performance under severe clutter.
