Attenuation correction using CT transmission scanning increases the accuracy of single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT and enables quantitative analysis. Current existing SPECT-only systems normally do not support transmission scanning and therefore scans on these systems\xa0are susceptible to attenuation artifacts. Moreover the use of CT scans also increases radiation dose to patients and significant artifacts can occur due to the misregistration between the SPECT and CT scans as a result of patient motion. The purpose of this study is to develop an approach to estimate attenuation maps directly from SPECT emission data using deep learning methods.
