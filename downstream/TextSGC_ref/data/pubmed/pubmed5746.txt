Brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity. While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored. We studied stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in two macaques. A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocorticographic recording across primary somatosensory S1 and motor M1 cortex Yazdan-Shahmorad et al. 2016. We tracked two measures of network connectivity the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes; these were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.
