Ultrasound is one of the most important imaging techniques in clinical medicine with unique advantages. Skills in ultrasound imaging are very usefull for physicians including novices and thus also mandated by the Task Force "National Competence-Based Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education" NKLM in Germany and as well as by the German Ultrasound Society Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Ultraschall in der Medizin DEGUM. Since ultrasound is best learned hands-on in very small supervised groups we developed and implemented a comprehensive ultrasound-curriculum for all undergraduate medical students of our faculty using a peer-teaching concept. Development and implementation of a comprehensive ultrasound curriculum for undergraduate medical students - a feasibility study.
