"One method of evaluating students learning is to measure surface deep and achieving approaches to learning using a questionnaire. In comparison with research on student nurses learning styles there has been little examination of their approaches to learning. Much of the approaches to learning research has been conducted with higher education students in Australia and Hong Kong and this kind of measurement is viewed as a valid and reliable way to assess learning."
