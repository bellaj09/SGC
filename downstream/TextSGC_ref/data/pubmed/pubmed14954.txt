This study compared the direction of social learning in 2 populations of Barbados Zenaida doves Zenaida aurita. One population St. James is territorial; it competes aggressively with conspecifics but scramble competes with heterospecifics. The other population Deep Water Harbour forages in large homospecific flocks. Field observations were conducted to quantify intraspecific and interspecific patterns of foraging association and aggression. Wild-caught doves from both areas were then tested on novel foraging tasks demonstrated by either a conspecific or a heterospecific tutor. In all experiments St. James doves learned more readily from the heterospecific tutor Carib grackle -Quiscalus lugubris- whereas Deep Water Harbour doves learned more readily from the conspecific tutor. The type of competitive feeding interaction in the field i.e. scramble vs. interference appears to better predict the pattern of social learning in an experiment than does species identity. Mode of foraging competition is related to tutor preference in Zenaida aurita.
