Structured illumination microscopy SIM surpasses the optical diffraction limit and offers a two-fold enhancement in resolution over diffraction limited microscopy. However it requires both intense illumination and multiple acquisitions to produce a single high-resolution image. Using deep learning to augment SIM we obtain a five-fold reduction in the number of raw images required for super-resolution SIM and generate images under extreme low light conditions at least 100 fewer photons. We validate the performance of deep neural networks on different cellular structures and achieve multi-color live-cell super-resolution imaging with greatly reduced photobleaching. Deep learning enables structured illumination microscopy with low light levels and enhanced speed.
