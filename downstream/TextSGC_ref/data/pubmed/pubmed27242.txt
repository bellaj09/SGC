Event-related desynchronization/synchronization ERD/ERS is a relative power decrease/increase of electroencephalogram EEG in a specific frequency band during physical motor execution and mental motor imagery thus it is widely used for the brain-computer interface BCI purpose. However what the ERD really reflects and its frequency band specific role have not been agreed and are under investigation. Understanding the underlying mechanism which causes a significant ERD would be crucial to improve the reliability of the ERD-based BCI. We systematically investigated the relationship between conditions of actual repetitive hand movements and resulting ERD. Modulation of event-related desynchronization during kinematic and kinetic hand movements.
