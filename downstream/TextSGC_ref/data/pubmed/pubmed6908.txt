Weakly supervised object detection WSOD is an interesting yet challenging task in the computer vision community. The core is to discover the image regions that contain the complete object instances under the image-level supervision. Existing works usually solve this problem via a proposal selection strategy which selects the most discriminative box regions from the weakly labeled training images. However these regions usually only contain the discriminative object parts rather than the complete object instances. To address this problem this article proposes to learn a searching-agent to gradually mine desirable object regions under a region searching paradigm where we formulate the searching process as a Markov decision process and learn the searching-agent under a deep reinforcement learning framework. To learn such a searching-agent under the weak supervision we extract the pseudo-complete object regions and the corresponding local discriminative object parts and introduce the obtained pseudo-target-part training pairs into the reinforcement learning process of the search-agent. This learning strategy has twofold advantages: 1 it can mimic the searching process to reveal complete object regions from a certain discriminative part of the object under the weak supervision and 2 it will not suffer from the learning difficulty arise from the long-action sequence that happens when searching from the entire image range. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate that by integrating the learned searching-agent with the existing WSOD method we can achieve better performance than the other state-of-the-art and baseline methods.
