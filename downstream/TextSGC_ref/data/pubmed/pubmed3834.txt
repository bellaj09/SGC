Previous imaging studies in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy TLE have examined the spatial distribution of changes in imaging parameters such as diffusion tensor imaging DTI metrics and cortical thickness. Multi-compartment models offer greater specificity with parameters more directly related to known changes in TLE such as altered neuronal density and myelination. We studied the spatial distribution of conventional and novel metrics including neurite density derived from NODDI Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and myelin water fraction MWF derived from mcDESPOT Multi-Compartment Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1/T2 to infer the underlying neurobiology of changes in conventional metrics. Microstructural imaging in temporal lobe epilepsy: Diffusion imaging changes relate to reduced neurite density.
