The aim of the present study was to demonstrate for the first time that brain waves can be used by a tetraplegic to control movements of his wheelchair in virtual reality VR. In this case study the spinal cord injured SCI subject was able to generate bursts of beta oscillations in the electroencephalogram EEG by imagination of movements of his paralyzed feet. These beta oscillations were used for a self-paced asynchronous brain-computer interface BCI control based on a single bipolar EEG recording. The subject was placed inside a virtual street populated with avatars. The task was to "go" from avatar to avatar towards the end of the street but to stop at each avatar and talk to them. In average the participant was able to successfully perform this asynchronous experiment with a performance of 90% single runs up to 100%.
