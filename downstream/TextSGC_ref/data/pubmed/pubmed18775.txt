Age-associated motor and cognitive deficits increase the risk of falls a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Because of the significant ramifications of falls many interventions have been proposed but few have aimed to prevent falls via an integrated approach targeting both motor and cognitive function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an intervention combining treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality VR to target both cognitive aspects of safe ambulation and mobility would lead to fewer falls than would treadmill training alone. Addition of a non-immersive virtual reality component to treadmill training to reduce fall risk in older adults V-TIME: a randomised controlled trial.
