Crime scene reconstruction plays a significant role in crime solving by helping to determine the course of events. Non-invasive high-resolution measurement and increased insight are always the goal of forensic crime scene documentation. However entire crime scenes cannot be effectively reconstructed with traditional methods. In this study we present a portable system that consists of a laser scanner two hand-held structured light scanners and a low-cost virtual reality VR headset with a mobile power supply to conduct multi-angle and omnidirectional three-dimensional spatial data collection of crime scenes. To demonstrate practical use a real case has been analysed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. The system accurately obtains information on decedent injuries possible injury-inflicting tools and on-site traces. Various types of evidence from the crime scene can be jointly studied by three-dimensional visualization to develop a cohesive story. The data are presented via immersive VR rather than displayed on computer screens. The relationship between evidence chains enables us to achieve a complete crime scene reconstruction using the specialized knowledge of experts and computer-aided forensic tools to analyse the causes of damage and identify suspects. The use of three- dimensional imaging techniques allows a more insightful survey and several useful analyses such as accurate measurement relative blood source location determination and injury-inflicting tool comparison. Virtual reality and integrated crime scene scanning for immersive and heterogeneous crime scene reconstruction.
