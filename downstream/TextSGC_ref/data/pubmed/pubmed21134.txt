Endometrial pathology is frequent in premenopausal women and the diagnostic hysteroscopy is considered the gold standard\xa0for assessing endometrial cavity and congenital uterine anomalies. However it is an invasive and uncomfortable procedure.\xa0Saline contrast hysterosalgingography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography allow detailed assessment of the uterine cavity.\xa0We propose a virtual hysteroscopy from three-dimensional saline and three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography\xa0scan data to generate a virtual reality as a new noninvasive procedure for assessing the uterine cavity in uterine congenital\xa0anomaly and endometrial pathology cases as well. Virtual hysteroscopy: a new non invasive approach for the assessment of uterine cavity.
