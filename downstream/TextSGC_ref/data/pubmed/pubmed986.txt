The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19; formally known as 2019-nCoV has become a most challenging health emergency. Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have\xa0become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance some rapid\xa0and progressive newborn diseases such as bilirubin encephalopathy may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to\xa0prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of\xa0bilirubin level of newborns\xa0that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic. Management strategies of neonatal jaundice during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.
