"In contrast to cranial interventions neuronavigation in spinal surgery is used in few applications not tapping into its full technological potential. We have developed a method to preoperatively create virtual resection planes and volumes for spinal osteotomies and export 3-D operation plans to a navigation system controlling intraoperative visualization using a surgical microscopes head-up display. The method was developed using a Sawbone  model of the lumbar spine demonstrating feasibility with high precision. Computer tomographic and magnetic resonance image data were imported into Amira   a 3-D visualization software. Resection planes were positioned and resection volumes representing intraoperative bone removal were defined. Fused to the original Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data the osteotomy planes were exported to the cranial version of a Brainlab  navigation system. A navigated surgical microscope with video connection to the navigation system allowed intraoperative image injection to visualize the preplanned resection planes."
