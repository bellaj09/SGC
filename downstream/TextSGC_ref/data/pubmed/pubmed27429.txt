The recently growing progress in neuroscience research and relevant achievements as well as advancements in the fabrication process have increased the demand for neural interfacing systems. Brain-machine interfaces BMIs have been revealed to be a promising method for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders and the restoration of sensory and motor function. Neural recording implants as a part of BMI are capable of capturing brain signals and amplifying digitizing and transferring them outside of the body with a transmitter. The main challenges of designing such implants are minimizing power consumption and the silicon area. In this paper multi-channel neural recording implants are surveyed. After presenting various neural-signal features we investigate main available neural recording circuit and system architectures. The fundamental blocks of available architectures such as neural amplifiers analog to digital converters ADCs and compression blocks are explored. We cover the various topologies of neural amplifiers provide a comparison and probe their design challenges. To achieve a relatively high SNR at the output of the neural amplifier noise reduction techniques are discussed. Also to transfer neural signals outside of the body they are digitized using data converters then in most cases the data compression is applied to mitigate power consumption. We present the various dedicated ADC structures as well as an overview of main data compression methods. Multi-Channel Neural Recording Implants: A Review.
