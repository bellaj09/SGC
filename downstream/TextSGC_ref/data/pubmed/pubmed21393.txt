Low back pain LBP is a common clinical problem. Many researchers have demonstrated that LBP disorders have difference in sensory strategies for postural control. Optokinetic stimulation OKS of optic flow has been widely applied to study its effect on vision but has not been applied to LBP. Here we used OKS on different surfaces to investigate the characteristics of chronic nonspecific LBP CNLBP posture control so as to provide new theoretical and experimental data for further recognizing CNLBP and enriching its treatment. Comparison of postural control between healthy subjects and individuals with nonspecific low back pain during exposure to visual stimulus.
