Obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD is increasingly conceptualized as a brain connectivity disorder. Recently abnormalities in remote resting-state functional connectivity FC have been well demonstrated in the frontoparietal areas that linked impairments in large-scale intrinsic brain networks with aberrant fronto-striatal interactions. Beyond the remote FC abnormalities in OCD many studies using regional homogeneity ReHo analysis have reported local FC alterations. However their results were not entirely consistent.
