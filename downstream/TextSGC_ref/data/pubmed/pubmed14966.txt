The present study is the first that examined neuronal underpinnings of spatial presence using multi-channel EEG in an interactive virtual reality VR. We compared two VR-systems: a highly immersive Single-Wall-VR-system three-dimensional view large screen and a less immersive Desktop-VR-system two-dimensional view small screen. Twenty-nine participants performed a spatial navigation task in a virtual maze and had to state their sensation of "being there" on a 5-point rating scale. Task-related power decrease/increase TRPD/TRPI in the Alpha band 8-12Hz and coherence analyses in different frequency bands were used to analyze the EEG data. The Single-Wall-VR-system caused a more intense presence experience than the Desktop-VR-system. This increased feeling of presence in the Single-Wall-VR-condition was accompanied by an increased parietal TRPD in the Alpha band which is associated with cortical activation. The lower presence experience in the Desktop-VR-group was accompanied by a stronger functional connectivity between frontal and parietal brain regions indicating that the communication between these two brain areas is crucial for the presence experience. Hence we found a positive relationship between presence and parietal brain activation and a negative relationship between presence and frontal brain activation in an interactive VR-paradigm supporting the results of passive non-interactive VR-studies.
