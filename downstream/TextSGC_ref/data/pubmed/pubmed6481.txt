Increasingly studies have identified abnormalities in the functional connectivity FC of large-scale neural networks in early psychosis but the findings thus far have been inconclusive. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify robust alterations in FC of the default mode DMN salience SN and central executive networks CEN in patients with first-episode psychosis FEP using a meta-analytic approach. Dysconnectivity of Large-Scale Functional Networks in Early Psychosis: A Meta-analysis.
