Previous research has supported the use of virtual reality VR to decrease stress anxiety perceptions of pain and increase positive affect. However the effect of VR on blood pressure BP and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment VE on BP and heart rate variability HRV during rest and following physical isometric handgrip or mental serial sevens subtraction stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens VE maintained the increased low frequency LF power of HRV $ 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units n.u. compared to seated rest $ 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u. $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency HF power of HRV $ 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u. compared to seated rest $ 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u. $\\mathrm {p}=0.014$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $ 2.4 \\pm 0.5$ compared to seated rest $ 1.6 \\pm 0.3$ $\\mathrm {p}=0.012$. Hence after mental stress VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.
