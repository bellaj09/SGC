Hybrid brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been proved to be more effective in mental control. In this study a hybrid BCI speller system combining steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs and eye tracking has been proposed. In this system the eye tracker was used to detect eye gaze position for a 33 block selection after that classification of the command was achieved through filter bank canonical correlation analysis FBCCA method. Results showed that the 40-classes hybrid speller system outperformed the SSVEP-only method achieved a mean accuracy of 92.1% and a mean information transfer rate ITR of 180.8 bits/min during online experiments and the scalability of the proposed system also has been tested with larger number of commands. Development of a High-speed Mental Spelling System Combining Eye Tracking and SSVEP-based BCI with High Scalability.
