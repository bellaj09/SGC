In the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography 18F-FDG PET/CT is used for its ability to detect functional changes at early stages of disease process. However anatomical information from another modality CT or MRI is still needed to properly interpret and localize the radiotracer uptake due to its low spatial resolution. Lack of structural information limits segmentation and accurate quantification of the 18F-FDG PET/CT. The correct segmentation of the brain compartment in 18F-FDG PET/CT will enable the quantitative analysis of the 18F-FDG PET/CT scan alone. In this paper we propose a method to segment white matter in 18F-FDG PET/CT images using generative adversarial network GAN. The segmentation result of GAN model was evaluated using evaluation parameters such as dice AUC-PR precision and recall. It was also compared with other deep learning methods. As a result the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and reliability compared with other deep learning methods.
