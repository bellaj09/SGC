Artificial intelligence has attracted attention in the various field as an advanced information technology. Regarding to the radiology many artificial intelligence technologies have been introduced to the computer aided diagnosis technologies such as lesion detection and analysis. Particularly deep learning shows significant performance compared to the conventional technologies. In this paper basic terms related to artificial intelligence technology are first defined and briefly introduce the research activities of domestic and overseas research. And then decision support system for lung cancer diagnosis developed by us are introduced. Application of Artificial Intelligence in Radiology.
