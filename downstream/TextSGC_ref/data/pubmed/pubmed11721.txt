Machine learning is enabling researchers to analyze and understand increasingly complex physical and biological phenomena in traditional fields such as biology medicine and engineering and emerging fields like synthetic biology automated chemical synthesis and biomanufacturing. These fields require new paradigms toward understanding increasingly complex data and converting such data into medical products and services for patients. The move toward deep learning and complex modeling is an attempt to bridge the gap between acquiring massive quantities of complex data and converting such data into practical insights. Here we provide an overview of the field of machine learning its current applications and needs in traditional and emerging fields and discuss an illustrative attempt at using deep learning to understand swarm behavior of molecular shuttles.
