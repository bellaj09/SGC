Diffusion tensor imaging DTI is a new imaging method that can be used to non-invasively measure the diffusion coefficient of water molecules in biological tissue structures in recent years. Since the DTI data is a tensor space its segmentation is different from ordinary MRI images. Based on the existing deep learning model an improved image semantic segmentation method based on super-pixels and conditional random field is proposed. Firstly this paper uses the existing feature extraction model based on deep learning to obtain rough semantic segmentation results including high-level semantic information of the image but lacking details of the image. In addition the super-pixel segmentation algorithm is implemented to obtain super-pixels that carries more low-level information. Secondly due to the lack of image details in rough segmentation results the segmentation of the edge of the image is inaccurate. In this paper a boundary optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the edge segmentation accuracy of the rough results. Finally the use of super-pixels for local boundary optimization can improve the segmentation accuracy. Experiments results show that this segment is a practical and effective method.
