Fungi have diverse biotechnological applications in among others agriculture bioenergy generation or remediation of polluted soil and water. In this context culture media based on color change in response to degradation of dyes are particularly relevant; but measuring dye decolorisation of fungal strains mainly relies on a visual and semiquantitative classification of color intensity changes. Such a classification is a subjective time-consuming and difficult to reproduce process. DecoFungi: a web application for automatic characterisation of dye decolorisation in fungal strains.
