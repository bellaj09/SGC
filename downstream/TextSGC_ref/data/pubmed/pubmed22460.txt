Surgery at the turn of the century and at the millennium is characterised by an extremely rapid development. There are no boundaries anymore among the different branches of medicine in different anatomical regions of the human body between the living human and the artificial tissues between the reality and the virtual reality. Nanotechnology and robotics offer new possibilities for minimally invasive procedures. By the introduction of telepresence surgery there are no more surgical limits among countries and continents between Earth and Space as well. A new chapter in history of medicine is the Cyber Surgery. The future has already arrived. Even in this new world we have to follow the ethical requirements summarised in the Hyppocrates Oath. Surgery without boundaries.
