"The microbiome the community of microorganisms living within an individual is a promising avenue for developing non-invasive methods for disease screening and diagnosis. Here we utilize 5643 aggregated annotated whole-community metagenomes to implement the first multiclass microbiome disease classifier of this scale able to discriminate between 18 different diseases and healthy. We compared three different machine learning models: random forests deep neural nets and a novel graph convolutional architecture which exploits the graph structure of phylogenetic trees as its input. We show that the graph convolutional model outperforms deep neural nets in terms of accuracy achieving 75% average test-set accuracy receiver-operator-characteristics 92.1% average area-under-ROC AUC and precision-recall 50% average area-under-precision-recall AUPR. Additionally the convolutional nets performance complements that of the random forest showing a lower propensity for Type-I errors false-positives while the random forest makes less Type-II errors false-negatives. Lastly we are able to achieve over 90% average top-3 accuracy across all of our models. Together these results indicate that there are predictive disease-specific signatures across microbiomes that can be used for diagnostic purposes."
