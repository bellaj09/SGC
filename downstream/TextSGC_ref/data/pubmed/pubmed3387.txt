Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD symptoms are most commonly treated with stimulant medication such as methylphenidate MPH; however approximately 25% of patients show little or no symptomatic response. We examined the extent to which initial changes in brain functional connectivity FC associated with the first MPH dose in boys newly diagnosed with ADHD predict MPH-associated changes in ADHD inattentiveness and hyperactivity symptoms at 3 months. First-Dose Methylphenidate-Induced Changes in Brain Functional Connectivity Are Correlated With 3-Month Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptom Response.
