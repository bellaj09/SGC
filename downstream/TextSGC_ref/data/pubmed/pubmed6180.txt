Understanding individual differences in cognitive performance is an important part of understanding how variations in underlying cognitive processes can result in variations in task performance. However the exploration of individual differences in the components of the decision process-such as cognitive processing speed response caution and motor execution speed-in previous research has been limited. Here we assess the heritability of the components of the decision process with heritability having been a common aspect of individual differences research within other areas of cognition. Importantly a limitation of previous work on cognitive heritability is the underlying assumption that variability in response times solely reflects variability in the speed of cognitive processing. This assumption has been problematic in other domains due to the confounding effects of caution and motor execution speed on observed response times. We extend a cognitive model of decision-making to account for relatedness structure in a twin study paradigm. This approach can separately quantify different contributions to the heritability of response time. Using data from the Human Connectome Project we find strong evidence for the heritability of response caution and more ambiguous evidence for the heritability of cognitive processing speed and motor execution speed. Our study suggests that the assumption made in previous studies-that the heritability of cognitive ability is based on cognitive processing speed-may be incorrect. More generally our methodology provides a useful avenue for future research in complex data that aims to analyze cognitive traits across different sources of related data whether the relation is between people tasks experimental phases or methods of measurement.
