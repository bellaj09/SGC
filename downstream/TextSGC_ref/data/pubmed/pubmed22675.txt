A set of electroencephalogram EEG data from 29 subjects obtained from a study in which the subjects performed a set of tests based on visual stimuli and motor images of the hands is presented. Three types of data are provided in this article: 1 Signals based on visual events VEP 2 signals based on steady state visual events SSVEP and 3 signals based upon Motor Imagery MI. Several research projects have used this data to test the detection of visual stimuli classification and selection of characteristics of brain signals EEG preprocessing and for optimization processes based on heuristic algorithms and algorithms based upon collective animal intelligence. The data was acquired using an Emotiv Epoc\xa0+\xa0portable EEG with 14 data channels and two reference channels. EEG data collection using visual evoked steady state visual evoked and motor image task designed to brain computer interfaces BCI development.
