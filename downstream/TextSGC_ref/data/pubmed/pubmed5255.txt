The basis of cross-suppression between rod and cone channels has long been an enigma. Using rabbit retinal connectome RC1 we show that all cone bipolar cell BC classes inhibit rod BCs via amacrine cell AC motifs C1-6; that all cone BC classes are themselves inhibited by AC motifs R1-5 R25 driven by rod BCs. A sparse symmetric AC motif CR is presynaptic and postsynaptic to both rod and cone BCs. ON cone BCs of all classes drive inhibition of rod BCs via motif C1 wide-field GABAergic ACs ACs and motif C2 narrow field glycinergic ON ACs GACs. Each rod BC receives 10 crossover AC synapses and each ON cone BC can target 10 or more rod BCs via separate AC processes. OFF cone BCs mediate monosynaptic inhibition of rod BCs via motif C3 driven by OFF ACs and GACs and disynaptic inhibition via motifs C4 and C5 driven by OFF wide-field ACs and narrow-field GACs respectively. Motifs C4 and C5 form halos of 60-100 inhibitory synapses on proximal dendrites of AI ACs. Rod BCs inhibit surrounding arrays of cone BCs through AII GAC networks that access ON and OFF cone BC patches via motifs R1 R2 R4 R5 and a unique ON AC motif R3 that collects rod BC inputs and targets ON cone BCs. Crossover synapses for motifs C1 C4 C5 and R3 are 3-4 larger than typical feedback synapses which may be a signature for synaptic winner-take-all switches. J. Comp. Neurol. 527:87-116 2019.
