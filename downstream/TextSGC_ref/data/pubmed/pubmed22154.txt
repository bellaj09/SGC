Computer-assisted surgery CAS will become more common in orthopedics as the technology becomes more accessible. Over the next several years demonstrated improvements in precision will result in improved clinical outcomes. The cost and time of CAS procedures will substantially decrease. The improved quantitative information will allow a more specific patient-tailored surgical procedure. Additional surgical procedures such as double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and femoroacetabular impingement surgery will become available. The registration technology will become less invasive. CAS and virtual reality simulators will enhance education for trainees and in the dissemination of new procedures. The future of computer-assisted surgery CAS in sports medicine.
