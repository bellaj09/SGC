Substantial advances in virtual reality technology open an exciting window toward better understanding of subdomains of balance control. Here we studied whether a portable virtual reality headset can be used to test sensory integration for balance. Twenty young adults stood on a both-sides-up ball or floor. Moving spheres were projected from an Oculus Development Kit 2 at various amplitudes and frequencies. Participants\ gains indicated visual "weighting" when standing on both-sides-up but not on the floor and "reweighting" with increased visual amplitude. Intraclass correlations showed acceptable to good reliability for all floor conditions and for some of the both-sides-up conditions when we repeated the protocol a week later. Future steps to further develop our paradigm into a clinical assessment of sensory integration for postural control are discussed. Assessment via the Oculus of Visual "Weighting" and "Reweighting" in Young Adults.
