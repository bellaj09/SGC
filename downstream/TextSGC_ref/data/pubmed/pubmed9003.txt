Vascular structures of skin are important biomarkers in diagnosis and assessment of cutaneous conditions. Presence and distribution of lesional vessels are associated with specific abnormalities. Therefore detection and localization of cutaneous vessels provide critical information towards diagnosis and stage status of diseases. However cutaneous vessels are highly variable in shape size color and architecture which complicate the detection task. Considering the large variability of these structures conventional vessel detection techniques lack the generalizability to detect different vessel types and require separate algorithms to be designed for each type. Furthermore such techniques are highly dependent on precise hand-crafted features which are time-consuming and computationally inefficient. As a solution we propose a data-driven feature learning framework based on stacked sparse auto-encoders SSAE for comprehensive detection of cutaneous vessels. Each training image is divided into small patches of either containing or non-containing vasculature. A multilayer SSAE is designed to learn hidden features of the data in hierarchical layers in an unsupervised manner. The high-level learned features are subsequently fed into a classifier which categorizes each patch into absence or presence of vasculature and localizes vessels within the lesion. Over a test set of 3095 patches derived from 200 images the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance of 95.4% detection accuracy over a variety of vessel patterns; outperforming other techniques by achieving the highest positive predictive value of 94.7%. The proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis CAD framework can serve as a decision support system assisting dermatologists for more accurate diagnosis especially in teledermatology applications in remote areas.
