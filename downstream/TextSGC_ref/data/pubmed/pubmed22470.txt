"Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI based on event related potentials ERP have been successfully developed for applications like virtual spellers and navigation systems. This study tests the use of visual stimuli unbalanced in the subjects field of view to simultaneously cue mental imagery tasks left vs. right hand movement and detect subject attention. The responses to unbalanced cues were compared with the responses to balanced cues in terms of classification accuracy. Subject specific ERP spatial filters were calculated for optimal group separation. The unbalanced cues appear to enhance early ERPs related to cue visuospatial processing that improved the classification accuracy as low as 6% of ERPs in response to left vs. right cues soon 150-200 ms after the cue presentation. This work suggests that such visual interface may be of interest in BCI applications as a gate mechanism for attention estimation and validation of control decisions."
