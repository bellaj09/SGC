Force feedback increases the effectiveness of virtual-reality surgery training systems. An overview of the fundamentals of applying force feedback is presented. An impedance control technique and data processing methods for stability preservation are illustrated. A flexible interface for general force-feedback applications has been developed. This interface is capable of controlling several different force-feedback hardware systems including the SensAble PHANTOM the Laparoscopic Impulse Engines from Immersion and the VS-One virtual endoscopic surgery trainer. The findings are evaluated using the main simulation system KISMET and the modeling tools KISMO and VESUV. Within the scope of a cooperative project called HapticIO funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research BMBF new haptic devices have been designed for virtual neuroendoscopy and laparoscopy. The concept and implementations presented in this paper have been found to be flexible stable and suitable for universal use. The impedance method combined with the open-loop feed-forward control technique is well suited and appropriate for the task. Fundamentals of force feedback and application to a surgery simulator.
