The crucial problem of infrared and visual image fusion is how to effectively extract the image features including the image regions and details and combine these features into the final fusion result to produce a clear fused image. To obtain an effective fusion result with clear image details an algorithm for infrared and visual image fusion through the fuzzy measure and alternating operators is proposed in this paper. Firstly the alternating operators constructed using the opening and closing based toggle operator are analyzed. Secondly two types of the constructed alternating operators are used to extract the multi-scale features of the original infrared and visual images for fusion. Thirdly the extracted multi-scale features are combined through the fuzzy measure-based weight strategy to form the final fusion features. Finally the final fusion features are incorporated with the original infrared and visual images using the contrast enlargement strategy. All the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective for infrared and visual image fusion. Infrared and Visual Image Fusion through Fuzzy Measure and Alternating Operators.
