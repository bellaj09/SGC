Over the past few years Spiking Neural Networks SNNs have become popular as a possible pathway to enable low-power event-driven neuromorphic hardware. However their application in machine learning have largely been limited to very shallow neural network architectures for simple problems. In this paper we propose a novel algorithmic technique for generating an SNN with a deep architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex visual recognition problems such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our technique applies to both VGG and Residual network architectures with significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Finally we present analysis of the sparse event-driven computations to demonstrate reduced hardware overhead when operating in the spiking domain.
