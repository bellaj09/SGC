The precise relationship between functional and structural connectivity in the brain is not well understood. Research in this area has so far mostly remained descriptive. In this issue of Neuron Mii et al. 2015 forge a promising new direction by modeling the propagation of information as it relates to spatially constrained network properties. From these preliminary results a glimmer of hope in uncovering deep principles of brain organization begins to emerge. What Cascade Spreading Models Can Teach Us about the Brain.
