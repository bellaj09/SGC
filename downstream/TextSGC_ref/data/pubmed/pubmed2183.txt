An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan China in December 2019. An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19 no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp. A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir 200\xa0mg on day 1 followed by 100\xa0mg once daily is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/RTV alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in\xa0vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine 200\xa0mg thrice daily plus azithromycin 500\xa0mg on day 1 followed by 250\xa0mg once daily on day 2-5 which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in\xa0vitro. The roles of teicoplanin which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.
