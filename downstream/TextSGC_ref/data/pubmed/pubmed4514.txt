The notion that specific cognitive and emotional processes arise from functionally distinct brain regions has lately shifted toward a connectivity-based approach that emphasizes the role of network-mediated integration across regions. The clinical neurosciences have likewise shifted from a predominantly lesion-based approach to a connectomic paradigm-framing disorders as diverse as stroke schizophrenia SCZ and dementia as "dysconnection syndromes". Here we position bipolar disorder BD within this paradigm. We first summarise the disruptions in structural functional and effective connectivity that have been documented in BD. Not surprisingly these disturbances show a preferential impact on circuits that support emotional processes cognitive control and executive functions. Those at high risk HR for BD also show patterns of connectivity that differ from both matched control populations and those with BD and which may thus speak to neurobiological markers of both risk and resilience. We highlight research fields that aim to link brain network disturbances to the phenotype of BD including the study of large-scale brain dynamics the principles of network stability and control and the study of interoception the perception of physiological states. Together these findings suggest that the affective dysregulation of BD arises from dynamic instabilities in interoceptive circuits which subsequently impact on fear circuitry and cognitive control systems. We describe the resulting disturbance as a "psychosis of interoception". Connectomics of bipolar disorder: a critical review and evidence for dynamic instabilities within interoceptive networks.
