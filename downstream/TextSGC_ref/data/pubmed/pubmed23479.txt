The purpose of this study was to apply virtual reality technology to spiral computed tomographic CT angiogram images in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis and to correlate the images with histopathologic evaluation of the aorta. Image data were transferred to the virtual endoscope system in a graphics workstation. "Virtualized angioscopy" includes an interactive graphic user interface which controls the viewpoint the direction of the observation and rendering and navigation functions. The virtual angioscopy system demonstrated irregularities of the luminal surface of the ascending aorta and a smooth luminal surface in the descending aorta. These observations were correlated with histopathologic findings. The results of this study indicate that the potential and real benefits of virtualized angioscopy far outweigh several technical limitations.
