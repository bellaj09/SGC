Self-interacting proteins SIPs play a significant role in the execution of most important molecular processes in cells such as signal transduction gene expression regulation immune response and enzyme activation. Although the traditional experimental methods can be used to generate SIPs data it is very expensive and time-consuming based only on biological technique. Therefore it is important and urgent to develop an efficient computational method for SIPs detection. In this study we present a novel SIPs identification method based on machine learning technology by combing the Zernike Moments ZMs descriptor on Position Specific Scoring Matrix PSSM with Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines PCVM and Stacked Sparse Auto-Encoder SSAE. More specifically an efficient feature extraction technique called ZMs is firstly utilized to generate feature vectors on Position Specific Scoring Matrix PSSM; Then Deep neural network is employed for reducing the feature dimensions and noise; Finally the Probabilistic Classification Vector Machine is used to execute the classification. The prediction performance of the proposed method is evaluated on S.erevisiae and Human SIPs datasets via cross-validation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve good accuracies of 92.55% and 97.47% respectively. To further evaluate the advantage of our scheme for SIPs prediction we also compared the PCVM classifier with the Support Vector Machine SVM and other existing techniques on the same data sets. Comparison results reveal that the proposed strategy is outperforms other methods and could be a used tool for identifying SIPs.
