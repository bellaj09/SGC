Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of stress-related adverse cardiovascular events. Because brain regions of the central autonomic network largely overlap with brain regions related to the neural response to emotion and stress the central autonomic network may mediate the autonomic response to negative emotional stimuli. We aimed to obtain evidence to determine whether neural connectivity of the central autonomic network is altered in individuals with cannabis use disorder CUD when they are exposed to negative emotional stimuli. Altered Effective Connectivity of Central Autonomic Network in Response to Negative Facial Expression in Adults With Cannabis Use Disorder.
