Image clustering is more challenging than image classification. Without supervised information current deep learning methods are difficult to be directly applied to image clustering problems. Image clustering needs to deal with three main problems: 1 the curse of dimensionality caused by highdimensional image data; 2 extracting the effective image features; 3 combining feature extraction dimensionality reduction and clustering. In this paper we propose a new clustering framework called Deep Embedded Dimensionality Reduction Clustering DERC via Probability-Based Triplet Loss which effectively solves the above issues. To the best of our knowledge the DERC is the first framework that effectively combines image embedding dimensionality reduction and clustering into the image clustering process. We also propose to incorporate a novel probability-based triplet loss measure to retrain the DERC network as a unified framework. By integrating the reconstruction loss and the probability-based triplet loss we can improve the image clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods on many commonly used datasets.
