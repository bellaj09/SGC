Rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD diagnosis and psychostimulant prescriptions continue to rise yet there are no clear diagnostic tests or biomarkers for the disorder. The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of diffusion MRI in bolstering a neurobiologic conceptualization of ADHD and how this holds promise for optimizing future diagnosis. Revealing the Structural Neural Circuitry of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder With Diffusion MRI: Implications for Future Diagnosis and Treatment.
