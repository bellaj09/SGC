Brachial plexus injury BPI is a serious peripheral nerve injury and clinical outcomes are generally unsatisfactory. It has been reported that cortical plasticity could influence the restoration of motor function. However the neurologic mechanism of BPI is unclear which provides a basis for further investigation. The supplementary motor area SMA plays an important role in the regulation of motor function. This study aims to explore SMA-whole brain functional connectivity after deafferentation of the brachial plexus.
