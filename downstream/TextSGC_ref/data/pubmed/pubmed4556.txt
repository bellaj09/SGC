Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function both in healthy and pathological conditions is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Recent progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity SC and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity rsFC. Here we adopt a systems approach relying on modular hierarchical clustering to study together SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. Our novel approach allows us to find a common skeleton shared by structure and function from which a new optimal brain partition can be extracted. We describe the emerging common structure-function modules SFMs in detail and compare them with commonly employed anatomical or functional parcellations. Our results underline the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics as well as the emerging coherent organization of the human brain. A novel brain partition highlights the modular skeleton shared by structure and function.
