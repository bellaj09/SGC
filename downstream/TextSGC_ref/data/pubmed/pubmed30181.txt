A bionic artificial device commonly integrates various distributed functional units to mimic the functions of biological sensory neural system bringing intricate interconnections complicated structure and interference in signal transmission. Here we show an all-in-one bionic artificial nerve based on a separate electrical double-layers structure that integrates the functions of perception recognition and transmission. The bionic artificial nerve features flexibility rapid response <21\u2009ms high robustness excellent durability >10000 tests personalized cutability and no energy consumption when no mechanical stimulation is being\xa0applied. The response signals are highly regionally differentiated for the mechanical stimulations which enables the bionic artificial nerve to mimic the spatiotemporally dynamic logic of a biological neural network. Multifunctional touch interactions demonstrate the enormous potential of the bionic artificial nerve for human-machine hybrid perceptual enhancement. By incorporating the spatiotemporal resolution function and algorithmic analysis we hope\xa0that bionic artificial nerves will promote further development of sophisticated\xa0neuroprosthetics and intelligent robotics. A bioinspired analogous nerve towards artificial intelligence.
