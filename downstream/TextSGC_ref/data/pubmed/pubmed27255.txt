Many serious concerns exist in the long-term stability of brain-machine interfaces BMIs based on spike signals single unit activity SUA; multi unit activity MUA. Some studies showed local field potentials LFPs could offer a stable decoding performance. However the decoding stability of LFPs was examined only when high quality spike signals were recorded. Here we aim to examine the long-term decoding stability of LFPs over a larger time scale when the quality of spike signals was from good to poor or even no spike was recorded.
