"Neuronal activity associated with a conditioned forepaw placing reaction was recorded in the cats motor cortex locally disinhibited by bicuculline spontaneously diffused from the recording pipette. Electrical stimulation of the parieral cortex area 5 with 3-5 pulses was used as a conditioned stimulus. In both naive and trained cats adding of APV NMDA receptor blocker led to disappearance of the late 30-120 ms secondary excitatory responses from the pattern of the neuronal reaction to the parietal stimulation recorded in the motor cortex. At the same time the APV administration did not change the excitatory reactions recorded predominantly in the deep cortical layers time-locked to the execution of the conditioned movement. The conditioning resulted in a statistically significant increase in the amplitude and duration of the late secondary responses as well as in a shortening of their latency. In some cases after a long period of training the late secondary responses to the conditioned stimulus transformed into paroxysmal epileptiform bursts. A hypothesis is discussed that the increase in synaptic strength of the backward horizontal collaterals of layer-II/III pyramidal neurons is responsible for the learning-related changes in the neuronal reactions in the disinhibited motor cortex." NMDA-dependent and NMDA-independent neuronal processes in the cat motor cortex disinhibited by bicuculline during forepaw placement conditioning.
