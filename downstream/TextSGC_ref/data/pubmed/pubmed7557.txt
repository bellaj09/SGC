In a mass casualty incident the factors that determine the survival rate of injured patients are diverse but one of the key factors is the time for triage. Additionally the main factor that determines the time of triage is the number of medical personnel. However when relying on a small number of medical personnel the ability to increase survivability is limited. Therefore developing a classification model for survival prediction that can quickly and precisely triage via wearable devices without medical personnel is important. In this study we designed a consciousness index to substitute the factor by manpower and improved the classification accuracy by applying a machine learning algorithm. First logistic regression analysis using vital signs and a consciousness index capable of remote monitoring through wearable devices confirmed the high efficiency of the consciousness index. We then developed a classification model with high accuracy which corresponds to existing injury severity scoring systems through the machine learning algorithms. We extracted 460865 cases which met our criteria for developing the survival prediction from the national sample project in the national trauma databank which contains 408316 cases of blunt injury and 52549 cases of penetrating injury. Among the dataset 17918 3.9% cases died while the other survived. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals CIs for the different models with the proposed simplified consciousness score as follows: RTS as baseline 0.78 95% CI = 0.775 to 0.785; logistic regression 0.87 95% CI = 0.862 to 0.870; random forest 0.87 95% CI = 0.862 to 0.872; deep neural network 0.89 95% CI = 0.882 to 0.890. As a result we confirmed the possibility of remote triage using a wearable device. It is expected that the time required for triage can be effectively reduced by using the developed classification model of survival prediction.
