Recording neural activity from the living brain is of great interest in neuroscience for interpreting cognitive processing or neurological disorders. Despite recent advances in neural technologies development of a soft neural interface that integrates with neural tissues increases recording sensitivity and prevents signal dissipation still remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a biocompatible conductive and biostable neural interface a supramolecular -peptide-based hydrogel that allows signal amplification via tight neural/hydrogel contact without neuroinflammation. The non-biodegradable -peptide forms a multihierarchical structure with conductive nanomaterial creating a three-dimensional electrical network which can augment brain signal efficiently. By achieving seamless integration in brain tissue with increased contact area and tight neural tissue coupling the epidural and intracortical neural signals recorded with the hydrogel were augmented especially in the high frequency range. Overall our tissuelike chronic neural interface will facilitate a deeper understanding of brain oscillation in broad brain states and further lead to more efficient brain-computer interfaces.
