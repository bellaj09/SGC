This paper presents a robust information theoretic RIT model to reduce the uncertainties i.e. missing and noisy labels in general discriminative data representation tasks. The fundamental pursuit of our model is to simultaneously learn a transformation function and a discriminative classifier that maximize the mutual information of data and their labels in the latent space. In this general paradigm we respectively discuss three types of the RIT implementations with linear subspace embedding deep transformation and structured sparse learning. In practice the RIT and deep RIT are exploited to solve the image categorization task whose performances will be verified on various benchmark data sets. The structured sparse RIT is further applied to a medical image analysis task for brain magnetic resonance image segmentation that allows group-level feature selections on the brain tissues.
