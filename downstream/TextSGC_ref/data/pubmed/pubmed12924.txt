Skill development in science technology engineering and math STEM education present one of the most formidable challenges of modern society. The Community FabLab platform presents a viable solution. Each FabLab contains a suite of modern computer numerical control CNC equipment electronics and computing hardware and design programming computer aided design CAD and computer aided machining CAM software. FabLabs are community and educational resources and open to the public. Development of STEM based workforce skills such as digital fabrication and advanced manufacturing can be enhanced using this platform. Particularly notable is the potential of the FabLab platform in STEM education. The active learning environment engages and supports a diversity of learners while the iterative learning that is supported by the FabLab rapid prototyping platform facilitates depth of understanding creativity innovation and mastery. The product and project based learning that occurs in FabLabs develops in the student a personal sense of accomplishment self-awareness command of the material and technology. This helps build the interest and confidence necessary to excel in STEM and throughout life. Finally the introduction and use of relevant technologies at every stage of the education process ensures technical familiarity and a broad knowledge base needed for work in STEM based fields. Biomedical engineering education strives to cultivate broad technical adeptness creativity interdisciplinary thought and an ability to form deep conceptual understanding of complex systems. The FabLab platform is well designed to enhance biomedical engineering education. The community FabLab platform: applications and implications in biomedical engineering.
