"Understanding a persons feelings is a very important process for the affective computing. People express their emotions in various ways. Among them facial expression is the most effective way to present human emotional status. We propose efficient deep joint spatiotemporal features for facial expression recognition based on the deep appearance and geometric neural networks. We apply three-dimensional 3D convolution to extract spatial and temporal features at the same time. For the geometric network 23 dominant facial landmarks are selected to express the movement of facial muscle through the analysis of energy distribution of whole facial landmarks.We combine these features by the designed joint fusion classifier to complement each other. From the experimental results we verify the recognition accuracy of 99.21% 87.88% and 91.83% for CK+ MMI and FERA datasets respectively. Through the comparative analysis we show that the proposed scheme is able to improve the recognition accuracy by 4% at least."
