Large image datasets acquired on automated microscopes typically have some fraction of low quality out-of-focus images despite the use of hardware autofocus systems. Identification of these images using automated image analysis with high accuracy is important for obtaining a clean unbiased image dataset. Complicating this task is the fact that image focus quality is only well-defined in foreground regions of images and as a result most previous approaches only enable a computation of the relative difference in quality between two or more images rather than an absolute measure of quality.
