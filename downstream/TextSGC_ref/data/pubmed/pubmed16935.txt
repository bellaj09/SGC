The center of plantar pressure COP reflects the dynamic balance of subjects to a certain extent. In this study wearable pressure insoles are designed body pose measure is detected by the Kinect sensor and a balance evaluation system is formulated. With the designed games for the interactive actions the Kinect sensor reads the skeletal poses to judge whether the desired action is performed and the pressure insoles simultaneously collect the plantar pressure data. The COP displacement and its speed are calculated to determine the body sway and the ability of balance control. Significant differences in the dispersion of the COP distribution of the 12 subjects have been obtained indicating different balancing abilities of the examined subjects. A novel assessment process is also proposed in the paper in which a correlation analysis is made between the de facto sit-to-stand STS test and the proposed method; the Pearson and Spearman correlations are also conducted which reveal a significant positive correlation. Finally four undergraduate volunteers with a right leg sports injury participate in the experiments. The experimental results show that the normal side and abnormal side have significantly different characters suggesting that our method is effective and robust for balance measurements.
