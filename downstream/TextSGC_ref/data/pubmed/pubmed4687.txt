Major depressive disorder MDD is highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity yet its pathophysiology remains only partially understood. While numerous studies have investigated the neurobiological correlates of MDD most have used only a single neuroimaging modality. In particular diffusion tensor imaging DTI studies have failed to yield uniform results. In this context examining key tracts and using information from multiple neuroimaging modalities may better characterize potential abnormalities in the MDD brain. This study analyzed data from 30 participants with MDD and 26 healthy participants who underwent DTI magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and magnetoencephalography MEG. Tracts connecting the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex sgACC and the left and right amygdala as well as connections to the left and right hippocampus and thalamus were examined as target areas. Reduced fractional anisotropy FA was observed in the studied tracts. Significant differences in the correlation between medial prefrontal glutamate concentrations and FA were also observed between MDD and healthy participants along tracts connecting the sgACC and right amygdala; healthy participants exhibited a strong correlation but MDD participants showed no such relationship. In the same tract a correlation was observed between FA and subsequent antidepressant response to ketamine infusion in MDD participants. Exploratory models also suggested group differences in the relationship between DTI fMRI and MEG measures. This study is the first to combine MRS DTI fMRI and MEG data to obtain multimodal indices of MDD and antidepressant response and may lay the foundation for similar future analyses. Multimodal imaging reveals a complex pattern of dysfunction in corticolimbic pathways in major depressive disorder.
