In this paper we propose a brain-computer interface BCI based mail client. This system is controlled by hybrid features extracted from scalp-recorded electroencephalographic EEG. We emulate the computer mouse by the motor imagery-based mu rhythm and the P300 potential. Furthermore an adaptive P300 speller is included to provide text input function. With this BCI mail client users can receive read write mails as well as attach files in mail writing. The system has been tested on 3 subjects. Experimental results show that mail communication with this system is feasible. A brain-computer interface controlled mail client.
