Multiple types of neural signals are available for controlling assistive devices through brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Intracortically recorded spiking neural signals are attractive for BCIs because they can in principle provide greater fidelity of encoded information compared to electrocorticographic ECoG signals and electroencephalograms EEGs. Recent reports show that the information content of these spiking neural signals can be reliably extracted simply by causally band-pass filtering the recorded extracellular voltage signals and then applying a spike detection threshold without relying on "sorting" action potentials. Non-causal spike filtering improves decoding of movement intention for intracortical BCIs.
