Immersive learning environments that use virtual simulation VS technology are increasingly relevant as medical learners train in an environment of restricted clinical training hours and a heightened focus on patient safety. We conducted a consensus process with a breakout group of the 2017 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference "Catalyzing System Change Through Health Care Simulation: Systems Competency and Outcomes." This group examined the current uses of VS in training and assessment including limitations and challenges in implementing VS into medical education curricula. We discuss the role of virtual environments in formative and summative assessment. Finally we offer recommended areas of focus for future research examining VS technology for assessment including high-stakes assessment in medical education. Specifically we discuss needs for determination of areas of focus for VS training and assessment development and exploration of virtual platforms automated feedback within such platforms and evaluation of effectiveness and validity of VS education.
