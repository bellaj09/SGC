In this study we investigated the application of artificial neural networks ANNs with composite architectures into the prediction of local control LC of lung cancer patients after radiotherapy. The motivation of this study was to take advantage of the temporal associations among longitudinal sequential data to improve the predictive performance of outcome models under the circumstance of limited sample sizes. Two composite architectures: 1 a one dimension 1D convolutional + fully connected and 2 a locally-connected+ fully connected architectures were implemented for this purpose. Compared with the fully-connected architecture multi-layer perceptron MLP our composite architectures yielded better predictive performance of LC in lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy. Specifically in a cohort of 98 patients 29 patients failed locally the composite architecture of 1D convolutional layers and fully-connected layers achieved an AUC area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 95% confidence interval CI: 0.807~0.841 with 18 features 14 features are longitudinal data. Whereas the composite architecture of locally- connected layers and fully-connected layers achieved an AUC of 0.80 95%CI: 0.775~0.811. Both outperformed an MLP in the prediction performance with the same set of features which achieved an AUC of 0.78 95%CI: 0.751~0.790; P-values for differences in AUC using the DeLong tests were 1.609  10-14and 1.407  10-4 respectively.
