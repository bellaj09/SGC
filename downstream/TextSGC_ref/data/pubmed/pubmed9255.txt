There is wide variability in reported venous thromboembolism VTE incidence following total shoulder replacement TSR or total elbow replacement TER. It is uncertain which risk factors influence the risk of VTE following TSR or TER. We conducted a PRISMA compliant meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence temporal trends and potential risk factors for VTE following primary TSR and TER.
