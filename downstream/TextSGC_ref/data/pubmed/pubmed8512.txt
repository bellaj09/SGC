"It has demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3 is related to Alzheimers disease AD. On the basis of the world largest traditional Chinese medicine TCM database a network-pharmacology-based approach was utilized to investigate TCM candidates that can dock well with multiple targets. Support vector machine SVM and multiple linear regression MLR methods were utilized to obtain predicted models. In particular the deep learning method and the random forest RF algorithm were adopted. We achieved R2 values of 0.927 on the training set and 0.862 on the test set with deep learning and 0.869 on the training set and 0.890 on the test set with RF. Besides comparative molecular similarity indices analysis CoMSIA was performed to get a predicted model. All of the training models achieved good results on the test set. The stability of GSK3 protein-ligand complexes was evaluated using 100 ns of MD simulation. Methyl 3- O-feruloylquinate and cynanogenin A induced both more compactness to the GSK3 complex and stable conditions at all simulation times and the GSK3 complex also had no substantial fluctuations after a simulation time of 5 ns. For TCM molecules we used the trained models to calculate predicted bioactivity values and the optimum TCM candidates were obtained by ranking the predicted values. The results showed that methyl 3- O-feruloylquinate contained in Phellodendron amurense and cynanogenin A contained in Cynanchum atratum are capable of forming stable interactions with GSK3."
