Available super-resolution techniques for 3-D images are either computationally inefficient prior-knowledge-based iterative techniques or deep learning methods which require a large database of known low-resolution and high-resolution image pairs. A recently introduced tensor-factorization-based approach offers a fast solution without the use of known image pairs or strict prior assumptions. In this paper this factorization framework is investigated for single image resolution enhancement with an offline estimate of the system point spread function. The technique is applied to 3-D cone beam computed tomography for dental image resolution enhancement. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method it is compared to a recent state-of-the-art iterative technique using low-rank and total variation regularizations. In contrast to this comparative technique the proposed reconstruction technique gives a 2-order-of-magnitude improvement in running time-2 min compared to 2 h for a dental volume of 282266392 voxels. Furthermore it also offers slightly improved quantitative results peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation quality. Another advantage of the presented technique is the low number of hyperparameters. As demonstrated in this paper the framework is not sensitive to small changes in its parameters proposing an ease of use.
