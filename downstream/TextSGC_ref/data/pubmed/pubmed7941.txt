Due to the potential risk of inducing cancer radiation exposure by X-ray CT devices should be reduced for routine patient scanning. However in low-dose X-ray CT severe artifacts typically occur due to photon starvation beam hardening and other causes all of which decrease the reliability of the diagnosis. Thus a high-quality reconstruction method from low-dose X-ray CT data has become a major research topic in the CT community. Conventional model-based de-noising approaches are however computationally very expensive and image-domain de-noising approaches cannot readily remove CT-specific noise patterns. To tackle these problems we want to develop a new low-dose X-ray CT algorithm based on a deep-learning approach. A deep convolutional neural network using directional wavelets for low-dose X-ray CT reconstruction.
