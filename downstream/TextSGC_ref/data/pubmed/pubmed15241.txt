Artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML techniques are revolutionizing several industrial and research fields like computer vision autonomous driving natural language processing and speech recognition. These novel tools are already having a major impact in radiology diagnostics and many other fields in which the availability of automated solution may benefit the accuracy and repeatability of the execution of critical tasks. In this narrative review we first present a brief description of the various techniques that are being developed nowadays with special focus on those used in spine research. Then we describe the applications of AI and ML to problems related to the spine which have been published so far including the localization of vertebrae and discs in radiological images image segmentation computer-aided diagnosis prediction of clinical outcomes and complications decision support systems content-based image retrieval biomechanics and motion analysis. Finally we briefly discuss major ethical issues related to the use of AI in healthcare namely accountability risk of biased decisions as well as data privacy and security which are nowadays being debated in the scientific community and by regulatory agencies.
