Many tests of hemispatial neglect are insensitive to subtle but clinically relevant forms of the disorder. This study provides additional reliability and validity data on the Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test VRLAT an easy-to-administer computerized measure of hemispatial neglect that mimics the attentional demands of real-world tasks and has previously shown strong validity and sensitivity Dawson Buxbaum & Rizzo 2008. The present study assessed a large sample of patients with the aim of developing a clinically useful version of the test and established the concurrent criterion validity of the VRLAT as measured by its association with performance in a real-world task. Reliability and validity of the Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test in assessing hemispatial neglect in right-hemisphere stroke.
