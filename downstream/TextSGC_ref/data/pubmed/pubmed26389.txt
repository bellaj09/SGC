We introduce a novel approach to brain monitoring based on electroencephalogram EEG recordings from within the ear canal. While existing clinical and wearable systems are limited in terms of portability and ease of use the proposed in-the-ear ITE recording platform promises a number of advantages including ease of implementation minimally intrusive electrodes and enhanced accuracy fixed electrode positions. It thus facilitates a crucial step towards the design of brain computer interfaces that integrate naturally with daily life. The feasibility of the ITE concept is demonstrated with recordings made from electrodes embedded on an earplug which are benchmarked against conventional scalp electrodes for a classic EEG paradigm.
