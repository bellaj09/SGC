Passive rehabilitation devices providing motivation and feedback potentially offer an automated and low-cost therapy method and can be used as simple human-machine interfaces. Here we ask whether there is any advantage for a hand-training device to be elastic as opposed to rigid in terms of performance and preference. To address this question we have developed a highly sensitive and portable digital handgrip promoting independent and repetitive rehabilitation of grasp function based around a novel elastic force and position sensing structure. A usability study was performed on 66 healthy subjects to assess the effect of elastic versus rigid handgrip control during various visuomotor tracking tasks. The results indicate that for tasks relying either on feedforward or on feedback control novice users perform significantly better with the elastic handgrip compared with the rigid equivalent 11% relative improvement 9-14% mean range; p\u2009<\u20090.01. Furthermore there was a threefold increase in the number of subjects who preferred elastic compared with rigid handgrip interaction. Our results suggest that device compliance is an important design consideration for grip training devices. Elasticity improves handgrip performance and user experience during visuomotor control.
