Recent research in brain-machine interfaces and devices to treat neurological disease indicate that important network activity exists at temporal and spatial scales beyond the resolution of existing implantable devices. High density active electrode arrays hold great promise in enabling high-resolution interface with the brain to access and influence this network activity. Integrating flexible electronic devices directly at the neural interface can enable thousands of multiplexed electrodes to be connected using many fewer wires. Active electrode arrays have been demonstrated using flexible inorganic silicon transistors. However these approaches may be limited in their ability to be cost-effectively scaled to large array sizes 8  8 cm. Here we show amplifiers built using flexible organic transistors with sufficient performance for neural signal recording. We also demonstrate a pathway for a fully integrated amplified and multiplexed electrode array built from these devices. Flexible organic electronics for use in neural sensing.
