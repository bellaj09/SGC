"The Math Interactive Learning Experience MILE a program designed to address academic and behavioral problems found in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders FASD was found to be effective in a randomized clinical trials with results that persisted at a 6-month follow-up. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a community translation in partnership with several community sites in the metropolitan Atlanta area. A total of 60 participants were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: the MILE program administered at a specialty care center Center MILE or in the community Community MILE or to parent math instruction only Parent Instruction. This study evaluated instructor satisfaction with the training program knowledge related to FASD and the MILE program adherence to the MILE teaching methodology participant math outcomes and parents satisfaction with their treatment experience. Instructors reported a high degree of satisfaction with the overall training and mean site fidelity ratings were positively correlated with change in math performance. Those in the MILE intervention groups demonstrated more positive gains in math skills than those in the Parent Instruction group but did not differ from each other. Parents in the Parent Instruction group reported less satisfaction with their intervention than those assigned to the Center MILE group but satisfaction ratings did not differ between those in the MILE intervention groups. These results indicate that the community translation and the MILE instructor training program developed as part of this process were well-received and effective in producing positive treatment outcomes."
