"With reference to a recently published research article on the applicability and effectiveness of problem-based learning PBL in non-Western medical schools this commentary explores the assumption that a set of shared values is the common denominator of the globalisation of medical education. The use and effectiveness of PBL are not isolated from the cultural and social structural context in which it is applied; critical differences in values and in views on education underlie what educators and students perceive to be effective locally. The globalisation of medical education is more than the import of instructional designs and includes Western models of social organisation that require deep reflection and adaptation for success; hence instead of spreading models for medical education across the globe more effort should be put into the support of home-grown equivalents and alternatives."
