Automatic sorting of banknotes in payment facilities such as automated payment machines or vending machines consists of many tasks such as recognition of banknote type classification of fitness for recirculation and counterfeit detection. Previous studies addressing these problems have mostly reported separately on each of these classification tasks and for a specific type of currency only. In other words there has been little research conducted considering a combination of these multiple tasks such as classification of banknote denomination and fitness of banknotes as well as considering a multinational currency condition of the method. To overcome this issue we propose a multinational banknote type and fitness classification method that both recognizes the denomination and input direction of banknotes and determines whether the banknote is suitable for reuse or should be replaced by a new one. We also propose a method for estimating the fitness value of banknotes and the consistency of the estimation results among input trials of a banknote. Our method is based on a combination of infrared-light transmission and visible-light reflection images of the input banknote and uses deep-learning techniques with a convolutional neural network. The experimental results on a dataset composed of Indian rupee INR Korean won KRW and United States dollar USD banknote images with mixture of two and three fitness levels showed that the proposed method gives good performance in the combination condition of currency types and classification tasks.
