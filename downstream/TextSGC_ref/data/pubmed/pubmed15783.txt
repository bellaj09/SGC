We describe an augmented reality optical see-through display based on a DMD chip with an extremely fast 16 kHz binary update rate. We combine the techniques of post-rendering 2-D offsets and just-in-time tracking updates with a novel modulation technique for turning binary pixels into perceived gray scale. These processing elements implemented in an FPGA are physically mounted along with the optical display elements in a head tracked rig through which users view synthetic imagery superimposed on their real environment. The combination of mechanical tracking at near-zero latency with reconfigurable display processing has given us a measured average of 80 s of end-to-end latency from head motion to change in photons from the display and also a versatile test platform for extremely-low-latency display systems. We have used it to examine the trade-offs between image quality and cost i.e. power and logical complexity and have found that quality can be maintained with a fairly simple display modulation scheme.
