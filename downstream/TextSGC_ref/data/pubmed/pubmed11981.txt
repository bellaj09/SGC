Detection algorithms for electroencephalography EEG data especially in the field of interictal epileptiform discharge IED detection have traditionally employed handcrafted features which utilized specific characteristics of neural responses. Although these algorithms achieve high accuracy mere detection of an IED holds little clinical significance. In this paper we consider deep learning for epileptic subjects to accommodate automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data while also providing clinical insight. Convolutional neural networks are trained in a subject independent fashion to demonstrate how meaningful features are automatically learned in a hierarchical process. We illustrate how the convolved filters in the deepest layers provide insight toward the different types of IEDs within the group as confirmed by our expert clinicians. The morphology of the IEDs found in filters can help evaluate the treatment of a patient. To improve the learning of the deep model moderately different score classes are utilized as opposed to binary IED and non-IED labels. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance and is also invariant to time differences between the IEDs. This paper suggests that deep learning is suitable for automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data while also providing insight into the data.
