In the past few years several studies have been directed to understanding the complexity of functional interactions between different brain regions during various human behaviors. Among these neuroimaging research installed the notion that speech and language require an orchestration of brain regions for comprehension planning and integration of a heard sound with a spoken word. However these studies have been largely limited to mapping the neural correlates of separate speech elements and examining distinct cortical or subcortical circuits involved in different aspects of speech control. As a result the complexity of the brain network machinery controlling speech and language remained largely unknown. Using graph theoretical analysis of functional MRI fMRI data in healthy subjects we quantified the large-scale speech network topology by constructing functional brain networks of increasing hierarchy from the resting state to motor output of meaningless syllables to complex production of real-life speech as well as compared to non-speech-related sequential finger tapping and pure tone discrimination networks. We identified a segregated network of highly connected local neural communities hubs in the primary sensorimotor and parietal regions which formed a commonly shared core hub network across the examined conditions with the left area 4p playing an important role in speech network organization. These sensorimotor core hubs exhibited features of flexible hubs based on their participation in several functional domains across different networks and ability to adaptively switch long-range functional connectivity depending on task content resulting in a distinct community structure of each examined network. Specifically compared to other tasks speech production was characterized by the formation of six distinct neural communities with specialized recruitment of the prefrontal cortex insula putamen and thalamus which collectively forged the formation of the functional speech connectome. In addition the observed capacity of the primary sensorimotor cortex to exhibit operational heterogeneity challenged the established concept of unimodality of this region.
