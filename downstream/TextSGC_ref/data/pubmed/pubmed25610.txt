Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs enable users to interact with computers without any dedicated movement bringing new hands-free interaction paradigms. In this paper we study the combination of BCI and Augmented Reality AR. We first tested the feasibility of using BCI in AR settings based on Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays OST-HMDs. Experimental results showed that a BCI and an OST-HMD equipment EEG headset and Hololens in our case are well compatible and that small movements of the head can be tolerated when using the BCI. Second we introduced a design space for command display strategies based on BCI in AR when exploiting a famous brain pattern called Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential SSVEP. Our design space relies on five dimensions concerning the visual layout of the BCI menu; namely: orientation frame-of-reference anchorage size and explicitness. We implemented various BCI-based display strategies and tested them within the context of mobile robot control in AR. Our findings were finally integrated within an operational prototype based on a real mobile robot that is controlled in AR using a BCI and a HoloLens headset. Taken together our results 4 user studies and our methodology could pave the way to future interaction schemes in Augmented Reality exploiting 3D User Interfaces based on brain activity and BCIs.
