Low back pain LBP is commonly associated with paraspinal muscle dysfunctions. A method to study deep lumbar paraspinal ie multifidus muscle function and neuromuscular activation pattern is intramuscular electromyography EMG. Previous studies have shown that the procedure does not significantly impact muscle function during activities involving low-level muscle contractions. However it is currently unknown how muscular function and activation are affected during high-exertion contractions. Insertion and Presence of Fine-Wire Intramuscular Electrodes to the Lumbar Paraspinal Muscles Do Not Affect Muscle Performance and Activation During High-Exertion Spinal Extension Activities.
