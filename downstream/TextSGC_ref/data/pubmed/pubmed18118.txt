"Measuring arm and hand function of the affected side is vital in stroke rehabilitation. Therefore the Virtual Peg Insertion Test VPIT an assessment combining virtual reality and haptic feedback during a goal-oriented task derived from the Nine Hole Peg Test NHPT was developed. This study aimed to evaluate 1 the concurrent validity of key outcome measures of the VPIT namely the execution time and the number of dropped pegs with the NHPT and Box and Block Test BBT and 2 the test-retest-reliability of these parameters together with the VPITs additional kinetic and kinematic parameters in patients with chronic stroke. The three tests were administered on 31 chronic patients with stroke in one session concurrent validity and the VPIT was retested in a second session 3-7\xa0days later test-retest reliability. Spearman rank correlation coefficients  were calculated for assessing concurrent validity and intraclass correlation coefficients ICCs were used to determine relative reliability. Bland-Altman plots were drawn and the smallest detectable difference SDD was calculated to examine absolute reliability." Concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the Virtual Peg Insertion Test to quantify upper limb function in patients with chronic stroke.
