"Improving performance in sports can be difficult because many biomechanical physiological and psychological factors come into play during competition. A better understanding of the perception-action loop employed by athletes is necessary. This requires isolating contributing factors to determine their role in player performance. Because of its inherent limitations video playback doesnt permit such in-depth analysis. Interactive immersive virtual reality VR can overcome these limitations and foster a better understanding of sports performance from a behavioral-neuroscience perspective. Two case studies using VR technology and a sophisticated animation engine demonstrate how to use information from visual displays to inform a players future course of action."
