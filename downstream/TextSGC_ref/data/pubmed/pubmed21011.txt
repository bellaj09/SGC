In a previous study we presented a low-cost small and wireless 14-channel EEG system suitable for field recordings Debener et al. 2012 psychophysiology. In the present follow-up study we investigated whether a single-trial P300 response can be reliably measured with this system while subjects freely walk outdoors. Twenty healthy participants performed a three-class auditory oddball task which included rare target and non-target distractor stimuli presented with equal probabilities of 16%. Data were recorded in a seated control condition and in a walking condition both of which were realized outdoors. A significantly larger P300 event-related potential amplitude was evident for targets compared to distractors p<.001 but no significant interaction with recording condition emerged. P300 single-trial analysis was performed with regularized stepwise linear discriminant analysis and revealed above chance-level classification accuracies for most participants 19 out of 20 for the seated 16 out of 20 for the walking condition with mean classification accuracies of 71% seated and 64% walking. Moreover the resulting information transfer rates for the seated and walking conditions were comparable to a recently published laboratory auditory brain-computer interface BCI study. This leads us to conclude that a truly mobile auditory BCI system is feasible. Towards a truly mobile auditory brain-computer interface: exploring the P300 to take away.
