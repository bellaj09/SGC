Diffusion-weighted imaging coupled with tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of human white-matter fascicles. Tractography takes diffusion measurements as input and produces the connectome a large collection of white-matter fascicles as output. We introduce a method to evaluate the evidence supporting connectomes. Linear fascicle evaluation LiFE takes any connectome as input and predicts diffusion measurements as output using the difference between the measured and predicted diffusion signals to quantify the prediction error. We use the prediction error to evaluate the evidence that supports the properties of the connectome to compare tractography algorithms and to test hypotheses about tracts and connections. Evaluation and statistical inference for human connectomes.
