Model-based iterative reconstruction algorithms for low-dose X-ray computed tomography CT are computationally expensive. To address this problem we recently proposed a deep convolutional neural network CNN for low-dose X-ray CT and won the second place in 2016 AAPM Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge. However some of the textures were not fully recovered. To address this problem here we propose a novel framelet-based denoising algorithm using wavelet residual network which synergistically combines the expressive power of deep learning and the performance guarantee from the framelet-based denoising algorithms. The new algorithms were inspired by the recent interpretation of the deep CNN as a cascaded convolution framelet signal representation. Extensive experimental results confirm that the proposed networks have significantly improved performance and preserve the detail texture of the original images.
