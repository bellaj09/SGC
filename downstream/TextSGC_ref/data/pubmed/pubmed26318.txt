"Graz brain-computer interface BCI" transforms changes in oscillatory electroencephalogram EEG activity into control signals for external devices and feedback. Steady-state evoked potentials SSEPs and event-related desynchronization ERD are employed to encode user messages. User-specific setup and training are important issues for robust and reliable classification. Furthermore in order to implement small and thus affordable systems focus is put on the minimization of the number of EEG sensors. The system also supports the self-paced operation mode that is users have on-demand access to the system at any time and can autonomously initiate communication. Flexibility usability and practicality are essential to increase user acceptance. Here we illustrate the possibilities offered by now from EEG-based communication. Results of several studies with able-bodied and disabled individuals performed inside the laboratory and in real-world environments are presented; their characteristics are shown and open issues are mentioned. The applications include the control of neuroprostheses and spelling devices the interaction with Virtual Reality and the operation of off-the-shelf software such as Google Earth. Flexibility and practicality graz brain-computer interface approach.
