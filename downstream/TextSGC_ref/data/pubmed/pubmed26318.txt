Communication and control of the external environment can be provided via brain-computer interfaces BCIs to replace a lost function in persons with severe diseases and little or no chance of recovery of motor abilities ie amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brainstem stroke. BCIs allow to intentionally modulate brain activity to train specific brain functions and to control prosthetic devices and thus this technology can also improve the outcome of rehabilitation programs in persons who have suffered from a central nervous system injury ie stroke leading to motor or cognitive impairment. Overall the BCI researcher is challenged to interact with people with severe disabilities and professionals in the field of neurorehabilitation. This implies a deep understanding of the disabled condition on the one hand and it requires extensive knowledge on the physiology and function of the human brain on the other. For these reasons a multidisciplinary approach and the continuous involvement of BCI users in the design development and testing of new systems are desirable. In this chapter we will focus on noninvasive EEG-based systems and their clinical applications highlighting crucial issues to foster BCI translation outside laboratories to eventually become a technology usable in real-life realm. Interfacing brain with computer to improve communication and rehabilitation after brain damage.
