We look at the recent application of deep learning DL methods in automated fine-grained segmentation of spectral domain optical coherence tomography OCT images of the retina. We describe a new method combining fully convolutional networks FCN with Gaussian Processes for post processing. We report performance comparisons between the proposed approach human clinicians and other machine learning ML such as graph based approaches. The approach is demonstrated on an OCT dataset consisting of mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy from the University of Miami. The method is shown to have performance on par with humans also compares favorably with the other ML methods and appears to have as small or smaller mean unsigned error equal to 1.06 versus errors ranging from 1.17 to 1.81 for other methods and compared with human error of 1.10.
