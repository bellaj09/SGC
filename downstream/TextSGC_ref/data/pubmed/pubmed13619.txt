The computational prediction of novel microRNA within a full genome involves identifying sequences having the highest chance of being a miRNA precursor pre-miRNA. These sequences are usually named candidates to miRNA. The well-known pre-miRNAs are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates to miRNA that have to be analyzed which makes this task a high class-imbalance classification problem. The classical way of approaching it has been training a binary classifier in a supervised manner using well-known pre-miRNAs as positive class and artificially defining the negative class. However although the selection of positive labeled examples is straightforward it is very difficult to build a set of negative examples in order to obtain a good set of training samples for a supervised method. In this work we propose a novel and effective way of approaching this problem using machine learning without the definition of negative examples. The proposal is based on clustering unlabeled sequences of a genome together with well-known miRNA precursors for the organism under study which allows for the quick identification of the best candidates to miRNA as those sequences clustered with known precursors. Furthermore we propose a deep model to overcome the problem of having very few positive class labels. They are always maintained in the deep levels as positive class while less likely pre-miRNA sequences are filtered level after level. Our approach has been compared with other methods for pre-miRNAs prediction in several species showing effective predictivity of novel miRNAs. Additionally we will show that our approach has a lower training time and allows for a better graphical navegability and interpretation of the results.
