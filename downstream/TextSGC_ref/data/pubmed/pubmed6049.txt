"Electronic Health Records EHRs contain a wealth of patient data useful to biomedical researchers. At present both the extraction of data and methods for analyses are frequently designed to work with a single snapshot of a patients record. Health care providers often perform and record actions in small batches over time. By extracting these care events a sequence can be formed providing a trajectory for a patients interactions with the health care system. These care events also offer a basic heuristic for the level of attention a patient receives from health care providers. We show that is possible to learn meaningful embeddings from these care events using two deep learning techniques unsupervised autoencoders and long short-term memory networks. We compare these methods to traditional machine learning methods which require a point in time snapshot to be extracted from an EHR."
