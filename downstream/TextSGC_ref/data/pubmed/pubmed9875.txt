Aluminum profile surface defects can greatly affect the performance safety and reliability of products. Traditional human-based visual inspection has low accuracy and is time consuming and machine vision-based methods depend on hand-crafted features that need to be carefully designed and lack robustness. To recognize the multiple types of defects with various size on aluminum profiles a multiscale defect-detection network based on deep learning is proposed. Then the network is trained and evaluated using aluminum profile surface defects images. Results show 84.6% 48.5% 96.9% 97.9% 96.9% 42.5% 47.2% 100% 100% and 43.3% average precision AP for the 10 defect categories respectively with a mean AP of 75.8% which illustrate the effectiveness of the network in aluminum profile surface defects detection. In addition saliency maps also show the feasibility of the proposed network. Research on Recognition Technology of Aluminum Profile Surface Defects Based on Deep Learning.
