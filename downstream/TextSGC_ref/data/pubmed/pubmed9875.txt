Deep learning algorithms derived in homogeneous populations may be poorly generalizable and have the potential to reflect perpetuate and even exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. In this study we aimed to 1 assess whether the performance of a deep learning algorithm designed to detect low left ventricular ejection fraction using the 12-lead ECG varies by race/ethnicity and to 2 determine whether its performance is determined by the derivation population or by racial variation in the ECG.
