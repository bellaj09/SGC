As multiscale structures are inherent in multiphase flows constitutive models employed in conjunction with transport equations for momentum species and energy are scale dependent. We suggest that this scale dependency can be better quantified through deep learning techniques and formulation of transport equations for additional quantities such as drift velocity and analogies for species energy and momentum transfer. How one should incorporate interparticle forces which arise through van der Waals interaction dynamic liquid bridges between wet particles and tribocharging in multiscale models warrants further study. Development of multiscale models that account for all the known interactions would improve confidence in the use of simulations to explore design options decrease the number of pilot-scale experiments and accelerate commercialization of new technologies.
