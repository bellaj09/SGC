Biological targets are most commonly proteins such as enzymes ion channels and receptors. They are anything within a living organism to bind with some other entities like an endogenous ligand or a drug resulting in change in their behaviors or functions. Exploring potential drug-target interactions DTIs are crucial for drug discovery and effective drug development. Computational methods were widely applied in drug-target interactions since experimental methods are extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper we proposed a novel deep learning-based prediction system with a new negative instance generation to identify DTIs. As a result our method achieved an accuracy of 0.9800 on our created dataset. Another dataset derived from DrugBank was used to further assess the generalization of the model which yielded a good performance with accuracy of 0.8814 and AUC value of 0.9527 on the dataset. The outcome of our experimental results indicated that the proposed method involving the credible negative generation can be employed to discriminate the interactions between drugs and targets.
