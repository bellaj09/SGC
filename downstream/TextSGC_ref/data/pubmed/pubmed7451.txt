"Individuals post-stroke sustain motor deficits years after the stroke. Despite recent advancements in the applications of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and Deep Brain Stimulation in humans there is a lack of evidence supporting their use for rehabilitation after brain lesions. Non-invasive brain stimulation is already in use for treating motor deficits in individuals with Parkinsons disease and post-stroke. Deep Brain Stimulation has become an established treatment for individuals with movement disorders such as Parkinsons disease essential tremor epilepsy cerebral palsy and dystonia. It has also been utilized for the treatment of Tourettes syndrome Alzheimers disease and neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder major depression and anorexia nervosa. There exists growing scientific knowledge from animal studies supporting the use of Deep Brain Stimulation to enhance motor recovery after brain damage. Nevertheless these results are currently not applicable to humans. This review details the current literature supporting the use of these techniques to enhance motor recovery both from human and animal studies aiming to encourage development in this domain." Can neuromodulation techniques optimally exploit cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit properties to enhance motor learning post-stroke?
