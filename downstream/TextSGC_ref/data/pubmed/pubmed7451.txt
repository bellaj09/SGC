Quantitative analysis of the heart is extremely necessary and significant for detecting and diagnosing heart disease yet there are still some challenges. In this study we propose a new end-to-end segmentation-based deep multi-task regression learning model Indices-JSQ to make a holonomic quantitative analysis of the left ventricle LV which contains a segmentation network Img2Contour and multi-task regression network Contour2Indices. First Img2Contour which contains a deep convolutional encoder-decoder module is designed to obtain the LV contour. Then the predicted contour is fed as input to Contour2Indices for full quantification. On the whole we take into account the relationship between different tasks which can serve as a complementary advantage. Meanwhile instead of using images directly from the original dataset we creatively use the segmented contour of the original image to estimate the cardiac indices to achieve better and more accurate results. We make experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects and gain the experimental results of 157\xa0mm 2 2.43\xa0mm 1.29\xa0mm and 0.87 on areas dimensions regional wall thicknesses and Dice Metric respectively. It intuitively shows that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that our method has a great potential in cardiac MR images segmentation comprehensive clinical assessment and diagnosis.
