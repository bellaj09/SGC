To build a low-cost small and wireless electroencephalogram EEG system suitable for field recordings we merged consumer EEG hardware with an EEG electrode cap. Auditory oddball data were obtained while participants walked outdoors on university campus. Single-trial P300 classification with linear discriminant analysis revealed high classification accuracies for both indoor 77% and outdoor 69% recording conditions. We conclude that good quality single-trial EEG data suitable for mobile brain-computer interfaces can be obtained with affordable hardware. How about taking a low-cost small and wireless EEG for a walk?
