Despite the important functional role of the amygdala and hippocampus in socioemotional functioning there have been limited adequately powered studies testing how the structure of these regions relates to putatively relevant personality traits such as neuroticism. Additionally recent advances in MRI analysis methods provide unprecedented accuracy in measuring these structures and enable segmentation into their substructures. Using the new FreeSurfer amygdala and hippocampus segmentation pipelines with the full Human Connectome Project sample N = 1105 the current study investigated whether the morphometry of these structures is associated with the five-factor model FFM personality traits in a sample of relatively healthy young adults. Drawing from prior findings the following hypotheses were tested: 1 amygdala and hippocampus gray matter volume would be associated with neuroticism 2 CA2/3 and dentate gyrus would account for the relationship of the hippocampus with neuroticism and 3 amygdala gray matter volume would be inversely associated with extraversion. Exploratory analyses were conducted investigating potential associations between all of the FFM traits and the structure of the hippocampus and amygdala and their subregions. Despite some previous positive findings of whole amygdala and hippocampus with personality traits and related psychopathology e.g. depression the current results indicated no relationships between the any of the brain regions and the FFM personality traits. Given the large sample and utilization of sophisticated analytic methodology the current study suggests no association of amygdala and hippocampus morphometry with major domains of personality. No evidence for morphometric associations of the amygdala and hippocampus with the five-factor model personality traits in relatively healthy young adults.
