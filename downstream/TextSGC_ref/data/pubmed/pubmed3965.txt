There is accumulating evidence that the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorders ASD is linked to atypical neural communication and connectivity. This body of work emphasizes the need to characterize the function of multiple regions that comprise neural circuits rather than focusing on singular regions as contributing to deficits in ASD. Multimodal neuroimaging - the formal combination of multiple functional and structural measures of the brain - is extremely promising as an approach to understanding neural deficits in ASD. This review provides an overview of the multimodal imaging approach and then provides a snapshot of how multimodal imaging has been applied in the study of ASD to date. This body of work is separated into two categories: one concerning whole brain connectomics and the other focused on characterizing neural circuits implicated as altered in ASD. We end this review by highlighting emerging themes from the existing body of literature and new resources that will likely influence future multimodal imaging studies.
