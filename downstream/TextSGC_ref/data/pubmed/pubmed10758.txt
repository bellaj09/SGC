Skin cancer is among the most common cancer types in the white population and consequently computer aided methods for skin lesion classification based on dermoscopic images are of great interest. A promising approach for this uses transfer learning to adapt pre-trained convolutional neural networks CNNs for skin lesion diagnosis. Since pre-training commonly occurs with natural images of a fixed image resolution and these training images are usually significantly smaller than dermoscopic images downsampling or cropping of skin lesion images is required. This however may result in a loss of useful medical information while the ideal resizing or cropping factor of dermoscopic images for the fine-tuning process remains unknown.
