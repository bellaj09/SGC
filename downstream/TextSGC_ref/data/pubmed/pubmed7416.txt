"Background The image quality of digital breast tomosynthesis DBT volumes depends greatly on the reconstruction algorithm. Purpose To compare two DBT reconstruction algorithms used by the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration system filtered back projection FBP and FBP with iterative optimizations EMPIRE using qualitative analysis by human readers and detection performance of machine learning algorithms. Material and Methods Visual grading analysis was performed by four readers specialized in breast imaging who scored 100 cases reconstructed with both algorithms 70 lesions. Scoring 5-point scale: 1\u2009=\u2009poor to 5\u2009=\u2009excellent quality was performed on presence of noise and artifacts visualization of skin-line and Coopers ligaments contrast and image quality and when present lesion visibility. In parallel a three-dimensional deep-learning convolutional neural network 3D-CNN was trained n\u2009=\u2009259 patients 51 positives with BI-RADS 3 4 or 5 calcifications and tested n\u2009=\u200946 patients nine positives separately with FBP and EMPIRE volumes to discriminate between samples with and without calcifications. The partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve pAUC of each 3D-CNN was used for comparison. Results EMPIRE reconstructions showed better contrast 3.23 vs. 3.10 P\u2009=\u20090.010 image quality 3.22 vs. 3.03 P\u2009<\u20090.001 visibility of calcifications 3.53 vs. 3.37 P\u2009=\u20090.053 significant for one reader and fewer artifacts 3.26 vs. 2.97 P\u2009<\u20090.001. The 3D-CNN-EMPIRE had better performance than 3D-CNN-FBP pAUC-EMPIRE\u2009=\u20090.880 vs. pAUC-FBP\u2009=\u20090.857; P\u2009<\u20090.001. Conclusion The new algorithm provides DBT volumes with better contrast and image quality fewer artifacts and improved visibility of calcifications for human observers as well as improved detection performance with deep-learning algorithms."
