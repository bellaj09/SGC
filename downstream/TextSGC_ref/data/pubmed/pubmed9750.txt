Over 80000 endocrine-disrupting chemicals EDCs are considered emerging contaminants ECs which are of great concern due to their effects on human health. Quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR models are a promising alternative to in\xa0vitro methods to predict the toxicological effects of chemicals on human health. In this study we assessed a deep-learning based QSAR DL-QSAR model to predict the qualitative and the quantitative effects of EDCs on the human endocrine system and especially sex-hormone binding globulin SHBG and estrogen receptor ER. Statistical analyses of the qualitative responses indicated that the accuracies of all three DL-QSAR methods were above 90% and greater than the other statistical and machine learning models indicating excellent classification performance. The quantitative analyses as assessed using deep-neural-network-based QSAR DNN-QSAR resulted in a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.80 and predictive square correlation coefficient Q2 of 0.86 which implied satisfactory goodness of fit and predictive ability. Thus DNN was able to transform sparse molecular descriptors into higher dimensional spaces and was superior for assessment qualitative responses. Moreover DNN-QSAR demonstrated excellent performance in the discipline of computational chemistry by handling multicollinearity and overfitting problems.
