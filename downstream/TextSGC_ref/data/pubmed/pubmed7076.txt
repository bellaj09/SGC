In network analysis the so-called "rich club" describes the core areas of the brain that are more densely interconnected among themselves than expected by chance and has been identified as a fundamental aspect of the human brain connectome. This is the first in-depth diffusion imaging study to investigate the rich club along with other organizational changes in the brain\s anatomical network in behavioral frontotemporal dementia bvFTD and a matched cohort with early-onset Alzheimer\s disease EOAD. Our study sheds light on how bvFTD and EOAD affect connectivity of white matter fiber pathways in the brain revealing differences and commonalities in the connectome among the dementias. To analyze the breakdown in connectivity we studied three groups: 20 bvFTD 23 EOAD and 37 healthy elderly controls. All participants were scanned with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging MRI and based on whole-brain probabilistic tractography and cortical parcellations we analyzed the rich club of the brain\s connectivity network. This revealed distinct patterns of disruption in both forms of dementia. In the connectome we detected less disruption overall in EOAD than in bvFTD false discovery rate FDR critical Pperm \u2009=\u20095.7  10-3  10000 permutations with more involvement of richly interconnected areas of the brain chi-squared P\u2009=\u20091.4  10-4 -predominantly posterior cognitive alterations. In bvFTD we found a greater spread of disruption including the rich club FDR critical Pperm \u2009=\u20096  10-4  but especially more peripheral alterations chi-squared P\u2009=\u20096.5  10-3  particularly in medial frontal areas of the brain in line with the known behavioral socioemotional deficits seen in these patients.
