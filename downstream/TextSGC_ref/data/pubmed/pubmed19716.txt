By elegantly combining recent advancements of free-form optical technology and multi-focal-plane MFP display technology we developed a high-performance true 3D augmented reality AR display that is capable of rendering a large volume of 3D scenes with accurate focus cues; this display overcomes the accommodation-convergence discrepancy problem in conventional AR display. In this paper we concentrate on various aspects of engineering challenges in the design and integration of a free-form optical see-through eyepiece with MFP technology for our AR display prototype. We present the design and optimization strategy in coupling free-form optics with a rotational-symmetric lens system to achieve high image quality. A comprehensive tolerance analysis of this complicated optical system is also presented including an effective tolerance method for random surface figure errors on aspheric and free-form surfaces. Finally the image quality of the virtual display is evaluated which shows the as-built performance matches very well with the optical design results and tolerance analysis. Design and tolerance of a free-form optical system for an optical see-through multi-focal-plane display.
