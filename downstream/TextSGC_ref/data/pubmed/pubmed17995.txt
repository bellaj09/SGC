Numerous reports indicate that the growing incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD in returning Operation Enduring Freedom OEF/Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF military personnel is creating a significant health care and economic challenge. These findings have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Virtual reality-delivered exposure therapy for PTSD has been previously used with reports of positive outcomes. The current paper will detail the development and early results from use of the Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system. The system consists of a series of customizable virtual scenarios designed to represent relevant Middle Eastern contexts for exposure therapy including a city and desert road convoy environment. The process for gathering user-centered design feedback from returning OEF/OIF military personnel and from a system deployed in Iraq as was needed to iteratively evolve the system will be discussed along with a brief summary of results from an open clinical trial using Virtual Iraq with 20 treatment completers which indicated that 16 no longer met PTSD checklist-military criteria for PTSD after treatment. Development and early evaluation of the Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system for combat-related PTSD.
