"At the balanced intersection of human and machine adaptation is found the optimally functioning brain-computer interface BCI. In this study we report a novel experiment of BCI controlling a robotic quadcopter in three-dimensional 3D physical space using noninvasive scalp electroencephalogram EEG in human subjects. We then quantify the performance of this system using metrics suitable for asynchronous BCI. Lastly we examine the impact that the operation of a real world device has on subjects control in comparison to a 2D virtual cursor task."
