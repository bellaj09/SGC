The use of deep-learning-based artificial intelligence AI is emerging in ophthalmology with AI-mediated differential diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration AMD and dry AMD a promising methodology for precise treatment strategies and prognosis. Here we developed deep learning algorithms and predicted diseases using 399 images of fundus. Based on feature extraction and classification with fully connected layers we applied the Visual Geometry Group with 16 layers VGG16 model of convolutional neural networks to classify new images. Image-data augmentation in our model was performed using Keras ImageDataGenerator and the leave-one-out procedure was used for model cross-validation. The prediction and validation results obtained using the AI AMD diagnosis model showed relevant performance and suitability as well as better diagnostic accuracy than manual review by first-year residents. These results suggest the efficacy of this tool for early differential diagnosis of AMD in situations involving shortages of ophthalmology specialists and other medical devices.
