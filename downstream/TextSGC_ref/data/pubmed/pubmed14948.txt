"Since Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR targets are full of coherent speckle noise the traditional deep learning models are difficult to effectively extract key features of the targets and share high computational complexity. To solve the problem an effective lightweight Convolutional Neural Network CNN model incorporating transfer learning is proposed for better handling SAR targets recognition tasks. In this work firstly we propose the Atrous-Inception module which combines both atrous convolution and inception module to obtain rich global receptive fields while strictly controlling the parameter amount and realizing lightweight network architecture. Secondly the transfer learning strategy is used to effectively transfer the prior knowledge of the optical non-optical hybrid optical and non-optical domains to the SAR target recognition tasks thereby improving the models recognition performance on small sample SAR target datasets. Finally the model constructed in this paper is verified to be 97.97% on ten types of MSTAR datasets under standard operating conditions reaching a mainstream target recognition rate. Meanwhile the method presented in this paper shows strong robustness and generalization performance on a small number of randomly sampled SAR target datasets."
