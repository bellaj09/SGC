"Recently we presented a computational framework named VizBET to simulate and visualize biological electron-transfer ET dynamics. The visualization process was encapsulated as a plugin to the Visual Molecular Dynamics VMD software. However the users ability to understand complex multidimensional ET pathways was severely limited when visualized in 2D on traditional computer monitors. To provide a more accurate representation with enhanced depth perception we here present an extension of VizBET named iBET to render the VMD model of ET dynamics in a commodity virtual reality VR platform. The paper describes detailed procedures to export VMD models into the Unity game engine and render it in an Oculus Rift head mounted display. With the increasing availability of low-cost VR systems like the Rift and rich programmability of game engines the iBET framework provides a powerful means to explore and understand not only biological ET processes but also a unique experiential tool for broad scientific communities." iBET: Immersive visualization of biological electron-transfer dynamics.
