Augmented reality AR is a field of computer research which deals with the combination of real world and computer generated data. Registration is one of the most difficult problems currently limiting the usability of AR systems. In this paper we propose a novel natural feature tracking based registration method for AR applications. The proposed method has following advantages: 1 it is simple and efficient as no man-made markers are needed for both indoor and outdoor AR applications; moreover it can work with arbitrary geometric shapes including planar near planar and non planar structures which really enhance the usability of AR systems. 2 Thanks to the reduced SIFT based augmented optical flow tracker the virtual scene can still be augmented on the specified areas even under the circumstances of occlusion and large changes in viewpoint during the entire process. 3 It is easy to use because the adaptive classification tree based matching strategy can give us fast and accurate initialization even when the initial camera is different from the reference image to a large degree. Experimental evaluations validate the performance of the proposed method for online pose tracking and augmentation.
