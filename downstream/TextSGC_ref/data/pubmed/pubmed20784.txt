A Brain-Computer Interface BCI attempts to create a direct channel of communication between the brain and a computer. This is especially important for patients that are "locked in" as they have limited motor function and thus require an alternative means of communication. In this scope a BCI can be controlled through the imagination of motor tasks i.e. Motor Imagery. This thinking of actions produce changes on the ongoing Electroencephalogram EEG such as the so called Event-Related Desynchronization ERD that can be detected and measured. Traditionally ERD is measured through the estimation of EEG signal power in specific frequency bands. In this work a new method based on the phase information from the EEG channels through the Phase-Locking Factor PLF is proposed. Both feature types were tested in real data obtained from 6 voluntary subjects who performed 7 motor tasks in an EEG session. The features were classified using Support Vector Machine SVM classifiers organized in a hierarchical structure. The results show that the PLF features are better with an average accuracy of  86% against an accuracy of  70% for the band power features. Although more research is still needed the PLF measure shows promising results for use in a BCI system. Phase-locking factor in a motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface.
