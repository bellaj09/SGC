The development of improved threading algorithms for remote homology modeling is a critical step forward in template-based protein structure prediction. We have recently demonstrated the utility of contact information to boost protein threading by developing a new contact-assisted threading method. However the nature and extent to which the quality of a predicted contact map impacts the performance of contact-assisted threading remains elusive. Here we systematically analyze and explore this interdependence by employing our newly-developed contact-assisted threading method over a large-scale benchmark dataset using predicted contact maps from four complementary methods including direct coupling analysis mfDCA sparse inverse covariance estimation PSICOV classical neural network-based meta approach MetaPSICOV and state-of-the-art ultra-deep learning model RaptorX. Experimental results demonstrate that contact-assisted threading using high-quality contacts having the Matthews Correlation Coefficient MCC  0.5 improves threading performance in nearly 30% cases while low-quality contacts with MCC <0.35 degrades the performance for 50% cases. This holds true even in CASP13 dataset where threading using high-quality contacts MCC  0.5 significantly improves the performance of 22 instances out of 29. Collectively our study uncovers the mutual association between the quality of predicted contacts and its possible utility in boosting threading performance for improving low-homology protein modeling. Evaluating the significance of contact maps in low-homology protein modeling using contact-assisted threading.
