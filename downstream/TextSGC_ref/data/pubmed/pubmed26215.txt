"Preventing accidents caused by drowsiness behind the steering wheel is highly desirable but requires techniques for continuously estimating drivers abilities of perception recognition and vehicle control abilities. This paper proposes methods for drowsiness estimation that combine the electroencephalogram EEG log subband power spectrum correlation analysis principal component analysis and linear regression models to indirectly estimate drivers drowsiness level in a virtual-reality-based driving simulator. Results show that it is feasible to quantitatively monitor drivers alertness with concurrent changes in driving performance in a realistic driving simulator."
