Sensorimotor rhythm SMR based Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI typically require lengthy user training. This can be exhausting and fatiguing for the user as data collection may be monotonous and typically without any feedback for user motivation. Hence new ways to reduce user training and improve performance are needed. We recently introduced a two class motor imagery BCI system which continuously adapted with increasing run-time to the brain patterns of the user. The system was designed to provide visual feedback to the user after just five minutes. The aim of the current work was to improve user-specific online adaptation which was expected to lead to higher performances. To maximize SMR discrimination the method of filter-bank common spatial patterns fbCSP and Random Forest RF classifier were combined. In a supporting online study all volunteers performed significantly better than chance. Overall peak accuracy of 88.6  6.1 SD % was reached which significantly exceeded the performance of our previous system by 13%. Therefore we consider this system the next step towards fully auto-calibrating motor imagery BCIs.
