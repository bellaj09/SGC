Although virtual reality VR simulators serve an important role in the training and assessment of surgeons they need to be evaluated for evidence of validity. Eye-tracking technology and measures of visual control have been used as an adjunct to the performance parameters produced by VR simulators to help in objectively establishing the construct validity experts vs. novices of VR simulators. However determining the extent to which VR simulators represent the real procedure and environment content validity has largely been a subjective process undertaken by experienced surgeons. This study aimed to examine the content validity of a VR transurethral resection of the prostate TURP simulator by comparing visual control metrics taken during simulated and real TURP procedures. Assessing visual control during simulated and live operations: gathering evidence for the content validity of simulation using eye movement metrics.
