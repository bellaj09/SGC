Virtual reality VR immersion often provokes subjective discomfort and postural instability so called VR sickness. The neural mechanism of VR sickness is speculated to be related to visual-vestibular information mismatch and/or postural instability. However the approaches proposed to relieve VR sickness through modulation of brain activity are poorly understood. Using transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS we aimed to investigate whether VR sickness could be relieved by the modulation of cortical excitability in the temporoparietal junction TPJ which is known to be involved in processing of both vestibular and visual information. Twenty healthy subjects received tDCS over right TPJ before VR immersion. The order of the three types of tDCS anodal cathodal and sham was counterbalanced across subjects. We evaluated the subjective symptoms heart rate and center of pressure at baseline after tDCS and after VR immersion. VR immersion using head-mounted displays provoked subjective discomfort and postural instability. However anodal tDCS over right TPJ ameliorated subjective disorientation symptoms and postural instability induced by VR immersion compared with sham condition. The amelioration of VR sickness by anodal tDCS over the right TPJ might result from relief of the sensory conflict and/or facilitation of vestibular function. Our result not only has potential clinical implications for the neuromodulation approach of VR sickness but also implies a causal role of the TPJ in VR sickness.
