"To allow skilled object manipulation the brain must generate a motor command specifically tailored to the object properties. For instance in object lifting the forces applied by the fingertips must be scaled to the objects weight. When lifting a series of objects forces are usually scaled according to recent experience from previously lifted objects an effect often referred to as sensorimotor memory. In this study we investigated the specific time period during which stored information from previous object manipulation is used to mediate sensorimotor memory. More specifically we examined whether sensorimotor memory was based on weight information obtained between object contact and lift completion lifting phase or during stable holding holding phase. Participants lifted light and heavy objects in a randomised order in virtual reality that could increase or decrease in weight after the object was lifted and held in the air. In this way we could distinguish whether the force planning in the next lift was scaled depending on weight information gathered from either the dynamic lifting or static holding period. We found that force planning was based on the previous object weight experienced during the lifting but not holding phase. This suggest that the lifting phase is a key time period for building up sensorimotor memory for planning future hand-object interactions." Sensorimotor memory for object weight is based on previous experience during lifting not holding.
