Adequate head and neck HN organ-at-risk OAR delineation is crucial for HN radiotherapy and for investigating the relationships between radiation dose to OARs and radiation-induced side effects. The automatic contouring algorithms that are currently in clinical use such as atlas-based contouring ABAS leave room for improvement. The aim of this study was to use a comprehensive evaluation methodology to investigate the performance of HN OAR auto-contouring when using deep learning contouring DLC compared to ABAS. Improving automatic delineation for head and neck organs at risk by Deep Learning Contouring.
