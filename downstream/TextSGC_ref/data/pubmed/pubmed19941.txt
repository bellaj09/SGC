Traditionally a novice ear doctor acquires the skillfully operative ability through dissecting cadaveric temporal bone in ear surgical training lab. For conceivable reasons donated bodies are always short in supply virtual reality-based simulator provides a new model for surgical training. It has been proven that the simulator is a useful tool for surgical training. And it can be used in the rehearsal of operation procedures real-time operation guidance and remote surgery. Our design is different from the existing virtual surgical system. It has a parallel distributed multi-workstation with the vivid three-dimensional model of temporal bone and it can be used not only to learn the ear surgical skills in the virtual environment but also preoperative plan and surgical consultation. A simulation system of otology microsurgery based on distributed virtual reality technology.
