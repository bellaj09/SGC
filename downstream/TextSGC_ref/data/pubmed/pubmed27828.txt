"For centuries people have aspired to understand and control the functions of the mind and brain. It has now become possible to image the functioning of the human brain in real time using functional MRI fMRI and thereby to access both sides of the mind-brain interface--subjective experience that is ones mind and objective observations that is external quantitative measurements of ones brain activity--simultaneously. Developments in neuroimaging are now being translated into many new potential practical applications including the reading of brain states brain-computer interfaces communicating with locked-in patients lie detection and learning control over brain activation to modulate cognition or even treat disease." Applications of real-time fMRI.
