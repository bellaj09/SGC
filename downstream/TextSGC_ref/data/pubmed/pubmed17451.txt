The aim of this study was to describe and compare small-sized preliminary data on the usability and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial. This study compares a one-to-one cognitive-behavioral treatment and a virtual reality treatment for children and adolescents hospitalized for long-term physical conditions. The final sample was composed of 19 children and adolescents with chronic illness who were hospitalized. The sample was randomly allocated to two intervention groups: cognitive-behavioral usual treatment and virtual reality-based treatment. Participants in the virtual reality group demonstrated higher perceived efficacy scores for every treatment component than for traditional treatment. Statistically significant differences were found for the total usability and acceptability scores. Participants in the virtual reality group show high acceptability of all the virtual environments. The components and environments of virtual reality were well accepted. The virtual reality program received high scores in immersion feasibility of use and sense of reality. Technology-based treatments that is virtual reality can provide motivational benefits in relation to traditional treatments.
