"Cue combination rules have often been applied to the perception of surface shape but not to judgements of object location. Here we used immersive virtual reality to explore the relationship between different cues to distance. Participants viewed a virtual scene and judged the change in distance of an object presented in two intervals where the scene changed in size between intervals by a factor of between 0.25 and 4. We measured thresholds for detecting a change in object distance when there were only physical stereo and motion parallax or texture-based cues independent of the scale of the scene and used these to predict biases in a distance matching task. Under a range of conditions in which the viewing distance and position of the target relative to other objects was varied the ratio of physical to texture-based thresholds was a good predictor of biases in the distance matching task. The cue combination approach which successfully accounts for our data relies on quite different principles from those underlying traditional models of 3D reconstruction."
