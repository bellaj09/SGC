This study investigated whether the experience of "breaking the walls" the embodiment of the metaphor "breaking the rules" could enhance creative performance. The virtual reality technology was used to simulate the scenario where participants could "break the walls" while walking in a corridor. Participants were asked to solve the creativity-demanding problems ie. alternative uses tasks AUT in either the "break" condition in which they had to break the walls to move forward in VR or the "no-break" condition where no barrier walls would appear. Results showed higher AUT originality and AUT fluency in the "break" condition than in the "no-break" condition. Moreover the effects of "breaking the walls" on AUT originality were fully mediated by cognitive flexibility and persistence. These findings may indicate that enacting metaphors such as "breaking the rules" contribute to creative performance. The enhanced cognitive flexibility and persistence may account for the benefits. Break the "wall" and become creative: Enacting embodied metaphors in virtual reality.
