Virtual Reality an immersive technology that replicates an environment via computer-simulated reality gets a lot of attention in the entertainment industry. However VR has also great potential in other areas like the medical domain Examples are intervention planning training and simulation. This is especially of use in medical operations where an aesthetic outcome is important like for facial surgeries. Alas importing medical data into Virtual Reality devices is not necessarily trivial in particular when a direct connection to a proprietary application is desired. Moreover most researcher do not build their medical applications from scratch but rather leverage platforms like MeVisLab MITK OsiriX or 3D Slicer. These platforms have in common that they use libraries like ITK and VTK and provide a convenient graphical interface. However ITK and VTK do not support Virtual Reality directly. In this study the usage of a Virtual Reality device for medical data under the MeVisLab platform is presented. The OpenVR library is integrated into the MeVisLab platform allowing a direct and uncomplicated usage of the head mounted display HTC Vive inside the MeVisLab platform. Medical data coming from other MeVisLab modules can directly be connected per drag-and-drop to the Virtual Reality module rendering the data inside the HTC Vive for immersive virtual reality inspection.
