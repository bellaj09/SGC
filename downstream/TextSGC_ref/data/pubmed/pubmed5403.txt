The brain must dynamically integrate coordinate and respond to internal and external stimuli across multiple time scales. Non-invasive measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity FC and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here we review recent findings methodological considerations neural and behavioral correlates and future directions in the emerging field of dynamic FC investigations. Dynamic functional connectivity: promise issues and interpretations.
