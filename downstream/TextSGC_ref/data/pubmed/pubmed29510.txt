Functional near infra-red spectroscopy fNIRS is a promising brain imaging technology for brain-computer interfaces BCI. Future clinical uses of fNIRS will likely require operation over long time spans during which neural activation patterns may change. However current decoders for fNIRS signals are not designed to handle changing activation patterns. The objective of this study is to test via simulations a new adaptive decoder for fNIRS signals the Gaussian mixture model adaptive classifier GMMAC. A Gaussian mixture model based adaptive classifier for fNIRS brain-computer interfaces and its testing via simulation.
