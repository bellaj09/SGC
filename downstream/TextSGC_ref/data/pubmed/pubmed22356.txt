We present a comprehensive procedure to simulate real-world scenes viewed through ophthalmic lenses. Such a method enables us to anticipate the effects on image formation of the following combined undesired optical defects typically found in ophthalmic lenses: blur distortion and chromatic aberration. Additionally it helps in comparing the expected scenes seen with different lens designs. The procedure is based on the following steps: 1 to calculate the distortion and local dioptric matrix associated with a set of different gaze directions; 2 to estimate point spread functions PSF associated with these matrices; 3 to compute the joint action of distortion chromatic aberration and PSF field on the scenes. We illustrate this procedure with two +5D spherical lenses: a moderately good performance lens and a highly degrading one. The method is suitable to evaluate ophthalmic lenses in a virtual reality framework. Simulating real-world scenes viewed through ophthalmic lenses.
