Recent deep learning based approaches have achieved great success on handwriting recognition. Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write pictographic Chinese characters. In this paper we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network RNN as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing generating Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network CNN models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system combining an LSTM and GRU state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore under the RNN framework a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters in vector format are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.
