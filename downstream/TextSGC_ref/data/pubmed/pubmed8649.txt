"Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity that underlie learning and memory require new transcription and translation for their persistence. The remarkable polarity and compartmentalization of neurons raises questions about the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression within neurons. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation APA generates mRNA isoforms with different 3 untranslated regions 3UTRs and/or coding sequences. Changes in the 3UTR composition of mRNAs can alter gene expression by regulating transcript localization stability and/or translation while changes in the coding sequences lead to mRNAs encoding distinct proteins. Using specialized 3 end deep sequencing methods we undertook a comprehensive analysis of APA following induction of long-term potentiation LTP of mouse hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. We identified extensive LTP-induced APA changes including a general trend of 3UTR shortening and activation of intronic APA isoforms. Comparison with transcriptome profiling indicated that most APA regulatory events were uncoupled from changes in transcript abundance. We further show that specific APA regulatory events can impact expression of two molecules with known functions during LTP including 3UTR APA of Notch1 and intronic APA of Creb1. Together our results reveal that activity-dependent APA provides an important layer of gene regulation during learning and memory."
