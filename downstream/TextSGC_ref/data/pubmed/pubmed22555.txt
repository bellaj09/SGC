Impaired motor and functional activity following stroke often has negative impacts on the patient the family and society. The available rehabilitation programs for stroke patients are reviewed. Conventional rehabilitation strategies Bobath Brunnstrom proprioception neuromuscular facilitation motor relearning and function-based principles are the mainstream tactics in clinical practices. Numerous advanced strategies for sensory-motor functional enhancement including electrical stimulation electromyographic biofeedback constraint-induced movement therapy robotics-aided systems virtual reality intermittent compression partial body weight supported treadmill training and thermal stimulation are being developed and incorporated into conventional rehabilitation programs. The concept of combining valuable rehabilitative procedures into "a training package" based on the patient\s functional status during different recovery phases after stroke is proposed. Integrated sensorimotor rehabilitation programs with appropriate temporal arrangements might provide great functional benefits for stroke patients. Progress in sensorimotor rehabilitative physical therapy programs for stroke patients.
