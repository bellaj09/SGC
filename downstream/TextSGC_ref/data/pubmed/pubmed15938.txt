An open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies i.e. whole genome shotgun WGS and amplicon AMP; typically the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun SG whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies SG and AMP are used alternatively for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data that can be employed for both of them. Deep learning models for bacteria taxonomic classification of metagenomic data.
