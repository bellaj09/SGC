Individuals with neurodegenerative attacks loose the entire motor neuron movements. These conditions affect the individual actions like walking speaking impairment and totally make the person in to locked in state LIS. To overcome the miserable condition the person need rehabilitation devices through a Brain Computer Interfaces BCI to satisfy their needs. BMI using Electroencephalogram EEG receives the mental thoughts from brain and converts into control signals to activate the exterior communication appliances in the absence of biological channels. To design the BCI we conduct our study with three normal male subjects three normal female subjects and three ALS affected individuals from the age of 20-60 with three electrode systems for four tasks. One Dimensional Local Binary Patterns LBP technique was applied to reduce the digitally sampled features collected from nine subjects was treated with Grey wolf optimization Neural Network GWONN to classify the mentally composed words. Using these techniques we compared the three types of subjects to identify the performances. The study proves that subjects from normal male categories performance was maximum compared with the other subjects. To assess the individual performance of the subject we conducted the recognition accuracy test in offline mode. From the accuracy test also we obtained the best performance from the normal male subjects compared with female and ALS subjects with an accuracy of 98.33 % 95.00 % and 88.33 %. Finally our study concludes that patients with ALS attack need more training than that of the other subjects. Optimized artificial neural network based performance analysis of wheelchair movement for ALS patients.
