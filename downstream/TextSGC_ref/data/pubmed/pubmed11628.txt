In this paper we address the problem of hallucinating high-resolution facial images from low-resolution inputs at high magnification factors. We approach this task with convolutional neural networks CNNs and propose a novel deep face hallucination model that incorporates identity priors into the learning procedure. The model consists of two main parts: i a cascaded super-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution facial images and ii an ensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the super-resolution network during training. Different from most competing super-resolution techniques that rely on a single model for upscaling even with large magnification factors our network uses a cascade of multiple SR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of 2 . This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals target appearances at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at multiple-scales. The proposed C-SRIP model Cascaded Super Resolution with Identity Priors is able to upscale tiny low-resolution images captured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results for diverse low-resolution inputs. We rigorously evaluate the proposed model on the Labeled Faces in the Wild LFW Helen and CelebA datasets and report superior performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art.
