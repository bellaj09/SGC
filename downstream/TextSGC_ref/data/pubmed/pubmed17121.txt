Magnetically guided neuronavigation of flexible instruments is a new tool that can be used in the frameless navigation of deep-seated lesions or shunt placements. Disadvantages of optical systems such as the line-of-sight problem the necessity of rigid pin fixation of the head and missing tracking of the tip of flexible instruments should be solved by the new tracking system. Until now the accuracy of magnetically guided systems was mostly estimated in laboratory setups. Magnetically guided neuronavigation of flexible instruments in shunt placement transsphenoidal procedures and craniotomies.
