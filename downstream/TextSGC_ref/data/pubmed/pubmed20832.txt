Neurofeedback training NFT has shown to be promising and useful to rehabilitate cognitive functions. Recently brain-computer interfaces BCIs were used to restore brain plasticity by inducing brain activity with an NFT. In our study we hypothesized that an NFT with a motor imagery-based BCI MI-BCI could enhance cognitive functions related to aging effects. To assess the effectiveness of our MI-BCI application 63 subjects older than 60\xa0years were recruited. This novel application was used by 31 subjects NFT group. Their Luria neuropsychological test scores were compared with the remaining 32 subjects who did not perform NFT control group. Electroencephalogram changes measured by relative power RP endorsed cognitive potential findings under study: visuospatial oral language memory intellectual and attention functions. Three frequency bands were selected to assess cognitive changes: 12 18 and 21\xa0Hz bandwidth 3\xa0Hz. Significant increases p\xa0<\xa00.01 in the RP of these frequency bands were found. Moreover results from cognitive tests showed significant improvements p\xa0<\xa00.01 in four cognitive functions after performing five NFT sessions: visuospatial oral language memory and intellectual. This established evidence in the association between NFT performed by a MI-BCI and enhanced cognitive performance. Therefore it could be a novel approach to help elderly people.
