An importance measure of 3D objects inspired by human perception has a range of applications since people want computers to behave like humans in many tasks. This paper revisits a well-defined measure distinction of 3D surface mesh which indicates how important a region of a mesh is with respect to classification. We develop a method to compute it based on a classification network and a Markov Random Field MRF. The classification network learns view-based distinction by handling multiple views of a 3D object. Using a classification network has an advantage of avoiding the training data problem which has become a major obstacle of applying deep learning to 3D object understanding tasks. The MRF estimates the parameters of a linear model for combining the view-based distinction maps. The experiments using several publicly accessible datasets show that the distinctive regions detected by our method are not just significantly different from those detected by methods based on handcrafted features but more consistent with human perception. We also compare it with other perceptual measures and quantitatively evaluate its performance in the context of two applications. Furthermore due to the view-based nature of our method we are able to easily extend mesh distinction to 3D scenes containing multiple objects.
