"To investigate knowledge of school-aged children and their perception on intestinal parasites and to assess knowledge reconstruction on prevention practices after specific training in the subject. We performed an activity package that included the analysis of childrens drawings of intestinal parasites and information and communication technologies ITCs to transfer knowledge about these pathogens and prevention measures. Retrieval learning activities were performed to fixation of general and specific prevention and control measures.Overall we found that there is a knowledge gap in many aspects of parasite biology and ecology and therefore on the risk of infection and acquisition mechanisms. After ITCs the children improved their knowledge over non-trained children.The approaches used to transfer knowledge and for learning fixation were valuable tools for incorporating changes in misconceptions and in the deep-rooted habits that favour entero-parasitic diseases. This has important implications for the specific design of future education materials and campaigns. Understanding of perceptions helps to provide justifications and knowledge to achieve changes in unhealthy habits and it constitutes the basis for the transformation of many risky practices."
