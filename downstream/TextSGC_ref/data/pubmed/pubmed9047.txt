The etiological underpinnings of many CNS disorders are not well understood. This is likely due to the fact that individual diseases aggregate numerous pathological subtypes each associated with a complex landscape of genetic risk factors. To overcome these challenges researchers are integrating novel data types from numerous patients including imaging studies capturing broadly applicable features from patient-derived materials. These datasets when combined with machine learning potentially hold the power to elucidate the subtle patterns that stratify patients by shared pathology. In this study we interrogated whether high-content imaging of primary skin fibroblasts using the Cell Painting method could reveal disease-relevant information among patients. First we showed that technical features such as batch/plate type plate and location within a plate lead to detectable nuisance signals as revealed by a pre-trained deep neural network and analysis with deep image embeddings. Using a plate design and image acquisition strategy that accounts for these variables we performed a pilot study with 12 healthy controls and 12 subjects affected by the severe genetic neurological disorder spinal muscular atrophy SMA and evaluated whether a convolutional neural network CNN generated using a subset of the cells could distinguish disease states on cells from the remaining unseen control-SMA pair. Our results indicate that these two populations could effectively be differentiated from one another and that model selectivity is insensitive to batch/plate type. One caveat is that the samples were also largely separated by source. These findings lay a foundation for how to conduct future studies exploring diseases with more complex genetic contributions and unknown subtypes.
