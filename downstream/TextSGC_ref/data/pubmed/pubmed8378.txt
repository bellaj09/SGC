Preterm birth imposes a high risk for developing neuromotor delay. Earlier prediction of adverse outcome in preterm infants is crucial for referral to earlier intervention. This study aimed to predict abnormal motor outcome at 2 years from early brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI acquired between 29 and 35 weeks postmenstrual age PMA using a deep learning convolutional neural network CNN model. Predicting motor outcome in preterm infants from very early brain diffusion MRI using a deep learning convolutional neural network CNN model.
