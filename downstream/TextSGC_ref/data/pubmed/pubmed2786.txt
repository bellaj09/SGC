Not all depression patients effectively respond to repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS. We tested whether the intrinsic functional connectivity FC strength between the stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC and left nucleus accumbens NAcc might predict effects of rTMS. Twenty-two medication-nave depression patients received rTMS on left DLPFC for 2 weeks and underwent baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. We compared the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuation ALFF and regional homogeneity ReHo in the stimulated target the cortex region directly stimulated by rTMS located in the left DLPFC and the left NAcc as well as the intrinsic FC of the DLPFC-NAcc between early improvers and non-improvers. We evaluated the association between the baseline brain imaging features ALFF ReHo and FC and improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms. We found that the pretreatment ALFF and ReHo in the stimulated DLPFC and left NAcc did not significantly differ between the subgroups. The early improvers displayed increased negative FC strength between the stimulated DLPFC and left NAcc with respect to non-improvers. The stimulated DLPFC-NAcc FC strength negatively correlated with improved depressive and anxious symptoms. This study is the first to demonstrate that the resting-state FC of the stimulated DLPFC-NAcc rather than regional brain activity or local synchronization in the stimulated target might predict the anti-depression and anti-anxiety effects of rTMS for depression. Stimulated left DLPFC-nucleus accumbens functional connectivity predicts the anti-depression and anti-anxiety effects of rTMS for depression.
