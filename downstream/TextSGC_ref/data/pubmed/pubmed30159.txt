A major challenge in neuroprosthetics is the restoration of sensory-motor hand functions in upper-limb amputees. Neuroprostheses based on the direct re-connection of the peripheral nerves may be an interesting approach for re-establishing the natural and effective bidirectional control of hand prostheses. Recent results have shown that transverse intrafascicular multi-channel electrodes TIMEs can restore natural and sophisticated sensory feedback. However the potential of using TIME-recorded motor intraneural signals to decode grasping tasks has not as yet been explored. Decoding of grasping tasks from intraneural recordings in trans-radial amputee.
