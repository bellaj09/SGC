Stroke survivors are typically affected by hand motor impairment. Despite intensive rehabilitation and spontaneous recovery improvements typically plateau a year after a stroke. Therefore novel approaches capable of restoring or augmenting lost motor behaviors are needed. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs may offer one such approach by using neurophysiological activity underlying hand movements to control an upper extremity orthosis. To test the performance of such a system we developed an electroencephalogram-based BCI controlled electrically actuated hand orthosis. Six able-bodied participants voluntarily grasped/relaxed one hand to elicit BCI-mediated closing/opening of the orthosis mounted on the opposite hand. Following a short training/calibration procedure participants demonstrated real-time online control of the orthosis by following computer cues. Their performances resulted in an average of 1.15 standard deviation: 0.85 false alarms and 0.22 0.36 omissions per minute. Analysis of signals from electrogoniometers mounted on both hands revealed an average correlation between voluntary and BCI-mediated movements of 0.58 0.13 with all but one online performance being statistically significant. This suggests that a BCI driven hand orthosis is feasible and therefore should be tested in stroke individuals with hand weakness. If proven viable this technology may provide a novel approach to the neuro-rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. Performance assessment of a brain-computer interface driven hand orthosis.
