Random Phase Encoding RPE techniques for image encryption have drawn increasing attention during the past decades. We demonstrate in this contribution that the RPE-based optical cryptosystems are vulnerable to the chosen-plaintext attack CPA with deep learning strategy. A deep neural network DNN model is employed and trained to learn the working mechanism of optical cryptosystems and finally obtaining a certain optimized DNN that acts as a decryption system. Numerical simulations were carried out to verify its feasibility and reliability of not only the classical Double RPE DRPE scheme but also the security-enhanced Tripe RPE TRPE scheme. The results further indicate the possibility of reconstructing images plaintexts outside the original data set. Cryptanalysis of random-phase-encoding-based optical cryptosystem via deep learning.
