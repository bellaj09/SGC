Event extraction and annotation has become a significant focus of recent efforts in biological text mining and information extraction IE. However event extraction event annotation methods and resources have so far focused almost exclusively on a single domain. State-of-the-art studies on biological event extraction and annotation are typically domain-dependent and domain-restricted. In this paper we adopt an approach aimed at extracting events and relations for two different tasks by generating a common dataset using transfer learning and structural correspondence learning SCL. A deep learning event extraction system was developed to evaluate our results. Our approach comprises two stages: 1 generating a dataset from two independent event extraction tasks or domains and 2 using a classifier model to learn feature patterns from the generated dataset for event and relation extraction. The classifier in the proposed model can extract events and relations irrespective of the domain of the test input. Our study shows that this approach performs competitively compared to domain specific or dependent tasks. Domain transformation on biological event extraction by learning methods.
