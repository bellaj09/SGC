Virtual reality VR is rapidly becoming an inexpensive mainstream technology. VR technology is superambulatory as it allows participants to be examined under standardized environments and tests anywhere. In addition it can test participants in different virtual spaces including environments that are unsafe inaccessible costly or difficult to set up or even nonexistent. We summarize the benefits and potential problems of VR technology but we also move beyond theoretical approaches and present a customizable open-source VR system PSY-VR that allows scalable psychological testing in modifiable VR environments. This system allows users to modify the environment using a simple graphical interface without programming expertise. Moreover as a proof-of-concept we compare responses in a typical Flanker task between a real laboratory and a painstakingly matched virtual laboratory. Results indicate that the VR responses are comparable to real life testing demonstrating the utility of VR for psychological assessment studies. The predicted rapid advancement of VR immersive technologies as well the ease of their integration with physiological metrics ensures that VR-based assessment will be the modus operandi of psychological assessment in the future. This will allow controllable low-cost assessment on a global scale. PsycINFO Database Record c 2019 APA all rights reserved. Assessing the suitability of virtual reality for psychological testing.
