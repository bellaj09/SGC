First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show cognitive impairments that are similar to but less severe than their ill relatives. We have shown that memory impairments can be improved and prefrontal cortical PFC activity increased in individuals with schizophrenia by providing beneficial encoding strategies. The current study used a similar paradigm to determine whether siblings of individuals with schizophrenia SIBs also show increases in brain activity when presented with beneficial encoding strategies. Levels-of-processing effects in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia.
