A virtual translumenal endoscopic surgical trainer VTEST is being developed to accelerate the development of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES procedures and devices in a safe and risk-free environment. For a rapidly developing field such as NOTES a needs analysis must be conducted regularly to discover emerging research trends and areas of potential high impact for a virtual simulator. This paper presents a survey-based study which follows a similar study conducted by this group in 2011 Sankaranarayanan et al. in Surg Endosc 27:1607-1616 2013. Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery NOTES: emerging trends and specifications for a virtual simulator.
