In this paper we present a design for a wearable computational DSP system that alleviates the issues of a previous design and provides a much smaller and lower power solution for the overall BMI goals. The system first acquires the neural data through a high speed data bus in order to train and evaluate prediction models. Then it wirelessly transmits the predicted results to a simulated robot arm. This system has been built and successfully tested with real and simulated data. A reconfigurable neural signal processor NSP for brain machine interfaces.
