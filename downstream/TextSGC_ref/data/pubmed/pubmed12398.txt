The majority of our human genome transcribes into noncoding RNAs with unknown structures and functions. Obtaining functional clues for noncoding RNAs requires accurate base-pairing or secondary-structure prediction. However the performance of such predictions by current folding-based algorithms has been stagnated for more than a decade. Here we propose the use of deep contextual learning for base-pair prediction including those noncanonical and non-nested pseudoknot base pairs stabilized by tertiary interactions. Since only Formula: see text250 nonredundant high-resolution RNA structures are available for model training we utilize transfer learning from a model initially trained with a recent high-quality bpRNA dataset of Formula: see text10000 nonredundant RNAs made available through comparative analysis. The resulting method achieves large statistically significant improvement in predicting all base pairs noncanonical and non-nested base pairs in particular. The proposed method SPOT-RNA with a freely available server and standalone software should be useful for improving RNA structure modeling sequence alignment and functional annotations.
