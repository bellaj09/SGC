"Objective: Research suggests that prospective memory PM is impaired from the very early stages of Alzheimers disease AD. We sought to further characterize this impairment in patients with mild AD using a virtual reality VR task to provide ecological assessment of PM. Methods: Fifteen cognitively normal older individuals 76.47 years old  4.14 MMSE: 28.80  1.21 and 17 patients with mild AD 79.29 years old  4.45 MMSE: 22.82  2.83 were asked to recall the prospective and retrospective components of seven intentions in a virtual town task. Six intentions were event-based where the prospective cue was either highly three intentions or weakly three intentions associated with the retrospective component. The remaining intention was time-based. All participants completed a neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory semantic memory and executive functioning. Non-parametric tests were used to compare the two groups on the different intentions types and components. Correlations between cognition and PM scores were then realized to further understand the cognitive correlates of the PM impairment in patients with AD. Results: Overall patients with Alzheimer disease recalled fewer intentions than controls with the retrospective component and time-based intentions being the most challenging for them. The strength of the association between the prospective and retrospective components however had no effect on their performance. Event-based PM impairment as well as deficit in the recall of prospective component correlated with memory and executive functions performance. Conclusion: PM is impaired in AD. Both automatic and controlled processes of PM retrieval are disturbed. This study also confirms the reliability of VR for assessing complex cognitive functions such as PM."
