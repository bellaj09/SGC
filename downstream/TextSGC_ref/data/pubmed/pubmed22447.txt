"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a virtual reality program combined with conventional therapy in upper limb function in people with tetraplegia and to provide data about patients satisfaction with the virtual reality system. Thirty-one people with subacute complete cervical tetraplegia participated in the study. Experimental group received 15 sessions with Toyra virtual reality system for 5 weeks 30 minutes/day 3 days/week in addition to conventional therapy while control group only received conventional therapy. All patients were assessed at baseline after intervention and at three-month follow-up with a battery of clinical functional and satisfaction scales. Control group showed significant improvements in the manual muscle test p = 0043 partial  2 = 022 in the follow-up evaluation. Both groups demonstrated clinical but nonsignificant changes to their arm function in 4 of the 5 scales used. All patients showed a high level of satisfaction with the virtual reality system. This study showed that virtual reality added to conventional therapy produces similar results in upper limb function compared to only conventional therapy. Moreover the gaming aspects incorporated in conventional rehabilitation appear to produce high motivation during execution of the assigned tasks. This trial is registered with EudraCT number 2015-002157-35." Effectiveness of the Virtual Reality System Toyra on Upper Limb Function in People with Tetraplegia: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
