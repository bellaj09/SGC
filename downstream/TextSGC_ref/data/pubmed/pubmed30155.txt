Tetraplegic patients using brain-machine interfaces can make visually guided reaches with robotic arms. However restoring proprioceptive feedback to these patients will be critical as evidenced by the movement deficit in patients with proprioceptive loss. Proprioception is critical in large part because it provides faster feedback than vision. Intracortical microstimulation ICMS is a promising approach but the ICMS-evoked reaction time RT is typically slower than that to natural proprioceptive and often even visual cues implying that ICMS feedback may not be fast enough to guide movement. Short reaction times in response to multi-electrode intracortical microstimulation may provide a basis for rapid movement-related feedback.
