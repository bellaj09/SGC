Gaze-based interfaces and Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs allow for hands-free human-computer interaction. In this paper we investigate the combination of gaze and BCIs. We propose a novel selection technique for 2D target acquisition based on input fusion. This new approach combines the probabilistic models for each input in order to better estimate the intent of the user. We evaluated its performance against the existing gaze and brain-computer interaction techniques. Twelve participants took part in our study in which they had to search and select 2D targets with each of the evaluated techniques. Our fusion-based hybrid interaction technique was found to be more reliable than the previous gaze and BCI hybrid interaction techniques for 10 participants over 12 while being 29% faster on average. However similarly to what has been observed in hybrid gaze-and-speech interaction gaze-only interaction technique still provides the best performance. Our results should encourage the use of input fusion as opposed to sequential interaction in order to design better hybrid interfaces.
