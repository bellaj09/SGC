The recent embedding of electroencephalographic EEG electrodes in wearable devices raises the problem of the quality of the data recorded in such uncontrolled environments. These recordings are often obtained with dry single-channel EEG devices and may be contaminated by many sources of noise which can compromise the detection and characterization of the brain state studied. In this paper we propose a classification-based approach to effectively quantify artefact contamination in EEG segments and discriminate muscular artefacts. The performance of our method were assessed on different databases containing either artificially contaminated or real artefacts recorded with different type of sensors including wet and dry EEG electrodes. Furthermore the quality of unlabelled databases was evaluated. For all the studied databases the proposed method is able to rapidly assess the quality of the EEG signals with an accuracy higher than 90%. The obtained performance suggests that our approach provide an efficient fast and automated quality assessment of EEG signals from low-cost wearable devices typically composed of a dry single EEG channel.
