The emergence of abundant biological networks which benefit from the development of advanced high-throughput techniques contributes to describing and modeling complex internal interactions among biological entities such as genes and proteins. Multiple networks provide rich information for inferring the function of genes or proteins. To extract functional patterns of genes based on multiple heterogeneous networks network embedding-based methods aiming to capture non-linear and low-dimensional feature representation based on network biology have recently achieved remarkable performance in gene function prediction. However existing methods do not consider the shared information among different networks during the feature learning process. Integrating multi-network topology for gene function prediction using deep neural networks.
