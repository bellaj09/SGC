The prefrontal-limbic network in the human brain plays a major role in social cognition especially cognitive control of emotion. The medial frontopolar cortex mFP; Brodmann Area 10 and the amygdala are part of this network and display correlated neuronal activity in time as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. This functional connectivity is dynamic sensitive to training and affected in mental disorders. However the effects of neurostimulation on functional connectivity within this network have not yet been systematically investigated. Here we investigate the effects of both low- and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS to the right mFP on functional connectivity between mFP and amygdala as measured with resting state fMRI rsfMRI. Three groups of healthy participants received either low-frequency rTMS 1 Hz; N = 18 sham TMS 1 Hz subthreshold; N = 18 or high-frequency rTMS 20\u2009Hz; N = 19. rsfMRI was acquired before and after separate days. We hypothesized a modulation of functional connectivity in opposite directions compared to sham TMS through adjustment of the stimulation frequency. Groups differed in functional connectivity between mFP and amygdala after stimulation compared to before stimulation low-frequency: decrease high-frequency: increase. Motion or induced changes in neuronal activity were excluded as confounders. Results show that rTMS is effective for increasing and decreasing functional coherence between prefrontal and limbic regions. This finding is relevant for social and affective neuroscience as well as novel treatment approaches in psychiatry.
