"Information flow among auditory and language processing-related regions implicated in the pathophysiology of auditory verbal hallucinations AVHs in schizophrenia SZ remains unclear. In this study we used stochastic dynamic causal modeling sDCM to quantify connections among the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inner speech monitoring auditory cortex auditory processing hippocampus memory retrieval thalamus information filtering and Brocas area language production in 17 first-episode drug-nave SZ patients with AVHs 15 without AVHs and 19 healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Finally we performed receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis and correlation analysis between image measures and symptoms. sDCM revealed an increased sensitivity of auditory cortex to its thalamic afferents and a decrease in hippocampal sensitivity to auditory inputs in SZ patients with AVHs. The area under the ROC curve showed the diagnostic value of these two connections to distinguish SZ patients with AVHs from those without AVHs. Furthermore we found a positive correlation between the strength of the connectivity from Brocas area to the auditory cortex and the severity of AVHs. These findings demonstrate for the first time augmented AVH-specific excitatory afferents from the thalamus to the auditory cortex in SZ patients resulting in auditory perception without external auditory stimuli. Our results provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying AVHs in SZ. This thalamic-auditory cortical-hippocampal dysconnectivity may also serve as a diagnostic biomarker of AVHs in SZ and a therapeutic target based on direct in vivo evidence."
