A number of remote robotic catheter systems have been developed to protect physicians from X-ray exposure in endovascular surgery. However the teleoperation prevents the physicians sensing the force directly which may easily result in healthy vessels injured. To realize the safe operation a tissue protection-based VR training system has been developed in this paper to prevent collateral damage by collision. The integrated VR simulator cannot only remind the novice possible collisions by visual signs but also cooperate with the newly designed tissue protection mechanism to remit collision trauma beforehand. Such mechanism exploits the diameter variable pulley in order to implement the safe interaction between catheter and vasculature. To testify the effectiveness of the tissue protection in training system we invited four non-medical students to participate the successive 5\xa0days training session. The evaluation results show that the average impingement distance representing tissue damage to vascular wall has been reduced to 0.6\xa0mm and the collision frequency is greatly decreased which implies the realization of relative safe catheterization. Design and evaluation of safety operation VR training system for robotic catheter surgery.
