Both functional connectivity FC and blood oxygen level-dependent BOLD signal variability SDBOLD are methods that are used for examining the physiological state of the brain. Although they are derived from signal changes and are related a few studies have explored their relationship. Here we examined the relationship between SDBOLD and FC within the default mode network DMN in healthy aging participants and those with Parkinson\s disease PD ON and OFF dopaminergic medications. Dopaminergic medications had profound effects on both DMN FC and SDBOLD measured separately in PD. Analyzing DMN FC and SDBOLD in a joint independent component analysis we identified joint components of DMN FC and SDBOLD that were separately associated with measurements of motor and cognitive impairment in PD and qualitatively similar to those in healthy aging. Dopaminergic medications had a differential effect on these components depending on these measures of disease severity "normalizing" the relationships. Importantly we show that dopaminergic medication status matters in imaging PD and it can affect both connectivity and SDBOLD. Imaging PD ON may lead to inflated estimates of SDBOLD and diminish the ability to measure changes associated with declining motor and cognitive capacities.
