"In-ear EEG offers a promising path toward usable discreet brain-computer interfaces BCIs for both healthy individuals and persons with disabilities. To test the promise of this modality we produced a brain-based authentication system using custom-fit EEG earpieces. In a sample of N = 7 participants we demonstrated that our system has high accuracy higher than prior work using non-custom earpieces. We demonstrated that both inherence and knowledge factors contribute to authentication accuracy and performed a simulated attack to show our systems robustness against impersonation. From an authentication standpoint our system provides three factors of authentication in a single step. From a usability standpoint our system does not require a cumbersome head-worn device."
