Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS plays an important role in treatment of mental and neurological illnesses and neurosurgery. However it is difficult to target specific brain regions accurately because the complex anatomy of the brain substantially affects the shape and strength of the electric fields induced by the TMS coil. A volume conductor model can be used for determining the accurate electric fields; however the construction of subject-specific anatomical head structures is time-consuming. Real-time estimation of electric fields induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation with deep neural networks.
