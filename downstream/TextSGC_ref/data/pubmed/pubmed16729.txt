"Visually induced motion sickness MS experienced in a 3D immersive virtual environment VE limits the widespread use of virtual reality VR. This paper studies the effects of a saliency detection-based approach on the reduction of MS when the display on a users retina is dynamic blurred. In the experiment forty participants were exposed to a VR experience under a control condition without applying dynamic blurring and an experimental condition applying dynamic blurring. The experimental results show that the participants under the experimental condition report a statistically significant reduction in the severity of MS symptoms on average during the VR experience compared to those under the control condition which demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively prevent visually induced MS in VR and enable users to remain in a VE for a longer period of time."
