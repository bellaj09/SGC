Using prospective longitudinal data from 198 very preterm and 70 full term children this study characterised the memory and learning abilities of very preterm children at 7 years of age in both verbal and visual domains. The relationship between the extent of brain abnormalities on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging MRI and memory and learning outcomes at 7 years of age in very preterm children was also investigated. Neonatal MRI scans were qualitatively assessed for global white-matter cortical grey-matter deep grey-matter and cerebellar abnormalities. Very preterm children performed less well on measures of immediate memory working memory long-term memory and learning compared with term-born controls. Neonatal brain abnormalities and in particular deep grey-matter abnormality were associated with poorer memory and learning performance at 7 years in very preterm children. Findings support the importance of cerebral neonatal pathology for predicting later memory and learning function. Neonatal brain abnormalities and memory and learning outcomes at 7 years in children born very preterm.
