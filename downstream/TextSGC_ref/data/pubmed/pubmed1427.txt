The reliable detection of transcription events through the quantification of the corresponding mRNA is of paramount importance for the diagnostics of infections and diseases. The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases e. g. Covid-19. In situ mRNA analysis however is a formidable challenge and currently performed with sets of single-fluorophore-containing oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands >30 are required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used however the higher the potential off-target binding effects that create background noise. Here we used click chemistry and alkyne-modified DNA oligonucleotides to prepare multiple-fluorophore-containing probes. We found that these multiple-dye probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very small number 5-10 of probe strands. The new method enabled the in\u2005situ detection of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection.
