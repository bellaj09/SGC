One of the main problems of both synchronous and asynchronous EEG-based BCIs is the need of an initial calibration phase before the system can be used. This phase is necessary due to the high non-stationarity of the EEG since it changes between sessions and users. The calibration process limits the BCI systems to scenarios where the outputs are very controlled and makes these systems non-friendly and exhausting for the users. Although it has been studied how to reduce calibration time for asynchronous signals it is still an open issue for event-related potentials. Here we propose the minimization of the calibration time on single-trial error potentials by using classifiers based on inter-subject information. The results show that it is possible to have a classifier with a high performance from the beginning of the experiment and which is able to adapt itself making the calibration phase shorter and transparent to the user. Minimizing calibration time using inter-subject information of single-trial recognition of error potentials in brain-computer interfaces.
