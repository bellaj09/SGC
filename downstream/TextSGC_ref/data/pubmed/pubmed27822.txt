We hereby present a new method of producing coaxial conducting polymer fibres loaded with an antibiotic drug that can then be subsequently released or sustained in response to electrical stimulation. The method involves wet-spinning of poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene polystyrenesulfonate PEDOT:PSS fibre which served as the inner core to the electropolymerised outer shell layer of polypyrrole Ppy. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride Cipro was selected as the model drug and as the dopant in the Ppy synthesis. The release of Cipro in phosphate buffered saline PBS from the fibres was controlled by switching the redox state of Ppy.Cipro layer. Released Cipro under passive and stimulated conditions were tested against Gram positive Streptococcus pyogenes and Gram negative Escherichia coli bacteria. Significant inhibition of bacterial growth was observed against both strains tested. These results confirm that Cipro retains antibacterial properties during fibre fabrication and electrochemically controlled release. In vitro cytotoxicity testing utilising the neural B35 cell line confirmed the cytocompatibility of the drug loaded conducting fibres. Electrical conductivity cytocompatibility and tuning release profile from this flexible fibre can lead to promising bionic applications such as neuroprosthetics and localised drug delivery. Multifunctional conducting fibres with electrically controlled release of ciprofloxacin.
