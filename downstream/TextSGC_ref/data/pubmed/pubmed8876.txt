Organ-at-risk OAR segmentation is a key step for radiotherapy treatment planning. Model-based segmentation MBS has been successfully used for the fully automatic segmentation of anatomical structures and it has proven to be robust to noise due to its incorporated shape prior knowledge. In this work we investigate the advantages of combining neural networks with the prior anatomical shape knowledge of the model-based segmentation of organs-at-risk for brain radiotherapy RT on Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI. We train our boundary detectors using two different approaches: classic strong gradients as described in 4 and as a locally adaptive regression task where for each triangle a convolutional neural network CNN was trained to estimate the distances between the mesh triangles and organ boundary which were then combined into a single network as described by 1. We evaluate both methods using a 5-fold cross- validation on both T1w and T2w brain MRI data from sixteen primary and metastatic brain cancer patients some post-surgical. Using CNN-based boundary detectors improved the results for all structures in both T1w and T2w data. The improvements were statistically significant p < 0.05 for all segmented structures in the T1w images and only for the auditory system in the T2w images.
