"Deep brain stimulation DBS is an effective treatment for the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease and other neurological disorders. However clinicians and commentators have noted that DBS recipients have not necessarily experienced the improvements in quality of life that would be expected due in large part to what have been described as the psychosocial impacts of DBS. The premise of this paper is that in order to realise the full potential of DBS and similar interventions clinical services need to be arranged in such a way that these psychosocial dimensions are recognised and managed. Our starting point is that the psychosocial effects of DBS in the field present us with analytically-useful disruptions: they disturb and foreground deeply held assumptions relating to the individual health and its treatment and which in a crude form manifest as the myth of technological solutionism within health care. Drawing on scholarship in medical sociology and science and technology studies STS we argue that DBS brings to the fore the relational dimensions of personhood and demonstrates the emotional and social turmoil that can result if the relational dimensions of personhood are ignored by clinical services. In light of this we argue that DBS should be implemented within a regime of care. Drawing on ethnographic research of a paediatric DBS clinical service we provide an example of a regime of care and conclude by reflecting on what other DBS services might learn from this paediatric service."
