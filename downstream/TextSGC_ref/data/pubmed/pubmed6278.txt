In an effort to develop quantitative biomarkers for degenerative joint disease and fill the void that exists for diagnosing monitoring and assessing the extent of whole joint degeneration the past decade has been marked by a greatly increased role of noninvasive imaging. This coupled with recent advances in image processing and deep learning opens new possibilities for promising quantitative techniques. The clinical translation of quantitative imaging was previously hampered by tedious non-scalable and subjective image analysis. Osteoarthritis OA diagnosis using X-rays can be automated by the use of deep learning models and pilot studies showed feasibility of using similar techniques to reliably segment multiple musculoskeletal tissues and detect and stage the severity of morphological abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging MRI. Automation and more advanced feature extraction techniques have applications on larger more heterogeneous samples. Analyses based on voxel based relaxometry have shown local patterns in relaxation time elevations and local correlations with outcome variables. Bone cartilage interactions are also enhanced by the analysis of three-dimensional bone morphology and the potential for the assessment of metabolic activity with simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography PET/MR systems. Novel techniques in image processing and deep learning are augmenting imaging to be a source of quantitative and reliable data and new multidimensional analytics allow us to exploit the interactions of data from various sources. In this review we aim to summarize recent advances in quantitative imaging the application of image processing and deep learning techniques to study knee and hip OA. 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
