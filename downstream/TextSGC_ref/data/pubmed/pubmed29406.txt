Brain-machine interface BMI is a new technology to receive input from the brain which is translated to operate a computer or other external device in real time. After significant progress during the recent 10 years this technology is now very close to the clinical use to restore neural functions of patients with severe neurologic impairment. This technology is also a strong tool to investigate the mode of neuro-signal processing in the brain and to understand the mechanism of neural dysfunction which leads to the development of novel neurotechnology for the treatment of various sorts of neurological disorders.
