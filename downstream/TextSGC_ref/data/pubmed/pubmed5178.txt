"MR-guided focused ultrasound MRgFUS can temporarily permeabilize the blood-brain barrier BBB noninvasively to allow therapeutics access to the central nervous system. However its secondary and potential neuromodulation effects are not well understood. We aimed to characterize the functional impact of MRgFUS BBB opening in human subjects based on the phase I trial in patients with Alzheimers disease. We analyzed for changes in bilateral frontoparietal networks in resting state functional MRI from five subjects after BBB opening in the right frontal lobe. We found a transient functional connectivity decrease within only the ipsilateral frontoparietal network that was recovered by the next day. Additionally baseline to month three comparisons did not reveal any significant differences from matched-controls from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Overall MRgFUS may transiently affect neurologic function but the functional organization is restored at one day and remains unchanged at three months. This first in human data has implications for the development of MRgFUS as a drug delivery platform to pathologic brain tissue and potential use for non-invasive neuromodulation."
