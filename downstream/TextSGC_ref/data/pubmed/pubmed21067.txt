"The field of Brain Machine Interfaces BMI has attracted an increased interest due to its multiple applications in the health and entertainment domains. A BMI enables a direct interface between the brain and machines and is capable of translating neuronal information into meaningful actions e.g. Electromyography based control of a prosthetic hand. One of the biggest challenges in developing a surface Electromyography sEMG based interface is the selection of the right muscles for the execution of a desired task. In this work we investigate optimal muscle selections for sEMG based decoding of dexterous in-hand manipulation motions. To do that we use EMG signals derived from 14 muscle sites of interest 7 on the hand and 7 on the forearm and an optical motion capture system that records the object motion. The regression problem is formulated using the Random Forests methodology that is based on decision trees. Regarding features selection we use the following time-domain features: root mean square waveform length and zero crossings. A 5-fold cross validation procedure is used for model assessment purposes and the importance values are calculated for each feature. This pilot study shows that the muscles of the hand contribute more than the muscles of the forearm to the execution of inhand manipulation tasks and that the myoelectric activations of the hand muscles provide better estimation accuracies for the decoding of manipulation motions. These outcomes suggest that the loss of the hand muscles in certain amputations limits the amputees ability to perform a dexterous EMG based control of a prosthesis in manipulation tasks. The results discussed can also be used for improving the efficiency and intuitiveness of EMG based interfaces for healthy subjects."
