Brain region-specific changes have been demonstrated with a variety of cognitive training interventions. The effect of cognitive training on brain subnetworks in humans however remains largely unknown with studies limited to functional networks. Here we used a well-established working memory training program and state-of-the art neuroimaging methods in 40 healthy adults 21 females mean age 26.5 years. Near and far-transfer training effects were assessed using computerized working memory and executive function tasks. Adaptive working memory training led to improvement on nontrained working memory tasks and generalization to tasks of reasoning and inhibition. Graph theoretical analysis of the structural white matter network connectivity "connectome" revealed increased global integration within a frontoparietal attention network following adaptive working memory training compared with the nonadaptive group. Furthermore the impact on the outcome of graph theoretical analyses of different white matter metrics to infer "connection strength" was evaluated. Increased efficiency of the frontoparietal network was best captured when using connection strengths derived from MR metrics that are thought to be more sensitive to differences in myelination putatively indexed by the quantitative longitudinal relaxation rate R1 than previously used diffusion MRI metrics fractional anisotropy or fiber-tracking recovered streamlines. Our findings emphasize the critical role of specific microstructural markers in providing important hints toward the mechanisms underpinning training-induced plasticity that may drive working memory improvement in clinical populations.
