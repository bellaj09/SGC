GPRC5B is a membrane glycoprotein robustly expressed in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells PCs. Its function is unknown. In Gprc5b-/- mice that lack GPRC5B PCs develop distal axonal swellings in deep cerebellar nuclei DCN. Numerous misshapen mitochondria which generated excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species ROS accumulated in these distal axonal swellings. In primary cell cultures of Gprc5b-/- PCs pharmacological reduction of ROS prevented the appearance of such swellings. To examine the physiological role of GPRC5B in PCs we analyzed cerebellar synaptic transmission and cerebellum-dependent motor learning in Gprc5b-/- mice. Patch-clamp recordings in cerebellum slices in vitro revealed that the induction of long-term depression LTD at parallel fiber-PC synapses was normal in adult Gprc5b-/- mice whereas the induction of long-term potentiation LTP at mossy fiber-DCN neuron synapses was attenuated in juvenile Gprc5b-/- mice. In Gprc5b-/- mice long-term motor learning was impaired in both the rotarod test and the horizontal optokinetic response eye movement HOKR test. These observations suggest that GPRC5B plays not only an important role in the development of distal axons of PCs and formation of synapses with DCN neurons but also in the synaptic plasticity that underlies long-term motor learning. Loss of GPRC5B impairs synapse formation of Purkinje cells with cerebellar nuclear neurons and disrupts cerebellar synaptic plasticity and motor learning.
