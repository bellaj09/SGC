The increasing development of computing hardware and software in the last decades has impacted scientific research in many fields including materials science biology chemistry and physics among many others. A new computational system for the accurate and fast simulation and 3D/VR visualization of nanostructures is presented here using the open-source molecular dynamics MD computer program LAMMPS. This alternative computational method uses modern graphics processors NVIDIA CUDA technology and specialized scientific codes to overcome processing speed barriers common to traditional computing methods. In conjunction with a virtual reality system used to model materials this enhancement allows the addition of accelerated MD simulation capability. The motivation is to provide a novel research environment which simultaneously allows visualization simulation modeling and analysis. The research goal is to investigate the structure and properties of inorganic nanostructures e.g. silica glass nanosprings under different conditions using this innovative computational system. The work presented outlines a description of the 3D/VR Visualization System and basic components an overview of important considerations such as the physical environment details on the setup and use of the novel system a general procedure for the accelerated MD enhancement technical information and relevant remarks. The impact of this work is the creation of a unique computational system combining nanoscale materials simulation visualization and interactivity in a virtual environment which is both a research and teaching instrument at UC Merced. Novel 3D/VR interactive environment for MD simulations visualization and analysis.
