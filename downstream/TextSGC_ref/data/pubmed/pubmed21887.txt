A Brain-Computer Interface BCI is a device that transforms brain signals which are intentionally modulated by a user into control commands. BCIs based on motor imagery MI and steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP can partially restore motor control in spinal cord injured patients. To determine whether these BCIs can be combined for grasp and elbow function control independently we investigated a control method where the beta rebound after brisk feet MI is used to control the grasp function and a two-class SSVEP-BCI the elbow function of a 2 degrees-of-freedom artificial upper limb. Subjective preferences for the BCI control were assessed with a questionnaire. The results of the initial evaluation of the system suggests that this is feasible. Combined motor imagery and SSVEP based BCI control of a 2 DoF artificial upper limb.
