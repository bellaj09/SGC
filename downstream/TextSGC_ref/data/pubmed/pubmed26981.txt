The Electroencephalogram EEG can be considered as the output of a nonlinear system whose dynamics is significantly affected by motor tasks. Nevertheless computational approaches derived from the complex system theory has not been fully exploited for characterising motor imagery tasks. To this extent in this study we investigated EEG complexity changes throughout the following categories of imaginary motor tasks of the upper limb: transitive actions involving an object intransitive meaningful gestures that do not include the use of objects and tool-mediated actions using an object to interact with another one. EEG irregularity was quantified following the definition of Fuzzy Entropy which has been demonstrated to be a reliable quantifier of system complexity with low dependence on data length. Experimental results from paired statistical analyses revealed minor topographical changes between EEG complexity associated with transitive and tool-mediated tasks whereas major significant differences were shown between the intransitive actions vs. the others. Our results suggest that EEG complexity level during motor imagery tasks of the upper limb are strongly biased by the presence of an object.
