Recently many studies have been focusing on optimizing the stimulus of an event-related potential ERP-based brain-computer interface BCI. However little is known about the effectiveness when increasing the stimulus unpredictability. We investigated a new stimulus type of varied geometric pattern where both complexity and unpredictability of the stimulus are increased. The proposed and classical paradigms were compared in within-subject experiments with 16 healthy participants. Results showed that the BCI performance was significantly improved for the proposed paradigm with an average online written symbol rate increasing by 138% comparing with that of the classical paradigm. Amplitudes of primary ERP components such as N1 P2a P2b N2 were also found to be significantly enhanced with the proposed paradigm. In this paper a novel ERP BCI paradigm with a new stimulus type of varied geometric pattern is proposed. By jointly increasing the complexity and unpredictability of the stimulus the performance of an ERP BCI could be considerably improved. Performance improvement of ERP-based brain-computer interface via varied geometric patterns.
