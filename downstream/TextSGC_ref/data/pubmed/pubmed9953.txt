Recently fully convolutional network FCN has been successfully used to locate spliced regions in synthesized images. However all the existing FCN-based algorithms use real-valued FCN to process each channel separately. As a consequence they fail to capture the inherent correlation between color channels and the integrity of three channels. So in this paper quaternion fully convolutional network QFCN is proposed to generalize FCN to quaternion domain by replacing real-valued conventional blocks in FCN with quaternion conventional blocks. In addition a new color image splicing localization algorithm is proposed by combining QFCNs and superpixel SP-enhanced pairwise conditional random field CRF. QFCNs consider three different versions QFCN32 QFCN16 and QFCN8 with different up-sampling layers. The SP-enhanced pairwise CRF is used to refine the results of QFCNs. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms including some conventional algorithms and some deep learning-based algorithms.
