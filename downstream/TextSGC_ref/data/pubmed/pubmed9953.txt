"Technological solutions for quantifying Parkinsons disease PD symptoms may provide an objective means to track response to treatment including side effects such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Vision-based systems are advantageous as they do not require physical contact with the body and have minimal instrumentation compared to wearables. We have developed a vision-based system to quantify a change in dyskinesia as reported by patients using 2D videos of clinical assessments during acute levodopa infusions." Automated assessment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia: Evaluating the responsiveness of video-based features.
