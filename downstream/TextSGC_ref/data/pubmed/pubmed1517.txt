Infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 SARS-CoV-2 i.e. Coronavirus-associated disease 2019 COVID-2019 may occasionally lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS requiring in the most severe cases extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO. Yet limited data if any are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for critically ill patients with coronavirus-associated disease 2019: an updated perspective of the European experience.
