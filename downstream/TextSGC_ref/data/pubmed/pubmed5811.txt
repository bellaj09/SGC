The functional connectome reflects a network architecture enabling adaptive behavior that becomes vulnerable in advanced age. The cellular mechanisms that contribute to altered functional connectivity in old age however are not known. Here we used a multiscale imaging approach to link age-related changes in the functional connectome to altered expression of the activity-dependent immediate-early gene Arc as a function of training to multitask on a working memory WM/biconditional association task BAT. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from young and aged rats longitudinally at three different timepoints during cognitive training. After imaging rats performed the WM/BAT and were immediately sacrificed to examine expression levels of Arc during task performance. Aged behaviorally impaired but not young rats had a subnetwork of increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex ACC and dorsal striatum DS that was correlated with the use of a suboptimal response-based strategy during cognitive testing. Moreover while young rats had stable rich-club organization across three scanning sessions the rich-club organization of old rats increased with cognitive training. In a control group of young and aged rats that were longitudinally scanned at similar time intervals but without cognitive training ACC-DS connectivity and rich-club organization did not change between scans in either age group. These findings suggest that aberrant large-scale functional connectivity in aged animals is associated with altered cellular activity patterns within individual brain regions.
