Pressure vessels PV are designed to hold liquids gases or vapors at high pressures in various industries but a ruptured pressure vessel can be incredibly dangerous if cracks are not detected in the early stage. This paper proposes a robust crack identification technique for pressure vessels using genetic algorithm GA-based feature selection and a deep neural network DNN in an acoustic emission AE examination. First hybrid features are extracted from multiple AE sensors that represent diverse symptoms of pressure vessel faults. These features stem from various signal processing domains such as the time domain frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Heterogenous features from various channels ensure a robust feature extraction process but are high-dimensional so may contain irrelevant and redundant features. This can cause a degraded classification performance. Therefore we use GA with a new objective function to select the most discriminant features that are highly effective for the DNN classifier when identifying crack types. The potency of the proposed method GA + DNN is demonstrated using AE data obtained from a self-designed pressure vessel. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective at selecting discriminant features. These features are used as the input of the DNN classifier achieving a 94.67% classification accuracy. Crack Classification of a Pressure Vessel Using Feature Selection and Deep Learning Methods.
