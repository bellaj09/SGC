Deep brain stimulation DBS of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum VC/VS is a novel therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders. Hypomania is a known complication of VC/VS DBS but who is at risk is less understood. Factors such as family history combined with details of DBS programming might quantify that risk. The authors performed an iterative modeling procedure on a VC/VS DBS patient registry to identify key predictors. Hypomania was less common for men and for patients stimulated on the ventral right contact. It was more common with right monopolar stimulation. These findings may help to establish decision rules to reduce complications of VC/VS DBS. Predictors of Hypomania During Ventral Capsule/Ventral Striatum Deep Brain Stimulation.
