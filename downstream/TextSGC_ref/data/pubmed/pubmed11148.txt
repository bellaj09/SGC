Throughout the past decade vehicular networks have attracted a great deal of interest in various fields. The increasing number of vehicles has led to challenges in traffic regulation. Vehicle-type detection is an important research topic that has found various applications in numerous fields. Its main purpose is to extract the different features of vehicles from videos or pictures captured by traffic surveillance so as to identify the types of vehicles and then provide reference information for traffic monitoring and control. In this paper we propose a step-forward vehicle-detection and -classification method using a saliency map and the convolutional neural-network CNN technique. Specifically compressed-sensing CS theory is applied to generate the saliency map to label the vehicles in an image and the CNN scheme is then used to classify them. We applied the concept of the saliency map to search the image for target vehicles: this step is based on the use of the saliency map to minimize redundant areas. CS was used to measure the image of interest and obtain its saliency in the measurement domain. Because the data in the measurement domain are much smaller than those in the pixel domain saliency maps can be generated at a low computation cost and faster speed. Then based on the saliency map we identified the target vehicles and classified them into different types using the CNN. The experimental results show that our method is able to speed up the window-calibrating stages of CNN-based image classification. Moreover our proposed method has better overall performance in vehicle-type detection compared with other methods. It has very broad prospects for practical applications in vehicular networks.
