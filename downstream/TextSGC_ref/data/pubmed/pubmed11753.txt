Low self-referential thoughts are associated with better concentration which leads to deeper encoding and increases learning and subsequent retrieval. There is evidence that being engaged in externally rather than internally focused tasks is related to low neural activity in the default mode network DMN promoting open mind and the deep elaboration of new information. Thus reduced DMN activity should lead to enhanced concentration comprehensive stimulus evaluation including emotional categorization deeper stimulus processing and better long-term retention over one whole week. In this fMRI study we investigated brain activation preceding and during incidental encoding of emotional pictures and on subsequent recognition performance. During fMRI 24 subjects were exposed to 80 pictures of different emotional valence and subsequently asked to complete an online recognition task one week later. Results indicate that neural activity within the medial temporal lobes during encoding predicts subsequent memory performance. Moreover a low activity of the default mode network preceding incidental encoding leads to slightly better recognition performance independent of the emotional perception of a picture. The findings indicate that the suppression of internally-oriented thoughts leads to a more comprehensive and thorough evaluation of a stimulus and its emotional valence. Reduced activation of the DMN prior to stimulus onset is associated with deeper encoding and enhanced consolidation and retrieval performance even one week later. Even small prestimulus lapses of attention influence consolidation and subsequent recognition performance. Prestimulus default mode activity influences depth of processing and recognition in an emotional memory task.
