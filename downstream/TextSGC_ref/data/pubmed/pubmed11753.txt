Since the concept of Deep Learning DL was formally proposed in 2006 it had a major impact on academic research and industry. Nowadays DL provides an unprecedented way to analyze and process data with demonstrated great results in computer vision medical imaging natural language processing etc. In this Minireview we summarize applications of DL in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR spectroscopy and outline a perspective for DL as entirely new approaches that are likely to transform NMR spectroscopy into a much more efficient and powerful technique in chemistry and life science. Review and Prospect: Deep Learning in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
