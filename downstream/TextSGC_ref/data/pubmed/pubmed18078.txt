The present study sought to examine various aspects of body image for persons reporting a previous out-of-body experience OBE. A total of 64 people took part in the study 34 of whom had had an OBE. Participants reporting a previous OBE were found to score significantly higher on measures of body dissatisfaction social physique anxiety and somatoform dissociation and lower on a measure of physical self-presentation. OBE experiments also reported lower levels of body awareness during use of an immersive virtual reality system than nonexperiments. The out-of-body experience and body image: differences between experiments and nonexperiments.
