Multimodal physical exercises already have well-established benefits for the post-stroke population that influence gait functional capacity balance gait cognition and quality of life. This type of intervention can be performed in both real and virtual environments. Considering the characteristics of both environments it is questioned to what extent the combination of interventions in real and virtual environments could result in improvement in post-stroke impairments. A combination of multimodal physical exercises in real and virtual environments for individuals after chronic stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
