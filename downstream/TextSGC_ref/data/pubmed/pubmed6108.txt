Personality is a central high-level psychological concept that defines individual human beings and has been associated with a variety of real-world outcomes e.g. mental health and academic performance. Using 2\u202fh high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI resting state data of 984 primary dataset N\u202f=\u202f801 hold-out dataset N\u202f=\u202f183 participants from the Human Connectome Project HCP we investigated the relationship between personality five-factor model FFM and intrinsic whole-brain functional connectome. We found a pattern of functional brain connectivity "global personality network" related to personality traits. Consistent with the heritability of personality traits the connectivity strength of this global personality network is also heritable more similar between monozygotic twin pairs compared to the dizygotic twin pairs. Validated by both the repeated family-based 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out dataset our intersubject network similarity analysis allowed us to identify participants\ pairs with similar personality profiles. Across all the identified pairs of participants we found a positive correlation between the network similarity and personality similarity supporting our "similar brain similar personality" hypothesis. Furthermore the global personality network can be used to predict the individual subject\s responses in the personality questionnaire on an item level. In sum based on individual brain connectivity pattern we could predict different facets of personality and this prediction is not based on localized regions but rather relies on the individual connectivity pattern in large-scale brain networks. Intersubject similarity of personality is associated with intersubject similarity of brain connectivity patterns.
