Beta-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and experimental design. Although recent approaches using machine-learning techniques such as support vector machine SVM neural networks and K nearest neighbor have achieved good results for beta-turn prediction there is still significant room for improvement. As previous predictors utilized features in a sliding window of 4-20 residues to capture interactions among sequentially neighboring residues such feature engineering may result in incomplete or biased features and neglect interactions among long-range residues. Deep neural networks provide a new opportunity to address these issues. Here we proposed a deep dense inception network DeepDIN for beta-turn prediction which takes advantage of the state-of-the-art deep neural network design of dense networks and inception networks. A test on a recent BT6376 benchmark data set shows that DeepDIN outperformed the previous best tool BetaTPred3 significantly in both the overall prediction accuracy and the nine-type beta-turn classification accuracy. A tool called MUFold-BetaTurn was developed which is the first beta-turn prediction tool utilizing deep neural networks.
