Performing patient-specific pre-operative cochlea CT-based measurements could be helpful to positively affect the outcome of cochlear surgery in terms of intracochlear trauma and loss of residual hearing. Therefore we propose a method to automatically segment and measure the human cochlea in clinical ultra-high-resolution UHR CT images and investigate differences in cochlea size for personalized implant planning. Multi-Scale deep learning framework for cochlea localization segmentation and analysis on clinical ultra-high-resolution CT images.
