We describe the WhiteText project and its progress towards automatically extracting statements of neuroanatomical connectivity from text. We review progress to date on the three main steps of the project: recognition of brain region mentions standardization of brain region mentions to neuroanatomical nomenclature and connectivity statement extraction. We further describe a new version of our manually curated corpus that adds 2111 connectivity statements from 1828 additional abstracts. Cross-validation classification within the new corpus replicates results on our original corpus recalling 67% of connectivity statements at 51% precision. The resulting merged corpus provides 5208 connectivity statements that can be used to seed species-specific connectivity matrices and to better train automated techniques. Finally we present a new web application that allows fast interactive browsing of the over 70000 sentences indexed by the system as a tool for accessing the data and assisting in further curation. Software and data are freely available at http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/WhiteText/. Text mining for neuroanatomy using WhiteText with an updated corpus and a new web application.
