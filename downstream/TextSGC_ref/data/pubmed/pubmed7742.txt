Automatic fruit detection is a very important benefit of harvesting robots. However complicated environment conditions such as illumination variation branch and leaf occlusion as well as tomato overlap have made fruit detection very challenging. In this study an improved tomato detection model called YOLO-Tomato is proposed for dealing with these problems based on YOLOv3. A dense architecture is incorporated into YOLOv3 to facilitate the reuse of features and help to learn a more compact and accurate model. Moreover the model replaces the traditional rectangular bounding box R-Bbox with a circular bounding box C-Bbox for tomato localization. The new bounding boxes can then match the tomatoes more precisely and thus improve the Intersection-over-Union IoU calculation for the Non-Maximum Suppression NMS. They also reduce prediction coordinates. An ablation study demonstrated the efficacy of these modifications. The YOLO-Tomato was compared to several state-of-the-art detection methods and it had the best detection performance. YOLO-Tomato: A Robust Algorithm for Tomato Detection Based on YOLOv3.
