Hybrid brain-computer interfaces BCIs are representing a recent approach to develop practical BCIs. In such a system disabled users are able to use all their remaining functionalities as control possibilities in parallel with the BCI. Sometimes these people have residual activity of their muscles. Therefore in the presented hybrid BCI framework we want to explore the parallel usage of electroencephalographic EEG and electromyographic EMG activity whereby the control abilities of both channels are fused. Results showed that the participants could achieve a good control of their hybrid BCI independently of their level of muscular fatigue. Thereby the multimodal fusion approach of muscular and brain activity yielded better and more stable performance compared to the single conditions. Even in the case of an increasing muscular fatigue a good control moderate and graceful degradation of the performance compared to the non-fatigued case and a smooth handover could be achieved. Therefore such systems allow the users a very reliable hybrid BCI control although they are getting more and more exhausted or fatigued during the day.
