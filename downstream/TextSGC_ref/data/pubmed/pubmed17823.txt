"This comment reflects the authors opinion on the outcomes of the first 100 robot-assisted Whipple procedures. Results were comparable to outcomes of open surgery in high-volume centres. The researchers state that learning curve effects are in fact not acceptable. They intended to avoid these effects by high-volume experience thorough preparation support during surgery and the ability of robotic systems to carry out precise work in laparoscopic settings. Their results are in contrast with the results of the Leopard-2 trial in the Netherlands. In this trial laparoscopic Whipple procedures were associated with higher mortality. Robot surgery may be helpful in complex laparoscopic procedures but it may also support further learning by providing virtual reality training and dual console setups which allow for step-by-step learning. Future developments in big data analysis may enable benchmarking for a variety of parameters on surgical performance. This may provide additional support in avoiding learning curve effects for patients." Learning in the high-tech era: are we getting a grip on the learning curve?
