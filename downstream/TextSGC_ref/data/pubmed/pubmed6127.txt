"Cryptography is not only a science of applying complex mathematics and logic to design strong methods to hide data called as encryption but also to retrieve the original data back called decryption. The purpose of cryptography is to transmit a message between a sender and receiver such that an eavesdropper is unable to comprehend it. To accomplish this not only we need a strong algorithm but a strong key and a strong concept for encryption and decryption process. We have introduced a concept of DNA Deep Learning Cryptography which is defined as a technique of concealing data in terms of DNA sequence and deep learning. In the cryptographic technique each alphabet of a letter is converted into a different combination of the four bases namely; Adenine A Cytosine C Guanine G and Thymine T which make up the human deoxyribonucleic acid DNA. Actual implementations with the DNA dont exceed laboratory level and are expensive. To bring DNA computing on a digital level easy and effective algorithms are proposed in this paper. In proposed work we have introduced firstly a method and its implementation for key generation based on the theory of natural selection using Genetic Algorithm with Needleman-Wunsch NW algorithm and Secondly a method for implementation of encryption and decryption based on DNA computing using biological operations Transcription Translation DNA Sequencing and Deep Learning."
