Human inhibitory control refers to the suppression of behavioral response in real environments such as when driving a car or riding a motorcycle playing a game and operating a machine. The P300 wave is a neural marker of human inhibitory control and it can be used to recognize the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD in human. In addition the P300 neural marker can be considered as a stop command in the brain-computer interface BCI technologies. Therefore the present study of electroencephalography EEG recognizes the mindset of human inhibition by observing the brain dynamics like P300 wave in the frontal lobe supplementary motor area and in the right temporoparietal junction of the brain all of them have been associated with response inhibition. Our work developed a hierarchical classification model to identify the neural activities of human inhibition. To accomplish this goal phase-locking value PLV method was used to select coupled brain regions related to inhibition because this method has demonstrated the best performance of the classification system. The PLVs were used with pattern recognition algorithms to classify a successful-stop versus a failed-stop in left-and right-hand inhibitions. The results demonstrate that quadratic discriminant analysis QDA yielded an average classification accuracy of 94.44%. These findings implicate the neural activities of human inhibition can be utilized as a stop command in BCI technologies as well as to identify the symptoms of ADHD patients in clinical research.
