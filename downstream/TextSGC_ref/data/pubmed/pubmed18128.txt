Global health governance benefits from participants well-versed in the realities of international policy-making. Consequently educational programmes must establish more opportunities for students to engage in global health policy development. This paper examines a unique global health governance and diplomacy practicum programme at the University of Southern California designed for Master of Public Health candidates. Through the programme students act as official non-governmental delegates to the World Health Assembly in Geneva Switzerland through organisational partnerships. Students and collaborating organisations were asked to complete an online post-participation survey examining the perceived quality of the experience. Through the survey students indicated reinforcement of classroom learning continued or heightened interest in global health policy and enthusiasm in recommending the programme to other students. Organisations perceived students to be adequately prepared and indicated their continued desire to work with students in the programme. The data collected suggest that the programme was successful in providing students with a worthwhile experience that developed skills in global health diplomacy and promoted interest and critical thinking concerning international policy-making processes. A discussion of strengths and challenges serves as a blueprint for the creation of future practicum programmes. Into the deep end: incorporating a global health governance and diplomacy experience in graduate public health training.
