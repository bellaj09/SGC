Low dose X-ray computed tomography LDCT is desirable for reduced patient dose. This work develops image reconstruction methods with deep learning DL regularization for LDCT. Our methods are based on unrolling of proximal forward-backward splitting PFBS framework with data-driven image regularization via deep neural networks. In contrast with PFBS-IR that utilizes standard data fidelity updates via iterative reconstruction IR method PFBS-AIR involves preconditioned data fidelity updates that fuse analytical reconstruction AR method and IR in a synergistic way i.e. fused analytical and iterative reconstruction AIR. The results suggest that DL-regularized methods PFBS-IR and PFBSAIR provided better reconstruction quality from conventional wisdoms AR or IR. In addition owing to AIR PFBS-AIR noticeably outperformed PFBS-IR and another DL-based postprocessing method FBPConvNet.
