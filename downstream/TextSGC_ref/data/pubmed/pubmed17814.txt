"Using an immersive virtual reality system we measured the ability of observers to detect the rotation of an object when its movement was yoked to the observers own translation. Most subjects had a large bias such that a static object appeared to rotate away from them as they moved. Thresholds for detecting target rotation were similar to those for an equivalent speed discrimination task carried out by static observers suggesting that visual discrimination is the predominant limiting factor in detecting target rotation. Adding a stable visual reference frame almost eliminated the bias. Varying the viewing distance of the target had little effect consistent with observers underestimating distance walked. However accuracy of walking to a briefly presented visual target was high and not consistent with an underestimation of distance walked. We discuss implications for theories of a task-independent representation of visual space." Systematic distortions of perceptual stability investigated using immersive virtual reality.
