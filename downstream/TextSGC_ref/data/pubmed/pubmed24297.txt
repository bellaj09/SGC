The objective of the study was to determine whether the metrics from a left-sided laparoscopic colectomy LC simulator could distinguish between the objectively scored performance of minimally invasive colorectal expert and novice surgeons. We report our results from the first virtual reality-based laparoscopic colorectal training course for experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Construct validation of a novel hybrid virtual-reality simulator for training and assessing laparoscopic colectomy; results from the first course for experienced senior laparoscopic surgeons.
