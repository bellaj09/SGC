We demonstrate a simple and effective automated method for the localization of glomeruli in large ~1 gigapixel histopathological whole-slide images WSIs of thin renal tissue sections and biopsies using an adaptation of the well-known local binary patterns LBP image feature vector to train a support vector machine SVM model. Our method offers high precision >90% and reasonable recall >70% for glomeruli from WSIs is readily adaptable to glomeruli from multiple species including mouse rat and human and is robust to diverse slide staining methods. Using 5 IntelR CoreTM i7-4790 CPUs with 40 GB RAM our method typically requires ~15\u2009sec for training and ~2\u2009min to extract glomeruli reproducibly from a WSI. Deploying a deep convolutional neural network trained for glomerular recognition in tandem with the SVM suffices to reduce false positives to below 3%. We also apply our LBP-based descriptor to successfully detect pathologic changes in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy. We envision potential clinical and laboratory applications for this approach in the study and diagnosis of glomerular disease and as a means of greatly accelerating the construction of feature sets to fuel deep learning studies into tissue structure and pathology.
