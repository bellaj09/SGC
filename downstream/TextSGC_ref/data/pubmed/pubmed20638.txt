The inability to render realistic soft-tissue behavior in real time has remained a barrier to face and content aspects of validity for many virtual reality surgical training systems. Biophysically based models are not only suitable for training purposes but also for patient-specific clinical applications physiological modeling and surgical planning. When considering the existing approaches for modeling soft tissue for virtual reality surgical simulation the computer graphics-based approach lacks predictive capability; the mass-spring model MSM based approach lacks biophysically realistic soft-tissue dynamic behavior; and the finite element method FEM approaches fail to meet the real-time requirement. The present development stems from physics fundamental thermodynamic first law; for a space discrete dynamic system directly formulates the space discrete but time continuous governing equation with embedded material constitutive relation and results in a discrete mechanics framework which possesses a unique balance between the computational efforts and the physically realistic soft-tissue dynamic behavior. We describe the development of the discrete mechanics framework with focused attention towards a virtual laparoscopic nephrectomy application. A discrete mechanics framework for real time virtual surgical simulations with application to virtual laparoscopic nephrectomy.
