The control of movement timing has been a significant challenge for brain-machine interfaces BMIs. As a first step toward developing a timing-based BMI we aimed to decode movement timing and target locations in a visually guided saccadic eye movement task using the activity of neurons in the primate frontal eye field FEF and supplementary eye field SEF. Decoding the timing and target locations of saccadic eye movements from neuronal activity in macaque oculomotor areas.
