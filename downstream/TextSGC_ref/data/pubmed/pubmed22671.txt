Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs translate neuronal information into commands to control external software or hardware which can improve the quality of life for both healthy and disabled individuals. Here a multi-modal BCI which combines motor imagery MI and steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP is proposed to achieve stable control of a quadcopter in three-dimensional physical space. The complete information common spatial pattern CICSP method is used to extract two MI features to control the quadcopter to fly left-forward and right-forward and canonical correlation analysis CCA is employed to perform the SSVEP classification for rise and fall. Eye blinking is designed to switch these two modes while hovering. Real-time feedback is provided to subjects by a global camera. Two flight tasks were conducted in physical space in order to certify the reliability of the BCI system. Subjects were asked to control the quadcopter to fly forward along the zig-zag pattern to pass through a gate in the relatively simple task. For the other complex task the quadcopter was controlled to pass through two gates successively according to an S-shaped route. The performance of the BCI system is quantified using suitable metrics and subjects are able to acquire 86.5% accuracy for the complicated flight task. It is demonstrated that the multi-modal BCI has the ability to increase the accuracy rate reduce the task burden and improve the performance of the BCI system in the real world.
