Research has documented the usefulness of virtual reality VR in treating a number of psychopathologies. Despite its recognized clinical utility VR remains underutilized in clinical practice. For the purpose of this study 262 therapists who reported that they did not currently use VR in psychotherapy were surveyed about their perceptions of the use of this technology in clinical practice. Results suggest that reluctance in using this technology stems from beliefs about the required training equipment and financial costs and from unfamiliarity with the various benefits and applications of VR. The significance of promoting greater use of this new technology is discussed. Perceptions of virtual reality among therapists who do not apply this technology in clinical practice.
