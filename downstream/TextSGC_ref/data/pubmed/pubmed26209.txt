The consequences of alcohol dependence syndrome are severe ranging from physical diseases to neuropsychological deficits in several cognitive domains. Alcohol abuse has also been related to brain dysfunction specifically in the prefrontal cortex. We assessed these deficits and the effects of traditional pen-and-paper and novel mobile technology approaches to cognitive stimulation of alcoholics in a neuropsychological intervention program. Thirty alcoholics in treatment of alcohol dependence syndrome were assessed during four weeks on a three-day/week basis. The results showed an overall increase in frontal lobe function between the first and the final assessment being more pronounced in alcoholics who were assigned to a treatment group with mobile technologies than to those assigned to a paper-and-pencil treatment and to a control group. These results support the use of ecologically sound and available approaches of neuropsychological stimulation to treat executive dysfunction in patients with alcohol dependence syndrome.
