The electrocardiogram ECG is a non-invasive inexpensive and effective tool for myocardial infarction MI diagnosis. Conventional detection algorithms require solid domain expertise and rely heavily on handcrafted features. Although previous works have studied deep learning methods for extracting features these methods still neglect the relationships between different leads and the temporal characteristics of ECG signals. To handle the issues a novel multi-lead attention MLA mechanism integrated with convolutional neural network CNN and bidirectional gated recurrent unit BiGRU framework MLA-CNN-BiGRU is therefore proposed to detect and locate MI via 12-lead ECG records. Specifically the MLA mechanism automatically measures and assigns the weights to different leads according to their contribution. The two-dimensional CNN module exploits the interrelated characteristics between leads and extracts discriminative spatial features. Moreover the BiGRU module extracts essential temporal features inside each lead. The spatial and temporal features from these two modules are fused together as global features for classification. In experiments MI location and detection were performed under both intra-patient scheme and inter-patient scheme to test the robustness of the proposed framework. Experimental results indicate that our intelligent framework achieved satisfactory performance and demonstrated vital clinical significance.
