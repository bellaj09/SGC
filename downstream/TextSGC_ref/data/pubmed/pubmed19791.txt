Enhancing the ability to perform differential diagnosis and psychopathological exploration is important for students who wish to work in the clinical field as well as for professionals already working in this area. Virtual reality VR simulations can immerse students totally in educational experiences in a way that is not possible using other methods. Learning in a VR environment can also be more effective and motivating than usual classroom practices. Traditionally immersion has been considered central to the quality of a VR system; immersive VR is considered a special and unique experience that cannot achieved by three-dimensional 3D interactions on desktop PCs. However some authors have suggested that if the content design is emotionally engaging immersive systems are not always necessary. The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and usability of two low-cost VR systems offering different levels of immersion in order to develop the ability to perform diagnostic interviews in eating disorders by means of simulations of psychopathological explorations.
