A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry precision medicine and pharmacogenomics serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches such as deep learning and neural network algorithms together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction prognosis prediction diagnosis prediction and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.
