"Proprioception-the sense of the bodys position in space-is important to natural movement planning and execution and will likewise be necessary for successful motor prostheses and brain-machine interfaces BMIs. Here we demonstrate that monkeys were able to learn to use an initially unfamiliar multichannel intracortical microstimulation signal which provided continuous information about hand position relative to an unseen target to complete accurate reaches. Furthermore monkeys combined this artificial signal with vision to form an optimal minimum-variance estimate of relative hand position. These results demonstrate that a learning-based approach can be used to provide a rich artificial sensory feedback signal suggesting a new strategy for restoring proprioception to patients using BMIs as well as a powerful new tool for studying the adaptive mechanisms of sensory integration." A learning-based approach to artificial sensory feedback leads to optimal integration.
