Despite myriads of studies on a parallel organization of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loops direct evidence of this has been lacking for the healthy human brain. Here we scrutinize the functional specificity of the cortico-subcortical loops depending on varying levels of cognitive hierarchy as well as their structural connectivity with high-resolution fMRI and diffusion-weighted MRI dMRI at 7 tesla. Three levels of cognitive hierarchy were implemented in two domains: second language and nonlanguage. In fMRI for the higher level activations were found in the ventroanterior portion of the prefrontal cortex PFC the head of the caudate nucleus CN and the ventral anterior nucleus VA in the thalamus. Conversely for the lower level activations were located in the posterior region of the PFC the body of the CN and the medial dorsal nucleus MD in the thalamus. This gradient pattern of activations was furthermore shown to be tenable by the parallel connectivity in dMRI tractography connecting the anterior regions of the PFC with the head of the CN and the VA in the thalamus whereas the posterior activations of the PFC were linked to the body of the CN and the MD in the thalamus. This is the first human in vivo study combining fMRI and dMRI showing that the functional specificity is mirrored within the cortico-subcortical loop substantiated by parallel networks. Functional network mirrored in the prefrontal cortex caudate nucleus and thalamus: high-resolution functional imaging and structural connectivity.
