There is good evidence for effective transfer of learning from virtual to real-world environments and this holds true even for complex spatial tasks such as route learning. However there is little research into the simple equivalence of an individual\s performance across real and virtual environments an important topic which could support the use of virtual reality as an assessment and research tool. This pilot study compared route-learning performance in a desktop virtual town with performance around a real-world route. Participants were "driven" around a route through a virtual town and around a different but equally complex route through a real-world suburb then asked to direct the driver back around each of the routes from memory. They completed strategy checklists after learning each route. Results indicated good equivalence between the real and virtual environments with comparable error rates and no differences in strategy preferences. This demonstrates that simple desktop virtual environments may be a useful tool for assessment of and research into route learning.
