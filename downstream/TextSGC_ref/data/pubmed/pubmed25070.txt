Error-related potentials ErrPs have the potential to guide classifier adaptation in BCI spellers for addressing non-stationary performance as well as for online optimization of system parameters by providing imperfect or partial labels. However the usefulness of ErrP-based labels for BCI adaptation has not been established in comparison to other partially supervised methods. Our objective is to make this comparison by retraining a two-step P300 speller on a subset of confident online trials using nave labels taken from speller output where confidence is determined either by i ErrP scores ii posterior target scores derived from the P300 potential or iii a hybrid of these scores. We further wish to evaluate the ability of partially supervised adaptation and retraining methods to adjust to a new stimulus-onset asynchrony SOA a necessary step towards online SOA optimization. Partially supervised P300 speller adaptation for eventual stimulus timing optimization: target confidence is superior to error-related potential score as an uncertain label.
