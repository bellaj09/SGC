Even as medical data sets become more publicly accessible most are restricted to specific medical conditions. Thus data collection for machine learning approaches remains challenging and synthetic data augmentation such as generative adversarial networks GAN may overcome this hurdle. In the present quality control study deep convolutional GAN DCGAN-based human brain magnetic resonance MR images were validated by blinded radiologists. In total 96 T1-weighted brain images from 30 healthy individuals and 33 patients with cerebrovascular accident were included. A training data set was generated from the T1-weighted images and DCGAN was applied to generate additional artificial brain images. The likelihood that images were DCGAN-created versus acquired was evaluated by 5 radiologists 2 neuroradiologists NRs vs 3 non-neuroradiologists NNRs in a binary fashion to identify real vs created images. Images were selected randomly from the data set variation of created images 40%-60%. None of the investigated images was rated as unknown. Of the created images the NRs rated 45% and 71% as real magnetic resonance imaging images NNRs 24% 40% and 44%. In contradistinction 44% and 70% of the real images were rated as generated images by NRs NNRs 10% 17% and 27%. The accuracy for the NRs was 0.55 and 0.30 NNRs 0.83 0.72 and 0.64. DCGAN-created brain MR images are similar enough to acquired MR images so as to be indistinguishable in some cases. Such an artificial intelligence algorithm may contribute to synthetic data augmentation for "data-hungry" technologies such as supervised machine learning approaches in various clinical applications.
