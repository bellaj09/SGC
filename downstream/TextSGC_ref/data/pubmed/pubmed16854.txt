Students take three approaches to learning and studying: deep surface and strategic influenced by the learning environment. Following the General Medical Council\s report "Tomorrow\s Doctors" a deep approach was cultivated in Years 1 and 2 of a university undergraduate medical programme by introducing explicit written learning objectives constructed according to Biggs\ SOLO taxonomy problem-based learning and constructively aligned in-course assignments and examinations. The effect of these changes was measured with the Approaches to Study Skills Inventory for Students ASSIST. Scores were highest for a deep approach and lowest for a surface approach and showed relatively little change during the degree programme apart from a slight fall in the scores for a surface approach particularly for students undertaking an intercalated science degree. Possible explanations include: students\ approaches may be established prior to university entry; deep scores were already high at the beginning of the programme and may be difficult to increase further; the changes in learning environment may not be strong enough to alter approaches which students perceive as having been successful.
