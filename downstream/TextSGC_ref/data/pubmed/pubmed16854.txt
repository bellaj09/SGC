"Force haptic reappearance technology is considered to be one of the top ten technologies that can change human life in the future. It has broad application prospects and market demand. Most of the existing medical robots especially the remote diagnosis and treatment robots lack haptic feedback or the calculation of feedback force is insufficient. Haptic reappearance technology is an effective method to solve the problem of haptic presence and improve the practicability of medical robot. The ultimate goal of the force haptic reappearance system is to let the operator feel the haptic feedback when interacting with the soft tissue model in the virtual environment in real time. Haptic device is the necessary condition to realize force haptic reappearance and it is an essential part of the system. Its important role is to introduce the external force imposed by the operator into the virtual environment and let the operator feel the force in the virtual environment which effectively guarantees the operators sense of reality and immersion when interacting with the virtual environment. Therefore starting with the key technology of force and haptic reappearance system this paper studies the construction of force and haptic reappearance system. Soft tissue surface model is drawn by OpenGL and hand model is drawn by 3Ds Max. The haptic reappearance and visual feedback of soft tissue model of hand palpation are realized. The quality of feedback is evaluated. The haptic reappearance is stable and realistic and the visual feedback is smooth. This indicates that the system has a certain application value and is worth to promote to the public." Construction of force haptic reappearance system based on Geomagic Touch haptic device.
