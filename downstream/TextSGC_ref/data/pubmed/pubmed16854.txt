This paper presents a novel immersive system called MR360 that provides interactive mixed reality MR experiences using a conventional low dynamic range LDR 360 panoramic video 360-video shown in head mounted displays HMDs. MR360 seamlessly composites 3D virtual objects into a live 360-video using the input panoramic video as the lighting source to illuminate the virtual objects. Image based lighting IBL is perceptually optimized to provide fast and believable results using the LDR 360-video as the lighting source. Regions of most salient lights in the input panoramic video are detected to optimize the number of lights used to cast perceptible shadows. Then the areas of the detected lights adjust the penumbra of the shadow to provide realistic soft shadows. Finally our real-time differential rendering synthesizes illumination of the virtual 3D objects into the 360-video. MR360 provides the illusion of interacting with objects in a video which are actually 3D virtual objects seamlessly composited into the background of the 360-video. MR360 was implemented in a commercial game engine and tested using various 360-videos. Since our MR360 pipeline does not require any pre-computation it can synthesize an interactive MR scene using a live 360-video stream while providing realistic high performance rendering suitable for HMDs.
