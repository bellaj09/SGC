Maintaining employment is difficult for patients with schizophrenia because of deterioration of psychosocial and cognitive functions. Such patients usually require vocational rehabilitation training which is both demanding and costly. In this study we developed a virtual reality-based vocational rehabilitation training program VR-VRTP for such patients and evaluated its feasibility as an alternative to traditional rehabilitation programs. We developed the VR-VRTP to include various situations commonly encountered in two types of occupations: convenience store employee and supermarket clerk. We developed practical situations as well as a system for providing feedback to ensure patients would not lose interest during training. Nine participants each performed the VR-VRTP repeatedly per week for a total of 8 weeks. At baseline and after training all participants were evaluated using the following clinical and neuropsychological tests: Manchester Scale Clinical Global Impression Personal and Social Performance Scale PSP Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Zung Depression Rating Scale Beck Anxiety Inventory Wisconsin Card Sorting Test Stroop Test Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test RCFT and Auditory Verbal Learning Test AVLT. After training patient scores improved on the PSP general symptoms on the Manchester Scale AVLT and delayed recall on the RCFT. The Manchester positive symptom score showed a trend of improvement. No significant changes were observed for other measures. The VR-VRTP may improve general psychosocial function and memory potentially influencing real-world vocational performance. These findings provide preliminary evidence regarding the utility of the VR-VRTP in patients with schizophrenia.
