Deep learning has made tremendous successes in numerous artificial intelligence applications and is unsurprisingly penetrating into various biomedical domains. High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices such as transcriptomes and metabolomes have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Architectures and accuracy of artificial neural network for disease classification from omics data.
