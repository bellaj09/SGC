Wireless networks have been widely deployed with a high demand for wireless data traffic. The ubiquitous availability of wireless signals brings new opportunities for non-intrusive human activity sensing. To enhance a thorough understanding of existing wireless sensing techniques and provide insights for future directions this survey conducts a review of the existing research on human activity sensing with wireless signals. We review and compare existing research of wireless human activity sensing from seven perspectives including the types of wireless signals theoretical models signal preprocessing techniques activity segmentation feature extraction classification and application. With the development and deployment of new wireless technology there will be more sensing opportunities in human activities. Based on the analysis of existing research the survey points out seven challenges on wireless human activity sensing research: robustness non-coexistence of sensing and communications privacy multiple user activity sensing limited sensing range complex deep learning and lack of standard datasets. Finally this survey presents four possible future research trends including new theoretical models the coexistence of sensing and communications awareness of sensing on receivers and constructing open datasets to enable new wireless sensing opportunities on human activities.
