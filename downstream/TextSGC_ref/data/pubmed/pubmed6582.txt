In the Cultural Heritage CH context art galleries and museums employ technology devices to enhance and personalise the museum visit experience. However the most challenging aspect is to determine what the visitor is interested in. In this work a novel Visual Attentive Model VAM has been proposed that is learned from eye tracking data. In particular eye-tracking data of adults and children observing five paintings with similar characteristics have been collected. The images are selected by CH experts and are-the three "Ideal Cities" Urbino Baltimore and Berlin the Inlaid chest in the National Gallery of Marche and Wooden panel in the "Studiolo del Duca" with Marche view. These pictures have been recognized by experts as having analogous features thus providing coherent visual stimuli. Our proposed method combines a new coordinates representation from eye sequences by using Geometric Algebra with a deep learning model for automated recognition to identify differentiate or authenticate individuals of people by the attention focus of distinctive eye movement patterns. The experiments were conducted by comparing five Deep Convolutional Neural Networks DCNNs yield high accuracy more than 80 % demonstrating the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach in identifying adults and children as museums\ visitors.
