In the paper a research on enhanced experience of virtual reality supported balance training is presented. Haptic floor mounted on the dynamic standing frame was used as a biofeedback at collisions in virtual environment. Electromyographic muscle activity of soleus gastrocnemius tibialis anterior semimembranosus rectus femoris tensor fasciae latae and erector spinae at the time of onset and recovery of postural perturbation were monitored using surface electrodes. 12 neurologically intact young adults participated in the research study. The main goal was to identify the differences in postural response strategies at collisions in the virtual world w/o haptic feedback. We found more dynamic responses in all subjects when applying haptic floor especially in the ankle complex stabilizing the tibia at the onset of perturbation. Choosing different strategies using the haptic floor may significantly enhance the telerehabilitation experience and thus increase the effectivness of the tele-balance training. Besides telerehabilitation such system may be also effective for postural reponse assessment and thus simplified telediagnostics. However the findings call for further study to support the proposed proof of concept. Changes in EMG latencies during balance therapy using enhanced virtual reality with haptic floor.
