There are more than 30 distinct types of mammalian retinal ganglion cells each sensitive to different features of the visual environment. In rabbit retina they can be grouped into four classes according to their morphology and stratification of their dendrites in the inner plexiform layer IPL. The goal of this study was to describe the synaptic inputs to one type of Class IV ganglion cell the third member of the sparsely branched Class IV cells SB3. One cell of this type was partially reconstructed in a retinal connectome developed using automated transmission electron microscopy ATEM. It had slender relatively straight dendrites that ramify in the sublamina a of the IPL. The dendrites of the SB3 cell were always postsynaptic in the IPL supporting its identity as a ganglion cell. It received 29% of its input from bipolar cells a value in the middle of the range for rabbit retinal ganglion cells studied previously. The SB3 cell typically received only one synapse per bipolar cell from multiple types of presumed OFF bipolar cells; reciprocal synapses from amacrine cells at the dyad synapses were infrequent. In a few instances the bipolar cells presynaptic to the SB3 ganglion cell also provided input to an amacrine cell presynaptic to the ganglion cell. There was apparently no crossover inhibition from narrow-field ON amacrine cells. Most of the amacrine cell inputs were from axons and dendrites of GABAergic amacrine cells likely providing inhibitory input from outside the classical receptive field.
