Ultrasound US is the most commonly used radiologic modality to identify and characterize thyroid nodules. Many nodules subsequently undergo fine needle aspiration to further characterize the nodule and determine appropriate treatment. The fine needle aspirate is most commonly classified using the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytology TBSRTC. It can sometimes be difficult to differentiate Bethesda class III lesions atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance from Bethesda class IV V and VI malignant nodules. However differentiation is important as clinical management differs between the two groups. The purpose of this study was to introduce machine learning methods to help radiologists differentiate Bethesda class III from Bethesda class VI V and VI lesions. Deep neural networks could differentiate Bethesda class III versus class IV/V/VI.
