"The visualization of medical images obtained from scanning techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is a well-researched field. However advanced tools and methods to manipulate these data for surgical planning and other tasks have not seen widespread use among medical professionals. Radiologists have begun using more advanced visualization packages on desktop computer systems but most physicians continue to work with basic two-dimensional grayscale images or not work directly with the data at all. In addition new display technologies that are in use in other fields have yet to be fully applied in medicine. It is our estimation that usability is the key aspect in keeping this new technology from being more widely used by the medical community at large. Therefore we have a software and hardware framework that not only make use of advanced visualization techniques but also feature powerful yet simple-to-use interfaces. A virtual reality system was created to display volume-rendered medical models in three dimensions. It was designed to run in many configurations from a large cluster of machines powering a multiwalled display down to a single desktop computer. An augmented reality system was also created for literally hands-on interaction when viewing models of medical data. Last a desktop application was designed to provide a simple visualization tool which can be run on nearly any computer at a users disposal. This research is directed toward improving the capabilities of medical professionals in the tasks of preoperative planning surgical training diagnostic assistance and patient education."
