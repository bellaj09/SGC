A fundamental issue in EEG event-related potentials ERPs studies is the amount of data required to have an accurate ERP model. This also impacts the time required to train a classifier for a brain-computer interface BCI. This issue is mainly due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the large fluctuations of the EEG caused by several sources of variability. One of these sources is directly related to the experimental protocol or application designed and may affect the amplitude or latency of ERPs. This usually prevents BCI classifiers from generalizing among different experimental protocols. In this paper we analyze the effect of the amplitude and the latency variations among different experimental protocols based on the same type of ERP. Latency correction of event-related potentials between different experimental protocols.
