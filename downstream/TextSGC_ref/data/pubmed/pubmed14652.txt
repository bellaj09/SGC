In clinical ophthalmology a variety of image-related diagnostic techniques have begun to offer unprecedented insights into eye diseases based on morphological datasets with millions of data points. Artificial intelligence AI inspired by the human multilayered neuronal system has shown astonishing success within some visual and auditory recognition tasks. In these tasks AI can analyze digital data in a comprehensive rapid and non-invasive manner. Bioinformatics has become a focus particularly in the field of medical imaging where it is driven by enhanced computing power and cloud storage as well as utilization of novel algorithms and generation of data in massive quantities. Machine learning ML is an important branch in the field of AI. The overall potential of ML to automatically pinpoint identify and grade pathological features in ocular diseases will empower ophthalmologists to provide high-quality diagnosis and facilitate personalized health care in the near future. This review offers perspectives on the origin development and applications of ML technology particularly regarding its applications in ophthalmic imaging modalities.
