"Depression is common in patients with Parkinsons disease PD which can make all the other symptoms of PD much worse. It is thus urgent to differentiate depressed PD DPD patients from non-depressed PD NDPD.The purpose of the present study was to characterize alterations in directional brain connectivity unique to Parkinsons disease with depression using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI.Sixteen DPD patients 20 NDPD patients 17 patients with major depressive disorder MDD and 21 healthy control subjects normal controls NC underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI scanning. Voxel-based morphometry and directional brain connectivity during resting-state were analyzed. Analysis of variance ANOVA and 2-sample t tests were used to compare each pair of groups using sex age education level structural atrophy and/or HAMD unified PD rating scale UPDRS as covariates.In contrast to NC DPD showed significant gray matter GM volume abnormalities in some mid-line limbic regions including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and sub-cortical regions including caudate and cerebellum. Relative to NC and MDD both DPD and NDPD showed significantly increased directional connectivity from bilateral anterior insula and posterior orbitofrontal cortices to left inferior temporal cortex. As compared with NC MDD and NDPD alterations of directional connectivity in DPD were specifically observed in the pathway from bilateral anterior insula and posterior orbitofrontal cortices to right basal ganglia.Resting state directional connectivity alterations were observed between emotion network and motor network in DPD patients after controlling for age sex structural atrophy. Given that these alterations are unique to DPD it may provide a potential differential biomarker for distinguishing DPD from NC NDPD and MDD."
