Distributed neural interfaces made of many mm-sized implantable medical devices IMDs are poised to play a key role in future brain-computer interfaces because of less damage to the surrounding tissue. Evaluating them wirelessly at preclinical stage e.g. in a rodent model however is a major challenge due to weak coupling and significant losses resulting in limited power delivery to the IMD within a nominal experimental arena like a homecage without surpassing the specific absorption rate limit. To address this problem we present a dual-band EnerCage system with two multi-coil inductive links which first deliver power at 13.56 MHz from the EnerCage 46  24  20 cm3 to a headstage 18  18  15 mm3 4.8 g that is carried by the animal via a 4-coil inductive link. Then a 60 MHz 3-coil inductive link from the headstage powers up the small IMD 2.5  2.5  1.5 mm3 15 mg which in this case is a free floating wirelessly powered implantable optical stimulator FF-WIOS. The power transfer efficiency and power delivered to the load PDL from EnerCage to the headstage at 7 cm height were 14.9%-22.7% and 122 mW; and from headstage to FF-WIOS at 5 mm depth were 18% and 2.7 mW respectively. Bidirectional data connectivity between EnerCage-headstage was established via bluetooth low energy. Between headstage and FF-WIOS on-off keying and load-shift-keying were used for downlink and uplink data respectively. Moreover a closed-loop power controller stabilized PDL to both the headstage and the FF-WIOS against misalignments. A Dual-Band Wireless Power Transmission System for Evaluating mm-Sized Implants.
