This paper presents the results of two cognitive load studies comparing three augmented reality display technologies: spatial augmented reality the optical see-through Microsoft HoloLens and the video see-through Samsung Gear VR. In particular the two experiments focused on isolating the cognitive load cost of receiving instructions for a button-pressing procedural task. The studies employed a self-assessment cognitive load methodology as well as an additional dual-task cognitive load methodology. The results showed that spatial augmented reality led to increased performance and reduced cognitive load. Additionally it was discovered that a limited field of view can introduce increased cognitive load requirements. The findings suggest that some of the inherent restrictions of head-mounted displays materialize as increased user cognitive load. Cognitive Cost of Using Augmented Reality Displays.
