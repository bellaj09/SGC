"Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness and is characterized by hallucinations and delusions as well as social skills deficits. Generally social skills training designed to help patients develop social skills includes role-playing but this form of training has typical shortcomings which are largely due to a trainers difficulties to project emotion. Virtual reality VR-based techniques have the potential to solve these difficulties because they provide a computer-generated but realistic three-dimensional world and humanlike avatars that can provide emotional stimuli. In this paper we report on a method of implementing virtual environments VEs in order to train people with schizophrenia to develop conversational skills in specific situations which could overcome the shortcomings of or complement conventional role-playing techniques. The paper reports the efficacy of the proposed approach in a preliminary clinical trial with 10 patients with schizophrenia."
