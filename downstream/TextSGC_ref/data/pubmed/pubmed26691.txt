Detecting the shift of covert visuospatial attention CVSA is vital for gaze-independent brain-computer interfaces BCIs which might be the only communication approach for severely disabled patients who cannot move their eyes. Although previous studies had demonstrated that it is feasible to use CVSA-related electroencephalography EEG features to control a BCI system the communication speed remains very low. This study aims to improve the speed and accuracy of CVSA detection by fusing EEG features of N2pc and steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP. Fast detection of covert visuospatial attention using hybrid N2pc and SSVEP features.
