In this study we evaluated electrooculography EOG an eye tracker and an auditory brain-computer interface BCI as access methods to augmentative and alternative communication AAC. The participant of the study has been in the locked-in state LIS for 6\xa0years due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was able to communicate with slow residual eye movements but had no means of partner independent communication. We discuss the usability of all tested access methods and the prospects of using BCIs as an assistive technology. Comparison of eye tracking electrooculography and an auditory brain-computer interface for binary communication: a case study with a participant in the locked-in state.
