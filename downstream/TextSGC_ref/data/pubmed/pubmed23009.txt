"Motor imagery MI a covert cognitive process where an action is mentally simulated but not actually performed could be used as an effective neurorehabilitation tool for motor function improvement or recovery. Recent approaches employing brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces to provide online feedback of the MI during rehabilitation training have promising rehabilitation outcomes. In this study we examined whether participants could volitionally recall MI-related brain activation patterns when guided using neurofeedback NF during training. The participants performance was compared to that without NF. We hypothesized that participants would be able to consistently generate the relevant activation pattern associated with the MI task during training with NF compared to that without NF. To assess activation consistency we used the performance of classifiers trained to discriminate MI-related brain activation patterns. Our results showed significantly higher predictive values of MI-related activation patterns during training with NF. Additionally this improvement in the classification performance tends to be associated with the activation of middle temporal gyrus/inferior occipital gyrus a region associated with visual motion processing suggesting the importance of performance monitoring during MI task training. Taken together these findings suggest that the efficacy of MI training in terms of generating consistent brain activation patterns relevant to the task can be enhanced by using NF as a mechanism to enable participants to volitionally recall task-related brain activation patterns."
