Preprocessing of Raman spectra is generally done in three separate steps: 1 cosmic ray removal 2 signal smoothing and 3 baseline subtraction. We show that a convolutional neural network CNN can be trained using simulated data to handle all steps in one operation. First synthetic spectra are created by randomly adding peaks baseline mixing of peaks and baseline with background noise and cosmic rays. Second a CNN is trained on synthetic spectra and known peaks. The results from preprocessing were generally of higher quality than what was achieved using a reference based on standardized methods second-difference asymmetric least squares cross-validation. From 105 simulated observations 91.4% predictions had smaller absolute error RMSE 90.3% had improved quality SSIM and 94.5% had reduced signal-to-noise SNR power. The CNN preprocessing generated reliable results on measured Raman spectra from polyethylene paraffin and ethanol with background contamination from polystyrene. The result shows a promising proof of concept for the automated preprocessing of Raman spectra. Single-Step Preprocessing of Raman Spectra Using Convolutional Neural Networks.
