"Recent studies have supported the relation between mitochondrial functions and degenerative disorders related to ageing such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. Since these studies have exposed the need for detailed and high-resolution analysis of physical alterations in mitochondria it is necessary to be able to perform segmentation and 3D reconstruction of mitochondria. However due to the variety of mitochondrial structures automated mitochondria segmentation and reconstruction in electron microscopy EM images have proven to be a difficult and challenging task. This paper puts forward an effective and automated pipeline based on deep learning to realize mitochondria segmentation in different EM images. The proposed pipeline consists of three parts: 1 utilizing image registration and histogram equalization as image pre-processing steps to maintain the consistency of the dataset; 2 proposing an effective approach for 3D mitochondria segmentation based on a volumetric residual convolutional and deeply supervised network; and 3 employing a 3D connection method to obtain the relationship of mitochondria and displaying the 3D reconstruction results. To our knowledge we are the first researchers to utilize a 3D fully residual convolutional network with a deeply supervised strategy to improve the accuracy of mitochondria segmentation. The experimental results on anisotropic and isotropic EM volumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the Jaccard index of our segmentation 91.8% in anisotropy 90.0% in isotropy and F1 score of detection 92.2% in anisotropy 90.9% in isotropy suggest that our approach achieved state-of-the-art results. Our fully automated pipeline contributes to the development of neuroscience by providing neurologists with a rapid approach for obtaining rich mitochondria statistics and helping them elucidate the mechanism and function of mitochondria."
