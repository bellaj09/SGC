Automatic femur segmentation from computed tomography volume is a crucial but challenging task for computer-aided diagnosis in orthopedic surgeries. The main obstacles are weak bone boundaries narrowness of joint space variations in femur density and shape as well as diverse leg postures. In this paper we presented a novel 3-D feature-enhanced network to address these challenges. The novelty of our approach lies in two feature enhancement modules including the edge detection task and the multi-scale features fusion. First the edge detection task was embedded into femur segmentation from computed tomography volume to solve the problems of narrow joint space and weak femur boundary. Crucially a task-specific edge detector was used to optimize the performance of femur segmentation in an end-to-end trainable system. Second the multi-scale features fusion provided both local and global contexts to handle the problems of large variations in leg postures as well as femur shape and density. The results demonstrated that accurate 3-D femur segmentation with a high Dice similarity coefficient of 96.88% was achieved using the developed method and the segmentation of computed tomography volume took 0.93 s on an average.
