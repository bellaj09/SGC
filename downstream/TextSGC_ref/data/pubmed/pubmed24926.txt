Background: Visual stimuli are frequently incorporated into interventions that use narratives to meet counseling therapy education and clinical needs. However the treatment efficacy of visual stimuli is unclear. This systematic review synthesizes and evaluates visual narrative interventions addressing anxiety.Methods: Databases n\u2009=\u20099 and extended reference searches identified 13 original studies using visual artifacts in narrative interventions for adult anxiety. The visual stimulations were analyzed based on artifact origin user interactivity and functions of the stimuli.Results: Three types of visual artifacts- virtual reality VR n\u2009=\u20094 videos n\u2009=\u20094 and drawings n\u2009=\u20095 were found. Dichotomous patterns of artifact origin native vs. foreign and interactivity participatory vs. non-participatory characterized the applications. A hierarchy of functions- engage externalize internalize and rescript was observed. Most studies confirmed the positive effects on the varied anxiety conditions; however unclear risk of bias and extraneous factors was present.Conclusions: Future visual narrative studies addressing adult anxiety are recommended to strengthen the current body of knowledge by using double-blinded randomized control trials with robust anxiety measures incorporating artifact origin and user interactivity in intervention designs considering alternative stimuli with high accessibility such as images and including employment-related anxiety conditions.
