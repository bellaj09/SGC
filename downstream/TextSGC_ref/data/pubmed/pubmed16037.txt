The formation and growth of cysts in kidneys and often liver in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD cause progressive increases in total kidney volume TKV and liver volume TLV. Laborious and time-consuming manual tracing of kidneys and liver is the current gold standard. We developed a fully automated segmentation method for TKV and TLV measurement that uses a deep learning network optimized to perform semantic segmentation of kidneys and liver. Automatic Measurement of Kidney and Liver Volumes from MR Images of Patients Affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.
