How do we know where we are? Orientation in space is key to our daily existence as we follow familiar routes navigate to a previous location or just try to get home as quickly as possible. As well as being interesting in its own right spatial cognition is also a useful model system in which to understand the neural bases of cognition and memory formation more generally. Spatial behavior offers potentially straightforward correlates of neuronal activity that can be studied similarly in adults and infants of both human and non-human animals. The neural mechanisms of spatial behavior can be realistically investigated in a well-controlled way with the aid of virtual reality technologies in humans and rodents. Virtual reality can thus help to bridge the gap between electrophysiological studies in rodents and brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans. Within this framework this article aims to translate findings from the single cell level in rodents to understand the neural and systems level mechanisms of spatial cognition in the human brain. From cells to systems: grids and boundaries in spatial memory.
