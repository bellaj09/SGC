"This initial feasibility study examined the use of virtual reality exposure therapy VRE in the treatment of MST-related PTSD with newly developed content tailored to MST. Participants included 15 veterans 26% male with MST-related PTSD. Assessment of PTSD depression and psychophysiological indicators of distress occurred at pre-treatment post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Treatment included 6-12 VRE sessions. There were significant reductions in pre- to post-treatment PTSD CAPS severity: t10\u202f=\u202f3.69 p\u202f=\u202f.004; PCL-5: t10\u202f=\u202f3.79 p\u202f=\u202f.004 and depressive symptoms PHQ-9: t8\u202f=\u202f2.83 p\u202f=\u202f.022 which were maintained at follow-up. There also was a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in heart rate response to a trauma cue. Cohens d effect sizes were large CAPS: d\u202f=\u202f1.11; PCL-5: d\u202f=\u202f1.14 PHQ-9: d\u202f=\u202f.94 and the percentage of participants meeting PTSD criteria continued to decline from post-treatment 53% to follow-up 33%. Findings indicate VRE can be safely delivered and is a promising treatment for MST-related PTSD."
