New strategies like motor imagery based brain-computer interfaces which use brain signals such as event-related desynchronization ERD or event-related synchronization ERS for motor rehabilitation after a stroke are undergoing investigation. However little is known about the relationship between ERD and ERS patterns and the degree of stroke impairment. The aim of this work was to clarify this relationship. Relationship between electrical brain responses to motor imagery and motor impairment in stroke.
