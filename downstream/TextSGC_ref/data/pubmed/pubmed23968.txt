The disorders of consciousness refer to clinical conditions that follow a severe head injury. Patients diagnosed as in a vegetative state lack awareness while patients diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state retain fluctuating awareness. However it is a challenge to accurately diagnose these disorders with clinical assessments of behavior. To improve diagnostic accuracy neuroimaging-based approaches have been developed to detect the presence or absence of awareness in patients who lack overt responsiveness. For the small subset of patients who retain awareness brain-computer interfaces could serve as tools for communication and environmental control. Here we review the existing literature concerning the sensory and cognitive abilities of patients with disorders of consciousness with respect to existing brain-computer interface designs. We highlight the challenges of device development for this special population and address some of the most promising approaches for future investigations. Brain-computer interfaces for patients with disorders of consciousness.
