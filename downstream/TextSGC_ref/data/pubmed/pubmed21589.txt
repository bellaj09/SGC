Diagnostic knee arthroscopy is a common procedure that orthopaedic residents are expected to learn early in their training. Arthroscopy requires a different skill set from traditional open surgery and many orthopaedic residents feel less prepared for arthroscopic procedures. Virtual reality simulation training and testing provide an opportunity to ensure basic competency before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients. Testing basic competency in knee arthroscopy using a virtual reality simulator: exploring validity and reliability.
