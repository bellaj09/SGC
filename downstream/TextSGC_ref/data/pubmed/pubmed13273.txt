The detection of brain responses at the single-trial level in the electroencephalogram EEG such as event-related potentials ERPs is a difficult problem that requires different processing steps to extract relevant discriminant features. While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network CNN as a type of deep learning technique have shown some interests as they are able to process the signal after limited pre-processing. In this study we propose to investigate the performance of CNNs in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject or a system for all the subjects. More particularly we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a convolutional neural network trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers. Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture.
