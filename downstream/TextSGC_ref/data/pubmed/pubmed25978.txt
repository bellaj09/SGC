"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs rely on various electroencephalography methodologies that allow the user to convey their desired control to the machine. Common approaches include the use of event-related potentials ERPs such as the P300 and modulation of the beta and mu rhythms. All of these methods have their benefits and drawbacks. In this paper three different selective attention tasks were tested in conjunction with a P300-based protocol i.e. the standard counting of target stimuli as well as the conduction of real and imaginary movements in sync with the target stimuli. The three tasks were performed by a total of 10 participants with the majority 7 out of 10 of the participants having never before participated in imaginary movement BCI experiments. Channels and methods used were optimized for the P300 ERP and no sensory-motor rhythms were explicitly used. The classifier used was a simple Fishers linear discriminant. Results were encouraging showing that on average the imaginary movement achieved a P300 versus No-P300 classification accuracy of 84.53%. In comparison mental counting the standard selective attention task used in previous studies achieved 78.9% and real movement 90.3%. Furthermore multiple trial classification results were recorded and compared with real movement reaching 99.5% accuracy after four trials 12.8 s imaginary movement reaching 99.5% accuracy after five trials 16 s and counting reaching 98.2% accuracy after ten trials 32 s."
