The review is devoted to researches in the relatively new field of neuroscience--connectomics. The theoretical and applied aspects of connectom studying are observed. The concept of connectom is defined as well as its attributes such as connectivity. The review describes the basic modern methods of the connectom investigation existing data on the connectom structure in normal and pathological conditions as well as prospects for the development of a new field of knowledge--connectomics. The Connectomics: Neurophysiology Achievements and Perspectives.
