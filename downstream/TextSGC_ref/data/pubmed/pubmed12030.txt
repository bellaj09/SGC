Smart Chinese medicine has emerged to contribute to the evolution of healthcare and medical services by applying machine learning together with advanced computing techniques like cloud computing to computer-aided diagnosis and treatment in the health engineering and informatics. Specially smart Chinese medicine is considered to be potential to treat the difficult and complicated diseases such as diabetes and cancers. Unfortunately smart Chinese medicine has made very limited progress in the past few years. In this paper we present a unified smart Chinese medicine framework based on the edge-cloud computing system. The objective of the framework is to achieve computer-aided syndrome differentiation and prescription recommendation and thus to provide pervasive personalized and patient-centralized services in healthcare and medicine. To accomplish this objective we integrate deep learning and deep reinforcement learning into the traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore we propose a multi-modal deep computation model for syndrome recognition that is a crucial part of syndrome differentiation. Finally we conduct experiments to validate the proposed model by comparing with the staked auto-encoder and multi-modal deep learning model for syndrome recognition of hypertension and cold. A Unified Smart Chinese Medicine Framework for Healthcare and Medical Services.
