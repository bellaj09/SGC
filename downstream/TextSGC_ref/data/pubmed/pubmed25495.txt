This paper presents a non-motor imagery tasks classification electroencephalography EEG based brain computer interface BCI for wheelchair control. It uses only two EEG channels and a better feature extractor to improve the portability and accuracy in the practical system. In addition two different features extraction methods power spectral density PSD and Hilbert Huang Transform HHT energy are compared to find a better method with improved classification accuracy using a Genetic Algorithm GA based neural network classifier. The results from five subjects show that using the original eight channels with three tasks accuracy between 76% and 85% is achieved. With only two channels in combination with the best chosen task using a PSD feature extractor the accuracy is reduced to between 65% and 79%. However the HHT based method provides an improved accuracy between 70% and 84% for the classification of three discriminative tasks using two EEG channels. Toward fewer EEG channels and better feature extractor of non-motor imagery mental tasks classification for a wheelchair thought controller.
