Our goal was to develop a tool for the assessment of executive functions by customizing a virtual reality VR version of the Multiple Errands Test MET Shallice & Burgess 1991; Fortin et al. 2003. The MET is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules. It is performed in an actual shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The specific goal of this study was to conduct a pilot study using the virtual version of MET VMET with both control subjects and patients with cognitive impairment derived from stroke. Implementation of the multiple errands test in a NeuroVR-supermarket: a possible approach.
