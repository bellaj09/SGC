"The notion of body-based scaling suggests that our body and its action capabilities are used to scale the spatial layout of the environment. Here we present four studies supporting this perspective by showing that the hand acts as a metric which individuals use to scale the apparent sizes of objects in the environment. However to test this one must be able to manipulate the size and/or dimensions of the perceivers hand which is difficult in the real world due to impliability of hand dimensions. To overcome this limitation we used virtual reality to manipulate dimensions of participants fully-tracked virtual hands to investigate its influence on the perceived size and shape of virtual objects. In a series of experiments using several measures we show that individuals estimations of the sizes of virtual objects differ depending on the size of their virtual hand in the direction consistent with the body-based scaling hypothesis. Additionally we found that these effects were specific to participants virtual hands rather than another avatars hands or a salient familiar-sized object. While these studies provide support for a body-based approach to the scaling of the spatial layout they also demonstrate the influence of virtual bodies on perception of virtual environments." Welcome to wonderland: the influence of the size and shape of a virtual hand on the perceived size and shape of virtual objects.
