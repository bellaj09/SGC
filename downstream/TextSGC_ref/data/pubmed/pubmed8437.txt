Medical image segmentation is one of the hot issues in the related area of image processing. Precise segmentation for medical images is a vital guarantee for follow-up treatment. At present however low gray contrast and blurred tissue boundaries are common in medical images and the segmentation accuracy of medical images cannot be effectively improved. Especially deep learning methods need more training samples which lead to time-consuming process. Therefore we propose a novelty model for medical image segmentation based on deep multiscale convolutional neural network CNN in this article. First we extract the region of interest from the raw medical images. Then data augmentation is operated to acquire more training datasets. Our proposed method contains three models: encoder U-net and decoder. Encoder is mainly responsible for feature extraction of 2D image slice. The U-net cascades the features of each block of the encoder with those obtained by deconvolution in the decoder under different scales. The decoding is mainly responsible for the upsampling of the feature graph after feature extraction of each group. Simulation results show that the new method can boost the segmentation accuracy. And it has strong robustness compared with other segmentation methods. DMCNN: A Deep Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation.
