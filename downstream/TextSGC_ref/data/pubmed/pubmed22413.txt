Recent years have seen notable advances in imaging technologies. Three-dimensional computer-rendered techniques with rapid image acquisition have led to the development of virtual reality imaging. Virtual reality imaging allows interactive intraluminal navigation through any hollow viscus simulating conventional endoscopy. This technique of virtual endoscopy has been applied to many organs including the urinary tract. Virtual reality endoscopy is beginning to challenge the gold standard of conventional endoscopic evaluation. Recent advances in laparoscopic surgery are largely attributable to technological improvements in imaging equipment. Laparoscopic ultrasound has become a common adjunct in laparoscopic surgery. In particular advances in video cameras and digital imaging technology have decreased the steep learning curve associated with laparoscopic procedures. Telerobotic systems offer several advantages to laparoscopic surgery such as all six degrees of freedom dexterity enhancement tremor filtering and stereovision. In addition technological breakthroughs allow many procedures to evolve from open operations involving lengthy hospital stays to imaging-guided minimally invasive procedures performed on an outpatient basis. Finally Internet-based imaging is changing the way in which urology services are delivered by allowing rapid communication between remote locations. Functional reconstruction and minimally invasive techniques.
