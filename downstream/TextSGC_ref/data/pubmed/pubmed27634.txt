"Gaze-independent event-related potential ERP based brain-computer interfaces BCIs yield relatively low BCI performance and traditionally employ unimodal stimuli. Bimodal ERP-BCIs may increase BCI performance due to multisensory integration or summation in the brain. An additional advantage of bimodal BCIs may be that the user can choose which modality or modalities to attend to. We studied bimodal visual-tactile gaze-independent BCIs and investigated whether or not ERP components tAUCs and subsequent classification accuracies are increased for 1 bimodal vs. unimodal stimuli; 2 location-congruent vs. location-incongruent bimodal stimuli; and 3 attending to both modalities vs. to either one modality. We observed an enhanced bimodal compared to unimodal P300 tAUC which appeared to be positively affected by location-congruency p = 0.056 and resulted in higher classification accuracies. Attending either to one or to both modalities of the bimodal location-congruent stimuli resulted in differences between ERP components but not in classification performance. We conclude that location-congruent bimodal stimuli improve ERP-BCIs and offer the user the possibility to switch the attended modality without losing performance."
