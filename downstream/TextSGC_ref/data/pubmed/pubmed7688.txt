Cryo-EM Single Particle Analysis workflows require tens of thousands of high-quality particle projections to unveil the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules. Conventional methods for automatic particle picking tend to suffer from high false-positive rates hampering the reconstruction process. One common cause of this problem is the presence of carbon and different types of high-contrast contaminations. In order to overcome this limitation we have developed MicrographCleaner a deep learning package designed to discriminate in an automated fashion between regions of micrographs which are suitable for particle picking and those which are not. MicrographCleaner implements a U-net-like deep learning model trained on a manually curated dataset compiled from over five hundred micrographs. The benchmarking carried out on approximately one hundred independent micrographs shows that MicrographCleaner is a very efficient approach for micrograph preprocessing. MicrographCleaner micrograph_cleaner_em package is available at PyPI and Anaconda Cloud and also as a Scipion/Xmipp protocol.
