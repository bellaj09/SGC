Haptics or touchsense haptic technology is a major breakthrough in medical and dental interventions. Haptic perception is the process of recognizing objects through touch. Haptic sensations are created by actuators or motors which generate vibrations to the users and are controlled by embedded software which is integrated into the device. It takes the advantage of a combination of somatosensory pattern of skin and proprioception of hand position. Anatomical and diagnostic knowledge when it is combined with this touch sense technology has revolutionized medical education. This amalgamation of the worlds of diagnosis and surgical intervention adds precise robotic touch to the skill of the surgeon. A systematic literature review was done by using MEDLINE GOOGLE SEARCH AND PubMed. The aim of this article was to introduce the fundamentals of haptic technology its current applications in medical training and robotic surgeries limitations of haptics and future aspects of haptics in medicine. Haptics - touchfeedback technology widening the horizon of medicine.
