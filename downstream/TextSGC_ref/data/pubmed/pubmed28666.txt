This paper presents a reliable brain-computer interface BCI based on a steady-state visually evoked potential SSEVP method using online recursive independent component analysis ORICA with denoising. The proposed system includes a visual stimulator a front-end data acquisition module an ORICA module a power spectrum density PSD-based noise channel detection module a denoising module and an EEG reconstruction module and a detection module using canonical correlation analysis CCA. The system with the proposed PSD-based denoising mechanism is simulated using test patterns of 9-Hz and 10-Hz SSEVP-based EEG raw data stream with an 8-second sliding window length with a 1-second step size under the condition of 128 Hz sampling rate. The accuracy of the detection is approximately 88% and 95% hit rate for 9-Hz and 10-Hz test patterns respectively. A reliable brain-computer interface based on SSVEP using online recursive independent component analysis.
