Newly diagnosed focal epilepsy NDfE is rarely studied particularly using advanced neuroimaging techniques. Many patients with NDfE experience cognitive impairments particularly with respect to memory sustained attention mental flexibility and executive functioning. Cognitive impairments have been related to alterations in resting-state functional brain networks in patients with neurological disorders. In the present study we investigated whether patients with NDfE had altered connectivity in large-scale functional networks using resting-state functional MRI. Resting-state functional brain networks in adults with a new diagnosis of focal epilepsy.
