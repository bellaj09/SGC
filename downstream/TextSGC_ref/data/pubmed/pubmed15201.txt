Human-machine interfaces are essential components between various human and machine interactions such as entertainment robotics control smart home virtual/augmented reality etc. Recently various triboelectric-based interfaces have been developed toward flexible wearable and battery-less applications. However most of them exhibit complicated structures and a large number of electrodes for multidirectional control. Herein a bio-inspired spider-net-coding BISNC interface with great flexibility scalability and single-electrode output is proposed through connecting information-coding electrodes into a single triboelectric electrode. Two types of coding designs are investigated i.e. information coding by large/small electrode width L/S coding and information coding with/without electrode at a predefined position 0/1 coding. The BISNC interface shows high scalability with a single electrode for detection and/or control of multiple directions by detecting different output signal patterns. In addition it also has excellent reliability and robustness in actual usage scenarios since recognition of signal patterns is in regardless of absolute amplitude and thereby not affected by sliding speed/force humidity etc. Based on the spider-net-coding concept single-electrode interfaces for multidirectional 3D control security code systems and flexible wearable electronics are successfully developed indicating the great potentials of this technology in diversified applications such as human-machine interaction virtual/augmented reality security robotics Internet of Things etc. Self-Powered Bio-Inspired Spider-Net-Coding Interface Using Single-Electrode Triboelectric Nanogenerator.
