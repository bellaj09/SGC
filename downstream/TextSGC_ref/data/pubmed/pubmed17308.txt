"Augmented Reality focuses on the enrichment of the users natural field of view by consistent integration of text symbols and interactive three-dimensional objects in real time. Placing virtual objects directly into the users view in a natural context empowers highly dynamic applications. On the other hand this necessitates deliberate choice of information design and density in particular for deployment in hazardous environments like military combat scenarios. As the amount of information needed is not foreseeable and strongly depends on the individual mission an appropriate system must offer adequate adaptation capabilities. The paper presents a prototypical vehicle-mountable Augmented Reality vision system designed for enhancing situation awareness in stressful urban warfare scenarios. Tracking as one of the most crucial challenges for outdoor Augmented Reality is accomplished by means of a Differential-GPS approach while the type of display to attach can be modified ranging from ocular displays to standard LCD mini-screens. The overall concept also includes envisioning of own troops blue forces for which a multi-sensor tracking approach has been chosen. As a main feature the system allows switching between different information categories focusing on friendly hostile unidentified or neutral data. Results of an empirical study on the superiority of an in-view navigation cue approach conclude the paper." Adaptive information design for outdoor augmented reality.
