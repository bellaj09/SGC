Fear of flying FoF a common phobia in the developed world is usually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy most efficiently when combined with exposure methods e.g. virtual reality exposure therapy VRET. We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating e.g. takeoff landing and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. A Novel Treatment of Fear of Flying Using a Large Virtual Reality System.
