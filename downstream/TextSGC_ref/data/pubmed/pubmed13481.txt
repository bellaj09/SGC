"Sporadic misbehavior suspect sales and marketing practices and the perceived deep pockets of the health care industry have put corporations and physicians alike at risk for investigation for fraud and abuse misconduct. The Advanced Medical Technology Associations AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals addresses interactions between the technology industry and physicians recommending appropriate behavior for partners engaged in developing testing learning and applying often complex technical innovations. As this discussion shows AdvaMeds industry code underscores uniformity between the drug and technology industries where similarities exist yet sets a distinct course where the needs of the two industries diverge. Health care professionals must be keenly aware of the differences and similarities of the overlapping codes of conducts. Provisions for allowable financial support for third-party conferences sales and promotional meetings industry-sponsored educational and training meetings consulting arrangements gifts to physicians reimbursement for technical information and charitable donations are all examined within the AdvaMed code of ethics and compared against codes and compliance guidance adopted by the American Medical Association; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; and the US Department of Health and Human Services; Office of Inspector General." New ethical code reflects expectations for industry behavior.
