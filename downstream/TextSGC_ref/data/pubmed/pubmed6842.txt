Various important topological properties of healthy brain connectome have recently been identified. However the manner in which brain lesion changes the functional network topology is unknown. We examined how critical specific brain areas are in the maintenance of network topology using multivariate support vector regression analysis on brain structural and resting-state functional imaging data in 96 patients with brain damages. Patients\ cortical lesion distribution patterns could significantly predict the functional network topology and a set of regions with significant weights in the prediction models were identified as "lesion hubs". Intriguingly we found two different types of lesion hubs whose lesions associated with changes of network topology towards relatively different directions being either more integrated global or more segregated local and correspond to hubs identified in healthy functional network in complex manners. Our results pose further important questions about the potential dynamics of the functional brain network after brain damage.
