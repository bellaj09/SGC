Few studies have investigated the relationship between stress and spatial performance in humans. In this study participants were exposed to an acute laboratory stressor Star Mirror Tracing Task or a control condition watching a nature video and then performed two spatial tasks. In the first task participants navigated through a virtual reality VR environment and then returned to the environment to make directional judgments relating to the learned targets. In the second task perspective taking participants made directional judgments to targets after imagined body rotations with respect to a map. Compared to the control condition participants in the Stress condition showed increases in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure indicating sympathetic adrenal medulla SAM axis activation. Participants in the Stress condition also reported being more anxious angry frustrated and irritated than participants in the Non-Stress condition. Salivary cortisol did not differ between conditions indicating no significant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical HPA axis involvement. In the VR task memory encoding was unaffected as directional error was similar in both conditions; however participants in the Stress condition responded more slowly which may be due to increases in negative affect SAM disruption in spatial memory retrieval through catecholamine release or a combination of both factors. In the perspective taking task participants were also slower to respond after stress suggesting interference in the ability to adopt new spatial orientations. Additionally sex differences were observed in that men had greater accuracy on both spatial tasks but no significant Sex by Stress condition interactions were demonstrated.
