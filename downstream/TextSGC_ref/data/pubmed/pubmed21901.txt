"Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet despite decades of study an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words syllables speech sounds phonemes and the actions of vocal tract articulators used to produce speech sounds articulatory gestures. Here we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in ventral precentral and inferior frontal gyri in men and women. Our results indicate that ventral precentral cortex represents gestures to a greater extent than phonemes while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a common cortical representation with that of other types of movement such as arm and hand movements. This has important implications both for our understanding of speech production and for the design of brain-machine interfaces to restore communication to people who cannot speak.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite being studied for decades the production of speech by the brain is not fully understood. In particular the most elemental parts of speech speech sounds phonemes and the movements of vocal tract articulators used to produce these sounds articulatory gestures have both been hypothesized to be encoded in motor cortex. Using direct cortical recordings we found evidence that primary motor and premotor cortices represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes. Inferior frontal cortex part of Brocas area appears to represent both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a similar cortical organizational structure with the movement of other body parts."
