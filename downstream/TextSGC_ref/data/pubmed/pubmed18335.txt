Computed Tomography CT provides a large amount of data but the presentation of the data to a physician can be less than satisfactory. Ideally the image data should be available to physicians in interactive 3D to allow for improved visualization planning and diagnosis. A virtual reality representation that not only allows for the manipulation of the image but also allows for the user to in effect move inside the image remotely would be ideal. In this paper the research associated with virtual reality is discussed. A formalism is then presented to create from the CT data the virtual reality world in the Virtual Reality Modeling Language. An implementation is described of this formalism that uses the Internet to allow for users in remote locations to view and manipulate the virtual worlds. The Internet and medical collaboration using virtual reality.
