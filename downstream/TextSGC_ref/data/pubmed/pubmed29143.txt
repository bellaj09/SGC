One of the main problems related to electroencephalogram EEG based brain-computer interface BCI systems is the non-stationarity of the underlying EEG signals. This results in the deterioration of the classification performance during experimental sessions. Therefore adaptive classification techniques are required for EEG based BCI applications. In this paper we propose simple adaptive sparse representation based classification SRC schemes. Supervised and unsupervised dictionary update techniques for new test data and a dictionary modification method by using the incoherence measure of the training data are investigated. The proposed methods are very simple and additional computation for the re-training of the classifier is not needed. The proposed adaptive SRC schemes are evaluated using two BCI experimental datasets. The proposed methods are assessed by comparing classification results with the conventional SRC and other adaptive classification methods. On the basis of the results we find that the proposed adaptive schemes show relatively improved classification accuracy as compared to conventional methods without requiring additional computation.
