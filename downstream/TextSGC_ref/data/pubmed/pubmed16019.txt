"Processing of transcripts at the 3-end involves cleavage at a polyadenylation site followed by the addition of a polyA-tail. By selecting which site is cleaved the process of alternative polyadenylation enables genes to produce transcript isoforms with different 3-ends. To facilitate the identification and treatment of disease-causing mutations that affect polyadenylation and to understand the sequence determinants underlying this regulatory process a computational model that can accurately predict polyadenylation patterns from genomic features is desirable." Inference of the human polyadenylation code.
