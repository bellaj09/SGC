Due to insufficient samples the generalization performance of deep network is insufficient. In order to solve this problem an improved U-net based image automatic segmentation and diagnosis algorithm was proposed in which the max-pooling operation in original U-net model was replaced by the convolution operation to keep more feature information. Firstly the regions of 128128 were extracted from all slices of the patients as data samples. Secondly the patient samples were divided into training sample set and testing sample set and data augmentation was performed on the training samples. Finally all the training samples were adopted to train the model. Compared with Fully Convolutional Network FCN model and max-pooling based U-net model DSC and CR coefficients of the proposed method achieve the best results while PM coefficient is 2.55 percentage lower than the maximum value in the two comparison models and Average Symmetric Surface Distance is slightly higher than the minimum value of the two comparison models by 0.004. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve good segmentation and diagnosis results.
