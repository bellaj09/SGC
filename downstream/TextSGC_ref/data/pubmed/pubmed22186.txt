"In order to identify the effects and divergences of the different landscape perception approaches on landscape preference this study investigated peoples preferences for urban green spaces with different vegetation structures in the early spring through using three approaches which were on-site survey photo elicitation and VR technology. The results showed that: a There were significant differences among the three approaches for landscape preference among which there was a significant difference between VR technology and the other two approaches while no differences between on-site survey and photo elicitation were found. b The respondents showed significant differences in their preferences for the urban green spaces with the different vegetation structures through VR technology and the semi-open green space received the highest preference score. c Whatever the approach employed there were no significant differences in gender and professional background groups for landscape preference. d In the comparisons of the three different approaches the respondents were more willing to choose physical recreational activities to be conducted in the early spring. Based on the above results the three approaches of landscape perception were divergent and irreplaceable. It is thus suggested that the approach of landscape perception should be carefully selected for a specific landscape in a certain season so as to provide a scientific basis for the evaluation of landscape perception and preference in the future."
