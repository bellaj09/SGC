Many proposed EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs make use of visual stimuli to elicit steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP the frequency of which can be mapped to a computer input. However such a control scheme can be ineffective if a user has no motor control over their eyes and cannot direct their gaze towards a flashing stimulus to generate such a signal. Tactile-based methods such as somatosensory steady-state evoked potentials SSSEP are a potentially attractive alternative in these scenarios. Here we compare the neural signals elicited by SSSEP to those elicited by SSVEP in nave BCI users towards evaluating the feasibility of SSSEP-based control of an EEG BCI. Comparison of steady-state visual and somatosensory evoked potentials for brain-computer interface control.
