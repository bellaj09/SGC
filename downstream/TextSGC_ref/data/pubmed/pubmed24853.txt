Hypothetical moral dilemmas pitting characteristically utilitarian and non-utilitarian outcomes against each other have played a central role in investigations of moral decision-making. Preferences for utilitarian over non-utilitarian responses have been explained by two contrasting hypotheses; one implicating increased deliberative reasoning and the other implicating diminished harm aversion. In recent field experiments these hypotheses have been investigated using alcohol intoxication to impair both social and cognitive functioning. These studies have found increased utilitarian responding arguably as a result of alcohol impairing affective empathy.
