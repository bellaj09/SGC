"We begin this report by defining Chronic Alternate-World Disorder CAWD as a symptomatic behavior in which a person becomes fanatically engrossed in a virtual-reality VR world to the extent that he or she can no longer distinguish between the actual world and virtual reality. We then report on our investigation and provide an analysis and discussion of what we believe to be a case of CAWD. The case in question involves a perpetrator who hijacked a jumbo jetliner in order to fly the airplane on his own after developing CAWD from the use of light-simulator software. Psychiatrists and physicians specializing in VR-related disorders have analyzed the cases psychological social and technical background based on previously disclosed information. We believe symptomatic cases of CAWD will increase as VR spreads throughout our society. In view of this our objective is to propose precautionary and preventive measures for providers of VR systems for patients with schizophrenia or personality disorders from psychiatric and sociological perspectives." Investigation and analysis of a reported incident resulting in an actual airline hijacking due to a fanatical and engrossed VR state.
