Neuromodulation has wide ranging potential applications in replacing impaired neural function prosthetics as a novel form of medical treatment therapy and as a tool for investigating neurons and neural function research. Voltage and current controlled electrical neural stimulation ENS are methods that have already been widely applied in both neuroscience and clinical practice for neuroprosthetics. However there are numerous alternative methods of stimulating or inhibiting neurons. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in ENS as well as alternative neuromodulation techniques-presenting the operational concepts technical implementation and limitations-in order to inform system design choices. Neuromodulation: present and emerging methods.
