In this paper we develop a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm called active hybrid deep belief networks AHD to address the semi-supervised sentiment classification problem with deep learning. First we construct the previous several hidden layers using restricted Boltzmann machines RBM which can reduce the dimension and abstract the information of the reviews quickly. Second we construct the following hidden layers using convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines CRBM which can abstract the information of reviews effectively. Third the constructed deep architecture is fine-tuned by gradient-descent based supervised learning with an exponential loss function. Finally active learning method is combined based on the proposed deep architecture. We did several experiments on five sentiment classification datasets and show that AHD is competitive with previous semi-supervised learning algorithm. Experiments are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with different number of labeled reviews and unlabeled reviews respectively.
