Cervical cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women which is the third leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Brachytherapy is the most effective treatment for cervical cancer. For brachytherapy computed tomography CT imaging is necessary since it conveys tissue density information which can be used for dose planning. However the metal artifacts caused by brachytherapy applicators remain a challenge for the automatic processing of image data for image-guided procedures or accurate dose calculations. Therefore developing an effective metal artifact reduction MAR algorithm in cervical CT images is of high demand. Metal artifact reduction on cervical CT images by deep residual learning.
