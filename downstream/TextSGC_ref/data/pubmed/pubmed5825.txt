Rapid advances in neuroimaging and network science have produced powerful tools and measures to appreciate human brain organization at multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is now possible to obtain increasingly meaningful representations of whole-brain structural and functional brain networks and to formally assess macroscale principles of network topology. In addition to its utility in characterizing healthy brain organization individual variability and life span-related changes there is high promise of network neuroscience for the conceptualization and ultimately management of brain disorders. In the current review we argue for a science of the human brain that while strongly embracing macroscale connectomics also recommends awareness of brain properties derived from meso- and microscale resolutions. Such features include MRI markers of tissue microstructure local functional properties as well as information from nonimaging domains including cellular genetic or chemical data. Integrating these measures with connectome models promises to better define the individual elements that constitute large-scale networks and clarify the notion of connection strength among them. By enriching the description of large-scale networks this approach may improve our understanding of fundamental principles of healthy brain organization. Notably it may also better define the substrate of prevalent brain disorders including stroke autism as well as drug-resistant epilepsies that are each characterized by intriguing interactions between local anomalies and network-level perturbations.
