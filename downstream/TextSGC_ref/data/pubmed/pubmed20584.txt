"Augmented reality technology has been used for intraoperative image guidance through the overlay of virtual images from preoperative imaging studies onto the real-world surgical field. Although setups based on augmented reality have been used for various neurosurgical pathologies very few cases have been reported for the surgery of arteriovenous malformations AVM. We present our experience with AVM surgery using a system designed for image injection of virtual images into the operating microscopes eyepiece and discuss why augmented reality may be less appealing in this form of surgery." Augmented reality in the surgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: technique assessment and considerations.
