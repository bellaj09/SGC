High-level abstraction for example semantic representation is vital for document classification and retrieval. However how to learn document semantic representation is still a topic open for discussion in information retrieval and natural language processing. In this paper we propose a new Hybrid Deep Belief Network HDBN which uses Deep Boltzmann Machine DBM on the lower layers together with Deep Belief Network DBN on the upper layers. The advantage of DBM is that it employs undirected connection when training weight parameters which can be used to sample the states of nodes on each layer more successfully and it is also an effective way to remove noise from the different document representation type; the DBN can enhance extract abstract of the document in depth making the model learn sufficient semantic representation. At the same time we explore different input strategies for semantic distributed representation. Experimental results show that our model using the word embedding instead of single word has better performance. Learning document semantic representation with hybrid deep belief network.
