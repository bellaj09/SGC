Remdesivir has received significant attention for its potential application in the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The remdesivir core contains GS-441524 which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone. In non-human primates following IV administration remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2\u2009h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24\u2009h. Nevertheless remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification. Development and validation of a UHPLC-MS/MS method for quantification of the prodrug remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524: a tool for clinical pharmacokinetics of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease.
