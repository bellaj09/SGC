The number of people living with dementia is increasing rapidly. Clinical dementia does not develop suddenly but rather is preceded by a period of cognitive decline beyond normal age-related change. People at this intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia are often described as having mild cognitive impairment MCI. Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease-modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia. Computerised cognitive training for preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment.
