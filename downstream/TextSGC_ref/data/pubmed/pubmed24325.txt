Analysis of visually guided tracking movements is an important component of understanding human visuomotor control system. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of different target speeds and different circular tracking planes which provide different visual feedback of depth information on temporal and spatial tracking accuracy. In this study we analyze motor control characteristic of circular tracking movements during monocular vision in three-dimensional space using a virtual reality system. Three parameters in polar coordinates were analyzed: R the difference in the distance from the fixed pole;  the difference in the position angle; and  the difference in the angular velocity. We compare the accuracy of visually guided circular tracking movements during monocular vision in two conditions: 1 movement in the frontal plane relative to the subject that requires less depth information and 2 movement in the sagittal plane relative to the subject that requires more depth information. We also examine differences in motor control at four different target speeds. The results show that depth information affects both spatial and temporal accuracy of circular tracking movement whereas target speed only affects temporal accuracy of circular tracking movement. This suggests that different strategies of feedforward and feedback controls are performed in the tracking of movements.
