Brain-wide activities revealed by neuroimaging and recording techniques have been used to predict motor and cognitive functions in both human and animal models. However although studies have shown the existence of micrometer-scale spatial organization of neurons in the motor cortex relevant to motor control two-photon microscopy TPM calcium imaging at cellular resolution has not been fully exploited for the same purpose. Here we ask if calcium imaging data recorded by TPM in rodent brain can provide enough information to predict features of upcoming movement. We collected calcium imaging signal from rostral forelimb area in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex while mice performed a two-dimensional lever reaching task. Images of average calcium activity collected during motion preparation period and inter-trial interval ITI were used to predict the forelimb reach results. The evaluation was based on a deep learning model that had been applied for object recognition. We found that the prediction accuracy for both maximum reaching location and trial outcome based on motion preparation period but not ITI were higher than the probabilities governed by chance. Our study demonstrated that imaging data encompassing information on the spatial organization of functional neuronal clusters in the motor cortex is useful in predicting motor acts even in the absence of detailed dynamics of neural activities.
