Recognition of communicative interactions is a complex social cognitive ability which is associated with a specific neural activity in healthy individuals. However neural correlates of communicative interaction processing from whole-body motion have not been known in patients with schizophrenia SCZ. Therefore the current study aims to examine the neural activity associated with recognition of communicative interactions in SCZ by using displays of the dyadic interactions downgraded to minimalistic point-light presentations. Brain correlates of recognition of communicative interactions from biological motion in schizophrenia.
