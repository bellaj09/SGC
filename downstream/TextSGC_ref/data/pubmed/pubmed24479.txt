"Brain Machine Interface BMI is a system that assumes users intention by analyzing users brain activities and control devices with the assumed intention. It is considered as one of prospective tools to enhance paralyzed patients quality of life. In our group we especially focus on ECoG electro-corti-gram-BMI which requires surgery to place electrodes on the cortex. We try to implant all the devices within the patients head and abdomen and to transmit the data and power wirelessly. Our device consists of 5 parts: 1 High-density multi-electrodes with a 3D shaped sheet fitting to the individual brain surface to effectively record the ECoG signals; 2 A small circuit board with two integrated circuit chips functioning 128 ch analogue amplifiers and A/D converters for ECoG signals; 3 A Wifi data communication & control circuit with the target PC; 4 A non-contact power supply transmitting electrical power minimum 400mW to the device 20mm away. We developed those devices integrated them and investigated the performance." Development of an implantable wireless ECoG 128ch recording device for clinical brain machine interface.
