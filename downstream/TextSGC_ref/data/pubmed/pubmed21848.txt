To better use virtual reality robotic simulators and offer surgeons more practical exercises we developed the Tube 3 module for practicing vesicourethral anastomosis VUA one of the most complex steps in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure. Herein we describe the principle of the Tube 3 module and evaluate its face content and construct validity. The Tube 3 module designed for practicing vesicourethral anastomosis in a virtual reality robotic simulator: determination of face content and construct validity.
