Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs can be used successfully for brain-computer interfaces BCI with multiple commands and high information transfer rates. In this study we investigated a novel affective SSVEP paradigm using flickering video clips of emotional human faces and evaluated their performance in an 8-command BCI controlling a robotic arm in near real-time. Single-trial affective SSVEP responses estimated using a new phase-locking value variability and a wavelet energy variability measures were significantly enhanced compared with blurred-face flicker and standard checkerboards. For multicommand SSVEP-based BCI affective face-flicker boosted up the information transfer rates from 50 to 64 bits/min while reducing user fatigue and enhancing visual attention and reliability. In the 5-12 Hz flicker frequency range the strongest affective SSVEP responses were obtained at 10 Hz. These findings suggest new directions for SSVEP-based neural applications including affective BCI and enhanced steady-state clinical probes. Emotional faces boost up steady-state visual responses for brain-computer interface.
