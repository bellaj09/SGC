Virtual environments VEs are increasingly used in the context of scientific inquiries and rehabilitation for tasks that are otherwise difficult to control or perform safely in physical environments PEs such as avoiding other pedestrians during locomotion. The usefulness of VEs however remains constrained by the extent to which they can elicit natural responses. The objectives of the study were to examine circumvention strategies in response to pedestrians approaching from different directions in the VE versus PE and to determine the effects of repeated practice on the circumvention strategies. Twelve participants were assessed over five blocks of eight trials that consisted of walking toward a target while circumventing pedestrians approaching from different directions 0  30 right or left or none in the VE and the PE. Similar onset distances of circumvention strategy and preferred side of circumvention were observed between the two environments. Participants however maintained enlarged minimum distances from the interferer 13% and walked slower 11.5% in the VE. Repeated practice resulted in walking speed increments of 7.4% over the entire session that were similar in the VE versus PE. While the changes observed in VE may reflect the use of more cautious circumvention strategies the similarities in strategies between the two environments and the advantages of VEs e.g. controlled exposure reproduction of ecologically valid conditions and safety suggest that virtual reality is a valuable tool to study visually guided locomotor tasks such as pedestrian circumvention and shows great potential for assessment and intervention in physical rehabilitation.
