"The fear of speaking is often cited as the worlds most common social phobia. The rapid growth of computer technology enabled us to use virtual reality VR for the treatment of the fear of public speaking. There have been two techniques used to construct a virtual environment for the treatment of the fear of public speaking: model-based and movie-based. Virtual audiences and virtual environments made by model-based technique are unrealistic and unnatural. The movie-based technique has a disadvantage in that each virtual audience cannot be controlled respectively because all virtual audiences are included in one moving picture file. To address this disadvantage this paper presents a virtual environment made by using image-based rendering IBR and chroma keying simultaneously. IBR enables us to make the virtual environment realistic because the images are stitched panoramically with the photos taken from a digital camera. And the use of chroma keying allows a virtual audience to be controlled individually. In addition a real-time capture technique was applied in constructing the virtual environment to give the subjects more interaction in that they can talk with a therapist or another subject."
