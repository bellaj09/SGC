In April 2007 the American College of Radiology released the "White Paper on Radiation Dose in Medicine". The Blue Ribbon panel members included private practice and academic diagnostic radiologists medical physicists representatives of industry and regulatory groups and a patient advocate. The panel concluded that the expanding use of imaging modalities using ionizing radiations such as CT and nuclear medicine may result in an increased incidence of radiation-related cancer in the exposed population in the not-too-distant future and this problem can likely be minimized by preventing the inappropriate use of such imaging and by optimizing studies that are performed to obtain the best image quality with the lowest radiation dose. The White Paper set forth practical suggestions to minimize radiation risk including education for all stakeholders in the principles of radiation safety and preferential use of alternative non-ionizing imaging techniques such as MRI and ultrasound. These recommendations are especially relevant for cardiologists who prescribe and/or practice medical imaging examinations accounting for at least 50% of the total effective dose by radiation medicine which amounts to an equivalent of about 160 chest x-rays per head per year in US. Were they be enacted these simple recommendations would determine a revolution in the contemporary way of teaching learning and practising cardiology.
