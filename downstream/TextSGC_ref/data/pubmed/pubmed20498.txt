The development of computerized surgical simulators in a virtual reality environment demands models for proper validation. Recent investigations have shown that a virtual reality simulator MIST-VR is a reliable tool for the assessment of laparoscopic psychomotor skills and that it improves the automation of the so-called fulcrum effect. Therefore we set out to determine whether training with the MIST-VR would improve the surgical performance of surgically inexperienced medical students and to see if results obtained in the simulator would correlate with surgical performance. Does training in a virtual reality simulator improve surgical performance?
