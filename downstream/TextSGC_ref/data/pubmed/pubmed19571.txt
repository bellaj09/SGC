Due to increases in network speed and bandwidth distributed exploration of medical data in immersive Virtual Reality VR environments is becoming increasingly feasible. The volumetric display of radiological data in such environments presents a unique set of challenges. The shear size and complexity of the datasets involved not only make them difficult to transmit to remote sites but these datasets also require extensive user interaction in order to make them understandable to the investigator and manageable to the rendering hardware. A sophisticated VR user interface is required in order for the clinician to focus on the aspects of the data that will provide educational and/or diagnostic insight. We will describe a software system of data acquisition data display Tele-Immersion and data manipulation that supports interactive collaborative investigation of large radiological datasets. The hardware required in this strategy is still at the high-end of the graphics workstation market. Future software ports to Linux and NT along with the rapid development of PC graphics cards open the possibility for later work with Linux or NT PCs and PC clusters.
