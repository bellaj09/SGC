Incisional hernia IH can be attributed to multiple factors. The presence of a parastomal hernia has shown to be a risk factor for IH after midline laparotomy. Our hypothesis is that this increased risk of IH may be caused by changes in biomechanical forces such as midline shift to the contralateral side of the colostomy owing to decreased restraining forces at the site of the colostomy and left abdominal rectus muscle ARM atrophy owing to intercostal nerve damage. Abdominal rectus muscle atrophy and midline shift after colostomy creation.
