Visuospatial neglect due to stroke is characterized by the inability to perceive stimuli emerging in the area opposite to the side of brain damage. Besides adopting conventional rehabilitation methods to treat neglect symptoms the use of virtual reality VR is becoming increasingly popular. We designed a series of 9 exergames aimed to improve exploration of the neglected side of space. When new VR interventions are designed it is important to assess the usability aspects of such management strategies within the target population. To date most studies used questionnaires to assess user satisfaction with the intervention or product being tested. However only a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data allows a full picture of user perspective.
