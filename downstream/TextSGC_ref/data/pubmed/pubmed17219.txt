The effects of inactivation of cerebellar deep nuclei and the lateral pontine nucleus on classical eyeblink conditioning with tone or lateral reticular nucleus LRN stimulation as conditioned stimuli CSs were examined. Inactivation of cerebellar deep nuclei abolished eyeblink conditioned responses CRs when the CS was either a tone or LRN stimulation. Inactivation of the lateral pontine nucleus prevented only the acquisition and retention of tone-evoked eyeblink CRs. Multiple-unit recording demonstrated that when LRN stimulation was used as the CS inactivation of the interpositus nucleus abolished learning-related neuronal activity in the lateral pontine nucleus whereas inactivation of pontine nucleus had little effect on similar activity in the interpositus nucleus. Thus the learning-induced neuronal activity in the lateral pontine nucleus was most likely driven by the cerebellar interpositus nucleus. Learning- and cerebellum-dependent neuronal activity in the lateral pontine nucleus.
