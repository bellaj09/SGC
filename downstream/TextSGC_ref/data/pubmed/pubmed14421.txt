This paper reports the gradual development and results achieved in the distance education program set up in the Public Health System in Chile in 2004. Up to date more than 22000 students from 29 different health divisions have been trained. This strategy was designed to provide more flexibility and diversity to the training programs of the Health System within the framework of a deep and complex organizational change promoted by Health Reform. The main results show that the integration of organizational teaching logistic and budgetary aspects has turned out to be a key element in its success validating the relevance of the provided solutions. The access to training by means of e-learning or blended learning electronic education that includes traditional and distance learning activities allowed employees to choose more independently what where and when to study. This fact accounts for the high demand for this program. Through this initiative the National Health System introduced a wider scope of responses to training needs which will mean a better adaptation to the challenges associated to health care.
