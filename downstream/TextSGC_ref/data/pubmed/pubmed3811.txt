While cranial radiation therapy CRT is an effective treatment healthy areas surrounding irradiation sites are negatively affected. Frontal lobe functions involving attention processing speed and inhibition control are impaired. These deficits appear months to years after CRT and impair quality of life. Exercise has been shown to rejuvenate the brain and aid in recovery post-injury through its effects on neurogenesis and cognition. Exercise ameliorates neurocognitive impairments in a translational model of pediatric radiotherapy.
