One of the most promising applications for electroencephalogram EEG-based brain computer interface is for stroke rehabilitation. Implemented as a standalone motor imagery MI training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Comparison of EEG measurement of upper limb movement in motor imagery training system.
