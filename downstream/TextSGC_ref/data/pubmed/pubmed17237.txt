"When we talk to one another face-to-face body gestures accompany our speech. Motion tracking technology enables us to include body gestures in avatar-mediated communication by mapping ones movements onto ones own 3D avatar in real time so the avatar is self-animated. We conducted two experiments to investigate a whether head-mounted display virtual reality is useful for researching the influence of body gestures in communication; and b whether body gestures are used to help in communicating the meaning of a word. Participants worked in pairs and played a communication game where one person had to describe the meanings of words to the other." Talk to the virtual hands: self-animated avatars improve communication in head-mounted display virtual environments.
