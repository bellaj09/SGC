This study is part of a larger project aiming to develop a virtual reality VR software to be implemented as a clinical tool for patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder AUD. The study is based on previous research in which we identified factors that elicit craving for alcohol in a sample of AUD patients and which led to the development of a virtual reality software to be used in cue exposure treatments of alcohol use disorder ALCO-VR. The main objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of ALCO-VR to elicit cue-induced craving and anxiety responses among social drinkers SD and AUD patients. Our secondary objective was to explore which responses cue-induced craving or anxiety can best differentiate between AUD patients and the SD group. Cue-Elicited Anxiety and Alcohol Craving as Indicators of the Validity of ALCO-VR Software: A Virtual Reality Study.
