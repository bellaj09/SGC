Aging is usually accompanied with deterioration of physical abilities such as muscular strength sensory sensitivity and functional capacity. Recently intervention methods with virtual reality have been introduced providing an enjoyable therapy for elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a 3-D virtual reality kayak program could improve the cognitive function muscle strength and balance of community-dwelling elderly. Importantly kayaking involves most of the upper body musculature and needs the balance control. Seventy-two participants were randomly allocated into the kayak program group n = 36 and the control group n = 36. The two groups were well matched with respect to general characteristics at baseline. The participants in both groups performed a conventional exercise program for 30 min and then the 3-D virtual reality kayak program was performed in the kayak program group for 20 min two times a week for 6 weeks. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Muscle strength was measured using the arm curl and handgrip strength tests. Standing and sitting balance was measured using the Good Balance system. The post-test was performed in the same manner as the pre-test; the overall outcomes such as cognitive function p < 0.05 muscle strength p < 0.05 and balance standing and sitting balance p < 0.05 were significantly improved in kayak program group compared to the control group. We propose that the 3-D virtual reality kayak program is a promising intervention method for improving the cognitive function muscle strength and balance of elderly.
