We propose a near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS-based brain-computer interface BCI that can be operated in eyes-closed EC state. To evaluate the feasibility of NIRS-based EC BCIs we compared the performance of an eye-open EO BCI paradigm and an EC BCI paradigm with respect to hemodynamic response and classification accuracy. To this end subjects performed either mental arithmetic or imagined vocalization of the English alphabet as a baseline task with very low cognitive loading. The performances of two linear classifiers were compared; resulting in an advantage of shrinkage linear discriminant analysis LDA. The classification accuracy of EC paradigm 75.6\u2009\u20097.3% was observed to be lower than that of EO paradigm 77.0\u2009\u20099.2% which was statistically insignificant p\u2009=\u20090.5698. Subjects reported they felt it more comfortable p\u2009=\u20090.057 and easier p\u2009<\u20090.05 to perform the EC BCI tasks. The different task difficulty may become a cause of the slightly lower classification accuracy of EC data. From the analysis results we could confirm the feasibility of NIRS-based EC BCIs which can be a BCI option that may ultimately be of use for patients who cannot keep their eyes open consistently.
