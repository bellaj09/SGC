Electromyography artifacts are a well-known problem in electroencephalography studies brain-computer interfaces BCIs brain mapping and clinical areas. Blind source separation BSS techniques are commonly used to handle artifacts. However these may remove not only the EMG artifacts but also some useful electroencephalography EEG sources. To reduce this useful information loss we propose a new technique for statistically selecting EEG channels that are contaminated with class-dependent EMG henceforth called EMG-CCh. The EMG-CCh is selected based on the correlation between EEG and facial EMG channels. They were compared using a Wilcoxon test to determine whether the artifacts played a significant role in class separation. To ensure that the promising results are not due to the weak EMG removal reliability tests were done In our data set the comparison results between BSS artifact removal applied in two ways to all channels and only to EMG-CCh showed that ICA PCA and BSS-CCA can yield significantly better   class separation with the proposed method 79% of the cases for ICA 53% for PCA and 11% for BSS-CCA. With BCI competition data we saw improvement in 60% of the cases for ICA and BSS-CCA. The simple method proposed in this paper showed improvement in class separation with both our data and the BCI competition data. There are no existing methods for removing EMG artifacts based on the correlation between the EEG and EMG channels. Also the EMG-CCh selection can be used on its own or it can be combined with pre-existing artifact handling methods. For these reasons we believe that this method can be useful for other EEG studies.
