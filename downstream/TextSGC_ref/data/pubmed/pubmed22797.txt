In this paper we present a novel rendering method which integrates reflective or refractive objects into a differential instant radiosity DIR framework usable for mixed-reality MR applications. This kind of objects are very special from the light interaction point of view as they reflect and refract incident rays. Therefore they may cause high-frequency lighting effects known as caustics. Using instant-radiosity IR methods to approximate these high-frequency lighting effects would require a large amount of virtual point lights VPLs and is therefore not desirable due to real-time constraints. Instead our approach combines differential instant radiosity with three other methods. One method handles more accurate reflections compared to simple cubemaps by using impostors. Another method is able to calculate two refractions in real-time and the third method uses small quads to create caustic effects. Our proposed method replaces parts in light paths that belong to reflective or refractive objects using these three methods and thus tightly integrates into DIR. In contrast to previous methods which introduce reflective or refractive objects into MR scenarios our method produces caustics that also emit additional indirect light. The method runs at real-time frame rates and the results show that reflective and refractive objects with caustics improve the overall impression for MR scenarios.
