We developed a stimulation technique on the basis of virtual reality methods for balance investigation performed in balance laboratories of otorhinolaryngological clinics and institutes of occupational health. Such a stimulation technique is greatly progressive in the sense that by creating virtual moving views and "virtual worlds" inside which the subject is located it is possible to make effective stimuli that would be very difficult or even impossible to set in any real environment. We tested our system on healthy subjects and found out that this kind of virtual reality stimulation system is very useful for balance analysis.
