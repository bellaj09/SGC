"Many educational institutions in higher education switched to problem-based learning PBL in the last 5 decades. Despite its successful implementation worldwide many institutions still encounter problems in their daily teaching practices that limit deep learning in students. This raises the question: How else can we look at PBL practice and research? The main argument of this reflective paper is to better align PBL practice with the theories or principles of contextual constructive self-directed and collaborative learning. This paper explains what these principles or theories are. In addition it discusses a new way to bridge theory and practice: design-based research DBR which combines redesigning theory-based teaching practices with investigating these practices in close collaboration with various stakeholders. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the problems encountered in PBL. We should be very careful in drawing conclusions about which PBL approach works best. No single solution works optimally under all conditions. At most DBR can help us gain better insight into why PBL with certain characteristics preferably based on theory might work in a specific context with particular goals in mind." How theory and design-based research can mature PBL practice and research.
