"Investigate how novice drivers with autism spectrum disorder ASD differ from experienced drivers and whether virtual reality driving simulation training VRDST improves ASD driving performance. 51 novice ASD drivers mean age 17.96 years 78% male were randomized to routine training RT or one of three types of VRDST 8-12 sessions. All participants followed DMV behind-the-wheel training guidelines for earning a drivers license. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training for driving-specific executive function EF abilities and tactical driving skills. ASD drivers showed worse baseline EF and driving skills than experienced drivers. At post-assessment VRDST significantly improved driving and EF performance over RT. This study demonstrated feasibility and potential efficacy of VRDST for novice ASD drivers."
