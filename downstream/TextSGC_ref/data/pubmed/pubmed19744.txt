The study compared human perceptions of height danger and anxiety as well as skin conductance and heart rate responses and postural instability effects in real and virtual height environments. The 24 participants 12 men 12 women whose average age was 23.6 years performed "lean-over-the-railing" and standing tasks on real and comparable virtual balconies using a surround-screen virtual reality SSVR system. The results indicate that the virtual display of elevation provided realistic perceptual experience and induced some physiological responses and postural instability effects comparable to those found in a real environment. It appears that a simulation of elevated work environment in a SSVR system although with reduced visual fidelity is a valid tool for safety research. Potential applications of this study include the design of virtual environments that will help in safe evaluation of human performance at elevation identification of risk factors leading to fall incidents and assessment of new fall prevention strategies.
