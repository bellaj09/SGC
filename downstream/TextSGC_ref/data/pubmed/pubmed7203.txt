This paper proposes the Relit Spectral Angle-Stacked Autoencoder a novel unsupervised feature learning approach for mapping pixel reflectances to illumination invariant encodings. This work extends the Spectral Angle-Stacked Autoencoder so that it can learn a shadow-invariant mapping. The method is inspired by a deep learning technique Denoising Autoencoders with the incorporation of a physics-based model for illumination such that the algorithm learns a shadow invariant mapping without the need for any labelled training data additional sensors a priori knowledge of the scene or the assumption of Planckian illumination. The method is evaluated using datasets captured from several different cameras with experiments to demonstrate the illumination invariance of the features and how they can be used practically to improve the performance of high-level perception algorithms that operate on images acquired outdoors.
