Precise assessment of the complex nerve-vessel relationship at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve is useful for planning microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. We have applied a fusion imaging technique of three-dimensional 3-D magnetic resonance cisternography and co-registered 3-D magnetic resonance angiography MRA that allows virtual reality for the preoperative simulation of the neurovascular conflict at the trigeminal nerve root entry zone. Preoperative simulation for microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia: visualization with three-dimensional magnetic resonance cisternogram and angiogram fusion imaging.
