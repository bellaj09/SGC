Attributes are mid-level semantic properties of objects. Recent research has shown that visual attributes can benefit many typical learning problems in computer vision community. However attribute learning is still a challenging problem as the attributes may not always be predictable directly from input images and the variation of visual attributes is sometimes large across categories. In this paper we propose a unified multiplicative framework for attribute learning which tackles the key problems. Specifically images and category information are jointly projected into a shared feature space where the latent factors are disentangled and multiplied to fulfil attribute prediction. The resulting attribute classifier is category-specific instead of being shared by all categories. Moreover our model can leverage auxiliary data to enhance the predictive ability of attribute classifiers which can reduce the effort of instance-level attribute annotation to some extent. By integrated into an existing deep learning framework our model can both accurately predict attributes and learn efficient image representations. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance on both instance-level and category-level attribute prediction. For zero-shot learning based on visual attributes and human-object interaction recognition our method can improve the state-of-the-art performance on several widely used datasets.
