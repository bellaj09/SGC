This study is a replication of an existing large study N\u2009=\u2009507 on the surface-based morphometric correlates of five-factor model FFM personality traits. The same methods were used as the original study in another large sample drawn from the same population N\u2009=\u2009597 with results then being aggregated from both samples N\u2009=\u20091104 providing the largest investigation into the neuroanatomical correlates of FFM personality traits to date. Clusters of association between brain morphometry and each FFM trait are reported. For neuroticism agreeableness openness and conscientiousness clusters of association were found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for at least one morphometric index. Morphometry in various other regions was also associated with each personality trait. While some regions found in the original study were confirmed in the replication and full samples others were not highlighting the importance of replicating even high-quality well-powered studies. Effect sizes were very similar in the replication and whole samples as those found in the original study. As a whole the current results provide the strongest evidence to date on the neuroanatomical correlates of personality and highlights challenges in using this approach to understanding the neural correlates of personality.
