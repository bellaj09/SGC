The aim of the Rural Medicine Rotation RMR at the University of Queensland is to give all third year medical students exposure to and an understanding of clinical practice in Australian rural or remote locations. Because the primary role of the Rural Clinical School is to improve medical recruitment and retention in rural areas the provision of positive student learning experiences and subsequent ability to make adequately informed rural career choices is of fundamental importance. A difficulty in achieving this is the relatively short period of student clinical placements in only one or two rural or remote locations. A web-based Clinical Discussion Board CDB has been introduced to address this problem by allowing students at all clinical sites to discuss their rural experiences and clinical issues with each other. The rationale behind the CDB is to encourage an enhanced understanding of the breadth and depth of rural medicine through peer-based learning. Tradition and technology: teaching rural medicine using an internet discussion board.
