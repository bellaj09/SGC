Sufficient prefrontal top-down control of limbic affective areas especially the amygdala is essential for successful effortful emotion regulation ER. Difficulties in effortful ER have been seen in patients with bipolar disorder BD which could be suggestive of a disturbed prefrontal-amygdala regulation circuit. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BD patients show abnormal effective connectivity from the prefrontal areas to the amygdala during effortful ER reappraisal. Altered frontal-amygdala effective connectivity during effortful emotion regulation in bipolar disorder.
