Objective: Commercially available active videogames AVGs are promising rehabilitation options but lack of familiarity with game options may limit clinical integration. We evaluated content and format usability of the \Kinect-ing\ with Clinicians KwiC website an online tool that characterizes commercially available games to support clinical decision-making about Kinect game use for rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional online survey of physical therapists PTs. Participants selected a case scenario and reviewed the KwiC resource for information about five Kinect games. Based on this interaction participants selected two games that would meet case scenario goals and answered Likert scale and open-ended questions about KwiC usability and usefulness of the content in guiding game selection for clinical case scenarios. Results: Twenty-five PTs participated six of whom had previous AVG experience. All KwiC items achieved prespecified consensus of 80% "agree" or "strongly agree" on statements evaluating ease of understanding usefulness and format usability. There were no differences in ratings between those with and without AVG experience. Participants most appreciated the videos illustrating game play. Eighty-four percent strongly agreed that the KwiC helped them to make a decision about their case scenario. Participants suggested improving the KwiC by including more information about game use with rehabilitation populations. Conclusions: Positive usability feedback supports continued KwiC development efforts to add additional games expand information about use specific to clinical populations and broaden the online format to allow opportunities for clinicians to provide feedback and suggestions. We will then evaluate utility of the KwiC in clinical practice.
