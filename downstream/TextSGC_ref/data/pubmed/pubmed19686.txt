"This chapter outlines the use in psychotherapy and medical diagnosis of an intelligent software system that helps clients to explore Personal Myth within virtual reality environments. Patented MYTHSEEKER software will allow clients to work with mythic analogues of lifeshapes and aspirations. This can help to focus therapy directions find ways to participate with the persons world and allow a kind of personal expression not previously possible. The software phases of assessment facilitation and enaction are described by which the client is assisted to explore systems of mythology or spirituality called Depth Systems that are traditional ancient or newly-arising. The client builds a Personal Depth System representing Personal Myth based on experiencing other Depth Systems which can itself be experienced in the virtual environment. This paper outlines our methodology and technology to realize these operations. Space limitations prevent further description in the present chapter of MYTHSEEKER software technology or psychotherapy scenarios of involvement."
