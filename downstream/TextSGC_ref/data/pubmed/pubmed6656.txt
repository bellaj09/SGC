This study investigated whether resting-state functional connectivity is associated with long-term clinical outcomes of patients with schizophrenia. Resting-state brain images were obtained from 79 outpatients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls HC using a 3\u202fT-MRI scanner. All patients were 20-50\u202fyears old with >3\u202fyears\ duration of illness and appeared clinically stable. We assessed their psychopathology using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale BPRS-18 and divided them into "good" "moderate" and "poor" outcome SZ-GO SZ-MO and SZ-PO groups depending on BPRS-18 total score. We obtained individual functional connectivity maps between a seed region of the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex PCC and all other brain regions and compared the functional connectivity of the default mode network DMN among the HC and 3 schizophrenia outcome groups with a voxel-wise threshold of P\u202f<\u202f.001 within a cluster-extent threshold of 114 voxels. Additionally we assessed correlations between functional connectivity and BPRS-18 scores. The SZ-MO and SZ-PO groups showed decreased functional connectivity between PCC and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmPFC left middle cingulate cortex and left frontopolar cortex FPC compared to the SZ-GO and HC groups. DMN connectivity in the right vmPFC and left FPC negatively correlated with subscale scores of the BPRS-18 except the negative symptoms subscale. In this study poorer clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia were associated with decreased DMN connectivity. In particular the decreased functional connectivity might be related to the severity of positive and mood symptoms rather than negative symptoms. Default mode network connectivity is associated with long-term clinical outcome in patients with schizophrenia.
