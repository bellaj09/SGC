This is a single blind randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of virtual reality-based training on the community ambulation in individuals with stroke. Twenty subjects with stroke were assigned randomly to either the control group n=9 or the experimental group n=11. Subjects in the control group received the treadmill training. Subjects in the experimental group underwent the virtual reality-based treadmill training. Walking speed community walking time walking ability questionnaire WAQ and activities-specific balance confidence ABC scale were evaluated. Subjects in the experimental group improved significantly in walking speed community walking time and WAQ score at posttraining and 1-month follow-up periods. Their ABC score also significantly increased at posttraining but did not maintain at follow-up period. Regarding the between-group comparisons the experimental group improved significantly more than control group in walking speed P=0.03 and community walking time P=0.04 at posttraining period and in WAQ score P=0.03 at follow-up period. Our results support the perceived benefits of gait training programs that incorporate virtual reality to augment the community ambulation of individuals with stroke.
