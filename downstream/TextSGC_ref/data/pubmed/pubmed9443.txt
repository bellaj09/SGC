"An artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers known as a deep neural network or DNN was employed as a predictive model DNNp for the first time to predict emotional responses using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data from individual subjects. During fMRI data acquisition 10 healthy participants listened to 80 International Affective Digital Sound stimuli and rated their own emotions generated by each sound stimulus in terms of the arousal dominance and valence dimensions. The whole-brain spatial patterns from a general linear model i.e. beta-valued maps for each sound stimulus and the emotional response ratings were used as the input and output for the DNNP respectively. Based on a nested five-fold cross-validation scheme the paired input and output data were divided into training three-fold validation one-fold and test one-fold data. The DNNP was trained and optimized using the training and validation data and was tested using the test data. The Pearsons correlation coefficients between the rated and predicted emotional responses from our DNNP model with weight sparsity optimization mean\u202f\u202fstandard error 0.52\u202f\u202f0.02 for arousal 0.51\u202f\u202f0.03 for dominance and 0.51\u202f\u202f0.03 for valence with an input denoising level of 0.3 and a mini-batch size of 1 were significantly greater than those of DNN models with conventional regularization schemes including elastic net regularization 0.15\u202f\u202f0.05 0.15\u202f\u202f0.06 and 0.21\u202f\u202f0.04 for arousal dominance and valence respectively those of shallow models including logistic regression 0.11\u202f\u202f0.04 0.10\u202f\u202f0.05 and 0.17\u202f\u202f0.04 for arousal dominance and valence respectively; average of logistic regression and sparse logistic regression and those of support vector machine-based predictive models SVMps; 0.12\u202f\u202f0.06 0.06\u202f\u202f0.06 and 0.10\u202f\u202f0.06 for arousal dominance and valence respectively; average of linear and non-linear SVMps. This difference was confirmed to be significant with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of less than 0.001 from a one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and subsequent paired t-test. The weights of the trained DNNPs were interpreted and input patterns that maximized or minimized the output of the DNNPs i.e. the emotional responses were estimated. Based on a binary classification of each emotion category e.g. high arousal vs. low arousal the error rates for the DNNP 31.2%\u202f\u202f1.3% for arousal 29.0%\u202f\u202f1.7% for dominance and 28.6%\u202f\u202f3.0% for valence were significantly lower than those for the linear SVMP 44.7%\u202f\u202f2.0% 50.7%\u202f\u202f1.7% and 47.4%\u202f\u202f1.9% for arousal dominance and valence respectively and the non-linear SVMP 48.8%\u202f\u202f2.3% 52.2%\u202f\u202f1.9% and 46.4%\u202f\u202f1.3% for arousal dominance and valence respectively as confirmed by the Bonferroni-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.001 from the one-way ANOVA. Our study demonstrates that the DNNp model is able to reveal neuronal circuitry associated with human emotional processing - including structures in the limbic and paralimbic areas which include the amygdala prefrontal areas anterior cingulate cortex insula and caudate. Our DNNp model was also able to use activation patterns in these structures to predict and classify emotional responses to stimuli."
