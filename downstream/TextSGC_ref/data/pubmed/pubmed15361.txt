The virtual articulator VA is intended for use as a tool for the analysis fo the complex static and dynamic occlusal relations. Its chief application is in individual diagnosis and the simulation of the mechanical articulator. As entry data the VA requires digital 3-dimensional representations of the jaws and patient-specific data on jaw movement. It then simulates jaw movement and provides a dynamic visualization of the occlusal contacts. If no patient-specific data are available the modus operandi of the mechanical articulator can be simulated. Virtual reality VR techniques applied in computer-aided diagnosis are revolutionizing medical routine in many disciplines. Particularly in the field of dental engineering VR combined with CAD/CAM technology has great potential in implant planning and design in terms of greater precision and shorter treatment duration. The geometry of teeth can be digitized the implant models can be designed with specialized CAD systems and the final implants can be manufactured with a CNC machine. In this context the virtual articulator completes the digital manufacturing process. The virtual articulator.
