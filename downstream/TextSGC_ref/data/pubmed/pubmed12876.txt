The objective of the present study was to investigate whether deep learning could be applied successfully to the classification of images from colposcopy. For this purpose a total of 158 patients who underwent conization were enrolled and medical records and data from the gynecological oncology database were retrospectively reviewed. Deep learning was performed with the Keras neural network and TensorFlow libraries. Using preoperative images from colposcopy as the input data and deep learning technology the patients were classified into three groups severe dysplasia carcinoma in situ CIS and invasive cancer IC. A total of 485 images were obtained for the analysis of which 142 images were of severe dysplasia 2.9 images/patient 257 were of CIS 3.3 images/patient and 86 were of IC 4.1 images/patient. Of these 233 images were captured with a green filter and the remaining 252 were captured without a green filter. Following the application of L2 regularization L1 regularization dropout and data augmentation the accuracy of the validation dataset was ~50%. Although the present study is preliminary the results indicated that deep learning may be applied to classify colposcopy images.
