We adopted a fusion approach that combines features from simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram EEG and magnetoencephalogram MEG signals to improve classification performances in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. We applied our approach to a group of 15 healthy subjects and found a significant classification performance enhancement as compared to standard single-modality approaches in the alpha and beta bands. Taken together our findings demonstrate the advantage of considering multimodal approaches as complementary tools for improving the impact of noninvasive BCIs.
