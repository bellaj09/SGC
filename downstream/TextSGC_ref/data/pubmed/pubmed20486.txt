Virtual reality VR technology has a great potential in the field of medical simulation due to its immersion interactivity and autonomy. It provides a new direction for integration and application in various disciplines. Combination of VR technology and clinical practice brings great convenience for medical education and experiments. Modern VR simulators can create realistic environments that capture minute anatomical details with high accuracy and solves the problem of difficulty in mass productions with traditional devices. Taking gastroscopy simulation system as an example this paper discusses the development and application of VR animation technology together with its excellent performance and current research status in surgery scientific research training and education. The Development and Application of Virtual Reality Animation Simulation Technology: Take Gastroscopy Simulation System as an Example.
