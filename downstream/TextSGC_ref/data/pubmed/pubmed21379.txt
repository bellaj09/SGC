We present our systematic efforts in advancing the computational performance of physically accurate soft tissue cutting simulation which is at the core of surgery simulators in general. We demonstrate a real-time performance of 15 simulation frames per second for haptic soft tissue cutting of a deformable body at an effective resolution of 170000 finite elements. This is achieved by the following innovative components: 1 a linked octree discretization of the deformable body which allows for fast and robust topological modifications of the simulation domain 2 a composite finite element formulation which thoroughly reduces the number of simulation degrees of freedom and thus enables to carefully balance simulation performance and accuracy 3 a highly efficient geometric multigrid solver for solving the linear systems of equations arising from implicit time integration 4 an efficient collision detection algorithm that effectively exploits the composition structure and 5 a stable haptic rendering algorithm for computing the feedback forces. Considering that our method increases the finite element resolution for physically accurate real-time soft tissue cutting simulation by an order of magnitude our technique has a high potential to significantly advance the realism of surgery simulators.
