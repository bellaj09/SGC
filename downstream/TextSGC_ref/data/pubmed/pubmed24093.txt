The proposal that humans can develop cognitive maps of their environment has a long and controversial history. We suggest an individual-differences approach to this question instead of a normative one. Specifically there is evidence that some people derive flexible map-like representations from information acquired during navigation whereas others store much less accurate information. Our research uses a virtual-reality paradigm in which two routes are learned and must be related to each other. It defines 3 groups: Integrators Non-integrators and Imprecise Navigators. These groups show distinctive patterns of spatial skills and working memory as well as personality. We contrast our approach with research challenging the cognitive map hypothesis and offer directions for rapprochement between the two views.
