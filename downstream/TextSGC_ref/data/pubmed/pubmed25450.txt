Brain-computer interfaces based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI-BCI allow volitional control of anatomically specific regions of the brain. Technological advancement in higher field MRI scanners fast data acquisition sequences preprocessing algorithms and robust statistical analysis are anticipated to make fMRI-BCI more widely available and applicable. This noninvasive technique could potentially complement the traditional neuroscientific experimental methods by varying the activity of the neural substrates of a region of interest as an independent variable to study its effects on behavior. If the neurobiological basis of a disorder e.g. chronic pain motor diseases psychopathy social phobia depression is known in terms of abnormal activity in certain regions of the brain fMRI-BCI can be targeted to modify activity in those regions with high specificity for treatment. In this paper we review recent results of the application of fMRI-BCI to neuroscientific research and psychophysiological treatment.
