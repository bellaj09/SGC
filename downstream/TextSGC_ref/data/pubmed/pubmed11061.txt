"Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems such as the Iris software. It is consequently an expensive process that can in addition suffer from geospatial discrepancies thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence specifically the rise of deep learning methods has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from which is typically their main limiting factor. However the CpiDc Centre dpidmiologie sur les causes mdicales de Dcs stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner."
