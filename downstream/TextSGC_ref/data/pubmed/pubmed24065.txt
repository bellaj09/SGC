This study explored the feasibility and safety of pairing the Microsoft Kinect sensor with the Oculus Rift Head Mounted Display HMD as a telerehabilitation technology platform for persons post-stroke. To test initial safety fourteen participants without disabilities age 30  8.8 years engaged in a game-based task using the Microsoft Kinect with a first-person view using the Oculus Rift. These tasks were repeated for five participants post-stroke age 56  3.0 years. No significant adverse events occurred in either study population. When using the Oculus Rift HMD three participants without disabilities reported dizziness and nausea. All of the participants post-stroke required hands-on assistance for balance and fall prevention. The intensive nature of physical support necessary for this type of interaction limits the application as a telerehabilitation intervention. Given the increasing availability of HMDs for commercial use it is crucial that the safety of immersive games and technologies for telerehabilitation is fully explored.
