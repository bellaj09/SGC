Functional interfaces between electronics and biological matter are essential to diverse fields including health sciences and bio-engineering. Here we report the discovery of spontaneous no external energy input hydrogen transfer from biological glucose reactions into SmNiO3 an archetypal perovskite quantum material. The enzymatic oxidation of glucose is monitored down to ~5\u2009\u200910-16 M concentration via hydrogen transfer to the nickelate lattice. The hydrogen atoms donate electrons to the Ni d orbital and induce electron localization through strong electron correlations. By enzyme specific modification spontaneous transfer of hydrogen from the neurotransmitter dopamine can be monitored in physiological media. We then directly interface an acute mouse brain slice onto the nickelate devices and demonstrate measurement of neurotransmitter release upon electrical stimulation of the striatum region. These results open up avenues for use of emergent physics present in quantum materials in trace detection and conveyance of bio-matter bio-chemical sciences and brain-machine interfaces.
