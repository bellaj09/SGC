Rotating machinery usually suffers from a type of fault where the fault feature extracted in the frequency domain is significant while the fault feature extracted in the time domain is insignificant. For this type of fault a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method developed in the frequency domain can reach high accuracy performance without real-time performance whereas a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method developed in the time domain obtains real-time diagnosis with lower diagnosis accuracy. In this paper a multimodal feature fusion-based deep learning method for accurate and real-time online diagnosis of rotating machinery is proposed. The proposed method can directly extract the potential frequency of abnormal features involved in the time domain data. Firstly multimodal features corresponding to the original data the slope data and the curvature data are firstly extracted by three separate deep neural networks. Then a multimodal feature fusion is developed to obtain a new fused feature that can characterize the potential frequency feature involved in the time domain data. Lastly the fused new feature is used as the input of the Softmax classifier to achieve a real-time online diagnosis result from the frequency-type fault data. A simulation experiment and a case study of the bearing fault diagnosis confirm the high efficiency of the method proposed in this paper.
