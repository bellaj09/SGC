The functional communications between brain regions are thought to be dynamic. However it is usually difficult to elucidate whether the observed dynamic connectivity is functionally meaningful or simply due to noise during unconstrained task conditions such as resting-state. During naturalistic conditions such as watching a movie it has been shown that local brain activities e.g. in the visual cortex are consistent across subjects. Following similar logic we propose to study intersubject correlations of the time courses of dynamic connectivity during naturalistic conditions to extract functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity patterns. We analyzed a functional MRI fMRI dataset when the subjects watched a short animated movie. We calculated dynamic connectivity by using sliding window technique and quantified the intersubject correlations of the time courses of dynamic connectivity. Although the time courses of dynamic connectivity are thought to be noisier than the original signals we found similar level of intersubject correlations of dynamic connectivity to those of regional activity. Most importantly highly consistent dynamic connectivity could occur between regions that did not show high intersubject correlations of regional activity and between regions with little stable functional connectivity. The analysis highlighted higher order brain regions such as the default mode network that dynamically interacted with posterior visual regions during the movie watching which may be associated with the understanding of the movie. Intersubject consistent dynamic connectivity during natural vision revealed by functional MRI.
