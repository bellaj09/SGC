In most paradigms for Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs that are based on Event-Related Potentials ERPs stimuli are presented with a pre-defined and constant speed. In order to boost BCI performance by optimizing the parameters of stimulation this offline study investigates the impact of the stimulus onset asynchrony SOA on ERPs and the resulting classification accuracy. The SOA is defined as the time between the onsets of two consecutive stimuli which represents a measure for stimulation speed. A simple auditory oddball paradigm was tested in 14 SOA conditions with a SOA between 50 ms and 1000 ms. Based on an offline ERP analysis the BCI performance quantified by the Information Transfer Rate ITR in bits/min was simulated. A great variability in the simulated BCI performance was observed within subjects N=11. This indicates a potential increase in BCI performance  1.6 bits/min for ERP-based paradigms if the stimulation speed is specified for each user individually. How stimulation speed affects Event-Related Potentials and BCI performance.
