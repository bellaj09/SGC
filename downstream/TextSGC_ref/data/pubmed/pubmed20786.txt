"The connection between health literacy and health outcomes includes access and utilization of healthcare services patient/provider interaction and self-care. Digital approaches can be designed to simplify or expand on a concept test for understanding and do not have a time constraint. New technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning virtual and augmented reality and blockchain can move the role of technology beyond data collection to a more integrated system. Rather than being a passive participant digital solutions provide the opportunity for the individual to be an active participant in their health. These solutions can be delivered in a way that builds or enhances the individuals belief that the plan will be successful and more confidence that they can stick with it. Digital solutions allow for the delivery of multi-media education such as videos voice and print at different reading levels in multiple languages using formal and informal teaching methods. By giving the patient a greater voice and empowering them to be active participants in their care they can develop their decision making and shared decision making skills. The first step in our health literacy instructional model is to address the emotional state of the person. Once the emotional state has been addressed and an engagement strategy has been deployed the final phase is the delivery of an educational solution. While a clear definition of health literacy and an instructional model are important further research must be done to continually determine more effective ways to incorporate health technology in the process of improving health outcomes."
