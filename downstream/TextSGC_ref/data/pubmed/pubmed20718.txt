Brain Computer Interfaces could be useful in rehabilitation of movement perhaps also for gait. Until recently research on movement related brain signals has not included measuring electroencephalography EEG during walking because of the potential artifacts. We investigated if it is possible to measure the event Related Desynchronization ERD and event related spectral perturbations ERSP during walking. Six subjects walked on a treadmill with a slow speed while EEG electromyography EMG of the neck muscles and step cycle were measured. A Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA was used to remove EMG artifacts from the EEG signals. It was shown that this method correctly deleted EMG components. A strong ERD in the mu band and a somewhat less strong ERD in the beta band were found during walking compared to a baseline period. Furthermore lateralized ERSPs were found depending on the phase in the step cycle. It is concluded that this is a promising method to use in BCI research on walking. These results therefore pave the way for using brain signals related to walking in a BCI context. Feasibility of measuring event related desynchronization with electroencephalography during walking.
