Cardiac Rehabilitation CR programs focused on improving the health trajectory of patients with cardiovascular disease strive to increase physical activity PA and cardiorespiratory fitness. However historically low compliance with recommended PA has prompted exploration of alternatives to traditional courses of exercise therapy. One alternative exergaming or the requirement of physical exercise inherent to a video game\s activities has shown to have a promising impact in improving patient self-efficacy for exercise training using digital hardware eg the Wii or the Xbox Kinect. Furthermore novel technologies in virtual reality can provide an engaging immersive environment for exergaming techniques maximizing goal-oriented training and building self-efficacy for patients during CR. Many groundbreaking institutions are already calculating energy expenditure of commercially successful virtual reality games and finding promise in the cardiometabolic responses to a number of virtual reality games. Research is still limited in establishing the efficacy of these games but virtual reality and exergaming are quickly proving to be appropriate and equivalent alternatives to traditional exercise programs. Though studies have examined the impact of prescriptive exergaming on PA they have yet to examine the potential for genuine integration of game-based motivational techniques and immersive environments into clinical interaction. The purpose of this review is to describe the current body of evidence and the impact and future potential of virtual reality and exergaming. Further we will introduce the concept of a "Clinical Arcade" as a new approach to integration of these techniques in CR care.
