Neurofeedback of event-related desynchronization ERD in electroencephalograms EEG of the sensorimotor cortex SM1 using a brain-computer interface BCI paradigm is a powerful tool to promote motor recovery from post-stroke hemiplegia. However the feedback delay attenuates the degree of motor learning and neural plasticity. Online detection of amplitude modulation of motor-related EEG desynchronization using a lock-in amplifier: Comparison with a fast Fourier transform a continuous wavelet transform and an autoregressive algorithm.
