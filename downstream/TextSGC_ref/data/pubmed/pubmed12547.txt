"Prediction of Alzheimers disease AD from Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI has become popular in recent years. Especially deep learning technique has been used to extract high-quality features and for classification in this topic. Whether the patient would converse from MCI into AD is a particular evaluation criteria in clinics. However there is no such a conversion prediction model in literature. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a decision supporting model based on deep learning and machine learning to predict the conversion probability from MCI into AD within one year. We analyzed 165 samples with MRI scans from Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI database in which all MCI patients were converted into AD in different time span for conversion. In this model we first extracted image features based on convolutional neural network CNN method and then we used support vector machine SVM classifier to classify these features. The results showed that the classification accuracy using linear polynomial and RBF kernel could achieve 91.0% 90.0% and 92.3%. As a result this study indicated that the decision supporting model is potential to be applied into predicting the conversion probability from MCI into AD within one year."
