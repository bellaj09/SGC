Virtual reality technology may provide new options for conducting perceptual-motor assessment within simulated 3D environments for persons with a wide range of disabilities. This paper outlines our work developing a series of game-like VR scenarios to assess and rehabilitate eye-hand coordination range of motion and other relevant perceptual-motor activities. Our efforts have focused on building engaging game-based stereoscopic graphic scenarios that allow clients to participate in perceptual-motor rehabilitation by interacting with 3D stimuli within a full 360-degree space using a head mounted display or by way of a "face-forward" format using 3D projection displays. Exploratory work using multiple video sensors to detect and track 3D body motion identify body postures and quantify motor performance is also described. Design and development of virtual reality based perceptual-motor rehabilitation scenarios.
