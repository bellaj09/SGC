Remarkable progress has been made in image classification and segmentation due to the recent study of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs. To solve the similar problem of diagnostic lung nodule detection in low-dose computed tomography CT scans we propose a new Computer-Aided Detection CAD system using CNNs and CT image segmentation techniques. Unlike former studies focusing on the classification of malignant nodule types or relying on prior image processing in this work we put raw CT image patches directly in CNNs to reduce the complexity of the system. Specifically we split each CT image into several patches which are divided into 6 types consisting of 3 nodule types and 3 non-nodule types. We compare the performance of ResNet with different CNNs architectures on CT images from a publicly available dataset named the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative LIDC-IDRI. Results show that our best model reaches a high detection sensitivity of 92.8% with 8 false positives per scan FPs/scan. Compared with related work our work obtains a state-of-the-art effect.
