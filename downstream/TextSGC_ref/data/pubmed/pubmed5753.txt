"In this work we propose a natural model for information flow in the brain through a neural message-passing dynamics on a structural network of macroscopic regions such as the human connectome HC. In our model each brain region is assumed to have a binary behavior active or not the strengths of interactions among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation BP algorithm working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network DMN of the brain which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover we use Susceptibility Propagation SP to compute the matrix of long-range correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks RSN determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new model we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural alterations like in Alzheimers disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations suggested by the model as well as the role of criticality are discussed."
