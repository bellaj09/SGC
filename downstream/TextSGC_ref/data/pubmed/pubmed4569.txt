Adults with psychotic disorders have dysconnectivity in critical brain networks including the default mode DM and the cingulo-opercular CO networks. However it is unknown whether such deficits are present in youth with less severe symptoms. We conducted a multivariate connectome-wide association study examining dysconnectivity with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a population-based cohort of 188 youths aged 8-22 years with psychosis-spectrum PS symptoms and 204 typically developing TD comparators. We found evidence for multi-focal dysconnectivity in PS youths implicating the bilateral anterior cingulate frontal pole medial temporal lobe opercular cortex and right orbitofrontal cortex. Follow-up seed-based and network-level analyses demonstrated that these results were driven by hyper-connectivity among DM regions and diminished connectivity among CO regions as well as diminished coupling between frontal and DM regions. Collectively these results provide novel evidence for functional dysconnectivity in PS youths which show marked correspondence to abnormalities reported in adults with established psychotic disorders.
