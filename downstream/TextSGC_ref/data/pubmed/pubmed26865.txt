Embodiment of a virtual body was induced and its movements were controlled by two different brain-computer interface BCI paradigms - one based on signals from sensorimotor versus one from visual cortical areas. BCI-control of movements engenders agency but not equally for all paradigms. Cortical sensorimotor activation correlates with agency and responsibility. This has significant implications for neurological rehabilitation and neuroethics. Agency and responsibility over virtual movements controlled through different paradigms of brain-computer interface.
