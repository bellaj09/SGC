Although AR technology has been largely dominated by visual media a number of AR tools using both visual and auditory feedback have been developed specifically to assist people with low vision or blindness - an application domain that we term Augmented Reality for Visual Impairment AR4VI. We describe two AR4VI tools developed at Smith-Kettlewell as well as a number of pre-existing examples. We emphasize that AR4VI is a powerful tool with the potential to remove or significantly reduce a range of accessibility barriers. Rather than being restricted to use by people with visual impairments AR4VI is a compelling universal design approach offering benefits for mainstream applications as well. AR4VI: AR as an Accessibility Tool for People with Visual Impairments.
