"Nowadays more than half of the worlds population lives in urban areas and this number continues increasing. Consequently there are more and more scientific publications that analyze health problems of people associated with living in these highly urbanized locations. In particular some of the recent work has focused on relating peoples health to the quality and quantity of urban green areas. In this context and considering the huge amount of land area in large cities that must be supervised our work seeks to develop a deep learning-based solution capable of determining the level of health of the land and to assess whether it is contaminated. The main purpose is to provide health institutions with software capable of creating updated maps that indicate where these phenomena are presented as this information could be very useful to guide public health goals in large cities. Our software is released as open source code and the data used for the experiments presented in this paper are also freely available."
