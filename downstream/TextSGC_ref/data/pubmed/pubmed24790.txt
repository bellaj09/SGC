Complex maxillofacial malformations continue to present challenges in analysis and correction beyond modern technology. The purpose of this paper is to present a virtual-reality workbench for surgeons to perform virtual orthognathic surgical planning and soft-tissue prediction in three dimensions. A resulting surgical planning system i.e. three-dimensional virtual-reality surgical-planning and soft-tissue prediction for orthognathic surgery consists of four major stages: computed tomography CT data post-processing and reconstruction three-dimensional 3-D color facial soft-tissue model generation virtual surgical planning and simulation soft-tissue-change preoperative prediction. The surgical planning and simulation are based on a 3-D CT reconstructed bone model whereas the soft-tissue prediction is based on color texture-mapped and individualized facial soft-tissue model. Our approach is able to provide a quantitative osteotomy-simulated bone model and prediction of postoperative appearance with photorealistic quality. The prediction appearance can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point using a low-cost personal-computer-based system. This cost-effective solution can be easily adopted in any hospital for daily use. Three-dimensional virtual-reality surgical planning and soft-tissue prediction for orthognathic surgery.
