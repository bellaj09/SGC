"Using a deep neural network we demonstrate a digital staining technique which we term PhaseStain to transform the quantitative phase images QPI of label-free tissue sections into images that are equivalent to the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples that are histologically stained. Through pairs of image data QPI and the corresponding brightfield images acquired after staining we train a generative adversarial network and demonstrate the effectiveness of this virtual-staining approach using sections of human skin kidney and liver tissue matching the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin Jones stain and Massons trichrome stain respectively. This digital-staining framework may further strengthen various uses of label-free QPI techniques in pathology applications and biomedical research in general by eliminating the need for histological staining reducing sample preparation related costs and saving time. Our results provide a powerful example of some of the unique opportunities created by data-driven image transformations enabled by deep learning."
