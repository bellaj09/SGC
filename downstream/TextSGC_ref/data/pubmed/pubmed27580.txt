Abnormal expansion of hexanucleotide GGGGCC G4C2 in the C9ORF72 gene has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders with particularly high prevalence in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and frontotemporal dementia FTD. Repeat expansions of this type have been associated with altered pathology symptom rate and severity as well as psychological changes. In this study we enrolled twenty-five patients with ALS and fifteen neurologically healthy controls in a P300 brain-computer interface BCI training procedure. Four of the patients were found to possess an expanded allele which was associated with a reduction in the quality of evoked potentials that led to reduced performance on the BCI task. Our findings warrant further exploration of the relationship between brain function and G4C2 repeat length. Such a relationship suggests that personalized assessment of suitability of BCI as a communication device in patients with ALS may be feasible. Expansion of C9ORF72 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis correlates with brain-computer interface performance.
