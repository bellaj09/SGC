Pegasus outperformed 5 of the 6 ophthalmologists in terms of diagnostic performance and there was no statistically significant difference between the deep learning system and the "best case" consensus between the ophthalmologists. The agreement between Pegasus and gold standard was 0.715 whereas the highest ophthalmologist agreement with the gold standard was 0.613. Furthermore the high sensitivity of Pegasus makes it a valuable tool for screening patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
