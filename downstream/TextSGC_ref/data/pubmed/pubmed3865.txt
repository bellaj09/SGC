It has recently become evident that the functional connectome of the human brain is a dynamical entity whose time evolution carries important information underpinning physiological brain function as well as its disease-related aberrations. While simple sliding window approaches have had some success in estimating dynamical brain connectivity in a functional MRI fMRI context these methods suffer from limitations related to the arbitrary choice of window length and limited time resolution. Recently Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic GARCH models have been employed to generate dynamical covariance models which can be applied to fMRI. Here we employ a GARCH-based method dynamic conditional correlation - DCC to estimate dynamical brain connectivity in the Human Connectome Project HCP dataset and study how the dynamic functional connectivity behaviors related to personality as described by the five-factor model. Openness a trait related to curiosity and creativity is the only trait associated with significant differences in the amount of time-variability but not in absolute median connectivity of several inter-network functional connections in the human brain. The DCC method offers a novel window to extract dynamical information which can aid in elucidating the neurophysiological underpinning of phenomena to which conventional static brain connectivity estimates are insensitive.
