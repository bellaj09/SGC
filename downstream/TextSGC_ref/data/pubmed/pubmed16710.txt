Deep learning has recently attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in processing audio image and video data. However few studies are devoted to the field of automatic modulation classification AMC. It is one of the most well-known research topics in communication signal recognition and remains challenging for traditional methods due to complex disturbance from other sources. This paper proposes a heterogeneous deep model fusion HDMF method to solve the problem in a unified framework. The contributions include the following: 1 a convolutional neural network CNN and long short-term memory LSTM are combined by two different ways without prior knowledge involved; 2 a large database including eleven types of single-carrier modulation signals with various noises as well as a fading channel is collected with various signal-to-noise ratios SNRs based on a real geographical environment; and 3 experimental results demonstrate that HDMF is very capable of coping with the AMC problem and achieves much better performance when compared with the independent network.
