It remains a mystery why the growth rate of bacteria is higher in low-dose ionizing radiation LDIR environment than that in normal environment. In this study a hypothesis composed of environmental selection and competitive exclusion was firstly proposed from observed phenomena experimental data and microbial ecology. Then a LDIR environment simulator LDIRES was built to cultivate a model organism of bacteria Escherichia coli E.\xa0coli DH5 the accurate response of bacterial population to ionizing radiation intensity variation was measured experimentally and then the precise relative dosage of ionizing radiation E.\xa0coli DH5 population received was calculated by finite element analysis based on drift-diffusion equations of plasma. Finally a highly valid mathematical model expressing the relationship between E.\xa0coli DH5 population and LDIR intensity was developed by system dynamics based on hypotheses experimental data and microbial ecology. Both experiment and simulation results clearly showed that the E.\xa0coli DH5 individuals with greater specific growth rate and lower substrate consumption coefficient would adapt and survive in LDIR environment and those without such adaptability were finally eliminated under the combined effects of ionizing radiation selection and competitive exclusion. Influence mechanism of low-dose ionizing radiation on Escherichia coli DH5 population based on plasma theory and system dynamics simulation.
