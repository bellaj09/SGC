"To elucidate how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding in visual species like primates we jointly examined navigation behavior visual exploration and hippocampal activity as macaque monkeys searched a virtual reality maze for a reward. Cells sensitive to place also responded to one or more variables like head direction point of gaze or task context. Many cells fired at the sight and in anticipation of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner simultaneously encoding the animals logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position view and action contexts. Our findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze therein supporting self-awareness in the construction of space."
