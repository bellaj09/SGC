Although homeoproteins Msx1 and Msx2 the cell-specific transcription regulators have been proven to play multiple roles in the embryogenesis of bone muscle and tooth the functions and mechanisms of Msx1 and Msx2 in the development of the central nervous system of mice after birth are not clear because of the death of Msx1 and Msx1/2 germline-deleted embryo at late gestation of mouse. In current research Nestin-Cre mice was introduced to generate the central nervous system-specific knockout mice Nestin-Cre;Msx1Msx2fl/fl. We found that besides the falling of the body mass and the brain volume the cortical tissue sections and staining showed the decreasing thickness of layer II-IV and declining number of vertebral cells in layer V resulting from Msx1/2 deletion. In addition electrophysiological tests revealed the aberrant action potential parameters of deep pyramidal neurons in Nestin-Cre;Msx12\u202ffl/fl mice which may be related with the ethology impairment displayed in further experiments. We discovered Nestin-Cre;Msx12\u202ffl/fl mice had severe impairment in their athletic ability and kinematic learning ability in rotate test and exhibited hyperactivity in open-field test. Above all our results revealed that deletion of homeoproteins Msx1 and Msx2 could lead to behavioral disorders and suggested that Msx1 and Msx2 played a crucial role in regulating the development and function of the neocortex. In addition our current research provided a new mouse model for understanding the pathogenesis of human central nervous system disease. Loss of homeoprotein Msx1 and Msx2 leading to athletic and kinematic impairment related to the increasing neural excitability of neurons in aberrant neocortex in mice.
