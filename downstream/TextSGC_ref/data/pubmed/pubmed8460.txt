"Issuing of correct prescriptions is a foundation of patient safety. Medication errors represent one of the most important problems in health care with look-alike and sound-alike LASA being the lead error. Existing solutions to prevent LASA still have their limitations. Deep learning techniques have revolutionized identification classifiers in many fields. In search of better image-based solutions for blister package identification problem this study using a baseline deep learning drug identification DLDI aims to understand how identification confusion of look-alike images by human occurs through the cognitive counterpart of deep learning solutions and thereof to suggest further solutions to approach them." A drug identification model developed using deep learning technologies: experience of a medical center in Taiwan.
