Emerging evidence shows that interactive virtual environments VEs may be a promising tool for studying sensorimotor processes and for rehabilitation. However the potential of VEs to recruit action observation-execution neural networks is largely unknown. For the first time a functional MRI-compatible virtual reality system VR has been developed to provide a window into studying brain-behavior interactions. This system is capable of measuring the complex span of hand-finger movements and simultaneously streaming this kinematic data to control the motion of representations of human hands in virtual reality. A virtual reality-based system integrated with fmri to study neural mechanisms of action observation-execution: a proof of concept study.
