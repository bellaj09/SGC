Degree centrality is a widely used measure in complex networks. Within the brain degree relates to other topological features with high-degree nodes i.e. hubs exhibiting high betweenness centrality participation coefficient and within-module z-score. However increasing evidence from neuroanatomical and predictive processing literature suggests that topological properties of a brain network may also be impacted by topography that is anatomical spatial distribution. More specifically cortical limbic areas agranular and dysgranular cortices which occupy an anatomically central position have been proposed to be topologically central and well suited to initiate predictions in the cerebral cortex. We estimated anatomical centrality and showed that it positively correlated with betweenness centrality participation coefficient and communicability analogously to degree. In contrast to degree however anatomical centrality negatively correlated with within-module z-score. Our data suggest that degree centrality and anatomical centrality reflect distinct contributions to cortical organization. Whereas degree would be more related to the amount of information integration performed by an area anatomical centrality would be more related to an area\s position in the predictive hierarchy. Highly anatomically central areas may function as "high-level connectors" integrating already highly integrated information across modules. These results are consistent with a high-level domain-general limbic workspace integrated by highly anatomically central cortical areas.
