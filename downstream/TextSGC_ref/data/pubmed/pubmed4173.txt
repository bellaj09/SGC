Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood and is characterized by inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity. Observations of distributed functional abnormalities in ADHD suggest aberrant large-scale brain network connectivity. However few studies have measured the voxel-wise network centrality of boys with ADHD which captures the functional relationships of a given voxel within the entire connectivity matrix of the brain. Here to examine the network patterns characterizing children with ADHD we recruited 47 boys with ADHD and 21 matched control boys who underwent resting-state functional imaging scanning in a 3.0 T MRI unit. We measured voxel-wise network centrality indexing local functional relationships across the entire brain connectome termed degree centrality DC. Then we chose the brain regions with altered DC as seeds to examine the remote functional connectivity FC of brain regions. We found that boys with ADHD exhibited 1 decreased centrality in the left superior temporal gyrus STG and increased centrality in the left superior occipital lobe SOL and right inferior parietal lobe\xa0IPL; 2 decreased FC between the STG and the putamen and thalamus which belong to the cognitive cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical CSTC loop and increased FC between the STG and medial/superior frontal gyrus within the affective CSTC loop; and 3 decreased connectivity between the SOL and cuneus within the dorsal attention network. Our results demonstrated that patients with ADHD show a connectivity-based pathophysiological process in the cognitive and affective CSTC loops and attention network.
