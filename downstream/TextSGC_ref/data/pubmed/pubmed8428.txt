To train deep learning models to differentiate benign and malignant breast tumors in ultrasound images we need to collect many training samples with clear labels. In general biopsy results can be used as benign/malignant labels. However most clinical samples generally do not have biopsy results. Previous works have proposed generating benign/malignant labels according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System BI-RADS ratings. However this approach will cause noisy labels which means that the benign/malignant labels produced from BI-RADS diagnoses may be inconsistent with the ground truths. Consequently deep models will overfit the noisy labels and hence obtain poor generalization performance. In this work we mainly focus on how to reduce the negative effect of noisy labels when they are used to train breast tumor classification models.
