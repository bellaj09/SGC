The speed of visual brain-computer interfaces BCIs has been greatly improved in recent years. However traditional visual BCI paradigm requires users to directly gaze at the intensive flickering items which would cause severe problems in practical applications such as visual fatigue and excessive visual resources consumption. A promising solution is to use small visual stimuli outside the central visual area to encode instructions which had been demonstrated to be effective in our previous study. This study aims to further investigate the effects of stimulus position on the classification of miniature asymmetric visual evoked potentials aVEPs. Small peripheral visual stimuli were designed with different eccentricities 1 and 2 and directions 0 45 90 135 180 -135 -90 and -45 to induce different kinds of miniature aVEPs. Five subjects participated in this experiment. Discriminative canonical pattern matching DCPM was used to classify all possible pairs of miniature aVEPs. Study results showed that visual stimuli with less eccentricity could induce more distinct miniature aVEPs. The highest single-trial accuracy achieved was about 83% for the binary classifications of miniature aVEPs pairs corresponding to 1 -135 Vs 1 0 1 -45 Vs 1 -135 and 1 -45 Vs 1 180. This finding is very important for the design and development of the miniature aVEPs-based BCIs.
