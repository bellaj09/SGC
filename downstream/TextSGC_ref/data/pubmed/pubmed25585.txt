Altering the normal association between touch and its visual correlate can result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of our own body. Thus when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality IVR to produce radical transformations in body ownership.
