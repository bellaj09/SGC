"Consumer behaviour in 2016 shows that retailers need online/offline integration to better serve their clients. An important distinguishing feature of the physical shop is how it can offer consumers a shopping experience. This study uses two experiments to research the extent a fashion stores shopping experience can be presented to consumers via visual material a regular photo a 360-degree photo and a virtual reality photo of the shop without the consumers being in the shop itself. The effects of these visual materials will also be measured in among others terms of purchase intention visiting intention to the physical shop and online visit satisfaction. A theoretical framework is used to substantiate how the three types of pictures can be classified in terms of medium richness. The completed experiments show among other outcomes that consumers who saw the virtual reality photo of the shop have a more positive shopping experience a higher purchase intention a higher intention to visit the physical shop and more online visit satisfaction than people who have only seen the regular photo or the 360-degree photo of the shop. Enjoyment and novelty seem to partly explain these found effects." The online appeal of the physical shop: How a physical store can benefit from a virtual representation.
