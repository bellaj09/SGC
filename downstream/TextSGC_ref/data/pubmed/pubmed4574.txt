ConnectomeDB is a database for housing and disseminating data about human brain structure function and connectivity along with associated behavioral and demographic data. It is the main archive and dissemination platform for data collected under the WU-Minn consortium Human Connectome Project. Additional connectome-style study data is and will be made available in the database under current and future projects including the Connectome Coordination Facility. The database currently includes multiple modalities of magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetoencephalograpy MEG data along with associated behavioral data. MRI modalities include structural task resting state and diffusion. MEG modalities include resting state and task. Imaging data includes unprocessed minimally preprocessed and analysis data. Imaging data and much of the behavioral data are publicly available subject to acceptance of data use terms while access to some sensitive behavioral data is restricted to qualified investigators under a more stringent set of terms. ConnectomeDB is the public side of the WU-Minn HCP database platform. As such it is geared towards public distribution with a web-based user interface designed to guide users to the optimal set of data for their needs and a robust backend mechanism based on the commercial Aspera fasp service to enable high speed downloads. HCP data is also available via direct shipment of hard drives and Amazon S3. ConnectomeDB--Sharing human brain connectivity data.
