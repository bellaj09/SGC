The Human Connectome Projects in Development HCP-D and Aging HCP-A are two large-scale brain imaging studies that will extend the recently completed HCP Young-Adult HCP-YA project to nearly the full lifespan collecting structural resting-state fMRI task-fMRI diffusion and perfusion MRI in participants from 5 to 100+\xa0years of age. HCP-D is enrolling 1300+\xa0healthy children adolescents and young adults ages 5-21 and HCP-A is enrolling 1200+\xa0healthy adults ages 36-100+ with each study collecting longitudinal data in a subset of individuals at particular age ranges. The imaging protocols of the HCP-D and HCP-A studies are very similar differing primarily in the selection of different task-fMRI paradigms. We strove to harmonize the imaging protocol to the greatest extent feasible with the completed HCP-YA 1200+\xa0participants aged 22-35 but some imaging-related changes were motivated or necessitated by hardware changes the need to reduce the total amount of scanning per participant and/or the additional challenges of working with young and elderly populations. Here we provide an overview of the common HCP-D/A imaging protocol including data and rationales for protocol decisions and changes relative to HCP-YA. The result will be a large rich multi-modal and freely available set of consistently acquired data for use by the scientific community to investigate and define normative developmental and aging related changes in the healthy human brain.
