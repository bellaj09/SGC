Patient-specific quality assurance QA for intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT is a ubiquitous clinical procedure but conventional methods have often been criticized as being insensitive to errors or less effective than other common physics checks. Recently there has been interest in the application of radiomics quantitative extraction of image features to radiotherapy QA. In this work we investigate a deep learning approach to classify the presence or absence of introduced radiotherapy treatment delivery errors from patient-specific QA. Deep learning for patient-specific quality assurance: Identifying errors in radiotherapy delivery by radiomic analysis of gamma images with convolutional neural networks.
