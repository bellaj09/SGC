Gamma-hydroxybutyrate GHB is an endogenous GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist and a narcolepsy treatment. However GHB is also abused for its prohedonic effects. On a neuronal level it was shown that GHB increases regional cerebral blood flow in limbic areas such as the right anterior insula rAI and the anterior cingulate cortex ACC. We aimed to further explore the association between the subjective and neuronal signatures of GHB. Prohedonic properties of gamma-hydroxybutyrate are associated with changes in limbic resting-state functional connectivity.
