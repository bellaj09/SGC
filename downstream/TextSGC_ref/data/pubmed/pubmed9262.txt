Malposition of the acetabular component causes dislocation and prosthetic impingement after Total Hip Arthroplasty THA which significantly affects the postoperative quality of life and implant longevity. The position of the acetabular component is determined by the Pelvic Sagittal Inclination PSI which not only varies among different people but also changes in different positions. It is important to recognize individual dynamic changes of the PSI for patient-specific planning of the THA. Previously PSI was estimated by registering the CT and radiography images. In this study we introduce a new method for accurate estimation of functional PSI without requiring CT image in order to lower radiation exposure of the patient which opens up the possibility of increasing its application in a larger number of hospitals where CT is not acquired as a routine protocol. Fully automatic estimation of pelvic sagittal inclination from anterior-posterior radiography image using deep learning framework.
