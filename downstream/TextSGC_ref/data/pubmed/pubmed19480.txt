We describe WeaVR a computer simulation system that takes virtual reality technology beyond specialized laboratories and research sites and makes it available in any open space such as a gymnasium or a public park. Novel hardware and software systems enable HMD-based immersive virtual reality simulations to be conducted in any arbitrary location with no external infrastructure and little-to-no setup or site preparation. The ability of the WeaVR system to provide realistic motion-tracked navigation for users to improve the study of large-scale navigation and to generate usable behavioral data is shown in three demonstrations. First participants navigated through a full-scale virtual grocery store while physically situated in an open grass field. Trajectory data are presented for both normal tracking and for tracking during the use of redirected walking that constrained users to a predefined area. Second users followed a straight path within a virtual world for distances of up to 2\xa0km while walking naturally and being redirected to stay within the field demonstrating the ability of the system to study large-scale navigation by simulating virtual worlds that are potentially unlimited in extent. Finally the portability and pedagogical implications of this system were demonstrated by taking it to a regional high school for live use by a computer science class on their own school campus.
