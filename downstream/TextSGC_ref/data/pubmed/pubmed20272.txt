Shoulder arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for diagnosis and treatment of a shoulder pathology. The procedure is performed with a fiber optic camera called arthroscope and instruments inserted through very tiny incisions made around the shoulder. The confined shoulder space unintuitive camera orientation and constrained instrument motions complicates the procedure. Therefore surgical competence in arthroscopy entails extensive training especially for psychomotor skills development. Conventional arthroscopy training methods such as mannequins cadavers or apprenticeship model have limited use attributed to their low-fidelity in realism cost inefficiency or incurring high risk. However virtual reality VR based surgical simulators offer a realistic low cost risk-free training and assessment platform where the trainees can repeatedly perform arthroscopy and receive quantitative feedback on their performances. Therefore we are developing a VR based shoulder arthroscopy simulation specifically for the rotator cuff ailments that can quantify the surgery performance. Development of such a VR simulation requires a through task analysis that describes the steps and goals of the procedure comprehensive metrics for quantitative and objective skills and surgical technique assessment.
