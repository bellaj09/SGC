The benefit of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer prevention depends on the adenoma detection rate ADR. The ADR should reflect the adenoma prevalence rate which is estimated to be higher than 50% in the screening-age population. However the ADR by colonoscopists varies from 7% to 53%. It is estimated that every 1% increase in ADR lowers the risk of interval colorectal cancers by 3%-6%. New strategies are needed to increase the ADR during colonoscopy. We tested the ability of computer-assisted image analysis using convolutional neural networks CNNs; a deep learning model for image analysis to improve polyp detection a surrogate of ADR. Deep Learning Localizes and Identifies Polyps in Real Time With 96% Accuracy in Screening Colonoscopy.
