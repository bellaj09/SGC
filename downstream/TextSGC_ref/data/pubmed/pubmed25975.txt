This paper deals with the support of virtual reality computer action in the procedures of surgical robotics. Computer support gives a direct representation of the surgical theatre. The modelization of the procedure in course and in development gives a psychological reaction towards safety and reliability. Robots similar to the ones used by the manufacturing industry can be used with little modification as very effective surgical tools. They have high precision repeatability and are versatile in integrating with the medical instrumentation. Now integrated surgical rooms with computer and robot-assisted intervention are operating. The computer is the element for a decision taking aid and the robot works as a very effective tool. Computer assisted surgery with 3D robot models and visualisation of the telesurgical action.
