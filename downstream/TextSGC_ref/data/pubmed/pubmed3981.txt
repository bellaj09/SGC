In this study we propose a framework to map functional MRI fMRI activation signals using DTI-tractography. This framework which we term functional by structural hierarchical FSH mapping models the regional origin of fMRI brain activation to construct "N-step reachable structural maps". Linear combinations of these N-step reachable maps are then used to predict the observed fMRI signals. Additionally we constructed a utilization matrix which numerically estimates whether the inclusion of a specific structural connection better predicts fMRI using simulated annealing. We applied this framework to a visual fMRI task in a sample of body dysmorphic disorder BDD subjects and comparable healthy controls. Group differences were inferred by comparing the observed utilization differences against 10000 permutations under the null hypothesis. Results revealed that BDD subjects under-utilized several key local connections in the visual system which may help explain previously reported fMRI findings and further elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of BDD. Hierarchical structural mapping for globally optimized estimation of functional networks.
