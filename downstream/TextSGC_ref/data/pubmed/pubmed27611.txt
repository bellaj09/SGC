The P300 Speller brain-computer interface BCI is a virtual keyboard that allows users to type without requiring neuromuscular control. P300 Speller research commonly aims to improve the system accuracy which is typically estimated by spelling a small number of characters and calculating the percent spelled correctly. In this paper we introduce a new method for estimating the long-term "projected" accuracy which utilizes all available flash data and a probabilistic model of the Speller system to produce an estimate with lower variance and lower granularity than the standard measure. We apply the new method to 110 previously-collected P300 Speller runs to confirm its consistency and simulate spelling runs from real subject data to demonstrate lower variance on the accuracy estimate for any given amount of data. Projected accuracy metric for the P300 Speller.
