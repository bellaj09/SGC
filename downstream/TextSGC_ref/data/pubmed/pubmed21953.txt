Self-Organizing Map SOM algorithm as an unsupervised learning method has been applied in anomaly detection due to its capabilities of self-organizing and automatic anomaly prediction. However because of the algorithm is initialized in random it takes a long time to train a detection model. Besides the Cloud platforms with large scale virtual machines are prone to performance anomalies due to their high dynamic and resource sharing characters which makes the algorithm present a low accuracy and a low scalability. To address these problems an Improved Incremental Self-Organizing Map IISOM model is proposed for anomaly detection of virtual machines. In this model a heuristic-based initialization algorithm and a Weighted Euclidean Distance WED algorithm are introduced into SOM to speed up the training process and improve model quality. Meanwhile a neighborhood-based searching algorithm is presented to accelerate the detection time by taking into account the large scale and high dynamic features of virtual machines on cloud platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness experiments on a common benchmark KDD Cup dataset and a real dataset have been performed. Results suggest that IISOM has advantages in accuracy and convergence velocity of anomaly detection for virtual machines on cloud platform. An incremental anomaly detection model for virtual machines.
