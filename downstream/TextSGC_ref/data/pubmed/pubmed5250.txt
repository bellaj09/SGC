Graph theoretical analysis of the community structure of networks attempts to identify the communities or modules to which each node affiliates. However this is in most cases an ill-posed problem as the affiliation of a node to a single community is often ambiguous. Previous solutions have attempted to identify all of the communities to which each node affiliates. Instead of taking this approach we introduce versatility V as a novel metric of nodal affiliation: V\u2009\u20090 means that a node is consistently assigned to a specific community; V\u2009>>\u20090 means it is inconsistently assigned to different communities. Versatility works in conjunction with existing community detection algorithms and it satisfies many theoretically desirable properties in idealised networks designed to maximise ambiguity of modular decomposition. The local minima of global mean versatility identified the resolution parameters of a hierarchical community detection algorithm that least ambiguously decomposed the community structure of a social karate club network and the mouse brain connectome. Our results suggest that nodal versatility is useful in quantifying the inherent ambiguity of modular decomposition. Versatility of nodal affiliation to communities.
