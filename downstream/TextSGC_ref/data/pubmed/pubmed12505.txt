"Evaluating the discrimination ability of a deep convolution neural network for ultrawide-field pseudocolor imaging and ultrawide-field autofluorescence of retinitis pigmentosa. In total the 373 ultrawide-field pseudocolor and ultrawide-field autofluorescence images 150 retinitis pigmentosa; 223 normal obtained from the patients who visited the Department of Ophthalmology Tsukazaki Hospital were used. Training with a convolutional neural network on these learning data objects was conducted. We examined the K-fold cross validation K = 5. The mean area under the curve of the ultrawide-field pseudocolor group was 0.998 95% confidence interval CI 0.9953-1.0 and that of the ultrawide-field autofluorescence group was 1.0 95% CI 0.9994-1.0. The sensitivity and specificity of the ultrawide-field pseudocolor group were 99.3% 95% CI 96.3%-100.0% and 99.1% 95% CI 96.1%-99.7% and those of the ultrawide-field autofluorescence group were 100% 95% CI 97.6%-100% and 99.5% 95% CI 96.8%-99.9% respectively. Heatmaps were in accordance with the clinicians observations. Using the proposed deep neural network model retinitis pigmentosa can be distinguished from healthy eyes with high sensitivity and specificity on ultrawide-field pseudocolor and ultrawide-field autofluorescence images." Accuracy of a deep convolutional neural network in detection of retinitis pigmentosa on ultrawide-field images.
