Recent advancements in deep learning for automated image processing and classification have accelerated many new applications for medical image analysis. However most deep learning algorithms have been developed using reconstructed human-interpretable medical images. While image reconstruction from raw sensor data is required for the creation of medical images the reconstruction process only uses a partial representation of all the data acquired. Here we report the development of a system to directly process raw computed tomography CT data in sinogram-space bypassing the intermediary step of image reconstruction. Two classification tasks were evaluated for their feasibility of sinogram-space machine learning: body region identification and intracranial hemorrhage ICH detection. Our proposed SinoNet a convolutional neural network optimized for interpreting sinograms performed favorably compared to conventional reconstructed image-space-based systems for both tasks regardless of scanning geometries in terms of projections or detectors. Further SinoNet performed significantly better when using sparsely sampled sinograms than conventional networks operating in image-space. As a result sinogram-space algorithms could be used in field settings for triage presence of ICH especially where low radiation dose is desired. These findings also demonstrate another strength of deep learning where it can analyze and interpret sinograms that are virtually impossible for human experts.
