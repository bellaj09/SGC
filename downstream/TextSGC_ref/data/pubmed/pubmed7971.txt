High-grade glioma is the most aggressive and severe brain tumor that leads to death of almost 50% patients in 1-2 years. Thus accurate prognosis for glioma patients would provide essential guidelines for their treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction generally utilizes clinical information and limited handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images MRI which is often time consuming laborious and subjective. In this paper we propose using deep learning frameworks to automatically extract features from multi-modal preoperative brain images i.e. T1 MRI fMRI and DTI of high-grade glioma patients. Specifically we adopt 3D convolutional neural networks CNNs and also propose a new network architecture for using multi-channel data and learning supervised features. Along with the pivotal clinical features we finally train a support vector machine to predict if the patient has a long or short overall survival OS time. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can achieve an accuracy as high as 89.9% We also find that the learned features from fMRI and DTI play more important roles in accurately predicting the OS time which provides valuable insights into functional neuro-oncological applications. 3D Deep Learning for Multi-modal Imaging-Guided Survival Time Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients.
