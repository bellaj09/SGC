"Although shown to have a great utility for a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging dMRI faces a major challenge of low signal-to-noise ratio SNR especially when pushing the spatial resolution for improved delineation of brains fine structure or increasing the diffusion weighting for increased angular contrast or both. Here we introduce a comprehensive denoising framework for denoising magnitude dMRI. The framework synergistically combines the variance stabilizing transform VST with optimal singular value manipulation. The purpose of VST is to transform the Rician data to Gaussian-like data so that an asymptotically optimal singular value manipulation strategy tailored for Gaussian data can be used. The output of the framework is the estimated underlying diffusion signal for each voxel in the image domain. The usefulness of the proposed framework for denoising magnitude dMRI is demonstrated using both simulation and real-data experiments. Our results show that the proposed denoising framework can significantly improve SNR across the entire brain leading to substantially enhanced performances for estimating diffusion tensor related indices and for resolving crossing fibers when compared to another competing method. More encouragingly the proposed method when used to denoise a single average of 7\xa0\u200bTesla Human Connectome Project-style diffusion acquisition provided comparable performances relative to those achievable with ten averages for resolving multiple fiber populations across the brain. As such the proposed denoising method is expected to have a great utility for high-quality high-resolution whole-brain dMRI desirable for many neuroscientific and clinical applications."
