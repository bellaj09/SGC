"Blur occurs naturally when the eye is focused at one distance and an object is presented at another distance. Computer-graphics engineers and vision scientists often wish to create display images that reproduce such depth-dependent blur but their methods are incorrect for that purpose. They take into account the scene geometry pupil size and focal distances but do not properly take into account the optical aberrations of the human eye. We developed a method that by incorporating the viewers optics yields displayed images that produce retinal images close to the ones that occur in natural viewing. We concentrated on the effects of defocus chromatic aberration astigmatism and spherical aberration and evaluated their effectiveness by conducting experiments in which we attempted to drive the eyes focusing response accommodation through the rendering of these aberrations. We found that accommodation is not driven at all by conventional rendering methods but that it is driven surprisingly quickly and accurately by our method with defocus and chromatic aberration incorporated. We found some effect of astigmatism but none of spherical aberration. We discuss how the rendering approach can be used in vision science experiments and in the development of ophthalmic/optometric devices and augmented- and virtual-reality displays."
