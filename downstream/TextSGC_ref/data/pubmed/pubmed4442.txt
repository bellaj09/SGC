"Connectome genetics seeks to uncover how genetic factors shape brain functional connectivity; however the causal impact of a single genes activity on whole-brain networks remains unknown. We tested whether the sole targeted deletion of the mu opioid receptor gene Oprm1 alters the brain connectome in living mice. Hypothesis-free analysis of combined resting-state fMRI diffusion tractography showed pronounced modifications of functional connectivity with only minor changes in structural pathways. Fine-grained resting-state fMRI mapping graph theory and intergroup comparison revealed Oprm1-specific hubs and captured a unique Oprm1 gene-to-network signature. Strongest perturbations occurred in connectional patterns of pain/aversion-related nodes including the mu receptor-enriched habenula node. Our data demonstrate that the main receptor for morphine predominantly shapes the so-called reward/aversion circuitry with major influence on negative affect centers." Deletion of the mu opioid receptor gene in mice reshapes the reward-aversion connectome.
