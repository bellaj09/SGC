"In this research a new method of wheelchair control using a Brain Computer Interface BCI is proposed in an attempt to bridge the gap between in-lab and real life applications we believe it would provide a high level control over the BCI instead of the normal low level commands. It is anticipated to emphasis on mu rhythm to provide the control signals. The wheelchair is equipped with a mapping system which scans the area and provides a map containing information about the users current location and next possible destinations then provides an optimized list of possible trajectories to reach the destination. The paradigm allows users to control the interface using motor imagery and issue commands to switch between possible trajectories and then confirm the choice. Commands trigger the motion of the wheelchair to the intended destination using a user selected path with speed up to 0.5 m/s. The interface also allows the user to interact with different robots through a common robotic system. Evaluation results indicate that this paradigm is indeed usable and could lead to promising outcomes."
