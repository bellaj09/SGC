With the rapid development of deep sequencing techniques in the recent years enhancers have been systematically identified in such projects as FANTOM and ENCODE forming genome-wide landscapes in a series of human cell lines. Nevertheless experimental approaches are still costly and time consuming for large scale identification of enhancers across a variety of tissues under different disease status making computational identification of enhancers indispensable. Predicting enhancers with deep convolutional neural networks.
