This work evaluates a possibility of creating a high-frequency SSVEP-based brain computer interface using a low cost EEG recording hardware - an Emotiv EEG Neuro-headset. Both above aspects are crucial to enable deploying the BCI technology in the consumer market. High frequencies can be used to create a non-tiring and more pleasant interface. Commercial EEG systems as the Emotiv EEG although demonstrating large underperformance are much more affordable than standard clinical-grade EEG amplifiers. A system classifying between two stimuli and rest is designed and tested in two experiments: on five and ten subject respectively. First the accuracy of the system is compared for frequencies in lower range 17Hz 19Hz 23Hz 25Hz and higher range 31Hz 33Hz 37Hz 40Hz. The mean online accuracy is 80%15% for the former and 67%12% for the latter. Second a more thorough investigation is done by evaluating the system for frequencies within a set of 35Hz-40Hz. Although the mean accuracy 64%  22% is relatively low most of the users were able to achieve satisfying accuracy with the mean reaching 82%5% which would allow for an efficient and yet pleasant usage of the BCI system. In each case a user dependent approach is applied with a calibration session lasting about five minutes. EEG feature extraction is done using common spatial pattern CSP filtering canonical correlation analysis CCA and linear discrimination analysis LDA. A high frequency steady-state visually evoked potential based brain computer interface using consumer-grade EEG headset.
