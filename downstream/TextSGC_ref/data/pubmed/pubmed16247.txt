Is there a better way to train and prepare our health care personnel to function in a chemical biological environment while continuing to provide for patient care in a variety of healthcare settings? The purpose of this pilot work was to compare the effectiveness and user satisfaction of the Cath-Sim Intravenous Training System to the traditional IV arm model for teaching and achieving competence at IV insertion while in Mission-Oriented Protective Posture level 4 for Army medical personnel. Grounded in adult psychomotor learning principles and in an established evaluation model participants were tested on both the traditional IV arm and Cath-Sim models and then allowed to practice on each model while at Mission-Oriented Protective Posture level 4. One week later participants were again tested on both models. Outcome measures included 1 a computer-generated score sheet measuring time to success and criterion success/nonsuccess on the Cath-Sim; 2 time and success rating for IV insertion on the IV arm model; and 3 satisfaction evaluations completed by the participants. There were conflicting evaluation scores for recommending one model over the other. Participants felt that there was some benefit to each model depending on user setting and purpose.
