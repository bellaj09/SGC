Artificial intelligence AI is revolutionizing healthcare and transforming the clinical practice of physicians across the world. Radiology has a strong affinity for machine learning and is at the forefront of the paradigm shift as machines compete with humans for cognitive abilities. AI is a computer science simulation of the human mind that utilizes algorithms based on collective human knowledge and the best available evidence to process various forms of inputs and deliver desired outcomes such as clinical diagnoses and optimal treatment options. Despite the overwhelmingly positive uptake of the technology warnings have been published about the potential dangers of AI. Concerns have been expressed reflecting opinions that future medicine based on AI will render radiologists irrelevant. Thus how much of this is based on reality? To answer these questions it is important to examine the facts clarify where AI really stands and why many of these\xa0speculations\xa0are untrue. We aim to debunk the 6 top myths regarding AI in the future of radiologists. Myths and facts about artificial intelligence: why machine- and deep-learning will not replace interventional radiologists.
