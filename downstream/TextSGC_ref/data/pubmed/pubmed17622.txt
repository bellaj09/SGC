Surgical training is undergoing a rapid transformation which has been influenced by advances in computer modeling. Increased pressure to reduce the use of animals in technical training has led to a new approach in teaching microsurgery. This new technology may prove to be a cost-effective portable and nonhazardous way forward in microsurgical training. This paper reviews the current state of available technological models used in microsurgical training. In doing so we review articles from the latest journals and authenticated Internet websites to compare and contrast these various methods. Finally we look at the specific technique that has potential impact on the future modeling of microsurgical techniques. Microsurgery simulators in virtual reality: review.
