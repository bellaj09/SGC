Detailed behavioral analysis is key to understanding the brain-behavior relationship. Here we present deep learning-based methods for analysis of behavior imaging data in mice and humans. Specifically we use three different convolutional neural network architectures and five different behavior tasks in mice and humans and provide detailed instructions for rapid implementation of these methods for the neuroscience community. We provide examples of three dimensional 3D kinematic analysis in the food pellet reaching task in mice three-chamber test in mice social interaction test in freely moving mice with simultaneous miniscope calcium imaging and 3D kinematic analysis of two upper extremity movements in humans reaching and alternating pronation/supination. We demonstrate that the transfer learning approach accelerates the training of the network when using images from these types of behavior video recordings. We also provide code for post-processing of the data after initial analysis with deep learning. Our methods expand the repertoire of available tools using deep learning for behavior analysis by providing detailed instructions on implementation applications in several behavior tests and post-processing methods and annotated code for detailed behavior analysis. Moreover our methods in human motor behavior can be used in the clinic to assess motor function during recovery after an injury such as stroke.
