Application of machine learning techniques for automatic and reliable classification of clinical documents have shown promising results. However machine learning models require abundant training data specific to each target hospital and may not be able to benefit from available labeled data from each of the hospitals due to data variations. Such training data limitations have presented one of the major obstacles for maximising potential application of machine learning approaches in the healthcare domain. We investigated transferability of artificial neural network models across hospitals from different domains representing various age demographic groups i.e. children adults and mixed in order to cope with such limitations.
