Some early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinomas ccRCCs of 7\u202fcm are associated with a poor clinical outcome. In this study we investigated molecular biomarkers associated with aggressive clinical T1 stage ccRCCs of 7\u202fcm which were used to develop a risk prediction tool toward guiding the decision of treatment. Among 1069 nephrectomies performed for ccRCC of 7\u202fcm conducted between January 2008 and December 2014 177 cases with available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were evaluated. An aggressive tumor was defined as a tumor exhibiting synchronous metastasis recurrence or leading to cancer-specific death. Expression levels of six genes FOXC2 CLIP4 PBRM1 BAP1 SETD2 and KDM5C were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR and their relation to clinical outcomes was investigated. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate the expression profiles of selected genes significantly associated with clinical outcomes in multivariate analysis. Using these genes we developed a prediction model of aggressive ccRCC based on logistic regression and deep-learning methods. FOXC2 PBRM1 and BAP1 expression levels were significantly lower in aggressive ccRCC than non-aggressive ccRCC both in univariate and multivariate analysis. The immunohistochemistry result demonstrated the significant downregulation of FOXC2 PBRM1 and BAP1 expression in aggressive ccRCC. Adding immunohistochemical staining results to qRT-PCR the aggressive ccRCC prediction models had the area under the curve AUC of 0.760 and 0.796 and accuracy of 0.759 and 0.852 using the logistic regression method and deep-learning method respectively. Use of these biomarkers and the developed prediction model can help stratify patients with clinical T1 stage ccRCC.
