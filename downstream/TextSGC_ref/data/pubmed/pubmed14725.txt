Machine-learning techniques have led to remarkable advances in data extraction and analysis of medical imaging. Applications of machine learning to breast MRI continue to expand rapidly as increasingly accurate 3D breast and lesion segmentation allows the combination of radiologist-level interpretation eg BI-RADS lexicon data from advanced multiparametric imaging techniques and patient-level data such as genetic risk markers. Advances in breast MRI feature extraction have led to rapid dataset analysis which offers promise in large pooled multiinstitutional data analysis. The object of this review is to provide an overview of machine-learning and deep-learning techniques for breast MRI including supervised and unsupervised methods anatomic breast segmentation and lesion segmentation. Finally it explores the role of machine learning current limitations and future applications to texture analysis radiomics and radiogenomics. Level of Evidence: 3 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn.
