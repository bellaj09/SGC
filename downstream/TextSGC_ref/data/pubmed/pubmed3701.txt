Adolescent changes in human brain function are not entirely understood. Here we used multiecho functional MRI fMRI to measure developmental change in functional connectivity FC of resting-state oscillations between pairs of 330 cortical regions and 16 subcortical regions in 298 healthy adolescents scanned 520 times. Participants were aged 14 to 26 y and were scanned on 1 to 3 occasions at least 6 mo apart. We found 2 distinct modes of age-related change in FC: "conservative" and "disruptive." Conservative development was characteristic of primary cortex which was strongly connected at 14 y and became even more connected in the period from 14 to 26 y. Disruptive development was characteristic of association cortex and subcortical regions where connectivity was remodeled: connections that were weak at 14 y became stronger during adolescence and connections that were strong at 14 y became weaker. These modes of development were quantified using the maturational index MI estimated as Spearman\s correlation between edgewise baseline FC at 14 y Formula: see text and adolescent change in FC Formula: see text at each region. Disruptive systems with negative MI were activated by social cognition and autobiographical memory tasks in prior fMRI data and significantly colocated with prior maps of aerobic glycolysis AG AG-related gene expression postnatal cortical surface expansion and adolescent shrinkage of cortical thickness. The presence of these 2 modes of development was robust to numerous sensitivity analyses. We conclude that human brain organization is disrupted during adolescence by remodeling of FC between association cortical and subcortical areas.
