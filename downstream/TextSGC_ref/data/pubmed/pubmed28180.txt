Two challenges need to be addressed before bringing non-motor mental tasks for brain-computer interface BCI control to persons in a minimally conscious state MCS who can be behaviorally unresponsive even when proven to be consciously aware: first keeping the cognitive demands as low as possible so that they could be fulfilled by persons with MCS. Second increasing the control of experimental protocol i.e. type and timing of the task performance. Evaluation of induced and evoked changes in EEG during selective attention to verbal stimuli.
