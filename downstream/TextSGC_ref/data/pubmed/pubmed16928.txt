"Body ownership the feeling that ones body belongs to oneself is commonly studied with Rubber hand illusion RHI paradigm that allows inducing a temporary illusory feeling of ownership of a life-sized rubber hand. However it remains unclear whether illusory ownership of the fake hand relies on the same mechanisms as ownership of ones own real hand. Here we directly compared ownership of the own hand OH and fake hand FH in the same set of conditions within immersive virtual reality. We obtained behavioral proprioceptive drift and subjective questionnaire measures of ownership and disownership for virtual OH FH and object Obj that were located congruently or incongruently with the participants real hand and were stimulated synchronously or asynchronously with the real hand. Both OH and FH but not Obj were embodied after synchronous stimulation in both locations. Crucially subjective ownership of the OH was stronger than of the FH in congruent location after synchronous stimulation. It was also present after asynchronous stimulation being stronger when the virtual OH was subjectively more similar to the real hand. The results suggest that the detailed appearance of the body might act as an additional component in the construction of body ownership." Visual appearance of the virtual hand affects embodiment in the virtual hand illusion.
