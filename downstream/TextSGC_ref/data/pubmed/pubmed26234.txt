For expanding application of virtual reality such as rehabilitation engineering concerns of cybersicknes should be cleared. We have investigated changes in autonomic regulations under real cycling and virtual mountain biking video with the first-person viewpoint. The results showed that the dominant sensory stimuli affected autonomic regulation with different process. The different process will lead to the hints for preventing cybersickness. Relationships between Sensory Stimuli and Autonomic Regulation During Real and Virtual Exercises.
