EEG-based BCI brain-computer-interface speller especially gaze-independent BCI speller has become a hot topic in recent years. It provides direct spelling device by non-muscular method for people with severe motor impairments and with limited gaze movement. Brain needs to conduct both stimuli-driven and stimuli-related attention in fast presented BCI paradigms for such BCI speller applications. Few researchers studied the mechanism of brain response to such fast presented BCI applications. In this study we compared the distribution of brain activation in visual auditory and audio-visual combined stimuli paradigms using sLORETA standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Between groups comparisons showed the importance of visual and auditory stimuli in audio-visual combined paradigm. They both contribute to the activation of brain regions with visual stimuli being the predominate stimuli. Visual stimuli related brain region was mainly located at parietal and occipital lobe whereas response in frontal-temporal lobes might be caused by auditory stimuli. These regions played an important role in audio-visual bimodal paradigms. These new findings are important for future study of ERP speller as well as the mechanism of fast presented stimuli.
