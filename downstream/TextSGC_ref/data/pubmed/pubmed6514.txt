"Defining the organizational principles of neuronal networks at the cellular scale or micro-connectomics is a key challenge of modern neuroscience. In this Review we focus on graph theoretical parameters of micro-connectome topology often informed by economical principles that conceptually originated with Ramn y Cajals conservation laws. First we summarize results from studies in intact small organisms and in samples from larger nervous systems. We then evaluate the evidence for an economical trade-off between biological cost and functional value in the organization of neuronal networks. Various results suggest that many aspects of neuronal network organization are indeed the outcome of competition between these two fundamental selection pressures."
