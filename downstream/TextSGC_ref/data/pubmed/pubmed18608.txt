Virtual reality simulators provide basic skills training without supervision in a controlled environment free of pressure of operating on patients. Skills obtained through virtual reality simulation training can be transferred on the operating room. However relative evidence is limited with data available only for basic surgical skills and for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No data exist on the effect of virtual reality simulation on performance on advanced surgical procedures. Evidence suggests that performance on virtual reality simulators reliably distinguishes experienced from novice surgeons Limited available data suggest that independent approach on virtual reality simulation training is not different from proctored approach. The effect of virtual reality simulators training on acquisition of basic surgical skills does not seem to be different from the effect the physical simulators. Limited data exist on the effect of virtual reality simulation training on the acquisition of visual spatial perception and stress coping skills. Undoubtedly virtual reality simulation training provides an alternative means of improving performance in laparoscopic surgery. However future research efforts should focus on the effect of virtual reality simulation on performance in the context of advanced surgical procedure on standardization of training on the possibility of synergistic effect of virtual reality simulation training combined with mental training on personalized training.
