The concept of "presence" describes the quality of subjective experience in immersive virtual reality IVR. Presence refers to a specific state of consciousness: we behave and feel as if we actually were in the virtual world even though we know there is nothing there. In their handbook of Virtual Reality Burdea and Coiffet Virtual reality technology Wiley New York 2003 suggested that the experience of presence in IVR would emerge from the combination of three Is: Immersion or capacity to isolate from the external world Interaction or capacity to naturally exploring the virtual environment and Imagination or individual aptitudes with mental imagery. So far several studies have investigated the technological and psychological factors affecting the degree of immersion and interaction. However no study has explored the relationship between perceived presence and mental imagery. Here we aim at filling this gap through a correlational study comparing self-reports about sense of presence and mental imagery abilities. After experiencing two IVR scenarios an art gallery and a living room 142 male and female users were administered with questionnaires assessing the degree of presence Igroup Presence Questionnaire the degree of vividness Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire and control Test of Visual Imagery Control of subjective mental images. Results showed a clear positive correlation between presence and vividness: the higher the vividness of mental images the stronger the reported sense of presence felt in IVR scenarios. Instead the capacity to control mental imagery showed a weaker association with presence. We may conclude that individual differences in the degree of perceived presence and mental imagery ability are associated. The experience of virtual reality: are individual differences in mental imagery associated with sense of presence?
