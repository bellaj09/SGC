Resting state functional connectivity MRI rs-fcMRI may provide a powerful and noninvasive "bridge" for comparing brain function between patients and experimental animal models; however the relationship between human and macaque rs-fcMRI remains poorly understood. Here using a novel surface deformation process for species comparisons in the same anatomical space Van Essen 2004 2005 we found high correspondence but also unique hub topology between human and macaque functional connectomes. The global functional connectivity match between species was moderate to strong r = 0.41 and increased when considering the top 15% strongest connections r = 0.54. Analysis of the match between functional connectivity and the underlying anatomical connectivity derived from a previous retrograde tracer study done in macaques Markov et al. 2012 showed impressive structure-function correspondence in both the macaque and human. When examining the strongest structural connections we found a 70-80% match between structural and functional connectivity matrices in both species. Finally we compare species on two widely used metrics for studying hub topology: degree and betweenness centrality. The data showed topological agreement across the species with nodes of the posterior cingulate showing high degree and betweenness centrality. In contrast nodes in medial frontal and parietal cortices were identified as having high degree and betweenness in the human as opposed to the macaque. Our results provide: 1 a thorough examination and validation for a surface-based interspecies deformation process 2 a strong theoretical foundation for making interspecies comparisons of rs-fcMRI and 3 a unique look at topological distinctions between the species. Bridging the gap between the human and macaque connectome: a quantitative comparison of global interspecies structure-function relationships and network topology.
