Measurement of supervisory attentional control is typically performed by placing task-relevant information in conflict with task-irrelevant information. A number of paper-and-pencil versions of the Stroop task have been developed to assess executive functioning and inhibitory control through the presentation of blocks of multiple Stroop stimuli on a card. While multi-item paper-and-pencil Stroop tasks are often used there are instances when a single-item presentation of Stroop stimuli may be preferable. For example there may be situations when neuropsychologists are interested in precise analysis of reaction times for individual stimuli. A limitation of these modalities is that they may not reflect the cognitive load found in everyday activities that are replete with distractors.
