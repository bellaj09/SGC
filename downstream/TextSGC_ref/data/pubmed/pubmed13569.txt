Fusion genes represent an important class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. ChimerDB is a comprehensive database of fusion genes encompassing analysis of deep sequencing data ChimerSeq and text mining of publications ChimerPub with extensive manual annotations ChimerKB. In this update we present all three modules substantially enhanced by incorporating the recent flood of deep sequencing data and related publications. ChimerSeq now covers all 10 565 patients in the TCGA project with compilation of computational results from two reliable programs of STAR-Fusion and FusionScan with several public resources. In sum ChimerSeq includes 65\xa0945 fusion candidates 21 106 of which were predicted by multiple programs ChimerSeq-Plus. ChimerPub has been upgraded by applying a deep learning method for text mining followed by extensive manual curation which yielded 1257 fusion genes including 777 cases with experimental supports ChimerPub-Plus. ChimerKB includes 1597 fusion genes with publication support experimental evidences and breakpoint information. Importantly we implemented several new features to aid estimation of functional significance including the fusion structure viewer with domain information gene expression plot of fusion positive versus negative patients and a STRING network viewer. The user interface also was greatly enhanced by applying responsive web design. ChimerDB 4.0 is available at http://www.kobic.re.kr/chimerdb/.
