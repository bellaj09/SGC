Background: Some terminal cancer patients wish to "go to a memorable place" or "return home." However owing to various symptom burdens and physical dysfunction these wishes are difficult for them to realize. Objective: The aim of the study is to verify whether simulated travel using virtual reality VR travel is efficacious in improving symptoms in terminal cancer patients. Design: This is a prospective multicenter single-arm study. Setting/Subjects: Twenty participants with terminal cancer were recruited from two palliative care wards; data were collected from November 2017 to April 2018. Measurements: The VR software Google Earth VR was used. The primary endpoint was the change in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System scores for each symptom before and after VR travel. Results: The average age of the participants was 72.3 standard deviation SD\u2009=\u200911.9 years. Significant improvements were observed for pain 2.35 SD\u2009=\u20092.25 vs. 1.15 SD\u2009=\u20092.03 p\u2009=\u20090.005 tiredness 2.90 SD\u2009=\u20092.71 vs. 1.35 SD\u2009=\u20091.90 p\u2009=\u20090.004 drowsiness 2.70 SD\u2009=\u20092.87 vs. 1.35 SD\u2009=\u20092.30 p\u2009=\u20090.012 shortness of breath 1.74 SD\u2009=\u20092.73 vs. 0.35 SD\u2009=\u20090.99 p\u2009=\u20090.022 depression 2.45 SD\u2009=\u20092.63 vs. 0.40 SD\u2009=\u20090.82 p\u2009=\u20090.001 anxiety 2.60 SD\u2009=\u20092.64 vs. 0.80 SD\u2009=\u20091.51 p\u2009<\u20090.001 and well-being 4.50 SD\u2009=\u20092.78 vs. 2.20 SD\u2009=\u20091.99 p\u2009<\u20090.001; pre- vs. post-VR travel score respectively. No participants complained of serious side effects. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that VR travel can be efficacious and safe for terminal cancer patients for improving symptom burden.
