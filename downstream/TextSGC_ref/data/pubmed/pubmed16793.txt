Multisensory interactive training has an increasingly prominent role in stroke rehabilitation. Currently there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate its efficacy on gait improvement upper limb and lower limb functional improvement global motor function and cognitive improvement. A recent Cochrane review confirmed that published studies on virtual reality VR training have the limitations of lack of powered sample size did not evaluate the benefits over a long-term period and lacked trial quality on cognitive function. Another systematic review also concluded that the evidence for the use of VR in gait and balance improvement is limited. This study investigates the effects of multisensory training on gait pattern upper and lower limb biomechanics upper limb gross and fine motor functions and lower limb functional recovery over a medium- to long-term period. Prospective clinical study of rehabilitation interventions with multisensory interactive training in patients with cerebral infarction: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
