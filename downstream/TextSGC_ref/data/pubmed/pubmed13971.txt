Two types of convolutional neural network CNN models a discrete classification network and a continuous regression network were trained to determine local sample thickness from convergent beam diffraction CBED patterns of SrTiO3 collected in a scanning transmission electron microscope STEM at atomic column resolution. Acquisition of atomic resolution CBED patterns for this purpose requires careful balancing of CBED feature size in pixels acquisition speed and detector dynamic range. The training datasets were derived from multislice simulations which must be convolved with incoherent source broadening. Sample thicknesses were also determined using quantitative high-angle annular dark-field HAADF STEM images acquired simultaneously. The regression CNN performed well on sample thinner than 35\xa0nm with 70% of the CNN results within 1\xa0nm of HAADF thickness and 1.0\xa0nm overall root mean square error between the two measurements. The classification CNN was trained for a thicknesses up to 100\xa0nm and yielded 66% of CNN results within one classification increment of 2\xa0nm of HAADF thickness. Our approach depends on methods from computer vision including transfer learning and image augmentation.
