"The integration of electroencephalogram EEG sensors into virtual reality VR headsets can provide the capability of tracking the users cognitive state and eventually be used to increase the sense of immersion. Recent developments in wireless room-scale VR tracking allow users to move freely in the physical and virtual spaces. Such motion can create significant movement artifacts in EEG sensors mounted to the VR headset. This study explores the removal of EEG movement artifacts caused by repetitive stereotyped movements during an interactive VR task." EEG Movement Artifact Suppression in Interactive Virtual Reality.
