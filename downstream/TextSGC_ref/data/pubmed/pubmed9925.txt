This paper presents an automated computational platform based on deep learning DL approach for left ventricular LV and right ventricular RV endocardium segmentation in long-axis cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance CMR. The proposed method uses modified deep U-Net convolutional networks. We trained our model using 4800 images from 40 human subjects 20 healthy volunteers 20 patients with various cardiac diseases and validated the technique in 6000 images from 50 subjects 10 healthy volunteers 40 patients. An average Dice metric of 0.929  0.036 along with an average Jaccard index of 0.869  0.059 were achieved for all the studied subjects. In addition a high level of correlation and agreement with the ground truth contours for LV ejection fraction R=0.975 LV fractional area change R=0.959 to 0.971 and RV fractional area change R=0.927 were observed. The proposed DL-based segmentation process took less than 3 seconds per subject or < 30 milliseconds per image over 120 images for each subject. Therefore our proposed framework offers a promising means to achieve fully automated and rapid segmentation for both LV and RV endocardium in long-axis cine CMR images using an appropriately trained deep convolutional neural network.
