In the not too distant future the median population age will tend towards 65; an age at which the need for dependency increases. Most older people want to remain autonomous and self-sufficient for as long as possible. As environments become smarter home automation solutions can be provided to support this aspiration. The technology discussed within this paper focuses on providing a home automation system that can be controlled by most users regardless of mobility restrictions and hence it may be applicable to older people. It comprises a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface home automation user interface and actuators. In the first instance our system is controlled with conventional computer input which is then replaced with eye tracking and finally a BCI and eye tracking collaboration. The systems have been assessed in terms of information throughput; benefits and limitations are evaluated. Promoting autonomy in a smart home environment with a smarter interface.
