Parsimonious representations are ubiquitous in modeling and processing information. Motivated by the recent Multi-Layer Convolutional Sparse Coding ML-CSC model we herein generalize the traditional Basis Pursuit problem to a multi-layer setting introducing similar sparse enforcing penalties at different representation layers in a symbiotic relation between synthesis and analysis sparse priors. We explore different iterative methods to solve this new problem in practice and we propose a new Multi-Layer Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm ML-ISTA as well as a fast version ML-FISTA. We show that these nested first order algorithms converge in the sense that the function value of near-fixed points can get arbitrarily close to the solution of the original problem. We further show how these algorithms effectively implement particular recurrent convolutional neural networks CNNs that generalize feed-forward ones without introducing any parameters. We present and analyze different architectures resulting unfolding the iterations of the proposed pursuit algorithms including a new Learned ML-ISTA providing a principled way to construct deep recurrent CNNs. Unlike other similar constructions these architectures unfold a global pursuit holistically for the entire network. We demonstrate the emerging constructions in a supervised learning setting consistently improving the performance of classical CNNs while maintaining the number of parameters constant.
