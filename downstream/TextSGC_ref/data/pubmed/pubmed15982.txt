Free tissue transfer has evolved from muscle flaps to fasciocutaneous flaps. Dissection of the intramuscular course of feeding vessels is technically challenging. Simulation-based microsurgery skills acquisition is moving toward nonliving training models. Living porcine model or human cadavers are currently cost-ineffective methods for the early learning curve in teaching intramuscular dissection. The aim of this study was to validate an inexpensive ex vivo porcine model simulating harvest of the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator DIEAP flap specifically including perforator intramuscular dissection.
