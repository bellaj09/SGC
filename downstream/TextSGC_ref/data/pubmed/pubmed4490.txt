Neural Mass Models provide a compact description of the dynamical activity of cell populations in neocortical regions. Moreover models of regional activity can be connected together into networks and inferences made about the strength of connections using M/EEG data and Bayesian inference. To date however Bayesian methods have been largely restricted to the Variational Laplace VL algorithm which assumes that the posterior distribution is Gaussian and finds model parameters that are only locally optimal. This paper explores the use of Annealed Importance Sampling AIS to address these restrictions. We implement AIS using proposals derived from Langevin Monte Carlo LMC which uses local gradient and curvature information for efficient exploration of parameter space. In terms of the estimation of Bayes factors VL and AIS agree about which model is best but report different degrees of belief. Additionally AIS finds better model parameters and we find evidence of non-Gaussianity in their posterior distribution. Annealed Importance Sampling for Neural Mass Models.
