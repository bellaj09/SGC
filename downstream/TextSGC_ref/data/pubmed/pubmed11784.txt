Successful adjustment to dynamic environments requires the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals. However the pursuit of multiple goals may bring about goal conflict. Despite evidence indicating that goal conflict can have a detrimental effect on subjective well-being little is known about the effects of goal competition in the context of pain. This experiment investigated whether different types of goal competition increase pain-related fear and slow pain-related decision-making. Forty-six participants completed a cross-directional movement task in which they learned to associate movements in 1 direction eg left with pain and movements in the opposite direction eg right with safety; and that movements in other directions eg up and down were associated with reward and loss of reward respectively. In the test phase both phases were combined creating different types of goal competition. The results showed that participants were most afraid of movements associated with 2 concurrent avoidance goals and the least afraid of movements associated with approach-approach competition. Additionally participants were slower in making a choice when presented with an avoidance-avoidance competition compared with approach-approach and avoidance-approach competition. These findings suggest that avoidance-avoidance competition increased fear and slowed decision-making compared with other types of competition.
