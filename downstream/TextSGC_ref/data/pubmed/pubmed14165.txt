The molecular characteristics of aging that lead to increased disease susceptibility remain poorly understood. Here we present a transcriptomic profile of the human brain associated with age and aging derived from a systematic integrative analysis of four independent cohorts of genome-wide expression data from 2202 brain samples cortex hippocampus and cerebellum of individuals of different ages from young infants 5-10\xa0years old to elderly people up to 100\xa0years old categorized in age stages by decades. The study provides a signature of 1148 genes detected in cortex 874 genes in hippocampus and 657 genes in cerebellum that present significant differential expression changes with age according to a robust gamma rank correlation profiling. The signatures show a significant large overlap of 258 genes between cortex and hippocampus and 63 common genes between the three brain regions. Focusing on cortex functional enrichment analysis and cell-type analysis provided biological insight about the aging signature. Response to stress and immune response were up-regulated functions. Synapse neurotransmission and calcium signaling were down-regulated functions. Cell analysis derived from single-cell data disclosed an increase of neuronal activity in the young stages of life and a decline of such activity in the old stages. A regulatory analysis identified the transcription factors TF associated with the signature of 258 genes common to cortex and hippocampus; revealing the role of MEF2AD PDX1 FOSL12 and RFX51 as candidate regulators of the signature. Finally a deep-learning neural network algorithm was used to build a biological age predictor based on the aging signature.
