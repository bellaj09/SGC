Volitional modulation and neurofeedback of sensorimotor oscillatory activity is currently being evaluated as a strategy to facilitate motor restoration following stroke. Knowledge on the interplay between this regional brain self-regulation distributed network entrainment and handedness is however limited. In a randomized cross-over design twenty-one healthy subjects twelve right-handers RH nine left-handers LH performed kinesthetic motor imagery of left 48 trials and right finger extension 48 trials. A brain-machine interface turned event-related desynchronization in the beta frequency-band 16-22\u202fHz during motor imagery into passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis. Thereby every participant subsequently activated either the dominant DH or non-dominant hemisphere NDH to control contralateral hand opening. The task-related cortical networks were studied with electroencephalography. The magnitude of the induced oscillatory modulation range in the sensorimotor cortex was independent of both handedness RH LH and hemispheric specialization DH NDH. However the regional beta-band modulation was associated with different alpha-band networks in RH and LH: RH presented a stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity while LH revealed a stronger intra-hemispheric interaction. Notably these distinct network entrainments were independent of hemispheric specialization. In healthy subjects sensorimotor beta-band activity can be robustly modulated by motor imagery and proprioceptive feedback in both hemispheres independent of handedness. However right and left handers show different oscillatory entrainment of cortical alpha-band networks during neurofeedback. This finding may inform neurofeedback interventions in future to align them more precisely with the underlying physiology.
