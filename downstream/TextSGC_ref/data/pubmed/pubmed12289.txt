"Analysis dictionary learning ADL has been successfully applied to a variety of learning systems. However the ordinal locality of analysis dictionary has rarely been explored in constructing discriminative terms. In this paper a discriminative low-rank analysis-synthesis dictionary learning LR-ASDL algorithm with the adaptively ordinal locality is proposed for object classification. Specifically we first explicitly introduce the relations between the analysis atoms and profiles i.e. row vectors of the coefficients matrix. That is the similarity between two profiles depends on that between the corresponding analysis atoms. Moreover an adaptively ordinal locality preservingAOLP term is constructed by simultaneously exploiting the profiles and analysis atoms which can be learned in a supervised way. In this way the neighborhood correlations between analysis atoms and the high-order ranking information of each analysis atoms neighbors can be simultaneously preserved in the learning process. Particularly this helps to uncover the intrinsic underlying data factors and inherit the geometry structure information of training samples. Furthermore the low-rank model is imposed on the synthesis atoms to further facilitate the learned dictionaries to be more discriminative. Extensive experimental results on eight databases demonstrate that the LR-ASDL algorithm clearly outperforms some analysis and synthesis dictionary learning algorithms using deep and hand-crafted features."
