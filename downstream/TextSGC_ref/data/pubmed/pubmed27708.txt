Brain-machine interfaces BMIs may provide new communication channels and motor function to individuals with severe neurodegenerative diseases but little is known about their interests in such devices. We investigated the interests of severely affected ALS patients in BMIs and examined factors that might influence these interests. We conducted an anonymous mail-back questionnaire survey of severely disabled ALS patients diagnosed using the revised El Escorial criteria. Thirty-seven patients responded to the questionnaire. Twenty-nine 78.4% had undergone tracheostomy positive pressure ventilation. More than 80% of the patients were interested in communication support. Thirty-three 89.2% felt stressed during communication. Among those using assistive communication devices 17 patients 15 88.2% were not satisfied with them. More than 50% of the patients expressed an interest in BMIs. Their expectations of BMIs ranged widely from emergency alarm to postural change. The frequent use of personal computers tended to be correlated with an interest in invasive BMIs p = 0.07. In conclusion this was the first questionnaire survey demonstrating that severely affected ALS patients have broad and high expectations for BMIs. Communication was the most desired support from BMIs for such patients. We need to meet their widely ranging expectations of BMIs. Severely affected ALS patients have broad and high expectations for brain-machine interfaces.
