People that cannot communicate due to neurological disorders would benefit from an internal speech decoder. Here we showed the ability to classify individual words during imagined speech from electrocorticographic signals. In a word imagery task we used high gamma 70-150\u2009Hz time features with a support vector machine model to classify individual words from a pair of words. To account for temporal irregularities during speech production we introduced a non-linear time alignment into the SVM kernel. Classification accuracy reached 88% in a two-class classification framework 50% chance level and average classification accuracy across fifteen word-pairs was significant across five subjects mean\u2009=\u200958%; p\u2009<\u20090.05. We also compared classification accuracy between imagined speech overt speech and listening. As predicted higher classification accuracy was obtained in the listening and overt speech conditions mean\u2009=\u200989% and 86% respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.0001 where speech stimuli were directly presented. The results provide evidence for a neural representation for imagined words in the temporal lobe frontal lobe and sensorimotor cortex consistent with previous findings in speech perception and production. These data represent a proof of concept study for basic decoding of speech imagery and delineate a number of key challenges to usage of speech imagery neural representations for clinical applications.
