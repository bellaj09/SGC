"Genomes are organized into self-interacting chromatin regions called topologically associated domains TADs. A significant number of TAD boundaries are shared across multiple cell types and conserved across species. Disruption of TAD boundaries may affect the expression of nearby genes and could lead to several diseases. Even though detection of TAD boundaries is important and useful there are experimental challenges in obtaining high resolution TAD locations. Here we present computational prediction of TAD boundaries from high resolution Hi-C data in fruit flies. By extensive exploration and testing of several deep learning model architectures with hyperparameter optimization we show that a unique deep learning model consisting of three convolution layers followed by a long short-term-memory layer achieves an accuracy of 96%. This outperforms feature-based models accuracy of 91% and an existing methods accuracy of 73-78% based on motif TRAP scores. Our method also detects previously reported motifs such as Beaf-32 that are enriched in TAD boundaries in fruit flies and also several unreported motifs."
