Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are promising devices that can be used as neuroprostheses by severely disabled individuals. Brain surface electroencephalograms electrocorticograms ECoGs can provide input signals that can then be decoded to enable communication with others and to control intelligent prostheses and home electronics. However conventional systems use wired ECoG recordings. Therefore the development of wireless systems for clinical ECoG BMIs is a major goal in the field. We developed a fully implantable ECoG signal recording device for human ECoG BMI i.e. a wireless human ECoG-based real-time BMI system W-HERBS. In this system three-dimensional 3D high-density subdural multiple electrodes are fitted to the brain surface and ECoG measurement units record 128-channel ch ECoG signals at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The units transfer data to the data and power management unit implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen through a subcutaneous stretchable spiral cable. The data and power management unit then communicates with a workstation outside the body and wirelessly receives 400 mW of power from an external wireless transmitter. The workstation records and analyzes the received data in the frequency domain and controls external devices based on analyses. We investigated the performance of the proposed system. We were able to use W-HERBS to detect sine waves with a 4.8-V amplitude and a 60-200-Hz bandwidth from the ECoG BMIs. W-HERBS is the first fully implantable ECoG-based BMI system with more than 100 ch. It is capable of recording 128-ch subdural ECoG signals with sufficient input-referred noise 3 Vrms and with an acceptable time delay 250 ms. The system contributes to the clinical application of high-performance BMIs and to experimental brain research.
