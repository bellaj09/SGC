"Whether Tai Chi Chuan TCC can influence the intrinsic functional architecture of the human brain remains unclear. To examine TCC-associated changes in functional connectomes resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired from 40 older individuals including 22 experienced TCC practitioners experts and 18 demographically matched TCC-nave healthy controls and their local functional homogeneities across the cortical mantle were compared. Compared to the controls the TCC experts had significantly greater and more experience-dependent functional homogeneity in the right post-central gyrus PosCG and less functional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex ACC and the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Increased functional homogeneity in the PosCG was correlated with TCC experience. Intriguingly decreases in functional homogeneity improved functional specialization in the left ACC and increases in functional homogeneity improved functional integration in the right PosCG both predicted performance gains on attention network behavior tests. These findings provide evidence for the functional plasticity of the brains intrinsic architecture toward optimizing locally functional organization with great implications for understanding the effects of TCC on cognition behavior and health in aging population." Tai Chi Chuan optimizes the functional organization of the intrinsic human brain architecture in older adults.
