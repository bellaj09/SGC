Preserving cognition and mental capacity is critical to aging with autonomy. Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence AI in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning ML support the integration of biological psychological and social factors when approaching diagnosis prognosis and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use benefits and limitations of AI for predicting diagnosing and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: 1 sociodemographics; 2 clinical and psychometric assessments; 3 neuroimaging and neurophysiology; 4 electronic health records and claims; 5 novel assessments e.g. sensors for digital data; and 6 genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches including supervised and unsupervised ML deep learning and natural language processing. AI technology still nascent in healthcare has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.
