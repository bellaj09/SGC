In this study a multiple kernel learning support vector machine algorithm is proposed for the identification of EEG signals including mental and cognitive tasks which is a key component in EEG-based brain computer interface BCI systems. The presented BCI approach included three stages: 1 a pre-processing step was performed to improve the general signal quality of the EEG; 2 the features were chosen including wavelet packet entropy and Granger causality respectively; 3 a multiple kernel learning support vector machine MKL-SVM based on a gradient descent optimization algorithm was investigated to classify EEG signals in which the kernel was defined as a linear combination of polynomial kernels and radial basis function kernels. Experimental results showed that the proposed method provided better classification performance compared with the SVM based on a single kernel. For mental tasks the average accuracies for 2-class 3-class 4-class and 5-class classifications were 99.20% 81.25% 76.76% and 75.25% respectively. Comparing stroke patients with healthy controls using the proposed algorithm we achieved the average classification accuracies of 89.24% and 80.33% for 0-back and 1-back tasks respectively. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is promising for implementing human-computer interaction HCI especially for mental task classification and identifying suitable brain impairment candidates.
