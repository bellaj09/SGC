Most existing brain-computer Interfaces BCIs are designed to control a single assistive device such as a wheelchair a robotic arm or a prosthetic limb. However many daily tasks require combined functions which can only be realized by integrating multiple robotic devices. Such integration raises the requirement of the control accuracy and is more challenging to achieve a reliable control compared with the single device case. In this study we propose a novel hybrid BCI with high accuracy based on electroencephalogram EEG and electrooculogram EOG to control an integrated wheelchair robotic arm system. The user turns the wheelchair left/right by performing left/right hand motor imagery MI and generates other commands for the wheelchair and the robotic arm by performing eye blinks and eyebrow raising movements. Twenty-two subjects participated in a MI training session and five of them completed a mobile self-drinking experiment which was designed purposely with high accuracy requirements. The results demonstrated that the proposed hBCI could provide satisfied control accuracy for a system that consists of multiple robotic devices and showed the potential of BCI-controlled systems to be applied in complex daily tasks.
