Cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death globally. These are often associated with atherosclerosis. This inflammation process triggers important variations in the coronary arteries CA and can lead to coronary artery disease CAD. The presence of CA calcification CAC has recently been shown to be a strong predictor of CAD. In this clinical setting computed tomography angiography CTA has begun to play a crucial role as a non-intrusive imaging method to characterize and study CA plaques. Herein we describe an automated algorithm to classify plaque as either normal calcified or non-calcified using 2646 CTA images acquired from 73 patients. The automated technique is based on various features that are extracted from the Gabor transform of the acquired CTA images. Specifically seven features are extracted from the Gabor coefficients : energy and Kapur Max Rnyi Shannon Vajda and Yager entropies. The features were then ordered based on the F-value and input to numerous classification methods to achieve the best classification accuracy with the least number of features. Moreover two well-known feature reduction techniques were employed and the features acquired were also ranked according to F-value and input to several classifiers. The best classification results were obtained using all computed features without the employment of feature reduction using a probabilistic neural network. An accuracy positive predictive value sensitivity and specificity of 89.09% 91.70% 91.83% and 83.70% was obtained respectively. Based on these results it is evident that the technique can be helpful in the automated classification of plaques present in CTA images and may become an important tool to reduce procedural costs and patient radiation dose. This could also aid clinicians in plaque diagnostics. Automated plaque classification using computed tomography angiography and Gabor transformations.
