Monitoring of heart rate can be used in many medical and sports applications. Lack of portability and connection problems make traditional monitoring methods difficult to use outside of clinical environments. The computer vision techniques have been shown that some physiological variables as heart rate can be measured without contact. Video magnification is one of these approach used for the detection of the pulse signal. In this paper we propose a new strategy to magnify motion in a video sequence using the Hermite transform. In addition a deep learning technique is implemented to estimate the beat by beat pulse signal. We trained the system and validated our results using an electronic pulse monitoring device. Our approach is compared with the classical video magnification using a Gaussian pyramid. The results show a better enhancement of spectral information from the colour changes allowing an accurate estimation of the instantaneous beat by beat pulse than the Gaussian approach.
