Most of biologists work on textual DNA sequences that are limited to the linear representation of DNA. In this paper we address the potential offered by Virtual Reality for 3D modeling and immersive visualization of large genomic sequences. The representation of the 3D structure of naked DNA allows biologists to observe and analyze genomes in an interactive way at different levels. We developed a powerful software platform that provides a new point of view for sequences analysis: ADNViewer. Nevertheless a classical eukaryotic chromosome of 40 million base pairs requires about 6 Gbytes of 3D data. In order to manage these huge amounts of data in real-time we designed various scene management algorithms and immersive human-computer interaction for user-friendly data exploration. In addition one bioinformatics study scenario is proposed. ADN-Viewer: a 3D approach for bioinformatic analyses of large DNA sequences.
