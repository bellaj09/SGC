Brain-machine interfaces BMIs allow direct translation of electric magnetic or metabolic brain signals into control commands of external devices such as robots prostheses or exoskeletons. However non-stationarity of brain signals and susceptibility to biological or environmental artifacts impede reliable control and safety of BMIs particularly in daily life environments. Here we introduce and tested a novel hybrid brain-neural computer interaction BNCI system fusing electroencephalography EEG and electrooculography EOG to enhance reliability and safety of continuous hand exoskeleton-driven grasping motions. Enhancing brain-machine interface BMI control of a hand exoskeleton using electrooculography EOG.
