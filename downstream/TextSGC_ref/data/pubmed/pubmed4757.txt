A core goal of human connectomics is to characterise the neural pathways that underlie brain function. This can be largely achieved noninvasively by inferring white matter connectivity using diffusion MRI data. However there are challenges. First diffusion tractography is blind to directed connections or whether a connection is expressed functionally. Second we need to be able to go beyond the characterization of anatomical pathways to understand distributed brain function that results from them. In particular we need to characterise effective connectivity using functional imaging modalities such as FMRI and M/EEG to understand its context-sensitivity e.g. modulation by task and how it changes with synaptic plasticity. Here we consider the critical role that biophysical network models have to play in meeting these challenges by providing a principled way to conciliate information from anatomical and functional data. They also provide biophysically meaningful parameters through which we can better understand brain function. In a translational setting well-validated models may shed light on the mechanisms of individual disease processes. Biophysical network models and the human connectome.
