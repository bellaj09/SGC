Addiction is characterized by an erosion of cognitive control toward drug taking that is accentuated by negative emotional states. Here we tested the hypothesis that enhanced interference on cognitive control reflects a loss of segregation between cognition and emotion in addiction. We analyzed Human Connectome Project data from 1206 young adults including 89 with cannabis dependence CD. Two composite factors one for cognition and one for emotion were derived using principal component PC analyses. Component scores for these PCs were significantly associated in the CD group such that negative emotionality correlated with poor cognition. However the corresponding component scores were uncorrelated in matched controls and nondependent recreational cannabis users n\u2009=\u200987. In CD but not controls or recreational users functional magnetic resonance imaging activations to emotional stimuli angry/fearful faces\u2009>\u2009shapes correlated with activations to cognitive demand working memory; 2-back\u2009>\u20090-back. Canonical correlation analyses linked individual differences in cognitive and emotional component scores with brain activations. In CD there was substantial overlap between cognitive and emotional brain-behavior associations but in controls associations were more restricted to the cognitive domain. These findings support our hypothesis of impaired segregation between cognitive and emotional processes in CD that might contribute to poor cognitive control under conditions of increased emotional demand.
