The increased availability of labeled X-ray image archives e.g. ChestX-ray14 dataset has triggered a growing interest in deep learning techniques. To provide better insight into the different approaches and their applications to chest X-ray classification we investigate a powerful network architecture in detail: the ResNet-50. Building on prior work in this domain we consider transfer learning with and without fine-tuning as well as the training of a dedicated X-ray network from scratch. To leverage the high spatial resolution of X-ray data we also include an extended ResNet-50 architecture and a network integrating non-image data patient age gender and acquisition type in the classification process. In a concluding experiment we also investigate multiple ResNet depths i.e. ResNet-38 and ResNet-101. In a systematic evaluation using 5-fold re-sampling and a multi-label loss function we compare the performance of the different approaches for pathology classification by ROC statistics and analyze differences between the classifiers using rank correlation. Overall we observe a considerable spread in the achieved performance and conclude that the X-ray-specific ResNet-38 integrating non-image data yields the best overall results. Furthermore class activation maps are used to understand the classification process and a detailed analysis of the impact of non-image features is provided.
