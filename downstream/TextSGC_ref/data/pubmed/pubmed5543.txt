Understanding circuit computation in the nervous system requires sampling activity over large neural populations and maximizing the number of features that can be extracted. By combining planar arrays of extracellular electrodes with the three-layered cortex of turtles we show that synaptic signals induced along individual axons as well as action potentials can be easily captured. Two types of information can be extracted from these signals the neuronal subtype inhibitory or excitatory-whose identification is more reliable than with traditional measures such as action potential width-and a partial spatial map of functional axonal projections from individual neurons. Because our approach is algorithmic it can be carried out in parallel on hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons. Combining our approach with soma triangulation we reveal an axonal projection bias among a population of pyramidal neurons in turtle cortex and confirm this bias through anatomical reconstructions.
