We assessed the effectiveness of ToT from VR laparoscopic simulation training in 2 studies. In a second study we also assessed the TER. ToT is a detectable performance improvement between equivalent groups and TER is the observed percentage performance differences between 2 matched groups carrying out the same task but with 1 group pretrained on VR simulation. Concordance between simulated and in-vivo procedure performance was also assessed. Prospective randomized assessment of transfer of training ToT and transfer effectiveness ratio TER of virtual reality simulation training for laparoscopic skill acquisition.
