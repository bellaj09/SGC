We present an application of an augmented reality laser projection system in which procedure-specific optimal incision sites computed from pre-operative image acquisition are superimposed on a patient to guide port placement in minimally invasive surgery. Tests were conducted to evaluate the fidelity of computed and measured port configurations and to validate the accuracy with which a surgical tool-tip can be placed at an identified virtual target. A high resolution volumetric image of a thorax phantom was acquired using helical computed tomography imaging. Oriented within the thorax a phantom organ with marked targets was visualized in a virtual environment. A graphical interface enabled marking the locations of target anatomy and calculation of a grid of potential port locations along the intercostal rib lines. Optimal configurations of port positions and tool orientations were determined by an objective measure reflecting image-based indices of surgical dexterity hand-eye alignment and collision detection. Intra-operative registration of the computed virtual model and the phantom anatomy was performed using an optical tracking system. Initial trials demonstrated that computed and projected port placement provided direct access to target anatomy with an accuracy of 2 mm.
