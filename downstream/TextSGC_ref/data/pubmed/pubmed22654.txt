"The general principles and current applications of pediatric video-assisted cardiothoracic surgery PVACTS are reviewed. The purpose of PVACTS is to improve surgical quality and precision in selected operations. In the 1990s PVACTS has expanded to include the management of a variety of pulmonary mediastinal and cardiac lesions. Currently PVACTS is carried out using a video camera connected to a low-profile scope and a specialized set of surgical instruments. PVACTS is an accepted modality for the diagnosis by biopsy of pleuropulmonary and mediastinal disease and the treatment of pediatric empyema spontaneous pneumothorax and mediastinal cysts. Diaphragmatic plication repair of chylous leak and ligation of collateral vessels have all been done using PVACTS. PVACTS patent ductus arteriosus PDA ligation and vascular ring repair are being successfully carried out in several institutions. The technique at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia is described. Indications and techniques for PVACTS lobectomy and pneumonectomy are less well established. Suggested anecdotal methods are described. Cardioscopy carries the hope of improving intracardiac repair and has been applied to several lesions. The future of PVACTS depends on the surgeons willingness to master it industrys willingness to customize instruments for pediatric use and developments in the fields of virtual imaging and augmented reality.
