Protein structure can be described by backbone torsion angles: rotational angles about the N-C bond  and the C-C bond  or the angle between Ci-1-Ci-Ci\u2009+\u20091  and the rotational angle about the Ci-Ci\u2009+\u20091 bond . Thus their accurate prediction is useful for structure prediction and model refinement. Early methods predicted torsion angles in a few discrete bins whereas most recent methods have focused on prediction of angles in real continuous values. Real value prediction however is unable to provide the information on probabilities of predicted angles. Grid-based prediction of torsion angle probabilities of protein backbone and its application to discrimination of protein intrinsic disorder regions and selection of model structures.
