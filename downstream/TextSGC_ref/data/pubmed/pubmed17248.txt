"Healthy sleep restores the brains ability to adapt to novel input through memory formation based on activity-dependent refinements of the strength of neural transmission across synapses synaptic plasticity. In line with this framework patients with primary insomnia often report subjective memory impairment. However investigations of memory performance did not produce conclusive results. The aim of this study was to further investigate memory performance in patients with primary insomnia in comparison to healthy controls using two well-characterized learning tasks a declarative virtual water maze task and emotional fear conditioning. Twenty patients with primary insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria 17 females three males 43.5\xa0\xa013.0\xa0years and 20 good sleeper controls 17 females three males 41.7\xa0\xa012.8\xa0years were investigated in a parallel-group study. All participants completed a hippocampus-dependent virtual Morris water maze task and amygdala-dependent classical fear conditioning. Patients with insomnia showed significantly delayed memory acquisition in the virtual water maze task but no significant difference in fear acquisition compared with controls. These findings are consistent with the notion that memory processes that emerge from synaptic refinements in a hippocampal-neocortical network are particularly sensitive to chronic disruptions of sleep while those in a basic emotional amygdala-dependent network may be more resilient."
