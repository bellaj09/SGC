Transformation in health care requires a deeply holistic approach. Natural leaders of such a transformation are the complementary and alternative medicine practitioners who already share a vision of wellness prevention and optimal human function. Central to this shared vision is lifestyle change for patients and practitioners. Yet to change a lifestyle is to change a self. Assisting individuals to transform their very sense of self in order to live healthier more fulfilling lives centered on flourishing requires several important keys. Visionary and unified leaders are the first key. Structural support through coordination of health clinics locally and nationally is the second key. This can be optimized by utilizing initiatives of the new Affordable Health Care Act because it provides a potential impetus for deep structural changes. An expanded evidence base for multifactorial approaches to wellness lifestyles is the third key. A reorganizational orientation with an emphasis on the right timing of transformation is the fourth key. The fifth key is an Integral map which brings together the personal behavioral cultural and social domains. By utilizing such a map one ensures that no aspect of the transformative revolution at hand slips away due to any misplaced focus such as emphasizing only on the things we can see with our eyes. By embracing the essence of transformation in terms of a wholeness to all reality an evolutionary unifying field with interior depth and exterior expression health care is redefined more authentically. Five keys to real transformation in health care.
