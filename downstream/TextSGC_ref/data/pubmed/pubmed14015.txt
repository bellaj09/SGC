Medical Informatics is the science and art of processing medical information. In this age of "Information Explosion" choosing the useful one is rather difficult and there lies the scope of electronic database management. However still many outstanding personnel related to the healthcare sector take pride in being "computer illiterate". The onus of the best use lies on the end-user health care providers only. Another term tele-health encompasses all the e-health and telemedicine services. Computer aided or assisted learning CAL is a computer based tutorial method that uses the computer to pose questions provide remedial information and chart a student through a course. Now the emphasis in medical education is on problem based learning PBL and there CAL could be of utmost help if used judiciously. Basic Medical Education and Research lays the foundation for advancing and applying proper healthcare delivery systems. There is no doubt that deep knowledge of anatomy is mandatory for successful surgery. Also comprehensive knowledge of physiology is essential for grasping the principles of pathology and pharmacology adequately to avoid incorrect and inadequate practice of medicine. Similarly medical informatics is not just a subject to be learnt and forgotten after the first professional MBBS examination. The final aim of every student should not only be to become a good user but also an expert for advancing medical knowledge base through medical informatics. In view of the fast changing world of medical informatics it is of utmost necessity to formulate a flexible syllabus rather than a rigid one. Basic medical science education must include medical informatics.
