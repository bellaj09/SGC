Benefiting from the quick development of deep convolutional neural networks especially fully convolutional neural networks FCNs remarkable progresses have been achieved on salient object detection recently. Nevertheless these FCNs based methods are still challenging to generate high resolution saliency maps and also not applicable for subsequent applications due to their heavy model weights. In this paper we propose a compact and efficient deep network with high accuracy for salient object detection. Firstly we propose two strategies for initial prediction one is a new designed multi-scale context module the other is incorporating hand-crafted saliency priors. Secondly we employ residual learning to refine it progressively by only learning the residual in each side-output which can be achieved with few convolutional parameters therefore leads to high compactness and high efficiency. Finally we further design a novel reverse attention block to guide side-output residual learning in a top-down manner. Specifically the current predicted salient regions are erased from each side-output feature thus the missing object parts and details can be efficiently learned from these unerased regions which results in high resolution and accuracy. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods and with advantages in terms of simplicity efficiency and model size.
