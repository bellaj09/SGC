Virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display HMD-VR has the potential to be a useful tool for motor learning and rehabilitation. However when developing tools for these purposes it is important to design applications that will effectively transfer to the real world. Therefore it is essential to understand whether motor skills transfer between HMD-VR and conventional\xa0screen-based environments and what factors predict transfer. Transfer of motor skill between virtual reality viewed using a head-mounted display and conventional screen environments.
