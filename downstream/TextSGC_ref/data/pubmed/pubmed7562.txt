The purpose of this research was to implement a deep learning network to overcome two of the major bottlenecks in improved image reconstruction for clinical positron emission tomography PET. These are the lack of an automated means for the optimization of advanced image reconstruction algorithms and the computational expense associated with these state-of-the art methods. We thus present a novel end-to-end PET image reconstruction technique called DeepPET based on a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network which takes PET sinogram data as input and directly and quickly outputs high quality quantitative PET images. Using simulated data derived from a whole-body digital phantom we randomly sampled the configurable parameters to generate realistic images which were each augmented to a total of more than 291000 reference images. Realistic PET acquisitions of these images were simulated resulting in noisy sinogram data used for training validation and testing the DeepPET network. We demonstrated that DeepPET generates higher quality images compared to conventional techniques in terms of relative root mean squared error 11%/53% lower than ordered subset expectation maximization OSEM/filtered back-projection FBP structural similarity index 1%/11% higher than OSEM/FBP and peak signal-to-noise ratio 1.1/3.8\xa0dB higher than OSEM/FBP. In addition we show that DeepPET reconstructs images 108 and 3 times faster than OSEM and FBP respectively. Finally DeepPET was successfully applied to real clinical data. This study shows that an end-to-end encoder-decoder network can produce high quality PET images at a fraction of the time compared to conventional methods.
