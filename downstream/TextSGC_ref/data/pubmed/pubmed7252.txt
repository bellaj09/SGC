"Deep Brain Stimulation DBS has gained increasing attention as an effective method to mitigate Parkinsons disease PD disorders. Existing DBS systems are open-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based on patients behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in the design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This paper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks using the subthalamic nucleus STN Local Field Potential LFP signals. In our approach we use the time-frequency representation spectrogram of the raw LFP signals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these features are combined together via Support Vector Machines SVM with Multiple Kernel Learning MKL formulation. The MKL-based classification method is utilized to classify different tasks: button press mouth movement speech and arm movement. Our experiments show that the lp-norm MKL significantly outperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks of five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz. This leads to a lower computational cost." A Multiple Kernel Learning approach for human behavioral task classification using STN-LFP signal.
