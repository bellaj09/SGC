Individuals with visual vertigo VV describe symptoms of dizziness disorientation and/or impaired balance in environments with conflicting visual and vestibular information or complex visual stimuli. Physical therapists often prescribe habituation exercises using optic flow to treat these symptoms but it is not known how individuals with VV process the visual stimuli. The primary purpose of this study was to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS to determine if individuals with VV have different cerebral activation during optic flow compared with control subjects. Changes in cerebral activation in individuals with and without visual vertigo during optic flow: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.
