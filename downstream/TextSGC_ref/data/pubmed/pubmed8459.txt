"Artificial intelligence such as deep neural networks exhibited remarkable performance in simulated video games and Go. In contrast most humanoid robots in the DARPA Robotics Challenge fell down to ground. The dramatic contrast in performance is mainly due to differences in the amount of training data which is huge and small respectively. Animals are not allowed with millions of the failed trials which lead to injury and death. Humans fall only several thousand times before they balance and walk. We hypothesize that a unique closed-loop neural circuit formed by the Purkinje cells the cerebellar deep nucleus and the inferior olive in and around the cerebellum and the highest density of gap junctions which regulate synchronous activities of the inferior olive nucleus are computational machinery for learning from a small sample. We discuss recent experimental and computational advances associated with this hypothesis." New insights into olivo-cerebellar circuits for learning from a small training sample.
