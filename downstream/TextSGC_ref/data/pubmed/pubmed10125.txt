Rain streaks particularly in heavy rain not only degrade visibility but also make many computer vision algorithms fail to function properly. In this paper we address this visibility problem by focusing on single-image rain removal even in the presence of dense rain streaks and rain-streak accumulation which is visually similar to mist or fog. To achieve this we introduce a new rain model and a deep learning architecture. Our rain model incorporates a binary rain map indicating rain-streak regions and accommodates various shapes directions and sizes of overlapping rain streaks as well as rain accumulation to model heavy rain. Based on this model we construct a multi-task deep network which jointly learns three targets: the binary rain-streak map rain streak layers and clean background which is our ultimate output. To generate features that can be invariant to rain steaks we introduce a contextual dilated network which is able to exploit regional contextual information. To handle various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks our strategy is to utilize a recurrent process that progressively removes rain streaks. Our binary map provides a constraint and thus additional information to train our network. Extensive evaluation on real images particularly in heavy rain shows the effectiveness of our model and architecture.
