Lower extremity function recovery is one of the most important goals in stroke rehabilitation. Many paradigms and technologies have been introduced for the lower limb rehabilitation over the past decades but their outcomes indicate a need to develop a complementary approach. One attempt to accomplish a better functional recovery is to combine bottom-up and top-down approaches by means of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. In this study a BCI-controlled robotic mirror therapy system is proposed for lower limb recovery following stroke. An experimental paradigm including four states is introduced to combine robotic training bottom-up and mirror therapy top-down approaches. A BCI system is presented to classify the electroencephalography EEG evidence. In addition a probabilistic model is presented to assist patients in transition across the experiment states based on their intent. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system both offline and online analyses are performed for five healthy subjects. The experiment results show a promising performance for the system with average accuracy of 94% in offline and 75% in online sessions.
