Spatial navigation which involves higher cognitive functions is frequently implemented in daily activities and is critical to the participation of human beings in mainstream environments. Virtual reality is an expanding tool which enables on one hand the assessment of the cognitive functions involved in spatial navigation and on the other the rehabilitation of patients with spatial navigation difficulties. Topographical disorientation is a frequent deficit among patients suffering from neurological diseases. The use of virtual environments enables the information incorporated into the virtual environment to be manipulated empirically. But the impact of manipulations seems differ according to their nature quantity occurrence and characteristics of the stimuli and the target population. The contribution of virtual reality to the diagnosis of spatial navigation disorders and to the study of the role of navigational aids: A systematic literature review.
