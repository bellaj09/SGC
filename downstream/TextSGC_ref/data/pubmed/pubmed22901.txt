"Minimally invasive procedures are becoming much more common in surgical practice because of the many advantages for patient comfort and convenience and improved surgical access. However some of the major problems leading to occasional surgical errors with this minimal access method are restricted vision limited sense of touch difficulties in identification in 3D space of the position of the instrument tips and their handling during delicate short-distance movements toward the surgical target area. These factors emphasize the need for computer simulated training in surgical manipulations and procedures in preparation for conducting them in patients. The key new feature of our proof-of-concept training simulator is a preventive mechanism that serves at least two functions. As the surgical target or a critical structure is approached a haptically generated preventive force forewarns the surgeon making it possible to abort those maneuvers that may lead to adverse results. By announcing a potential collision of a virtual instrument tip with a surgical target the time used for searching for the target is shortened and the haptic signal minimizes the potential of tissue damage. This real-time interactive virtual reality based haptic breast biopsy-training simulation is a PC/NT based multitasking multithreading system. It is based upon an advanced force feedback device. The system monitors and indirectly guides the surgeons movements while providing high fidelity visual and force feedback cues as the area of surgical interest is approached. Our first application is with human breast." "Virtual reality and womens health: a breast biopsy system."
