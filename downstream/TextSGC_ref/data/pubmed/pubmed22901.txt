The use of 3-dimensional 3D videos allows students to visualize surgical procedures from the perspective of the surgeon without missing the essential parts.1 This 3D commented video demonstrates the operative technique and surgical nuances of the combined petrosectomy visualize using virtual reality headsets. Historically traditional intradural cisternal routes using suboccipital and pterional approaches have been proposed to remove petroclival tumors.2-5 It allows rapid identification of neurovascular structures and a short exposure time. However access to the petroclival region is far not direct and requires intradural cerebral retraction.6 In order to improve the access for tumoral dissection lateral transpetrosal approaches have been proposed.7-12 The extradural route shortened the distance to the petroclival region allows to better preserve the veins to decrease the cerebral retraction to interrupt early the tumor vascular supply and a larger extent of resection.6 Transpetrosal approaches includes middle fossa approach810 removing the petrous apex posterior petrosal approach91314 removing of presigmoid retrolabyrinthine bone and translabyrinthine petrosectomy.12 A combined petrosectomy may be used to approach larger tumor extending across the clival midline upward to the tentorium or downward to the lower cranial nerves.6101516 Alternatively according to Nanda a retro-sigmoid approach may need to be performed to avoid critical draining veins injury.1017 Good resection and outcomes are obtained when experienced surgeons use familiar approaches and microsurgical techniques.10.
