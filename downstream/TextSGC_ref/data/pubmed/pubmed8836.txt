Using the standard colors provided in the instructions PackTest products can approximate and quickly estimate the chemical characteristics of liquid samples. The combination of PackTest products and deep learning was examined for its accuracy and precision in quantifying chemical oxygen demand ammonium ion and phosphate ion using a pseudocolor imaging method. Each PackTest product underwent reactions with standard solutions. The generated color was scanner-read. From the color image ten grayscale images representing the intensity values of red green blue cyan magenta yellow key black and L   and the values of a  and b  were generated. Using the grayscale images representing the red green and blue intensity values 73 other grayscale images were generated. The grayscale intensity values were used to prepare datasets for the ten and 83 =10\u2009+\u200973 images. For both datasets chemical oxygen demand quantification was successful resulting in values of normalized mean absolute error of less than 0.4% and coefficients of determination that were greater than 0.9996. However the quantification of ammonium and phosphate ions commonly provided false positive results for the standard solution that contained no ammonium ion/phosphate ion. For ammonium ion multiple regression markedly improved the accuracy using the pseudocolor method. Phosphate ion quantification was also improved by avoiding the use of an estimated value for the reference solution that contained no phosphate ion. Real details of the measurements and the perspectives were discussed.
