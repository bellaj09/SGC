"While the ultimate goal of simulation training is to enhance learning cost-effectiveness is a critical factor. Research that compares simulation training in terms of educational- and cost-effectiveness will lead to better-informed curricular decisions. Using previously published data we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of three simulation-based programs. Medical students n = 15 per group practiced in one of three 2-h intravenous catheterization skills training programs: low-fidelity virtual reality high-fidelity mannequin or progressive consisting of virtual reality task trainer and mannequin simulator. One week later all performed a transfer test on a hybrid simulation standardized patient with a task trainer. We used a net benefit regression model to identify the most cost-effective training program via paired comparisons. We also created a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to visually represent the probability that one program is more cost-effective when compared to its comparator at various willingness-to-pay values. We conducted separate analyses for implementation and total costs. The results showed that the progressive program had the highest total cost p < 0.001 whereas the high-fidelity program had the highest implementation cost p < 0.001. While the most cost-effective program depended on the decision makers willingness-to-pay value the progressive training program was generally most educationally- and cost-effective. Our analyses suggest that a progressive program that strategically combines simulation modalities provides a cost-effective solution. More generally we have introduced how a cost-effectiveness analysis may be applied to simulation training; a method that medical educators may use to investment decisions e.g. purchasing cost-effective and educationally sound simulators."
