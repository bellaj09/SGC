Controlling a brain-actuated device requires the participant to look at and to split his attention between the interaction of the device with its environment and the status information of the Brain-Computer Interface BCI. Such parallel visual tasks are partly contradictory with the goal of achieving a good and natural device control. Is there a possibility to free the visual channel from one of these tasks? To address this a stimulation system based on 6 coin-motors is developed which provides a spatially continuous tactile illusion as BCI feedback so that the visual channel can be devoted to the device. Several experiments are conducted in this work to optimize the tactile illusion patterns and to investigate the influence on the electroencephalogram EEG. Finally 6 healthy BCI participants compare visual with tactile feedback in online BCI recordings. The developed stimulator can be used without interfering with the EEG. All subjects are able to perceive this type of tactile feedback well and no statistical degradation in the online BCI performance could be identified between visual and tactile feedback. Freeing the visual channel by exploiting vibrotactile BCI feedback.
