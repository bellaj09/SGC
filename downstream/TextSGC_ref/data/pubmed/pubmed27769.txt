In this study grey-based Hopfield neural network GHNN is proposed for the unsupervised analysis of motor imagery MI electroencephalogram EEG data. Combined with segment selection and feature extraction GHNN is used for the recognition of left and right MI data. A Gaussian-like filter is proposed to reduce noise to further enhance performance of active segment selection. Features are extracted by coherence from wavelet data and then discriminated by GHNN which is an unsupervised approach suitable for the online classification of nonstationary biomedical signals. Compared to EEG data without segment selection several usual features and classifiers the proposed system is potentially an analytic approach in brain-computer interface BCI applications.
