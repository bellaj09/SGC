Recovery of upper extremity function is particularly recalcitrant to successful rehabilitation. Robotic-assisted arm training devices integrated with virtual targets or complex virtual reality gaming simulations are being developed to deal with this problem. Neural control mechanisms indicate that reaching and hand-object manipulation are interdependent suggesting that training on tasks requiring coordinated effort of both the upper arm and hand may be a more effective method for improving recovery of real world function. However most robotic therapies have focused on training the proximal rather than distal effectors of the upper extremity. This paper describes the effects of robotically-assisted integrated upper extremity training. Robotically facilitated virtual rehabilitation of arm transport integrated with finger movement in persons with hemiparesis.
