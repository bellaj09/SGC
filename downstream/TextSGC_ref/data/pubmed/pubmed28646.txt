Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS a progressive neurodegenerative disease restricts patients\ communication capacity a few years after onset. A proof-of-concept of brain-computer interface BCI has shown promise in ALS and "locked-in" patients mostly in pre-clinical studies or with only a few patients but performance was estimated not high enough to support adoption by people with physical limitation of speech. Here we evaluated a visual BCI device in a clinical study to determine whether disabled people with multiple deficiencies related to ALS would be able to use BCI to communicate in a daily environment.
