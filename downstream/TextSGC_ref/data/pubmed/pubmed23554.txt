While previous research has established that virtual reality VR can be successfully used in the treatment of anxiety disorders including phobias and PTSD no research has examined changes in brain patterns associated with the use of VR for generalized anxiety management. In the current study we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of VR for anxiety management and stress reduction programs.
