Heart disease HD is the leading cause of global death; there are several mortality prediction models of HD for identifying critically-ill patients and for guiding decision making. The existing models however cannot be used during initial treatment or screening. This study aimed to derive and validate an echocardiography-based mortality prediction model for HD using deep learning DL. Deep learning for predicting in-hospital mortality among heart disease patients based on echocardiography.
