"For over 60 yr researchers and engineers have based investigations and the design of cockpit displays and structures upon the presupposition that during flight the pilot maintains a head alignment coincident with the aircrafts vertical axis z-axis. Recent simulator studies have verified the existence of a pilot neck reflex which refutes this long-standing assumption. This reflex named the opto-kinetic cervical reflex OKCR occurs during visual flight and is theorized to be an attempt by the pilot to stabilize a retinal image of the horizon to maintain spatial orientation. As a result during initial banking maneuvers pilots view a fixed-horizon image and not a moving-horizon. The research objectives were to determine if the OKCR occurs during actual flight of high performance jet aircraft and to model the response."
