Increasing time and resource constraints and the potential for patient complications has led to an emphasis on finding innovative ways to teach catheter-based procedures outside of the laboratory. Virtual reality VR simulator training has been proposed as a potential training solution. We report on the initial validation of a full procedural VR simulator for carotid angiography CA using the Vascular Interventional System Trainer VIST. Face and content validation of virtual reality simulation for carotid angiography: results from the first 100 physicians attending the Emory NeuroAnatomy Carotid Training ENACT program.
