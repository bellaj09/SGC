Virtual Patients are an essential component of medical virtual reality. Most work to date has been dedicated to virtual patients in surgery. However virtual patients also have a strong potential in clinical medicine where they can be used as visual interfaces to knowledge-based systems in various simulation and training applications. In this paper we describe the implementation of a virtual patient in the field of cardiac emergencies and propose directions to extend the development of virtual patients towards the integration of multiple physiological sub-systems. Virtual patients in clinical medicine.
