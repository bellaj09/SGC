Scientific developments have enabled the application of virtual reality VR technology in various fields. However this technology is disadvantaged by low recognition existence of bias lack of precision and fatigue of text input in VR environments. To address these problems this study proposed a spatial enhancement technique. This study investigated the effectiveness of spatial enhancement keys of a virtual keyboard from various angles and explored the impact of enhanced response time and enhanced protrusion distance on the spatial enhancement technology. Finally the following conclusions are obtained: 1 The average text input performance of the keyboard using the spatial enhancement technique is significantly better than that of the ordinary virtual keyboard without using the spatial enhancement technique. 2 The recommended time interval for enhanced response time and the protrusion distance are 0-100\u202fms and 1.85 diopter respectively. The keyboard angle insignificantly affects the input through the keyboard performance. Effect of spatial enhancement technology on input through the keyboard in virtual reality environment.
