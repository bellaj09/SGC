A major predicament for Intensive Care Unit ICU patients is inconsistent and ineffective communication means. Patients rated most communication sessions as difficult and unsuccessful. This in turn can cause distress unrecognized pain anxiety and fear. As such we designed a portable BCI system for ICU communications BCI4ICU optimized to operate effectively in an ICU environment. The system utilizes a wearable EEG cap coupled with an Android app designed on a mobile device that serves as visual stimuli and data processing module. Furthermore to overcome the challenges that BCI systems face today in real-world scenarios we propose a novel subject-specific Gaussian Mixture Model- GMM- based training and adaptation algorithm. First we incorporate subject-specific information in the training phase of the SSVEP identification model using GMM-based training and adaptation. We evaluate subject-specific models against other subjects. Subsequently from the GMM discriminative scores we generate the transformed vectors which are passed to our predictive model. Finally the adapted mixture mean scores of the subject-specific GMMs are utilized to generate the high-dimensional supervectors. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieved 98.7% average identification accuracy which is promising in order to provide effective and consistent communication for patients in the intensive care.
