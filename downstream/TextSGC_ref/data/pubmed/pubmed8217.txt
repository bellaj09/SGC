"Breast cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer with very low median survival. Accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer can spare a significant number of patients from receiving unnecessary adjuvant systemic treatment and its related expensive medical costs. Previous work relies mostly on selected gene expression data to create a predictive model. The emergence of deep learning methods and multi-dimensional data offers opportunities for more comprehensive analysis of the molecular characteristics of breast cancer and therefore can improve diagnosis treatment and prevention. In this study we propose a Multimodal Deep Neural Network by integrating Multi-dimensional Data MDNNMD for the prognosis prediction of breast cancer. The novelty of the method lies in the design of our methods architecture and the fusion of multi-dimensional data. The comprehensive performance evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves a better performance than the prediction methods with single-dimensional data and other existing approaches. The source code implemented by TensorFlow 1.0 deep learning library can be downloaded from the Github: https://github.com/USTC-HIlab/MDNNMD."
