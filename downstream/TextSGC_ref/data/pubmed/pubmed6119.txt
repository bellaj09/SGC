"Various data-driven voxel-wise measures derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI have been developed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. These measures have been widely applied to explore brain functional changes in schizophrenia and have enjoyed significant success in unraveling the neural mechanisms of this disorder. However their spatial and temporal coupling alterations in schizophrenia remain largely unknown. To address this issue 88 schizophrenia patients and 116 gender- and age-matched healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI examinations. Kendalls W was used to calculate volume-wise across voxels and voxel-wise across time windows concordance among multiple commonly used measures including fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations regional homogeneity voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity degree centrality and global signal connectivity. Inter-group differences in the concordance were investigated. Results revealed that whole gray matter volume-wise concordance was reduced in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls. Although two groups showed similar spatial distributions of the voxel-wise concordance quantitative comparison analysis revealed that schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased voxel-wise concordance in gray matter areas spanning the bilateral frontal parietal occipital temporal and insular cortices. In addition these concordance changes were negatively correlated with onset age in schizophrenia patients. Our findings suggest that the concordance approaches may provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia and have the potential to be extended to neuropsychiatric disorders."
