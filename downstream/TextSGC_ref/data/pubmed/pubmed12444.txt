A substantial portion of medical data is unstructured. Extracting data from unstructured text presents a barrier to advancing clinical research and improving patient care. In addition ongoing studies have been focused predominately on the English language whereas inflected languages with non-Latin alphabets such as Slavic languages with a Cyrillic alphabet present numerous linguistic challenges. We developed deep-learning-based natural language processing algorithms for automatically extracting biomarker status of patients with breast cancer from three oncology centers in Bulgaria.
