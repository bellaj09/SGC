Electroencephalography EEG is a core element in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndromes and can help to monitor antiseizure treatment. Mobile EEG mEEG devices are increasingly available on the consumer market and may offer easier access to EEG recordings especially in rural or resource-poor areas. The usefulness of consumer-grade devices for clinical purposes is still underinvestigated. Here we compared EEG traces of a commercially available mEEG device Emotiv EPOC to a simultaneously recorded clinical video EEG vEEG. Twenty-two adult patients 11 female mean age 40.2\u202fyears undergoing noninvasive vEEG monitoring for clinical purposes were prospectively enrolled. The EEG recordings were evaluated by 10 independent raters with unmodifiable view settings. The individual evaluations were compared with respect to the presence of abnormal EEG findings regional slowing epileptiform potentials seizure pattern. Video EEG yielded a sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 88% for abnormal EEG findings whereas mEEG reached 39% and 85% respectively. Interrater reliability coefficients were better in vEEG as compared to mEEG \u202f=\u202f0.50 vs. 0.30 corresponding to a moderate and fair agreement. Intrarater reliability between mEEG and vEEG evaluations of simultaneous recordings of a given participant was moderate \u202f=\u202f0.48. Given the limitations of our exploratory pilot study our results suggest that vEEG is superior to mEEG but that mEEG can be helpful for diagnostic purposes. We present the first quantitative comparison of simultaneously acquired clinical and mobile consumer-grade EEG for a clinical use-case. Can commercially available wearable EEG devices be used for diagnostic purposes? An explorative pilot study.
