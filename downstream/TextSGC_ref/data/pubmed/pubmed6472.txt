In the ventral tegmental area VTA a subpopulation of dopamine neurons express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and make glutamatergic connections to nucleus accumbens NAc and olfactory tubercle OT neurons. However their glutamatergic connections across the forebrain have not been explored systematically. To visualize dopamine neuron forebrain projections and to enable photostimulation of their axons independent of transmitter status we virally transfected VTA neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein ChR2-EYFP and used DATIREScre mice to restrict expression to dopamine neurons. ChR2-EYFP-expressing neurons almost invariably stained for tyrosine hydroxylase identifying them as dopaminergic. Dopamine neuron axons visualized by ChR2-EYFP fluorescence projected most densely to the striatum moderately to the amygdala and entorhinal cortex ERC sparsely to prefrontal and cingulate cortices and rarely to the hippocampus. Guided by ChR2-EYFP fluorescence we recorded systematically from putative principal neurons in target areas and determined the incidence and strength of glutamatergic connections by activating all dopamine neuron terminals impinging on recorded neurons with wide-field photostimulation. This revealed strong glutamatergic connections in the NAc OT and ERC; moderate strength connections in the central amygdala; and weak connections in the cingulate cortex. No glutamatergic connections were found in the dorsal striatum hippocampus basolateral amygdala or prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that VTA dopamine neurons elicit widespread but regionally distinct glutamatergic signals in the forebrain and begin to define the dopamine neuron excitatory functional connectome.
