This pilot study compares the differences in learning outcomes when students are presented with either an active student-centered or passive teacher-centered virtual reality-based anatomy lesson. The "active" lesson used UCSD\s Anatomic VisualizeR and enabled students to interact with 3D models and control presentation of learning materials. The "passive" lesson used a digital recording of an anatomical expert\s tour of the same VR lesson played back as a QuickTime movie. Subsequent examination of the recall and retention of the studied anatomic objects were comparable in both groups. Issues underlying these results are discussed. Passive vs. active virtual reality learning: the effects on short- and long-term memory of anatomical structures.
