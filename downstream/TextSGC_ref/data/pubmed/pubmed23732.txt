An illusory sensation of ownership over a surrogate limb or whole body can be induced through specific forms of multisensory stimulation such as synchronous visuotactile tapping on the hidden real and visible rubber hand in the rubber hand illusion. Such methods have been used to induce ownership over a manikin and a virtual body that substitute the real body as seen from first-person perspective through a head-mounted display. However the perceptual and behavioral consequences of such transformed body ownership have hardly been explored. In Exp. 1 immersive virtual reality was used to embody 30 adults as a 4-y-old child condition C and as an adult body scaled to the same height as the child condition A experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronized. The result was a strong body-ownership illusion equally for C and A. Moreover there was an overestimation of the sizes of objects compared with a nonembodied baseline which was significantly greater for C compared with A. An implicit association test showed that C resulted in significantly faster reaction times for the classification of self with child-like compared with adult-like attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16 participants extinguished the ownership illusion by using visuomotor asynchrony with all else equal. The size-estimation and implicit association test differences between C and A were also extinguished. We conclude that there are perceptual and probably behavioral correlates of body-ownership illusions that occur as a function of the type of body in which embodiment occurs. Illusory ownership of a virtual child body causes overestimation of object sizes and implicit attitude changes.
