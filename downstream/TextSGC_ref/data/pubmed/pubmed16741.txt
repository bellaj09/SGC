Contagious yawning occurs in humans and a few other highly social animals following the detection of yawns in others yet the factors influencing the propagation of this response remain largely unknown. Stemming from earlier laboratory research we conducted five experiments to investigate the effects of social presence on contagious yawning in virtual reality VR. We show that similar to a traditional laboratory setting having a researcher present during testing significantly inhibited contagious yawning in VR even though participants were viewing a virtual environment and unable to see the researcher. Unlike previous research however manipulating the social presence in VR i.e. embedding recording devices and humanoid avatars within the simulation did not affect contagious yawning. These experiments provide further evidence that social presence is a powerful deterrent of yawning in humans which warrants further investigation. More generally these findings also have important applications for the use of VR in psychological research. While participants were quite sensitive to social stimuli presented in VR as evidenced by contagious yawning our results suggest a major difference in the influence of social factors within real-world and virtual environments. That is social cues in actual reality appear to dominate and supersede those in VR. Contagious yawning in virtual reality is affected by actual but not simulated social presence.
