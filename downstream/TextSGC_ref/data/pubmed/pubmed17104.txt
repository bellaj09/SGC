This study provides the first immunohistochemical evidence visualizing cholinergic octopus neurons containing choline acetyltransferase ChAT the synthetic enzyme of acetylcholine. Because the antiserum applied here was raised against a recombinant protein encoded by exons 7 and 8 of the rat gene for ChAT and initially used for studies in mammals to validate antibody specificity for the octopus counterpart enzyme we therefore used three methods. Immunoprecipitation using Pansorbin indicated that immunoreactive octopus brain molecules were capable of synthesizing acetylcholine. Western blot analysis after denatured gel electrophoresis of octopus brain extracts revealed a single band at approximately 81 kDa. A gel slice containing the 81-kDa protein after native nondenatured gel electrophoresis exhibited high ChAT activity. All findings obtained with these three methods clearly indicated that the antiserum effectively recognizes octopus ChAT. The immunohistochemical use of the antiserum in the retina optic lobe and its neighboring peduncle complex detected enzyme-containing neuronal cell bodies in only two regions the cell islands of the optic lobe medulla and the cortical layer of the posterior olfactory lobule. Immunoreactive fibers and probable nerve terminals were also found in the plexiform layer of the deep retina within the stroma of the optic gland and the neuropils of the optic lobe peduncle lobe and olfactory lobe. These results provide information on the morphology and distribution patterns of cholinergic neurons in the octopus visual system a useful invertebrate model for learning and memory where the cholinergic system as in higher vertebrates including mammals plays an important role. First visualization of cholinergic cells and fibers by immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase of the common type in the optic lobe and peduncle complex of Octopus vulgaris.
