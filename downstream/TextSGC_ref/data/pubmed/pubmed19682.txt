Traditional one-session exposure therapy OST in which a patient is gradually exposed to feared stimuli for up to 3 h in a one-session format has been found effective for the treatment of specific phobias. However many individuals with specific phobia are reluctant to seek help and access to care is lacking due to logistic challenges of accessing collecting storing and/or maintaining stimuli. Virtual reality VR exposure therapy may improve upon existing techniques by facilitating access decreasing cost and increasing acceptability and effectiveness. The aim of this study is to compare traditional OST with in vivo spiders and a human therapist with a newly developed single-session gamified VR exposure therapy application with modern VR hardware virtual spiders and a virtual therapist. Single-session gamified virtual reality exposure therapy for spider phobia vs. traditional exposure therapy: study protocol for a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial.
