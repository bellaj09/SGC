Steady-state visually evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs allow healthy subjects to communicate. However their dependence on gaze control prevents their use with severely disabled patients. Gaze-independent SSVEP-BCIs have been designed but have shown a drop in accuracy and have not been tested in brain-injured patients. In the present paper we propose a novel independent SSVEP-BCI based on covert attention with an improved classification rate. We study the influence of feature extraction algorithms and the number of harmonics. Finally we test online communication on healthy volunteers and patients with locked-in syndrome LIS. An independent SSVEP-based brain-computer interface in locked-in syndrome.
