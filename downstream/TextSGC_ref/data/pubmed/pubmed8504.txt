Sensory neuroscience aims to build models that predict neural responses and perceptual behaviors and that provide insight into the principles that give rise to them. For decades artificial neural networks trained to perform perceptual tasks have attracted interest as potential models of neural computation. Only recently however have such systems begun to perform at human levels on some real-world tasks. The recent engineering successes of deep learning have led to renewed interest in artificial neural networks as models of the brain. Here we review applications of deep learning to sensory neuroscience discussing potential limitations and future directions. We highlight the potential uses of deep neural networks to reveal how task performance may constrain neural systems and behavior. In particular we consider how task-optimized networks can generate hypotheses about neural representations and functional organization in ways that are analogous to traditional ideal observer models. Deep neural network models of sensory systems: windows onto the role of task constraints.
