Background: Artificial Intelligence AI frameworks have emerged as a novel approach in medicine. However information regarding its applicability and effectiveness in a clinical prognostic factor setting remains unclear. Methods: The AI framework was derived from a pooled dataset of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ICC patients from three clinical centers n = 1421 by applying the TensorFlow deep learning algorithm to Cox-indicated pathologic four serologic six and etiologic two factors; this algorithm was validated using a dataset of ICC patients from an independent clinical center n = 234. The model was compared to the commonly used staging system American Joint Committee on Cancer; AJCC and methodology Cox regression by evaluating the brier score BS integrated discrimination improvement IDI net reclassification improvement NRI and area under curve AUC values. Results: The framework BS 0.17; AUC 0.78 was found to be more accurate than the AJCC stage BS 0.48; AUC 0.60; IDI 0.29; NRI 11.85; P < 0.001 and the Cox model BS 0.49; AUC 0.70; IDI 0.46; NRI 46.11; P < 0.001. Furthermore hazard ratios greater than three were identified in both overall survival HR; 3.190; 95% confidence interval CI 2.150-4.733; P < 0.001 and disease-free survival HR 3.559; 95% CI 2.500-5.067; P < 0.001 between latent risk and stable groups in validation. In addition the latent risk subgroup was found to be significantly benefited from adjuvant treatment HR 0.459; 95% CI 0.360-0.586; P < 0.001. Conclusions: The AI framework seems promising in the prognostic estimation and stratification of susceptible individuals for adjuvant treatment in patients with ICC after resection. Future prospective validations are needed for the framework to be applied in clinical practice.
