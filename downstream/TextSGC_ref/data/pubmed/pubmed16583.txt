Accurate classification of human aquatic activities using radar has a variety of potential applications such as rescue operations and border patrols. Nevertheless the classification of activities on water using radar has not been extensively studied unlike the case on dry ground due to its unique challenge. Namely not only is the radar cross section of a human on water small but the micro-Doppler signatures are much noisier due to water drops and waves. In this paper we first investigate whether discriminative signatures could be obtained for activities on water through a simulation study. Then we show how we can effectively achieve high classification accuracy by applying deep convolutional neural networks DCNN directly to the spectrogram of real measurement data. From the five-fold cross-validation on our dataset which consists of five aquatic activities we report that the conventional feature-based scheme only achieves an accuracy of 45.1%. In contrast the DCNN trained using only the collected data attains 66.7% and the transfer learned DCNN which takes a DCNN pre-trained on a RGB image dataset and fine-tunes the parameters using the collected data achieves a much higher 80.3% which is a significant performance boost.
