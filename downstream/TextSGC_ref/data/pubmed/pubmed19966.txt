A virtual reality simulator developed for orthopaedic and trauma surgical training has been introduced. However it is unclear whether the experiences of actual surgery are reflected in virtual reality simulation surgery VRSS using a simulator. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the results in VRSS differ between a trauma expert and a trauma novice. Is actual surgical experience reflected in virtual reality simulation surgery for a femoral neck fracture?
