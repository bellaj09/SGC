"This review is one of a series of rapid reviews that Cochrane contributors have prepared to inform the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread such as during the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare workers adherence to infection prevention and control IPC guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment PPE such as masks face shields gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines.
