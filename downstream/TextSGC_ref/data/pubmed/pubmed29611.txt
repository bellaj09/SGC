The achievement of multiple instances of control with the same type of mental strategy represents a way to improve flexibility of brain-computer interface BCI systems. Here we test the hypothesis that pure visual motion imagery of an external actuator can be used as a tool to achieve three classes of electroencephalographic EEG based control which might be useful in attention disorders. Pure visual imagery as a potential approach to achieve three classes of control for implementation of BCI in non-motor disorders.
