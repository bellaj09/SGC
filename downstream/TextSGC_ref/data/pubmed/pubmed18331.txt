As the considerable technical challenges involved with generating crystal structures of G guanine nucleotide- binding protein-coupled receptors GPCRs are starting to be successfully addressed opportunities to apply fragment-based drug discovery FBDD to this class of target are becoming a reality. GPCRs represent a large and important family of drug targets with considerable clinical and commercial interest. While their general seven transmembrane helix bundle structures are amenable to therapeutic intervention with small molecules to date successful drugs have primarily been discovered using traditional competitive or function-based screening. With advances in biophysical screening techniques such as Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR and Target-Immobilised NMR Screening TINS being matched to developments in molecular dynamics simulations virtual screening and stabilisation of biologically relevant conformations of GPCRs structure-based approaches using fragment starting points are beginning to be applied to the discovery of new generations of small molecules.
