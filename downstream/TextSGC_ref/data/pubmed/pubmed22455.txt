Noninvasive electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs popularly utilize event-related potential ERP for intent detection. Specifically for EEG-based BCI typing systems different symbol presentation paradigms have been utilized to induce ERPs. In this manuscript through an experimental study we assess the speed recorded signal quality and system accuracy of a language-model-assisted BCI typing system using three different presentation paradigms: a 4  7 matrix paradigm of a 28-character alphabet with row-column presentation RCP and single-character presentation SCP and rapid serial visual presentation RSVP of the same. Our analyses show that signal quality and classification accuracy are comparable between the two visual stimulus presentation paradigms. In addition we observe that while the matrix-based paradigm can be generally employed with lower inter-trial-interval ITI values the best presentation paradigm and ITI value configuration is user dependent. This potentially warrants offering both presentation paradigms and variable ITI options to users of BCI typing systems.
