Optical coherence tomography OCT is used for non-invasive diagnosis of diabetic macular edema assessing the retinal layers. In this paper we propose a new fully convolutional deep architecture termed ReLayNet for end-to-end segmentation of retinal layers and fluid masses in eye OCT scans. ReLayNet uses a contracting path of convolutional blocks encoders to learn a hierarchy of contextual features followed by an expansive path of convolutional blocks decoders for semantic segmentation. ReLayNet is trained to optimize a joint loss function comprising of weighted logistic regression and Dice overlap loss. The framework is validated on a publicly available benchmark dataset with comparisons against five state-of-the-art segmentation methods including two deep learning based approaches to substantiate its effectiveness.
