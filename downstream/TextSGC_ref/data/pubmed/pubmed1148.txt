The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. Due to growing demand for reagents and/or kits to extract SARS-CoV-2 RNA for subsequent RT-qPCR diagnostics there is a worldwide risk of shortages. With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% 95% CI:\u200986.2-99.9% we describe a simple fast alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 min at 98\u2009C before a commonly-used RT-qPCR procedure. An alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 - escape from the NA extraction kit-shortage Copenhagen Denmark March 2020.
