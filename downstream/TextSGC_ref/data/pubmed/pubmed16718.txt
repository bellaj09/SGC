Unsupervised multilayered &#x201C;deep&#x201D; models are considered for imagery. The model is represented using a hierarchical convolutional factor-analysis construction with sparse factor loadings and scores. The computation of layer-dependent model parameters is implemented within a Bayesian setting employing a Gibbs sampler and variational Bayesian VB analysis that explicitly exploit the convolutional nature of the expansion. To address large-scale and streaming data an online version of VB is also developed. The number of dictionary elements at each layer is inferred from the data based on a beta-Bernoulli implementation of the Indian buffet process. Example results are presented for several image-processing applications with comparisons to related models in the literature. Deep learning with hierarchical convolutional factor analysis.
