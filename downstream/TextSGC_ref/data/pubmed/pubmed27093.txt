We present results of an approach to a code-modulated visual evoked potential cVEP based brain-computer interface BCI paradigm using four high-frequency flashing stimuli. To generate higher frequency stimulation compared to the state-of-the-art cVEP-based BCIs we propose to use the light-emitting diodes LEDs driven from a small micro-controller board hardware generator designed by our team. The high-frequency and green-blue chromatic flashing stimuli are used in the study in order to minimize a danger of a photosensitive epilepsy PSE. We compare the the green-blue chromatic cVEP-based BCI accuracies with the conventional white-black flicker based interface. The high-frequency cVEP responses are identified using a canonical correlation analysis CCA method. Chromatic and high-frequency cVEP-based BCI paradigm.
