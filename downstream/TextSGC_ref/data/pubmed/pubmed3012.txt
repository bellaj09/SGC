COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory distress SARS-corona virus-2 SARS-CoV-2. Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy.

It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals. Pharmacologic treatment of transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2: considerations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and drug-drug interactions.
