AsTeRICS - "The Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set" is a construction set for assistive technologies which can be adapted to the motor abilities of end-users. AsTeRICS allows access to different devices such as PCs cell phones and smart home devices with all of them integrated in a platform adapted as much as possible to each user. People with motor disabilities in the upper limbs with no cognitive impairment no perceptual limitations neither visual nor auditory and with basic skills in using technologies such as PCs cell phones electronic agendas etc. have available a flexible and adaptable technology which enables them to access the Human-Machine-Interfaces HMI on the standard desktop and beyond. AsTeRICS provides graphical model design tools a middleware and hardware support for the creation of tailored AT-solutions involving bioelectric signal acquisition Brain-/Neural Computer Interfaces Computer-Vision techniques and standardized actuator and device controls and allows combining several off-the-shelf AT-devices in every desired combination. Novel end-user ready solutions can be created and adapted via a graphical editor without additional programming efforts. The AsTeRICS open-source framework provides resources for utilization and extension of the system to developers and researches. AsTeRICS was developed by the AsTeRICS project and was partially funded by EC. AsTeRICS.
