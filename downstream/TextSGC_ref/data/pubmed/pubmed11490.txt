This study aims to produce non-contrast computed tomography CT images using a deep convolutional neural network CNN for imaging. Twenty-nine patients were selected. CT images were acquired without and with a contrast enhancement medium. The transverse images were divided into 64  64 pixels. This resulted in 14 723 patches in total for both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT image pairs. The proposed CNN model comprises five two-dimensional 2D convolution layers with one shortcut path. For comparison the U-net model which comprises five 2D convolution layers interleaved with pooling and unpooling layers was used. Training was performed in 24 patients and for testing of trained models another 5 patients were used. For quantitative evaluation 50 regions of interest ROIs were selected on the reference contrast-enhanced image of the test data and the mean pixel value of the ROIs was calculated. The mean pixel values of the ROIs at the same location on the reference non-contrast image and the predicted non-contrast image were calculated and those values were compared. Regarding the quantitative analysis the difference in mean pixel value between the reference contrast-enhanced image and the predicted non-contrast image was significant P < 0.0001 for both models. Significant differences in pixels P < 0.0001 were found using the U-net model; in contrast there was no significant difference using the proposed CNN model when comparing the reference non-contrast images and the predicted non-contrast images. Using the proposed CNN model the contrast-enhanced region was satisfactorily reduced. Deep convolutional neural network for reduction of contrast-enhanced region on CT images.
