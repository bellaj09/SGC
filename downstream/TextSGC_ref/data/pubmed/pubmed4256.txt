Human brain functional connectivity FC is often measured as the similarity of functional MRI responses across brain regions when a brain is either resting or performing a task. This paper aims to statistically analyze the dynamic nature of FC by representing the collective time-series data over a set of brain regions as a trajectory on the space of covariance matrices or symmetric-positive definite matrices SPDMs. We use a recently developed metric on the space of SPDMs for quantifying differences across FC observations and for clustering and classification of FC trajectories. To facilitate large scale and high-dimensional data analysis we propose a novel metric-based dimensionality reduction technique to reduce data from large SPDMs to small SPDMs. We illustrate this comprehensive framework using data from the Human Connectome Project HCP database for multiple subjects and tasks with task classification rates that match or outperform state-of-the-art techniques.
