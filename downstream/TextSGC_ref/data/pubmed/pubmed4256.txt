Morphometric correlation networks of cortical thickness surface area and gray matter volume have statistically different structural topology. However there is no report directly describing their correlation patterns in view of interregional covariance. Here we examined the characteristics of the correlation patterns in three morphometric networks of cortical thickness surface area and gray matter volume using a Venn diagram concept across 314 normal subjects. We found that over 60% of all nonoverlapping correlation patterns emerged with divergent unique patterns while there were 10% of all common edges in ipsilateral and homotopic regions among the three morphometric correlation networks. It was also found that the network parameters of the three networks were different. Our findings showed that correlation patterns of the network itself can provide complementary information when compared with network properties. We demonstrate that morphometric correlation networks of distinct structural phenotypes have different correlation patterns and different network properties. This finding implies that the topology of each morphometric correlation network may reflect different aspects of each morphometric descriptor.
