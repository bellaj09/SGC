"The design of recommendation strategies in the adaptive learning systems focuses on utilizing currently available information to provide learners with individual-specific learning instructions. As a critical motivate for human behaviours curiosity is essentially the drive to explore knowledge and seek information. In a psychologically inspired view we propose a curiosity-driven recommendation policy within the reinforcement learning framework allowing for an efficient and enjoyable personalized learning path. Specifically a curiosity reward from a well-designed predictive model is generated to model ones familiarity with the knowledge space. Given such curiosity rewards we apply the actor-critic method to approximate the policy directly through neural networks. Numerical analyses with a large continuous knowledge state space and concrete learning scenarios are provided to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method."
