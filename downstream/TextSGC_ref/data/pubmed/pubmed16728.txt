Dysfunction of allocentric and egocentric memories is one of the core features of psychiatric disorders. There are a few navigational studies on these memories in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders but studies in schizoaffective disorder are lacking. Here we aim to explore allocentric and egocentric navigation deficits in these subjects using our advanced recently developed virtual reality navigation task VRNT. Twenty patients with schizophrenia and 20 with schizoaffective disorder were compared with 20 normal volunteer subjects on VRNTs consisting of a virtual neighbourhood allocentric memory and a virtual maze egocentric memory. Compared with schizoaffective disorder and control subjects patients with schizophrenia had the worst performance on both virtual neighbourhood and virtual maze tasks. The allocentric memory in both patients with schizophrenia and those with schizoaffective disorder was more impaired than the egocentric memory p\xa0\xa00.001. However the patients with schizoaffective disorder performed better in egocentric memory than those with schizophrenia as they had fewer errors in the virtual maze. It was concluded that allocentric memory is more impaired than egocentric in both schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia patients whereas patients with schizoaffective disorder performed better in egocentric memory than patients with schizophrenia. It was also concluded that allocentric memory deficits can help differentiate patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder from healthy participants whereas egocentric memory deficits can be used to distinguish them from each other. Differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder from normal subjects using virtual reality.
