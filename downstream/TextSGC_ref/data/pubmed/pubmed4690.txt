Depression a condition commonly comorbid with multiple sclerosis MS is associated more generally with elevated inflammatory markers and hippocampal pathology. We hypothesized that neuroinflammation in the hippocampus is responsible for depression associated with MS. We characterized the relationship between depressive symptoms and hippocampal microglial activation in patients with MS using the 18-kDa translocator protein radioligand 18FPBR111. To evaluate pathophysiologic mechanisms we explored the relationships between hippocampal neuroinflammation depressive symptoms and hippocampal functional connectivities defined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
