"Levodopa-induced dyskinesia LID represents a significant source of discomfort for people with Parkinsons disease PD. It negatively affects quality of life it is associated with both motor and nonmotor fluctuations and it brings an increased risk of disability balance problems and falls. Although the prevalence of severe LID appears to be lower than in previous eras likely owing to a more conservative use of oral levodopa we have not yet found a way to prevent the development of this complication. Advanced surgical therapies such as deep brain stimulation ameliorate LID but only a minority of PD patients qualify for these interventions. Although some have argued that PD patients would rather be ON with dyskinesia than OFF the deeper truth is that patients would very much prefer to be ON without dyskinesia. As researchers and clinicians we should aspire to make that goal a reality. To this end translational research on LID is to be encouraged and persistently pursued." Dyskinesia matters.
