Accurately predicting distant metastasis in head & neck cancer has the potential to improve patient survival by allowing early treatment intensification with systemic therapy for high-risk patients. By extracting large amounts of quantitative features and mining them radiomics has achieved success in predicting treatment outcomes for various diseases. However there are several challenges associated with conventional radiomic approaches including: 1 how to optimally combine information extracted from multiple modalities; 2 how to construct models emphasizing different objectives for different clinical applications; and 3 how to utilize and fuse output obtained by multiple classifiers. To overcome these challenges we propose a unified model termed as multifaceted radiomics M-radiomics. In M-radiomics a deep learning with stacked sparse autoencoder is first utilized to fuse features extracted from different modalities into one representation feature set. A multi-objective optimization model is then introduced into M-radiomics where probability- based objective functions are designed to maximize the similarity between the probability output and the true label vector. Finally M-radiomics employs multiple base classifiers to get a diverse Pareto-optimal model set and then fuses the output probabilities of all the Pareto-optimal models through an evidential reasoning rule fusion ERRF strategy in the testing stage to obtain the final output probability. Experimental results show that M-radiomics with the stacked autoencoder outperforms the model without the autoencoder. M-radiomics obtained more accurate results with a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than other single-objective or single-classifier-based models.
