"One of the main problems of EEG-based brain computer interfaces BCIs is their low information rate thus for complex tasks the user needs large amounts of time to solve the task. In an attempt to reduce this time and improve the application robustness recent works have explored shared-control strategies where the device does not only execute the decoded commands but it is also involved in executing the task. This work proposes a shared-control BCI using error potentials for a 2D reaching task with discrete actions and states. The proposed system has several interesting properties: the system is scalable without increasing the complexity of the users mental task; the interaction is natural for the user as the mental task is to monitor the device performance to promote its task learning in this context the reaching task; and the system has the potential to be combined with additional brain signals to recover or learn from interaction errors. Online control experiments were performed with four subjects showing that it was possible to reach a goal location from any starting point within a 55 grid in around 23 actions about 19 seconds of EEG signal both with fixed goals and goals freely chosen by the users."
