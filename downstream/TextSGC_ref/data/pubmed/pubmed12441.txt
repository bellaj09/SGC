"In the field of aerial image object detection based on deep learning its difficult to extract features because the images are obtained from a top-down perspective. Therefore there are numerous false detection boxes. The existing post-processing methods mainly remove overlapped detection boxes but its hard to eliminate false detection boxes. The proposed dual non-maximum suppression dual-NMS combines the density of detection boxes that are generated for each detected object with the corresponding classification confidence to autonomously remove the false detection boxes. With the dual-NMS as a post-processing method the precision is greatly improved under the premise of keeping recall unchanged. In vehicle detection in aerial imagery VEDAI and dataset for object detection in aerial images DOTA datasets the removal rate of false detection boxes is over 50%. Additionally according to the characteristics of aerial images the correlation calculation layer for feature channel separation and the dilated convolution guidance structure are proposed to enhance the feature extraction ability of the network and these structures constitute the correlation network CorrNet. Compared with you only look once YOLOv3 the mean average precision mAP of the CorrNet for DOTA increased by 9.78%. Commingled with dual-NMS the detection effect in aerial images is significantly improved."
