Tinnitus is the sound heard in the absence of physical sound sources external or internal to the body. Tinnitus never occurs in isolation; it typically develops after hearing loss and not infrequently for losses at the higher frequencies not tested in clinical audiology. Furthermore tinnitus is often accompanied by hyperacusis i.e. increased loudness sensitivity which may reflect the central gain change in the auditory system that occurs after hearing loss. I will first review the electrophysiological findings in the thalamus and cortex pertaining to animal research into tinnitus. This will comprise the changes in tonotopic maps spontaneous firing rates and changes in pairwise neural cross-correlation induced by tinnitus-inducing agents that are commonly used in animal experiments. These are systemic application of sodium salicylate and noise exposure at levels ranging from those that do not cause a hearing loss to those that only cause a temporary threshold shift to those that cause a permanent hearing loss. Following this I will review neuroimaging and electrophysiological findings in the auditory cortex in humans with tinnitus. The neural substrates of tinnitus derived from animal data do not apply universally as neither hearing loss nor hyperacusis appear to be necessary conditions for tinnitus to occur in humans. Finally I will relate the findings in humans to the predictions from animal models of tinnitus. These comparisons indicate that neural correlates of tinnitus can be studied successfully both at the level of animal models and in humans.
