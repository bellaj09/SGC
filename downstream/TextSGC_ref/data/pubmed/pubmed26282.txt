Research on brain-computer interfaces BCIs is gaining strong interest. This is motivated by BCIs being applicable for helping disabled for gaming and as a tool in cognitive neuroscience. Often motor imagery is used to produce binary control signals. However finding other types of control signals that allow the discrimination of multiple classes would help to increase the applicability of BCIs. We have investigated if modulation of posterior alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention in two dimensions can be reliably classified in single trials. Magnetoencephalography MEG data were collected for 15 subjects who were engaged in a task where they covertly had to visually attend left right up or down during a period of 2500 ms. We then classified the trials using support vector machines. The four orientations of covert attention could be reliably classified up to a maximum of 69% correctly classified trials 25% chance level without the need for lengthy and burdensome subject training. Low classification performance in some subjects was explained by a low alpha signal. These findings support the case that modulation of alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention is promising as a control signal for a two-dimensional BCI.
