Despite partial success communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing a state called complete locked-in state CLIS. Based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric brain-computer interface BCI communication attempts in CLIS we here report BCI communication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS and an implicit attentional processing procedure. Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS-two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS without reliable means of communication-learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a "yes" or "no" thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. Three patients completed more than 46 sessions spread over several weeks and one patient patient W completed 20 sessions. Online fNIRS classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine SVM resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70%. Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a "yes" or "no" response. However electroencephalogram EEG changes in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior communication performance probably because of decreased vigilance and attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS these positive results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in states at least for ALS. RETRACTED ARTICLE
