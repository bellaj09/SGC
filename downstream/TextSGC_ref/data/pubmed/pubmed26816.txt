The development of advanced and effective human-machine interfaces especially for amputees to control their prostheses is very high priority and a very active area of research. An intuitive control method should retain an adequate level of functionality for dexterous operation provide robustness against confounding factors and supply adaptability for diverse long-term usage all of which are current problems being tackled by researchers. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art as well as the limitations of current myoelectric signal control MSC methods. To address the research topic on functionality we review different approaches to prosthetic hand control DOF configuration discrete or simultaneous etc. and how well the control is performed accuracy response intuitiveness etc.. To address the research on robustness we review the confounding factors limb positions electrode shift force variance and inadvertent activity that affect the stability of the control performance. Lastly to address adaptability we review the strategies that can automatically adjust the classifier for different individuals and for long-term usage. This review provides a thorough overview of the current MSC methods and helps highlight the current areas of research focus and resulting clinic usability for the MSC methods for upper-limb prostheses. Improving the functionality robustness and adaptability of myoelectric control for dexterous motion restoration.
