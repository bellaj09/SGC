Aberrant structural diffusion tensor imaging DTI and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imagining connectivity are core features of bipolar disorder. However few studies have explored the integrity agreement between structural and functional connectivity SC-FC in bipolar disorder. We examine SC connectivity coupling index whether could potentially provide additional clinical predictive value for bipolar disorder spectrum disorders besides the intramodality network measures. By examining the structural DTI and resting-state functional network properties as well as their coupling index among 57 euthymic bipolar disorder patients age 13-28 years 18 females and 42 age- and gender-matched healthy controls age 13-28 years 16 females we found that compared to controls bipolar disorder patients showed increased structural rich-club connectivity as well as decreased functional modularity. Importantly the coupling strength between structural and functional connectome was decreased in patients compared to controls which emerged as the most powerful feature discriminating the two groups. Our findings suggest that structural-functional coupling strength could serve as a valuable biological trait-like feature for bipolar disorder over and above the intramodality network measures. Such measure can have important clinical implications for early identification of bipolar disorder individuals and inform strategies for prevention of bipolar disorder onset and relapse.
