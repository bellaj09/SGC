The neocognitron is a deep multi-layered convolutional neural network that can be trained to recognize visual patterns robustly. In the intermediate layers of the neocognitron local features are extracted from input patterns. In the deepest layer based on the features extracted in the intermediate layers input patterns are classified into classes. A method called IntVec interpolating-vector is used for this purpose. This paper proposes a new learning rule called margined Winner-Take-All mWTA for training the deepest layer. Every time when a training pattern is presented during the learning if the result of recognition by WTA Winner-Take-All is an error a new cell is generated in the deepest layer. Here we put a certain amount of margin to the WTA. In other words only during the learning a certain amount of handicap is given to cells of classes other than that of the training vector and the winner is chosen under this handicap. By introducing the margin to the WTA we can generate a compact set of cells with which a high recognition rate can be obtained with a small computational cost. The ability of this mWTA is demonstrated by computer simulation. Margined winner-take-all: New learning rule for pattern recognition.
