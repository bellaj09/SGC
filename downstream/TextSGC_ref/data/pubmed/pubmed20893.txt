Several neurorehabilitation strategies have been introduced over the last decade based on the so-called simulation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that a neural network located in primary and secondary motor areas is activated not only during overt motor execution but also during observation or imagery of the same motor action. Based on this hypothesis we investigated the combination of a virtual reality VR based neurorehabilitation system together with a wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS instrument. This combination is particularly appealing from a rehabilitation perspective as it may allow minimally constrained monitoring during neurorehabilitative training. Testing the potential of a virtual reality neurorehabilitation system during performance of observation imagery and imitation of motor actions recorded by wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS.
