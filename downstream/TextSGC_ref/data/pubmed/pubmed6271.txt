Prenatal alcohol exposure has been linked to a broad range of developmental deficits with eyeblink classical conditioning EBC among the most sensitive endpoints. This fMRI study compared EBC-related brain activity in 47 children with fetal alcohol syndrome FAS partial FAS PFAS heavily exposed HE non-syndromal children and healthy controls. All of the children had previously participated in two EBC studies conducted as part of our longitudinal study of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Although learning-related behavioral differences were seen in all groups during the scans controls showed more conditioned responses CR than the alcohol-exposed groups. Despite lower conditioning levels relative to controls the exposed groups exhibited extensive cerebellar activations. Specifically children with FAS/PFAS showed increased activation of cerebellar lobule VI in session 2 while HE children showed increased activation in session 1. Continuous measures of prenatal alcohol use correlated with learning-related activations in cerebellum and frontal cortices. Only controls showed significant cerebellar activation-CR correlations in the deep nuclei and lateral lobule VI suggesting that these key regions supporting EBC may be functionally disorganized in alcohol-exposed children. These findings are the first to characterize abnormalities in brain function associated with the behavioral conditioning deficits seen in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.
