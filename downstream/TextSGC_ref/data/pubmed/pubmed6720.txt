The unique morphology and pattern of synaptic connections made by a neuron during development arise in part by an extended period of growth in which cell-cell interactions help to sculpt the arbor into its final shape size and participation in different synaptic networks. Recent experiments highlight a guiding role played by gap junction proteins in controlling this process. Ectopic and overexpression studies in invertebrates have revealed that the selective expression of distinct gap junction genes in neurons and glial cells is sufficient to establish selective new connections in the central nervous systems of the leech Firme et al. 2012: J Neurosci 32:14265-14270 the nematode Rabinowitch et al. 2014: Nat Commun 5:4442 and the fruit fly Pzier et al. 2016: PLoS One 11:e0152211. We present here an overview of this work and suggest that gap junction proteins in addition to their synaptic/communicative functions have an instructive role as recognition and adhesion factors.
