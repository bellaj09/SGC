Due to the tremendous technical progress that has been made in recent years and the increased interest in using new technologies in sports and exercise the effects of "exergaming" exercise with video games and the use of an interactive computer-generated virtual reality on human health have been investigated in numerous research projects. This systematic mini review analyzes the effects of regular exergaming in patients with components of metabolic syndrome. The review indicates that improvements in different variables e.g. body mass index body fat glycemic control and blood lipid/lipoprotein levels as well as blood pressure can be achieved through regular exergaming. Future studies should examine whether exergaming can motivate patients with metabolic syndrome to engage in physical activity in the long term. Support from and initial supervision by health professionals sports coaches physiotherapists are recommended to increase positive outcomes. Exergaming for patients with metabolic syndrome?!
