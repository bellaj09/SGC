This paper presents a review of virtual reality telemedicine and systems engineering design concepts that relate to the human performance of mission tasks during long duration spaceflight. A Mini-Case Study of the MIR/Progress collision is discussed and serves to highlight some of the key issues. We review some physiologic changes which occur as a result of long duration spaceflight discuss issues associated with performing required mission tasks and integrate concepts from telemedicine and virtual reality as possible methods and technologies to alleviate some of the deleterious effects of extended space missions. Some virtual reality and telemedicine applications useful for long duration spaceflight from a systems engineering perspective.
