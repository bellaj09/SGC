"We describe a novel markerless camera tracking approach and user interaction methodology for augmented reality AR on unprepared tabletop environments. We propose a real-time system architecture that combines two types of feature tracking. Distinctive image features of the scene are detected and tracked frame-to-frame by computing optical flow. In order to achieve real-time performance multiple operations are processed in a synchronized multi-threaded manner: capturing a video frame tracking features using optical flow detecting distinctive invariant features and rendering an output frame. We also introduce user interaction methodology for establishing a global coordinate system and for placing virtual objects in the AR environment by tracking a users outstretched hand and estimating a camera pose relative to it. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of our hybrid feature tracking approach and demonstrate a proof-of-concept application for enabling AR in unprepared tabletop environments using bare hands for interaction."
