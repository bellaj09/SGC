Breast cancer is a common gynecological disease that poses a great threat to women health due to its high malignant rate. Breast cancer screening tests are used to find any warning signs or symptoms for early detection and currently Ultrasound screening is the preferred method for breast cancer diagnosis. The localization and segmentation of the lesions in breast ultrasound BUS images are helpful for clinical diagnosis of the disease. In this paper an RDAU-NET Residual-Dilated-Attention-Gate-UNet model is proposed and employed to segment the tumors in BUS images. The model is based on the conventional U-Net but the plain neural units are replaced with residual units to enhance the edge information and overcome the network performance degradation problem associated with deep networks. To increase the receptive field and acquire more characteristic information dilated convolutions were used to process the feature maps obtained from the encoder stages. The traditional cropping and copying between the encoder-decoder pipelines were replaced by the Attention Gate modules which enhanced the learning capabilities through suppression of background information. The model when tested with BUS images with benign and malignant tumor presented excellent segmentation results as compared to other Deep Networks. A variety of quantitative indicators including Accuracy Dice coefficient AUCArea-Under-Curve Precision Sensitivity Specificity Recall F1score and M-IOU Mean-Intersection-Over-Union provided performances above 80%. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed RDAU-NET model can accurately segment breast lesions when compared to other deep learning models and thus has a good prospect for clinical diagnosis.
