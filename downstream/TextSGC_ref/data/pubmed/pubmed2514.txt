"The Royal College of General Practitioners RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre RSC and Public Health England PHE have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately the RCGP RSCs surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy."
