Diagnosis of renal diseases is often delayed owing to the scarcity of trained physicians lack of facilities and shortage of funds limits effective management particularly when it comes to the red zone of renal replacement therapy. The Internetis expected to open up a myriad resource of knowledge and applications for academicians researchers and clinicians alike in all health care professions across the globe. Also the Internet has grown rapidly over the years and will inevitably expand even more. Evolving technologies offer modern applications for information management communications with multimedia and virtual reality. Now these innovative technologies have opened up newer possibilities for nephrologists. As Internet is serving as a backbone for these modern technologies it is an utmost necessity to use and refine Internet applications for future nephrologists. Increasingly easy access to Internet has dramatically reduced barriers in sharing of information among basic and clinical nephrologists. Considering the growing scope for nephrologists in the use of Internet it is necessary to understand Internet as a source of information and backbone of modern application. This review illustrates expanding roles of the Internet for the nephrologists and provides ready to use compilation of useful academic research clinical resources and is expected to introduce stimulate and guide nephrologists into the realm of the world wide web. It also investigates how Internet is supporting in growth and development of the field of nephrology and present and future scopes of Internet as a tool for professionals involved in this area as well as information about biological sciences and it also gives information about societies in various continents working in field of nephrology and the links useful for clinicians and research scientists.
