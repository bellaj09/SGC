Brain-control behaviors BCBs are behaviors of humans that communicate with external devices by means of the human brain rather than peripheral nerves or muscles. In this paper to understand and simulate such behaviors we propose a mathematical model by combining a queuing network-based encoding model with a brain-computer interface model. Experimental results under the static tests show the effectiveness of the proposed model in simulating real BCBs. Furthermore we verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model through the dynamic experimental tests in a simulated vehicle. This paper not only promotes the understanding and prediction of BCBs but also provides some insights into assistive technology on brain-controlled systems and extends the scope of research on human behavior modeling.
