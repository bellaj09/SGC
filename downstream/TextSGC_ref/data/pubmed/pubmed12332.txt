"In this paper a marker-based single-person optical motion capture method DeepMoCap is proposed using multiple spatio-temporally aligned infrared-depth sensors and retro-reflective straps and patches reflectors. DeepMoCap explores motion capture by automatically localizing and labeling reflectors on depth images and subsequently on 3D space. Introducing a non-parametric representation to encode the temporal correlation among pairs of colorized depthmaps and 3D optical flow frames a multi-stage Fully Convolutional Network FCN architecture is proposed to jointly learn reflector locations and their temporal dependency among sequential frames. The extracted reflector 2D locations are spatially mapped in 3D space resulting in robust 3D optical data extraction. The subjects motion is efficiently captured by applying a template-based fitting technique on the extracted optical data. Two datasets have been created and made publicly available for evaluation purposes; one comprising multi-view depth and 3D optical flow annotated images DMC2.5D and a second consisting of spatio-temporally aligned multi-view depth images along with skeleton inertial and ground truth MoCap data DMC3D. The FCN model outperforms its competitors on the DMC2.5D dataset using 2D Percentage of Correct Keypoints PCK metric while the motion capture outcome is evaluated against RGB-D and inertial data fusion approaches on DMC3D outperforming the next best method by 4 . 5 % in total 3D PCK accuracy."
