"As experts in the realm of applying brain imaging technology for meaningful information on an individual patients medical care neuroradiologists can provide a physiologic pathophysiologic and clinical context for the advances achieved from brain-mapping. Precise identification of the abnormalities involved in brain conditions resulting from a multidisciplinary effort including neuroradiology will help to further define the nature of the pathology evaluate the results of therapy and improve health care." Brain mapping project: clinical aspects and role of neuroradiology.
