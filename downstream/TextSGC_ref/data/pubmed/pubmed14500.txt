Fluorescence molecular tomography FMT as well as mesoscopic FMT MFMT is widely employed to investigate molecular level processes ex vivo or in vivo. However acquiring depth-localized and less blurry reconstruction still remains challenging especially when fluorophore dye is located within large scattering coefficient media. Herein a two-stage deep learning-based three-dimensional 3-D reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The key point for the proposed algorithm is to employ a 3-D convolutional neural network to correctly predict the boundary of reconstructions leading refined results. Compared with conventional algorithm in silico experiments show that relative volume and absolute centroid error reduce over  50 % whereas intersection over union increases over 15% for most situations. These results preliminarily indicate the promising future of appropriately applying machine learning deep learning-based methods in MFMT.
