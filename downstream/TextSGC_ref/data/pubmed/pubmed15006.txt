"Alternative polyadenylation polyA sites near the 3 end of a pre-mRNA create multiple mRNA transcripts with different 3 untranslated regions 3 UTRs. The sequence elements of a 3 UTR are essential for many biological activities such as mRNA stability sub-cellular localization protein translation protein binding and translation efficiency. Moreover numerous studies in the literature have reported the correlation between diseases and the shortening or lengthening of 3 UTRs. As alternative polyA sites are common in mammalian genes several machine learning tools have been published for predicting polyA sites from sequence data. These tools either consider limited sequence features or use relatively old algorithms for polyA site prediction. Moreover none of the previous tools consider RNA secondary structures as a feature to predict polyA sites." DeepPASTA: deep neural network based polyadenylation site analysis.
