In this paper we propose a new Intelligent Traffic Sign Recognition ITSR system with illumination preprocessing capability. Our proposed Dark Area Sensitive Tone Mapping DASTM technique can enhance the illumination of only dark regions of an image with little impact on bright regions. We used this technique as a pre-processing module for our new traffic sign recognition system. We combined DASTM with a TS detector an optimized version of YOLOv3 for the detection of three classes of traffic signs. We trained ITSR on a dataset of Korean traffic signs with prohibitory mandatory and danger classes. We achieved Mean Average Precision MAP value of 90.07% previous best result was 86.61% on challenging Korean Traffic Sign Detection KTSD dataset and 100% on German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark GTSDB. Result comparisons of ITSR with latest D-Patches TS detector and YOLOv3 show that our new ITSR significantly outperforms in recognition performance.
