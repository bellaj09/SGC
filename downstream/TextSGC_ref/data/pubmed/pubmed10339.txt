Deep learning-based auto-segmented contours DC aim to alleviate labour intensive contouring of organs at risk OAR and clinical target volumes CTV. Most previous DC validation studies have a limited number of expert observers for comparison and/or use a validation dataset related to the training dataset. We determine if DC models are comparable to Radiation Oncologist RO inter-observer variability on an independent dataset. Comparing deep learning-based auto-segmentation of organs at risk and clinical target volumes to expert inter-observer variability in radiotherapy planning.
