Pure speech delay is a common developmental disorder which according to some estimates affects 5%-8% of the population. Speech delay may not only be an isolated condition but also can be part of a broader condition such as global developmental delay. The present study investigated whether diffusion tensor imaging tractography-based connectome can differentiate global developmental delay from speech delay in young children. Differentiation of Speech Delay and Global Developmental Delay in Children Using DTI Tractography-Based Connectome.
