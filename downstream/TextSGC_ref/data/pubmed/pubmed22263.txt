Humans are undergoing a fateful transformation focusing on artificial intelligence quantum information technology virtual reality etc. which is inseparable from intelligent nano-micro devices. However the booming of "Big Data" brings about an even greater challenge by growing electromagnetic radiation. Herein an innovative flexible multifunctional microsensor is proposed opening up a new horizon for intelligent devices. It integrates "non-crosstalk" multiple perception and green electromagnetic interference shielding only in one pixel with satisfactory sensitivity and fast information feedback. Importantly beneficial by deep insight into the variable-temperature electromagnetic response the microsensor tactfully transforms the urgent threat of electromagnetic radiation into "wealth" further integrating self-power. This result will refresh researchers\ realization of next-generation devices ushering in a new direction for aerospace engineering remote sensing communications medical treatment biomimetic robot prosthetics etc. Variable-Temperature Electron Transport and Dipole Polarization Turning Flexible Multifunctional Microsensor beyond Electrical and Optical Energy.
