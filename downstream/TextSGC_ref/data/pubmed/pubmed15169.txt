"High-risk prediction of cardiovascular disease is of great significance and impendency in medical fields with the increasing phenomenon of sub-health these years. Most existing pathological methods for the prognosis prediction are either costly or prone to misjudgement. Therefore plenty of automated models based on machine learning have been proposed to predict the onset of cardiovascular disease with the premorbid information of patients extracted from their historical Electronic Health Records EHRs. However it is a tough job to select proper features from longitudinal and heterogeneous EHRs and also a great challenge to obtain accurate and robust representations for patients. In this paper we propose an entirely end-to-end model called DeepRisk based on attention mechanism and deep neural networks which can not only learn high-quality features automatically from EHRs but also efficiently integrate heterogeneous and time-ordered medical data and finally predict patients risk of cardiovascular diseases. Experiments are carried out on a real medical dataset and results show that DeepRisk can significantly improve the high-risk prediction accuracy for cardiovascular disease compared with state-of-the-art approaches."
