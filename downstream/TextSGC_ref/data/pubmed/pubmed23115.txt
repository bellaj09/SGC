Background. Brain computer interface BCI is a combination of software and hardware communication protocols that allow brain to control external devices. Main purpose of BCI controlled external devices is to provide communication medium for disabled persons. Now these devices are considered as a new way to rehabilitate patients with impunities. There are certain potentials present in electroencephalogram EEG that correspond to specific event. Main issue is to detect such event related potentials online in such a low signal to noise ratio SNR. In this paper we propose a method that will facilitate the concept of online processing by providing an efficient filtering implementation in a hardware friendly environment by switching to finite impulse response FIR. Main focus of this research is to minimize latency and computational delay of preprocessing related to any BCI application. Four different finite impulse response FIR implementations along with large Laplacian filter are implemented in Xilinx System Generator. Efficiency of 25% is achieved in terms of reduced number of coefficients and multiplications which in turn reduce computational delays accordingly.
