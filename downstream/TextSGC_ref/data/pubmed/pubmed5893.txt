"Deep networks are now able to achieve human-level performance on a broad spectrum of recognition tasks. Independently neuromorphic computing has now demonstrated unprecedented energy-efficiency through a new chip architecture based on spiking neurons low precision synapses and a scalable communication network. Here we demonstrate that neuromorphic computing despite its novel architectural primitives can implement deep convolution networks that i approach state-of-the-art classification accuracy across eight standard datasets encompassing vision and speech ii perform inference while preserving the hardwares underlying energy-efficiency and high throughput running on the aforementioned datasets at between 1200 and 2600 frames/s and using between 25 and 275 mW effectively >6000 frames/s per Watt and iii can be specified and trained using backpropagation with the same ease-of-use as contemporary deep learning. This approach allows the algorithmic power of deep learning to be merged with the efficiency of neuromorphic processors bringing the promise of embedded intelligent brain-inspired computing one step closer."
