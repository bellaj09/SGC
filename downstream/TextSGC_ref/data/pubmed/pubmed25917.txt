In this paper we present new developments in the area of 3D human jaw modeling and animation. CT Computed Tomography scans have traditionally been used to evaluate patients with dental implants assess tumors cysts fractures and surgical procedures. More recently this data has been utilized to generate models. Researchers have reported semi-automatic techniques to segment and model the human jaw from CT images and manually segment the jaw from MRI images. Recently opto-electronic and ultrasonic-based systems JMA from Zebris have been developed to record mandibular position and movement. In this research project we introduce: 1 automatic patient-specific three-dimensional jaw modeling from CT data and 2 three-dimensional jaw motion simulation using jaw tracking data from the JMA system Zebris. The virtual craniofacial patient: 3D jaw modeling and animation.
