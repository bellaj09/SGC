New and emerging media technologies have the potential to induce a variety of experiences in users. In this paper it is argued that the inducement of experience presupposes that users are absorbed in the illusion created by these media. Looking to another successful visual medium film this paper borrows from the techniques used in "shaping experience" to hold spectators\ attention in the illusion of film and identifies what breaks the illusion/experience for spectators. This paper focuses on one medium virtual reality VR and advocates a transparent or "invisible style" of interaction. We argue that transparency keeps users in the "flow" of their activities and consequently enhances experience in users. Breakdown in activities breaks the experience and subsequently provides opportunities to identify and analyze potential causes of usability problems. Adopting activity theory we devise a model of interaction with VR--through consciousness and activity--and introduce the concept of breakdown in illusion. From this a model of effective interaction with VR is devised and the occurrence of breakdown in interaction and illusion is identified along a continuum of engagement. Evaluation guidelines for the design of experience are proposed and applied to usability problems detected in an empirical study of a head-mounted display HMD VR system. This study shows that the guidelines are effective in the evaluation of VR. Finally we look at the potential experiences that may be induced in users and propose a way to evaluate user experience in virtual environments VEs and other new and emerging media. Evaluation for the design of experience in virtual environments: modeling breakdown of interaction and illusion.
