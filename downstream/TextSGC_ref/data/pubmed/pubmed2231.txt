Focal epilepsy is characterised by paroxysmal events reflecting changes in underlying local brain networks. To capture brain network activity at the maximal temporal resolution of the acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data we have previously developed a novel analysis framework called Dynamic Regional Phase Synchrony DRePS. DRePS measures instantaneous mean phase coherence within neighbourhoods of brain voxels. We use it here to examine how the dynamics of the functional connections of regional brain networks are altered in neocortical focal epilepsy. Using task-free fMRI data from 21 subjects with focal epilepsy and 21 healthy controls we calculated the power spectral density of DRePS which is a measure of signal variability in local connectivity estimates. Whole-brain averaged power spectral density of DRePS or signal variability of local connectivity was significantly higher in epilepsy subjects compared to healthy controls. Maximal increase in DRePS spectral power was seen in bilateral inferior frontal cortices ipsilateral mid-cingulate gyrus superior temporal gyrus caudate head and contralateral cerebellum. Our results provide further evidence of common brain abnormalities across people with focal epilepsy. We postulate that dynamic changes in specific cortical brain areas may help maintain brain function in the presence of pathological epileptiform network activity in neocortical focal epilepsy.
