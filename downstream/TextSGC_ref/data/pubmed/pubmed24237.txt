The real-time requirement means that the simulation should be able to follow the actions of the user that may be moving in the virtual environment. The computer system should also store in its memory a three-dimensional 3D model of the virtual environment. In that case a real-time virtual reality system will update the 3D graphic visualization as the user moves so that up-to-date visualization is always shown on the computer screen. Upon completion of the tele-operation the surgeon compares the preoperative and postoperative images and models of the operative field and studies video records of the procedure itself Using intraoperative records animated images of the real tele-procedure performed can be designed. Virtual surgery offers the possibility of preoperative planning in rhinology. The intraoperative use of computer in real time requires development of appropriate hardware and software to connect medical instrumentarium with the computer and to operate the computer by thus connected instrumentarium and sophisticated multimedia interfaces. Application of advanced virtual reality and 3D computer assisted technologies in tele-3D-computer assisted surgery in rhinology.
