Human brain function research has evolved dramatically in the last decades. In this chapter the role of modern methods of recording brain activity in understanding human brain function is explained. Current knowledge of brain function relevant to brain-computer interface BCI research is detailed with an emphasis on the motor system which provides an exceptional level of detail to decoding of intended or attempted movements in paralyzed beneficiaries of BCI technology and translation to computer-mediated actions. BCI technologies that stand to benefit the most of the detailed organization of the human cortex are and for the foreseeable future are likely to be reliant on intracranial electrodes. These evolving technologies are expected to enable severely paralyzed people to regain the faculty of movement and speech in the coming decades. Human brain function and brain-computer interfaces.
