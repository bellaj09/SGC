Simulation-based training SBT in laparoscopic cholecystectomy LCCY provides an opportunity for junior residents to learn the procedure in a safe nonthreatening environment. Mental rehearsal MR has the potential of augmenting skill acquisition. This project investigated the correlation between MR of LCCY with performance on 2 different types of simulators: a procedural task PT training model and virtual reality VR machine. Thinking it through: mental rehearsal and performance on 2 types of laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulators.
