"Attentional disorders ADD feature decreased attention span impulsivity and over-activity interfering with successful lives. Childhood onset ADD frequently persists to adulthood. Etiology may be hereditary or disease associated. Prevalence is 5% but recognition may be overshadowed by comorbidities brain injury mood disorder thereby escaping formal recognition. Blinded diagnosis by MRI has failed. ADD may not itself manifest a single anatomical pattern of brain abnormality but may reflect multiple unique responses to numerous and diverse etiologies. Alternatively a stable ADD-specific brain pattern may be better detected by brain physiology. EEG coherence measuring cortical connectivity is used to explore this possibility." A unique pattern of cortical connectivity characterizes patients with attention deficit disorders: a large electroencephalographic coherence study.
