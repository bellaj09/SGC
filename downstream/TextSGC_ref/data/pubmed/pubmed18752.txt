Mindfulness-based relapse prevention MBRP is a method that combines cognitive behavioral relapse prevention with mindfulness practice. Research suggests that MBRP can effectively reduce withdrawal/craving in people with substance use disorder SUD. An important part of MBRP is to practice mindfulness meditation to cope with high-risk situations for relapse such as stimuli and situations associated with drug taking. Virtual reality cue exposure VRCE may be a complementary approach to MBRP as it allows for controlled and graded presentations of various high-risk situations with distal and proximal drug cues. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of MBRP combined with VRCE in comparison to MBRP alone or treatment as usual on craving and emotional responses in people with methamphetamine use disorders.
