Virtual reality VR systems have been integrated into rehabilitation techniques for phantom limb pain PLP. In this case report we used electroencephalography EEG to analyze corticocortical coherence between the bilateral sensorimotor cortices during vibrotactile stimulation in conjunction with VR rehabilitation in two PLP patients. As a result we observed PLP alleviation and increased alpha wave coherence during VR rehabilitation when stimulation was delivered to the cheek and shoulder referred sensation areas of the affected side. Vibrotactile stimulation with VR rehabilitation may enhance the awareness and movement of the phantom hand. Direct evidence of EEG coherence in alleviating phantom limb pain by virtual referred sensation: Case report.
