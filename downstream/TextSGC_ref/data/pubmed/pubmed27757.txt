We present a novel assistive control strategy for a robotic hip exoskeleton for assisting hip flexion/extension based on a proportional Electromyography EMG strategy. The novelty of the proposed controller relies on the use of the Gastrocnemius Medialis GM EMG signal instead of a hip flexor muscle to control the hip flexion torque. This strategy has two main advantages: first avoiding the placement of the EMG electrodes at the human-robot interface can reduce discomfort issues for the user and motion artifacts of the recorded signals; second using a powerful signal for control such as the GM could improve the reliability of the control system. The control strategy has been tested on eight healthy subjects walking with the robotic hip exoskeleton on the treadmill. We evaluated the controller performance and the effect of the assistance on muscle activities. The tuning of the assistance timing in the controller was subject dependent and varied across subjects. Two muscles could benefit more from the assistive strategy namely the Rectus Femoris directly assisted and the Tibialis Anterior indirectly assisted. A significant correlation was found between the timing of the delivered assistance i.e. synchronism with the biological hip torque and reduction of the hip flexors muscular activity during walking; instead no significant correlations were found for peak torque and peak power. Results suggest that the timing of the assistance is the most significant parameter influencing the effectiveness of the control strategy. The findings of this work could be important for future studies aimed at developing assistive strategies for walking assistance exoskeletons.
