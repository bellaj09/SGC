The human phenome has been widely used with a variety of genomic data sources in the inference of disease genes. However most existing methods thus far derive phenotype similarity based on the analysis of biomedical databases by using the traditional term frequency-inverse document frequency TF-IDF formulation. This framework though intuitive not only ignores semantic relationships between words but also tends to produce high-dimensional vectors and hence lacks the ability to precisely capture intrinsic semantic characteristics of biomedical documents. To overcome these limitations we propose a framework called mimvec to analyze the human phenome by making use of the state-of-the-art deep learning technique in natural language processing. Mimvec: a deep learning approach for analyzing the human phenome.
