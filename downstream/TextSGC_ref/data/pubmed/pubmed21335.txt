Brain-computer interfaces BCIs directly measure brain activity with no physical movement and translate the neural signals into messages. BCIs that employ the P300 event-related brain potential often have used the visual modality. The end user is presented with flashing stimuli that indicate selections for communication control or both. Counting each flash that corresponds to a specific target selection while ignoring other flashes will elicit P300s to only the target selection. P300 BCIs also have been implemented using auditory or tactile stimuli. P300 BCIs have been used with a variety of applications for severely disabled end users in their homes without frequent expert support. P300 BCI research and development has made substantial progress but challenges remain before these tools can become practical devices for impaired patients and perhaps healthy people. 30+ years of P300 brain-computer interfaces.
