Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs mGluR1 and mGluR5 in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of S-35-Dihydroxyphenylglycine DHPG causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors NMDARs which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 PKD1. Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining non-internalized surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents mEPSCs but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs in vitro. Thus we investigated the in vivo effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze MWM and the novel object discrimination NOD tests. Hippocampal protein kinase D1 is necessary for DHPG-induced learning and memory impairments in rats.
