Capsule endoscopy CE is a preferred diagnostic method for analyzing small bowel diseases. However capsule endoscopes capture a sparse number of images because of their mechanical limitations. Post-procedural management using computational methods can enhance image quality. Additional information including depth can be obtained by using recently developed computer vision techniques. It is possible to measure the size of lesions and track the trajectory of capsule endoscopes using the computer vision technology without requiring additional equipment. Moreover the computational analysis of CE images can help detect lesions more accurately within a shorter time. Newly introduced deep leaning-based methods have shown more remarkable results over traditional computerized approaches. A large-scale standard dataset should be prepared to develop an optimal algorithms for improving the diagnostic yield of CE. The close collaboration between information technology and medical professionals is needed. Recent Development of Computer Vision Technology to Improve Capsule Endoscopy.
