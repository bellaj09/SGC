Behavioral assessments of consciousness based on overt command following cannot differentiate patients with disorders of consciousness DOC from those who demonstrate a dissociation between intent/awareness and motor capacity: cognitive motor dissociation CMD. We argue that delineation of peri-personal space PPS - the multisensory-motor space immediately surrounding the body - may differentiate these patients due to its central role in mediating human-environment interactions and putatively in scaffolding a minimal form of selfhood. In Experiment 1 we determined a normative physiological index of PPS by recording electrophysiological EEG responses to tactile auditory or audio-tactile stimulation at different distances 5 vs. 75\u202fcm in healthy volunteers N\u202f=\u202f19. Contrasts between paired AT and summed A\u202f+\u202fT responses demonstrated multisensory supra-additivity when AT stimuli were presented near i.e. within the PPS and highlighted somatosensory-motor sensors as electrodes of interest. In Experiment 2 we recorded EEG in patients behaviorally diagnosed as DOC or putative CMD N\u202f=\u202f17 30 sessions. The PPS-measure developed in Experiment 1 was analyzed in relation with both standard clinical diagnosis i.e. Coma Recovery Scale; CRS-R and a measure of neural complexity associated with consciousness. Results demonstrated a significant correlation between the PPS measure and neural complexity but not with the CRS-R highlighting the added value of the physiological recordings. Further multisensory processing in PPS was preserved in putative CMD but not in DOC patients. Together the findings suggest that indexing PPS allows differentiating between groups of patients whom both show overt motor impairments DOC and CMD but putatively distinct levels of awareness or motor intent.
