Genomic selection is revolutionizing plant breeding. However still lacking are better statistical models for ordinal phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the selection of candidate genotypes. For this reason in this paper we explore the genomic based prediction performance of two popular machine learning methods: the Multi Layer Perceptron MLP and support vector machine SVM methods vs. the Bayesian threshold genomic best linear unbiased prediction TGBLUP model. We used the percentage of cases correctly classified PCCC as a metric to measure the prediction performance and seven real data sets to evaluate the prediction accuracy and found that the best predictions in four out of the seven data sets in terms of PCCC occurred under the TGLBUP model while the worst occurred under the SVM method. Also in general we found no statistical differences between using 1 2 and 3 layers under the MLP models which means that many times the conventional neuronal network model with only one layer is enough. However although even that the TGBLUP model was better we found that the predictions of MLP and SVM were very competitive with the advantage that the SVM was the most efficient in terms of the computational time required.
