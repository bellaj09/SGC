Regaining the function of an impaired limb is highly desirable in paralyzed individuals. One possible avenue to achieve this goal is to bridge the interrupted pathway between preserved neural structures and muscles using a brain-computer interface. Here we demonstrate that monkeys with subcortical stroke were able to learn to use an artificial cortico-muscular connection ACMC which transforms cortical activity into electrical stimulation to the hand muscles to regain volitional control of a paralysed hand. The ACMC induced an adaptive change of cortical activities throughout an extensive cortical area. In a targeted manner modulating high-gamma activity became localized around an arbitrarily-selected cortical site controlling stimulation to the muscles. This adaptive change could be reset and localized rapidly to a new cortical site. Thus the\xa0ACMC imparts new function for muscle control to connected cortical sites and triggers cortical adaptation to regain impaired motor function after stroke. Bypassing stroke-damaged neural pathways via a neural interface induces targeted cortical adaptation.
