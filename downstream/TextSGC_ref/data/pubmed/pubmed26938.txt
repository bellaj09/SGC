The term "cyborg" refers to a cybernetic organism which characterizes the chimera of a living organism and a machine. Owing to the widespread application of intracorporeal medical devices cyborgs are no longer exclusively a subject of science fiction novels but technically they already exist in our society. In this review we briefly summarize the development of modern prosthetics and the evolution of brain-machine interfaces and discuss the latest technical developments of implantable devices in particular biocompatible integrated electronics and microfluidics used for communication and control of living organisms. Recent examples of animal cyborgs and their relevance to fundamental and applied biomedical research and bioethics in this novel and exciting field at the crossroads of chemistry biomedicine and the engineering sciences are presented. The chemistry of cyborgs--interfacing technical devices with organisms.
