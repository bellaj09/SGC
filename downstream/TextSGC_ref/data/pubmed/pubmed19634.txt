Peripersonal space PPS representation is modulated by information coming from the body. In paraplegic individuals whose lower limb sensory-motor functions are impaired or completely lost the representation of PPS around the feet is reduced. However passive motion can have short-term restorative effects. What remains unclear is the mechanisms underlying this recovery in particular with regard to the contribution of visual and motor feedback and of interoception. Using virtual reality technology we dissociated the motor and visual feedback during passive motion in paraplegics with complete and incomplete lesions and in healthy controls. The results show that in the case of paraplegics the presence of motor feedback was necessary for the recovery of PPS representation both when the motor feedback was congruent and when it was incongruent with the visual feedback. In contrast visuo-motor incongruence led to an inhibition of PPS representation in the control group. There were no differences in sympathetic responses between the three groups. Nevertheless in individuals with incomplete lesions greater interoceptive sensitivity was associated with a better representation of PPS around the feet in the visuo-motor incongruent conditions. These results shed new light on the modulation of PPS representation and demonstrate the importance of residual motor feedback and its integration with other bodily information in maintaining space representation.
