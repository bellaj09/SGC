The signals acquired in brain-computer interface BCI experiments usually involve several complicated sampling artifact and noise conditions. This mandated the use of several strategies as preprocessing to allow the extraction of meaningful components of the measured signals to be passed along to further processing steps. In spite of the success present preprocessing methods have to improve the reliability of BCI there is still room for further improvement to boost the performance even more.
