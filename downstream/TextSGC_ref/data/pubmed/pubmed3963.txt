"Relating the brains structural connectivity SC to its functional connectivity FC is a fundamental goal in neuroscience because it is capable of aiding our understanding of how the relatively fixed SC architecture underlies human cognition and diverse behaviors. With the aid of current noninvasive imaging technologies e.g. structural MRI diffusion MRI and functional MRI and graph theory methods researchers have modeled the human brain as a complex network of interacting neuronal elements and characterized the underlying structural and functional connectivity patterns that support diverse cognitive functions. Specifically research has demonstrated a tight SC-FC coupling not only in interregional connectivity strength but also in network topologic organizations such as community rich-club and motifs. Moreover this SC-FC coupling exhibits significant changes in normal development and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. This review summarizes recent progress regarding the SC-FC relationship of the human brain and emphasizes the important role of large-scale brain networks in the understanding of structural-functional associations. Future research directions related to this topic are also proposed." Understanding structural-functional relationships in the human brain: a large-scale network perspective.
