Morphological analysis is the starting point for the diagnostic approach of more than 80% of hematological diseases. However the morphological differentiation among different types of normal and abnormal peripheral blood cells is a difficult task that requires experience and skills. Therefore the paper proposes a system for the automatic classification of eight groups of peripheral blood cells with high accuracy by means of a transfer learning approach using convolutional neural networks. With this new approach it is not necessary to implement image segmentation the feature extraction becomes automatic and existing models can be fine-tuned to obtain specific classifiers. Recognition of peripheral blood cell images using convolutional neural networks.
