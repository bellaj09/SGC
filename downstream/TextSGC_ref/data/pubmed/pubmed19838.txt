Some aspects of assistive technology can be enhanced by the application of virtual reality. Although virtual simulation offers a range of new possibilities learning to navigate in a virtual environment is not equivalent to learning to navigate in the real world. Therefore virtual reality simulation is advocated as a useful preparation for assessment and training within the physical environment. We are engaged in several efforts to develop virtual environments and devices for mobility skills assessment and training exercise training and environment assessment. Virtual reality offers wheelchair users a training tool in different risk-free environments without any indoor e.g. walls furniture and stairs and outdoor e.g. curb cuts uneven terrain and street traffic physical constraints. Virtual reality technology will probably become more common in the field of assistive technology especially given the rapid expansion of gaming technology and the continued exponential growth of computing power.
