Predictive maintenance plays an important role in modern Cyber-Physical Systems CPSs and data-driven methods have been a worthwhile direction for Prognostics Health Management PHM. However two main challenges have significant influences on the traditional fault diagnostic models: one is that extracting hand-crafted features from multi-dimensional sensors with internal dependencies depends too much on expertise knowledge; the other is that imbalance pervasively exists among faulty and normal samples. As deep learning models have proved to be good methods for automatic feature extraction the objective of this paper is to study an optimized deep learning model for imbalanced fault diagnosis for CPSs. Thus this paper proposes a weighted Long Recurrent Convolutional LSTM model with sampling policy wLRCL-D to deal with these challenges. The model consists of 2-layer CNNs 2-layer inner LSTMs and 2-Layer outer LSTMs with under-sampling policy and weighted cost-sensitive loss function. Experiments are conducted on PHM 2015 challenge datasets and the results show that wLRCL-D outperforms other baseline methods.
