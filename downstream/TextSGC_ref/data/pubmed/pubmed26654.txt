Motor imagery MI with real-time neurofeedback could be a viable approach e.g. in rehabilitation of cerebral stroke. Magnetoencephalography MEG noninvasively measures electric brain activity at high temporal resolution and is well-suited for recording oscillatory brain signals. MI is known to modulate 10- and 20-Hz oscillations in the somatomotor system. In order to provide accurate feedback to the subject the most relevant MI-related features should be extracted from MEG data. In this study we evaluated several MEG signal features for discriminating between left- and right-hand MI and between MI and rest. Comparing Features for Classification of MEG Responses to Motor Imagery.
