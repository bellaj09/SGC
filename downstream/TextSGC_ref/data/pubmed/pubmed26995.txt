Multi-gene prognostic signatures derived from primary tumor biopsies can guide clinicians in designing an appropriate course of treatment. Identifying genes and pathways most essential to a signature performance may facilitate clinical application provide insights into cancer progression and uncover potentially new therapeutic targets. We previously developed a 17-gene prognostic signature HTICS for HER2+:ER- breast cancer patients using genes that are differentially expressed in tumor initiating cells TICs versus non-TICs from MMTV-Her2/neu mammary tumors. Here we probed the pathways and genes that underlie the prognostic power of HTICS. Identification of cell proliferation immune response and cell migration as critical pathways in a prognostic signature for HER2+:ER- breast cancer.
