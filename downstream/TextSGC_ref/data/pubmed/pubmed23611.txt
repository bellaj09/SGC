"Three-dimensional 3D ultrasound volume acquisition analysis and display of fetal structures have enhanced their visualization and greatly improved the general understanding of their anatomy and pathology. The dynamic display of volume data generally depends on proprietary software usually supplied with the ultrasound system and on the operators ability to maneuver the dataset digitally. We have used relatively simple tools and an established storage display and manipulation format to generate non-linear virtual reality object movies of prenatal images including moving sequences and 3D-rendered views that can be navigated easily and interactively on any current computer. This approach permits a viewing or learning experience that is superior to watching a linear movie passively." Simple virtual reality display of fetal volume ultrasound.
