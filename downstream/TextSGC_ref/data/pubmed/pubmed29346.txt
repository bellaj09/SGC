"Research on the neurophysiological correlates of visuomotor integration and learning VMIL has largely focused on identifying learning-induced activity changes in cortical areas during motor execution. While such studies have generated valuable insights into the neural basis of VMIL little is known about the processes that represent the current state of VMIL independently of motor execution. Here we present empirical evidence that a subjects performance in a 3D reaching task can be predicted on a trial-to-trial basis from pre-trial electroencephalographic EEG data. This evidence provides novel insights into the brain states that support successful VMIL." Predicting motor learning performance from Electroencephalographic data.
