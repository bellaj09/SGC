Applying deep learning methods to electroencephalograph EEG data for cognitive state assessment has yielded improvements over previous modeling methods. However research focused on cross-participant cognitive workload modeling using these techniques is underrepresented. We study the problem of cross-participant state estimation in a non-stimulus-locked task environment where a trained model is used to make workload estimates on a new participant who is not represented in the training set. Using experimental data from the Multi-Attribute Task Battery MATB environment a variety of deep neural network models are evaluated in the trade-space of computational efficiency model accuracy variance and temporal specificity yielding three important contributions: 1 The performance of ensembles of individually-trained models is statistically indistinguishable from group-trained methods at most sequence lengths. These ensembles can be trained for a fraction of the computational cost compared to group-trained methods and enable simpler model updates. 2 While increasing temporal sequence length improves mean accuracy it is not sufficient to overcome distributional dissimilarities between individuals&rsquo; EEG data as it results in statistically significant increases in cross-participant variance. 3 Compared to all other networks evaluated a novel convolutional-recurrent model using multi-path subnetworks and bi-directional residual recurrent layers resulted in statistically significant increases in predictive accuracy and decreases in cross-participant variance.
