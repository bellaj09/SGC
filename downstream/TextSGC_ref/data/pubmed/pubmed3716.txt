As a substrate for function large-scale brain structural networks are crucial for fundamental and systems-level understanding of primate brains. However it is challenging to acquire a complete primate whole-brain structural connectome using track tracing techniques. Here we acquired a weighted brain structural network across 91 cortical regions of a whole macaque brain hemisphere with a connectivity density of 59% by predicting missing links from the CoCoMac-based binary network with a low density of 26.3%. The prediction model combines three factors including spatial proximity topological similarity and cytoarchitectural similarity-to predict missing links and assign connection weights. The model was tested on a recently obtained high connectivity density yet partial-coverage experimental weighted network connecting 91 sources to 29 target regions; the model showed a prediction sensitivity of 74.1% in the predicted network. This predicted macaque hemisphere-wide weighted network has module segregation closely matching functional domains. Interestingly the areas that act as integrators linking the segregated modules are mainly distributed in the frontoparietal network and correspond to the regions with large wiring costs in the predicted weighted network. This predicted weighted network provides a high-density structural dataset for further exploration of relationships between structure function and metabolism in the primate brain.
