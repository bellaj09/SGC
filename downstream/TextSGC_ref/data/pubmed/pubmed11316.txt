Spatial resolution is a critical imaging parameter in magnetic resonance imaging. The image super-resolution SR is an effective and cost efficient alternative technique to improve the spatial resolution of MR images. Over the past several years the convolutional neural networks CNN-based SR methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However CNNs with very deep network structures usually suffer from the problems of degradation and diminishing feature reuse which add difficulty to network training and degenerate the transmission capability of details for SR. To address these problems in this work a progressive wide residual network with a fixed skip connection named FSCWRN based SR algorithm is proposed to reconstruct MR images which combines the global residual learning and the shallow network based local residual learning. The strategy of progressive wide networks is adopted to replace deeper networks which can partially relax the above-mentioned problems while a fixed skip connection helps provide rich local details at high frequencies from a fixed shallow layer network to subsequent networks. The experimental results on one simulated MR image database and three real MR image databases show the effectiveness of the proposed FSCWRN SR algorithm which achieves improved reconstruction performance compared with other algorithms.
