"In this paper we demonstrate that healthy adults respond differentially to the administration of force feedback and the presentation of scientific content in a virtual environment where they interact with a low-cost haptic device. Subjects are tasked with controlling the movement of a cursor on a predefined trajectory that is superimposed on a map of New York Citys Bronx Zoo. The system is characterized in terms of a suite of objective indices quantifying the subjects dexterity in planning and generating the multijoint visuomotor tasks. We find that force feedback regulates the smoothness accuracy and duration of the subjects movement whereby converging or diverging force fields influence the range of variations of the hand speed. Finally our findings provide preliminary evidence that using educational content increases subjects satisfaction. Improving the level of interest through the inclusion of learning elements can increase the time spent performing rehabilitation tasks and promote learning in a new context." Can force feedback and science learning enhance the effectiveness of neuro-rehabilitation? An experimental study on using a low-cost 3D joystick and a virtual visit to a zoo.
