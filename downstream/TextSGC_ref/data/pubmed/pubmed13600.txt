To investigate the performance of deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs for glaucoma discrimination using color fundus images STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate the discriminative ability of 3 DCNNs we used a total of 3312 images consisting of 369 images from glaucoma-confirmed eyes 256 images from glaucoma-suspected eyes diagnosed by a glaucoma expert and 2687 images judged to be nonglaucomatous eyes by a glaucoma expert. We also investigated the effects of image size on the discriminative ability and heatmap analysis to determine which parts of the image contribute to the discrimination. Additionally we used 465 poor-quality images to investigate the effect of poor image quality on the discriminative ability. Evaluation of deep convolutional neural networks for glaucoma detection.
