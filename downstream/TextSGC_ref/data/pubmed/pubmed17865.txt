"The sense of how we experience our physical body as our own represents a fundamental component of human self-awareness. Body ownership can be studied with bodily illusions which are generated by inducing a visuo-tactile conflict where individuals experience illusionary ownership over a fake body or body part such as a rubber hand. Previous studies showed that different types of touch modulate the strength of experienced ownership over a rubber hand. Specifically participants experienced more ownership after the rubber hand illusion was induced through affective touch vs non-affective touch. It is however unclear whether this effect would also occur for an entire fake body. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether affective touch modulates the strength of ownership in a virtual reality full body illusion. To elicit this illusion we used slow 3\xa0cm/s; affective touch and fast 30\xa0cm/s; non-affective touch stroking velocities on the participants abdomen. Both stroking velocities were performed either synchronous or asynchronous control condition while participants viewed a virtual body from a first-person-perspective. In our first study we found that participants experienced more subjective ownership over a virtual body in the affective touch condition compared to the non-affective touch condition. In our second study we found higher levels of subjective ownership for synchronous stimulation compared to asynchronous for both touch conditions but failed to replicate the findings from study 1 that show a difference between affective and non-affective touch. We therefore cannot conclude unequivocally that affective touch enhances the full-body illusion. Future research is required to study the effects of affective touch on body ownership." Does affective touch influence the virtual reality full body illusion?
