"A brain-computer interface BCI is a system that allows communication between the central nervous system and an external device. The BCIs developed by various research groups differ in their main features and the comparison across studies is therefore challenging. Here in the same group of 19 healthy participants we investigate three different tasks SSVEP P300 and hybrid that allowed four choices to the user without previous neurofeedback training. We used the same 64-channel EEG equipment to acquire data while participants performed each of the tasks. We systematically compared the participants offline performance on the following parameters: 1 accuracy; 2 BCI Utility in bits/min; and 3 inefficiency/illiteracy. In addition we evaluated the accuracy as a function of the number of electrodes. In this paper the SSVEP task outperformed the other tasks in bit rate reaching an average and maximum BCI Utility of 63.4 and 91.3 bits/min respectively. All participants achieved an accuracy level above70% on both SSVEP and P300 tasks. Furthermore the average accuracy of all tasks was highest if a reduced subset with 4-12 electrodes was used. These results are relevant for the development of online BCIs intended for the real-life applications."
