"BACKGROUNDVestibular dysfunctions result in a wide range of impairments and can have debilitating consequences on a persons day-to-day activities. Conventional vestibular rehabilitation is effective but suffers from poor therapy compliance due to boredom. Virtual reality technology can make training more engaging and allow precise quantification of the training process. However most existing technologies for vestibular rehabilitation are expensive and not suitable for use in patients homes and most clinics. In this pilot study we developed and evaluated the usability of a smartphone-based head-mounted display HMD for vestibular rehabilitation and quantified the simulator sickness induced by the system.METHODSTwo adaptive training games were developed to train discrete and rhythmic head movements in the pitch and yaw planes. The usability and simulator sickness associated with the system were evaluated in a single testing session on healthy subjects and patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction. Additionally the head movement kinematics measured during training was also analyzed using different movement quality measures.RESULTSA total of 15 healthy subjects and 15 patients underwent testing with the system. Both groups found the system to be highly usable >80 score on the system usability scale. Following 20-30\u200amin training with the system healthy subjects reported minimal simulator sickness symptoms. On the other hand patients reported a higher incidence rate for symptoms which could have been the result of their vestibular condition.CONCLUSIONThe current study demonstrated the usability and safety of a smartphone-based system for vestibular rehabilitation. The system is compact and affordable thus has the potential to become an excellent tool for home-based vestibular rehabilitation."
