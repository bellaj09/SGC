"Brain machine interfaces BMIs have attracted intense attention as a promising technology for directly interfacing computers or prostheses with the brains motor and sensory areas thereby bypassing the body. The availability of multiscale neural recordings including spike trains and local field potentials LFPs brings potential opportunities to enhance computational modeling by enriching the characterization of the neural system state. However heterogeneity on data type spike timing versus continuous amplitude signals and spatiotemporal scale complicates the model integration of multiscale neural activity. In this paper we propose a tensor-product-kernel-based framework to integrate the multiscale activity and exploit the complementary information available in multiscale neural activity. This provides a common mathematical framework for incorporating signals from different domains. The approach is applied to the problem of neural decoding and control. For neural decoding the framework is able to identify the nonlinear functional relationship between the multiscale neural responses and the stimuli using general purpose kernel adaptive filtering. In a sensory stimulation experiment the tensor-product-kernel decoder outperforms decoders that use only a single neural data type. In addition an adaptive inverse controller for delivering electrical microstimulation patterns that utilizes the tensor-product kernel achieves promising results in emulating the responses to natural stimulation."
