"Explicit motor imagery eMI is a widely used brain-computer interface BCI paradigm but not everybody can accomplish this task. Here we propose a BCI based on implicit motor imagery iMI. We compared classification accuracy between eMI and iMI of hands. Fifteen able-bodied people were asked to judge the laterality of hand images presented on a computer screen in a lateral or medial orientation. This judgment task is known to require mental rotation of a persons own hands which in turn is thought to involve iMI. The subjects were also asked to perform eMI of the hands. Their electroencephalography was recorded. Linear classifiers were designed based on common spatial patterns. For discrimination between left hand and right hand the classifier achieved maximum of 81  8% accuracy for eMI and 83  3% for iMI. These results show that iMI can be used to achieve similar classification accuracy as eMI. Additional classification was performed between iMI in medial and lateral orientations of a single hand; the classifier achieved 81  7% for the left hand and 78  7% for the right hand which indicate distinctive spatial patterns of cortical activity for iMI of a single hand in different directions. These results suggest that a special BCI based on iMI may be constructed for people who cannot perform explicit imagination for rehabilitation of movement or for treatment of bodily spatial neglect."
