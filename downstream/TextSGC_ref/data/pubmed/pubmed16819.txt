In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics developing new non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures. However for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound cleaning clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of virtual reality are needed to further amplify the potency of virtual reality analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality VR via "hands free" eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR no eye-tracking for reducing pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.
