In this work we used multimodal non-invasive brain signal recording systems namely Near Infrared Spectroscopy NIRS disc electrode electroencephalography EEG and tripolar concentric ring electrodes TCRE electroencephalography tEEG. 7 healthy subjects participated in our experiments to control a 2-D Brain Computer Interface BCI. Four motor imagery task were performed imagery motion of the left hand the right hand both hands and both feet. The signal slope SS of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration measured by NIRS was used for feature extraction while the power spectrum density PSD of both EEG and tEEG in the frequency band 8-30Hz was used for feature extraction. Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA was used to classify different combinations of the aforementioned features. The highest classification accuracy 85.2% was achieved by using features from all the three brain signals recording modules. The improvement in classification accuracy was highly significant p = 0.0033 when using the multimodal signals features as compared to pure EEG features. Multimodal 2D Brain Computer Interface.
