Purpose To evaluate the performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network CNN model compared with a traditional natural language processing NLP model in extracting pulmonary embolism PE findings from thoracic computed tomography CT reports from two institutions. Materials and Methods Contrast material-enhanced CT examinations of the chest performed between January 1 1998 and January 1 2016 were selected. Annotations by two human radiologists were made for three categories: the presence chronicity and location of PE. Classification of performance of a CNN model with an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations of words was compared with the open-source application PeFinder. Sensitivity specificity accuracy and F1 scores for both the CNN model and PeFinder in the internal and external validation sets were determined. Results The CNN model demonstrated an accuracy of 99% and an area under the curve value of 0.97. For internal validation report data the CNN model had a statistically significant larger F1 score 0.938 than did PeFinder 0.867 when classifying findings as either PE positive or PE negative but no significant difference in sensitivity specificity or accuracy was found. For external validation report data no statistical difference between the performance of the CNN model and PeFinder was found. Conclusion A deep learning CNN model can classify radiology free-text reports with accuracy equivalent to or beyond that of an existing traditional NLP model.
