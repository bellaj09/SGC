Traditional cue reactivity provides a methodology for examining drug triggers and stimuli in laboratory and clinical settings. However current techniques lack standardization and generalization across research settings. Improved methodologies using virtual reality VR cue reactivity extend previous research standardizing exposure to stimuli and exploring reactions to drug cues in a controlled VR setting. In a controlled pilot trial 13 nicotine-dependent participants were allowed to smoke ad libitum then exposed to VR smoking and VR neutral cues and compared on craving intensity. VR smoking cues significantly increased craving compared to VR neutral cues. On average craving intensity increased 118% during exposure to VR smoking cues. Implications for substance abuse research and treatment using VR to assess cessation and anticraving medications are discussed. Utilizing virtual reality to standardize nicotine craving research: a pilot study.
