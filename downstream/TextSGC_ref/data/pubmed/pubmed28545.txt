Artificial brain-machine interfaces BMIs represent a prospective step forward supporting or replacing faulty brain functions. So far several obstacles such as the energy supply the portability and the biocompatibility have been limiting their effective translation in advanced experimental or clinical applications. In this work a novel 16 channel chronically implantable epicortical grid has been proposed. It provides wireless transmission of cortical recordings and stimulations with induction current recharge. The grid has been chronically implanted in a non-human primate Macaca fascicularis and placed over the somato-motor cortex such that 13 electrodes recorded or stimulated the primary motor cortex and three the primary somatosensory cortex in the deeply anaesthetized animal. Cortical sensory and motor recordings and stimulations have been performed within 3 months from the implant. In detail by delivering motor cortex epicortical single spot stimulations 1-8 V 1-10 Hz 500 ms biphasic waves we analyzed the motor topographic precision evidenced by tunable finger or arm movements of the anesthetized animal. The responses to light mechanical peripheral sensory stimuli blocks of 100 stimuli each single stimulus being <1 ms and interblock intervals of 1.5-4 s have been analyzed. We found 150-250 ms delayed cortical responses from fast finger touches often spread to nearby motor stations. We also evaluated the grid electrical stimulus interference with somatotopic natural tactile sensory processing showing no suppressing interference with sensory stimulus detection. In conclusion we propose a chronically implantable epicortical grid which can accommodate most of current technological restrictions representing an acceptable candidate for BMI experimental and clinical uses. A novel wireless recording and stimulating multichannel epicortical grid for supplementing or enhancing the sensory-motor functions in monkey Macaca fascicularis.
