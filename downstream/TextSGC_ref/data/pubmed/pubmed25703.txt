We examined the feasibility and acceptability of using an immersive virtual reality environment VRE alongside cognitive behaviour therapy CBT for young people with autism experiencing specific phobia. Thirty-two participants were randomised to treatment or control. Treatment involved one session introducing CBT techniques and four VRE sessions delivered by local clinical therapists. Change in target behaviour was independently rated. Two weeks after treatment four treatment participants 25% and no control participants were responders; at 6\xa0months after treatment six 38% treatment and no control participants were responders. At 6\xa0months post-treatment symptoms had worsened for one treatment and five control untreated participants. Brief VRE exposure with CBT is feasible and acceptable to deliver through child clinical services and is effective for some participants.
