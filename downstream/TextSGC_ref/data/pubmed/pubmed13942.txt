"Interpretation of the electroencephalographic EEG and magnetoencephalographic MEG signals requires off-line artifacts removal. Since artifacts share frequencies with brain activity filtering is insufficient. Blind source separation mainly through independent component analysis ICA is the gold-standard procedure for the identification of artifacts in multi-dimensional recordings. However a classification of brain and artifactual independent components ICs is still required. Since ICs exhibit recognizable patterns classification is usually performed by experts visual inspection. This procedure is time consuming and prone to errors. Automatic ICs classification has been explored often through complex ICs features extraction prior to classification. Relying on deep-learning ability of self-extracting the features of interest we investigated the capabilities of convolutional neural networks CNNs for off-line automatic artifact identification through ICs without feature selection."
