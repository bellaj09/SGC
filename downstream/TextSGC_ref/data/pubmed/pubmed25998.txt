Flexible sigmoidoscopy a core skill for the primary care physician requires learned hand-eye skills that can be difficult to master during residency training. With recent advances in virtual reality simulation technology simulated flexible sigmoidoscopes are available to family medicine residents for training before their initial and subsequent live patient examinations. The purpose of the study was to determine whether a virtual reality flexible sigmoidoscope simulator would improve the hand-eye skills and various performance parameters in a live patient. Virtual reality flexible sigmoidoscopy simulator training: impact on resident performance.
