Self-regulated learning is optimized when instructional supports are provided. We evaluated three supports for self-regulated simulation-based training: practice schedules normative comparisons and learning goals. Participants practiced 5 endoscopy tasks on a physical simulator then completed 4 repetitions on a virtual reality simulator. Study A compared two practice schedules: sequential master each task in assigned order versus unstructured trainee-defined. Study B compared normative comparisons framed as success 10% of trainees were successful versus failure 90% of trainees were unsuccessful. Study C compared a time-only goal go 1\xa0min faster versus time\u2009+\u2009quality goal go 1\xa0min faster with better visualization and scope manipulation. Participants 18 surgery interns 17 research fellows 5 medical/college students were randomly assigned to groups. In Study A the sequential group had higher task completion 10/19 vs. 1/21; P\u2009<\u2009.001 longer persistence attempting an ultimately incomplete task 20.0 vs. 15.9\xa0min; P\u2009=\u2009.03 and higher efficiency 43% vs. 27%; P\u2009=\u2009.02 but task time was similar between groups 20.0 vs. 22.6\xa0min; P\u2009=\u2009.23. In Study B the success orientation group had higher task completion 10/16 vs. 1/24; P\u2009<\u2009.001 and longer persistence 21.2 vs. 14.6\xa0min; P\u2009=\u2009.001 but efficiency was similar 33% vs. 35%; P\u2009=\u2009.84. In Study C the time-only group had greater efficiency than time\u2009+\u2009quality 56% vs. 41%; P\u2009=\u2009.03 but task time did not differ significantly 172 vs. 208\xa0s; P\u2009=\u2009.07. In this complex motor task a sequential vs. unstructured schedule success vs. failure orientation and time-only vs. time\u2009+\u2009quality goal improved some but not all performance outcomes.
