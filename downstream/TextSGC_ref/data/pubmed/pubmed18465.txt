"Purpose This study aimed to investigate whether a virtual reality VR intervention has an influence in improving the motor function and activities of daily living ADLs in patients with lesions in different regions of the brain. Subjects and Methods Eleven subjects with hemiplegic stroke were recruited in this study which was conducted from January to February 2017. They received a VR intervention once a day for 30\u2005min 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment FMA and the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index K-MBI were used to assess the post-stroke patients motor function and ADLs respectively. Results There were significant differences in pre- and post-test outcomes of the Arm and Coordination and Speed CS in the FMA and K-MBI in the middle cerebral artery group MCAG. Moreover there were significant differences in all sub-tests of FMA and K-MBI in the Basal ganglia group BGG. In addition there were significant differences in the pre-test outcomes of Arm and pre- and post-test outcomes of Hand in the FMA between the two groups. Conclusion This study revealed that VR intervention improved the upper limb motor function and ADLs of post-stroke patients especially those in the BGG." Effects of virtual reality intervention on upper limb motor function and activity of daily living in patients with lesions in different regions of the brain.
