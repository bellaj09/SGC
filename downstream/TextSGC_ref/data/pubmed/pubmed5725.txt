The uncontrollable growth of cells in the breast tissue causes breast cancer which is the second most common type of cancer affecting women in the United States. Normally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 proteins are responsible for the division and growth of healthy breast cells. HER2 status is currently assessed using immunohistochemistry IHC as well as in situ hybridization ISH in equivocal cases. Manual HER2 evaluation of IHC stained microscopic images involves an error-prone tedious inter-observer variable and time-consuming routine lab work due to diverse staining overlapped regions and non-homogeneous remarkable large slides. To address these issues digital pathology offers reproducible automatic and objective analysis and interpretation of whole slide image WSI. In this paper we present a machine learning ML framework to segment classify and quantify IHC breast cancer images in an effective way. The proposed method consists of two major classifying and segmentation parts. Since HER2 is associated with tumors of an epithelial region and most of the breast tumors originate in epithelial tissue it is crucial to develop an approach to segment different tissue structures. The proposed technique is comprised of three steps. In the first step a superpixel-based support vector machine SVM feature learning classifier is proposed to classify epithelial and stromal regions from WSI. In the second stage on classified epithelial regions a convolutional neural network CNN based segmentation method is applied to segment membrane regions. Finally divided tiles are merged and the overall score of each slide is evaluated. Experimental results for 127 slides are presented and compared with state-of-the-art handcraft and deep learning-based approaches. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieved promising performance on IHC stained data. The presented automated algorithm was shown to outperform other approaches in terms of superpixel based classifying of epithelial regions and segmentation of membrane staining using CNN.
