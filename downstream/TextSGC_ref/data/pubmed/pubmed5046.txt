The use of Multivariate Granger Causality MVGC in estimating directed Blood-Oxygen-Level- Dependant BOLD connectivity is still controversial. This is mostly due to the short data Ienghts typically available in func- tional MRI fMRI acquisitions to the very nature of the BOLD acquisition strategy which yields extremely low signal- to-noise-ratio and importantly to the fact that neuronal activi- ty is convolved with a slow-varying haemodynamic response function HRF which therefore generates a temporal confound which is arduous to account for when basing MVGC estimates on vector autoregressive models VAR. In this paper we em- ploy realistic complex network models based on Izhikevich neuronal populations interlinked by realistic neuronal fiber bundles which exert compounded directed influences and cas- cade into Baloon-model-like neurovascular coupling to explore and validate the MVGC approach to directed connectivity es- timation in realistic fMRI conditions and in a complex directed network setting. In particular we show in silico that the top 1 percentile of a BOLD connectivity matrix estimated with MVGC from BOLD data similar to the one provided by the Human Connectome Project HCP has a Positive Predictive Value very close to 1 hence corroborating the evidence that the "strongest" connections can be safely studied with this method in fMRI. A realistic neuronal network and neurovascular coupling model for the study of multivariate directed connectivity in fMRI data.
