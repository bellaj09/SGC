"Freezing of gait and falls represent a major burden in patients with advanced forms of Parkinsons disease PD. These axial motor signs are not fully alleviated by drug treatment or deep-brain stimulation. Recently virtual reality has emerged as a rehabilitation option for these patients. In this pilot study we aim to determine the feasibility and acceptability of rehabilitation with a customised videogame to treat gait and balance disorders in PD patients and assess its effects on these disabling motor signs."
