Adverse events caused by drug-drug interaction DDI not only pose a serious threat to health but also increase additional medical care expenditure. However despite the emergence of many excellent text mining-based DDI classification methods achieving a balance between using simpler method and better model performance is still unsatisfactory. In this article we present a deep learning method of stacked bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit GRU- convolutional neural network SGRU-CNN model which apply stacked bidirectional GRU BiGRU network and convolutional neural network CNN on lexical information and entity position information respectively to conduct DDIs extraction task. Furthermore SGRU-CNN model assigns the weights of each word feature to improve performance with one attentive pooling layer. On the condition that other values are not inferior to other algorithms experimental results on the DDI Extraction 2013 corpus show that our model achieves a 1.54% improvement in recall value. And the proposed SGRU-CNN model reaches great performance F1-score: 0.75 with the fewest features indicating an excellent balance between avoiding redundant preprocessing task and higher accuracy in relation extraction on biomedical literature using our method.
