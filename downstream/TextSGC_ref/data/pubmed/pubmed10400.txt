The surge in the interest in personalized medicine necessitates a corresponding rational approach for implementing such individualized therapies. Dynamiceuticals represents a natural extension of the Pharmaceutical and Electroceutical fields where the precise determination of the dynamical regimes of the pathophysiology will guide to devise therapies that ameliorate the pathology in a well-controlled manner thus being precisely tailored toward the implementation of individualized medicine. This approach foretells to lessen side-effects and achieve superior efficacy as compared with current trial-and-error or open-loop strategies. But does the current state of knowledge and technology allow this scheme to offer what it claims? Dynamiceuticals: The Next Stage in Personalized Medicine.
