Diffusion weighted imaging DWI is widely used to study microstructural characteristics of the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging DTI and high-angular resolution imaging HARDI are frequently used in radiology and neuroscience research but can be limited in describing the signal behavior in composite nerve fiber structures. Here we developed and assessed the benefit of a comprehensive diffusion encoding scheme known as hybrid diffusion imaging HYDI composed of 300 DWI volumes acquired at 7-Tesla with diffusion weightings at b = 1000 3000 4000 8000 and 12000 s/mm2 and applied it in transgenic Alzheimer rats line TgF344-AD that model the full clinico-pathological spectrum of the human disease. We studied and visualized the effects of the multiple concentric "shells" when computing three distinct anisotropy maps-fractional anisotropy FA generalized fractional anisotropy GFA and normalized quantitative anisotropy NQA. We tested the added value of the multi-shell q-space sampling scheme when reconstructing neural pathways using mathematical frameworks from DTI and q-ball imaging QBI. We show a range of properties of HYDI including lower apparent anisotropy when using high b-value shells in DTI-based reconstructions and increases in apparent anisotropy in QBI-based reconstructions. Regardless of the reconstruction scheme HYDI improves FA- GFA- and NQA-aided tractography. HYDI may be valuable in human connectome projects and clinical research as well as magnetic resonance research in experimental animals.
