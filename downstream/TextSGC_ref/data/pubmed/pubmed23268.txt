Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS has broad prospects in both clinical application and brain-computer interface. To improve the spatial resolution modified Beer-Lambert law with weighted partial optical path length wMBLL is proposed for multi-distance probe configuration. Taking both surface tissue layers and deep tissue layers into consideration the partial optical path length is estimated as a function of the distance between source and detector. Besides a multi-distance 15mm and 30mm probe configuration is designed which approximates a rectangle. Constructed with 9 sources and 14 detectors 40 channels are produced including 20 short short-separation channel and 20 long-separation channel. Also experiment is implemented with left hand grip-stretch movement and involves five healthy subjects. The concentration of HbO is used to image the brain activation map. Results demonstrate that compared with the conventional method the proposed wMBLL method is effective to detect brain activity with higher spatial resolution.
