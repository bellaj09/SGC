"Virtual reality force feedback simulators provide a haptic sense of touch feedback through the device being held by the user. The simulators goal is to provide a learning experience resembling reality. A newly developed haptic simulator IDEA Dental Las Vegas NV USA was assessed in this study. Our objectives were to assess the simulators ability to serve as a tool for dental instruction self-practice and student evaluation as well as to evaluate the sensation it provides. A total of thirty-three evaluators were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of twenty-one experienced dental educators; the second consisted of twelve fifth-year dental students. Each participant performed drilling tasks using the simulator and filled out a questionnaire regarding the simulator and potential ways of using it in dental education. The results show that experienced dental faculty members as well as advanced dental students found that the simulator could provide significant potential benefits in the teaching and self-learning of manual dental skills. Development of the simulators tactile sensation is needed to attune it to genuine sensation. Further studies relating to aspects of the simulators structure and its predictive validity its scoring system and the nature of the performed tasks should be conducted."
