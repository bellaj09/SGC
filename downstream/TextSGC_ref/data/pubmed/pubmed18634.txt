In recent years development of computer graphics and haptic feedback technology enabled the use of virtual reality. Virtual reality provides the opportunity to combine 3D visual imagery with interactivity visual and tactile realism. Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery is defined as the use of computers and robotic technology to assist the orthopedist in providing musculoskeletal care in which machine has the capability of precision and accuracy. Robotic-assisted orthopedic surgery is used in simulating diagnosis preoperative and intraoperative planning and actual surgery. One of the main areas for computer-assisted surgical applications is unicompartmental or bicompartmental knee arthroplasty in which the clinical efficacy is improved by providing enhanced component positioning with dynamic ligament balancing.
