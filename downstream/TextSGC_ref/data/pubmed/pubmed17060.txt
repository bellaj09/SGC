"The use of simulation in the undergraduate nursing curriculum is gaining popularity and is becoming a foundation of many nursing programs. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a new simulation teaching strategy virtual reality VR simulation which capitalizes on the technological skills of the new generation student. This small-scale pilot study focused on improving interpersonal skills in senior level nursing students using VR simulation. In this study a repeated-measure design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of VR simulation on improving students performance over a series of two VR scenarios. Using the Emergency Medicine Crisis Resource Management EMCRM tool student performance was evaluated. Overall the total EMCRM score improved but not significantly. The subscale areas of communication P = .047\u200995%\u2009CI: - 1.06 -.007 and professional behavior P = .003\u200995%\u2009CI: - 1.12 -.303 did show a significant improvement between the two scenario exposures. Findings from this study show the potential for virtual reality simulations to have an impact on nursing student performance." Innovative simulation strategies in education.
