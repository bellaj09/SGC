Virtual Reality VR is a new technology that makes humans communicate with computer. It allows the user to see hear feel and interact in a three-dimensional virtual world created graphically. Virtual Reality Therapy VRT based on this sophisticated technology has been recently used in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with acrophobia a disorder that is characterized by marked anxiety upon exposure to heights avoidance of heights and a resulting interference in functioning. Conventional virtual reality system for the treatment of acrophobia has a limitation in scope that it is based on over-costly devices or somewhat unrealistic graphic scene. The goal of this study was to develop a inexpensive and more realistic virtual environment for the exposure therapy of acrophobia. We constructed two types virtual environment. One is constituted a bungee-jump tower in the middle of a city. It includes the open lift surrounded by props beside tower that allowed the patient to feel sense of heights. Another is composed of diving boards which have various heights. It provides a view of a lower diving board and people swimming in the pool to serve the patient stimuli upon exposure to heights. Development of virtual environment for treating acrophobia.
