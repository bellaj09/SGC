In this paper we propose the first sketching system for interactively personalized and photorealistic face caricaturing. Input an image of a human face the users can create caricature photos by manipulating its facial feature curves. Our system firstly performs exaggeration on the recovered 3D face model which is conducted by assigning the laplacian of each vertex a scaling factor according to the edited sketches. The mapping between 2D sketches and the vertex-wise scaling field is constructed by a novel deep learning architecture. Our approach allows outputting different exaggerations when applying the same sketching on different input figures in term of their different geometric characteristics which makes the generated results "personalized". With the obtained 3D caricature model two images are generated one obtained by applying 2D warping guided by the underlying 3D mesh deformation and the other obtained by re-rendering the deformed 3D textured model. These two images are then seamlessly integrated to produce our final output. Due to the severe stretching of meshes the rendered texture is of blurry appearances. A deep learning approach is exploited to infer the missing details for enhancing these blurry regions. Moreover a relighting operation is invented to further improve the photorealism of the result. These further make our results "photorealistic". The qualitative experiment results validated the efficiency of our sketching system.
