This paper describes a new virtual reality VR locomotion input device the Pressure Mat which allows a simulator user to navigate/traverse a virtual environment VE using similar motions as in the real world; i.e. walk run crawl. The device consists of an array of pressure sensitive resistors covered by a thin flexible mat. The resistor array is connected to a personal computer PC that uses a real-time pattern recognition algorithm to determine if the user is standing still or walking forward backward left or right. The information from the Pressure Mat was used to allow users to navigate in a VE. The Pressure Mat may also be useful in the diagnosis of a variety of conditions and/or in rehabilitative therapy. Navigation by walking around: using the Pressure Mat to move in virtual worlds.
