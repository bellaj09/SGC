"Parental responses to their children are crucially influenced by stress. However brain-based mechanistic understanding of the adverse effects of parenting stress and benefits of therapeutic interventions is lacking. We studied maternal brain responses to salient child signals as a function of Mom Power MP an attachment-based parenting intervention established to decrease maternal distress. Twenty-nine mothers underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans during a baby-cry task designed to solicit maternal responses to childs or selfs distress signals. Between scans mothers were pseudorandomly assigned to either MP n = 14 or control n = 15 with groups balanced for depression. Compared to control MP decreased parenting stress and increased child-focused responses in social brain areas highlighted by the precuneus and its functional connectivity with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex which are key components of reflective self-awareness and decision-making neurocircuitry. Furthermore over 13 weeks reduction in parenting stress was related to increasing child- versus self-focused baby-cry responses in amygdala-temporal pole functional connectivity which may mediate maternal ability to take her childs perspective. Although replication in larger samples is needed the results of this first parental-brain intervention study demonstrate robust stress-related brain circuits for maternal care that can be modulated by psychotherapy."
