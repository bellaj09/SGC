"It is often assumed that humans generate a 3D reconstruction of the environment either in egocentric or world-based coordinates but the steps involved are unknown. Here we propose two reconstruction-based models evaluated using data from two tasks in immersive virtual reality. We model the observers prediction of landmark location based on standard photogrammetric methods and then combine location predictions to compute likelihood maps of navigation behaviour. In one model each scene point is treated independently in the reconstruction; in the other the pertinent variable is the spatial relationship between pairs of points. Participants viewed a simple environment from one location were transported virtually to another part of the scene and were asked to navigate back. Error distributions varied substantially with changes in scene layout; we compared these directly with the likelihood maps to quantify the success of the models. We also measured error distributions when participants manipulated the location of a landmark to match the preceding interval providing a direct test of the landmark-location stage of the navigation models. Models such as this which start with scenes and end with a probabilistic prediction of behaviour are likely to be increasingly useful for understanding 3D vision."
