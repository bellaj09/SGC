Defining the influence of parameters of visual disorders on ability of balancing turns out to be an important process in effective diagnostics. Current diagnostic methods relating mainly to determination of the coefficient of BRUTM Balance Rehabilitation Unit Trade Mark depend on lots of tests carried out in a disturbed environment created by Virtual Reality Technology. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the frequency of visual disturbances on stabilographic values in the virtual reality environment. The influence of frequency of visual disorders on stabilographic parameters.
