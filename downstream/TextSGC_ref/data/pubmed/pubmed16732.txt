After traumatic brain injury TBI motor impairment is less common than neurocognitive or behavioral problems. However about 30% of TBI survivors have reported motor deficits limiting the activities of daily living or participation. After acute primary and secondary injuries there are subsequent changes including increased GABA-mediated inhibition during the subacute stage and neuroplastic alterations that are adaptive or maladaptive during the chronic stage. Therefore timely and appropriate neuromodulation by transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS may be beneficial to patients with TBI for neuroprotection or restoration of maladaptive changes.Technologically combination of imaging-based modelling or simultaneous brain signal monitoring with tDCS could result in greater individualized optimal targeting allowing a more favorable neuroplasticity after TBI. Moreover a combination of task-oriented training using virtual reality with tDCS can be considered as a potent tele-rehabilitation tool in the home setting increasing the dose of rehabilitation and neuromodulation resulting in better motor recovery.This review summarizes the pathophysiology and possible neuroplastic changes in TBI as well as provides the general concepts and current evidence with respect to the applicability of tDCS in motor recovery. Through its endeavors it aims to provide insights on further successful development and clinical application of tDCS in motor rehabilitation after TBI.
