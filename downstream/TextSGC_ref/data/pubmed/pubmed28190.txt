Electrocorticography ECoG is an important area of research for Brain-Computer Interface BCI development. ECoG along with some other biopotentials has spectral characteristics that can be exploited for more optimal front-end performance than is achievable with conventional techniques. This paper optimizes noise performance of such a system and discusses an equalization technique that reduces the analog-to-digital converter ADC dynamic range requirements and eliminates the need for a variable gain amplifier VGA. We demonstrate a fabricated prototype in 1p9m 65 nm CMOS that takes advantage of the presented findings to achieve high-fidelity full-spectrum ECoG recording. It requires 1.08 W over a 150 Hz bandwidth for the entire analog front end and only 7 bits of ADC resolution.
