"The pattern of resting-state networks is influenced by several factors besides the underlying pathological changes of Parkinsons disease PD. Uric acid UA as an antioxidant has a neuroprotective property against PD-related microenvironment; however this effect would be gender-specific. We aimed to evaluate a gender-sensitive resting-state networks RSN according to the UA level in drug nave de novo patients with PD to elucidate the role of antioxidant in cortical functional networks of PD."
