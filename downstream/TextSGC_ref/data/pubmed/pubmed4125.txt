"Studies have demonstrated that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimers disease AD are associated with abnormal connections in either functional connectivity networks FCNs or structural connectivity networks SCNs. However the FCN and SCN of AD have usually been examined separately and the results were inconsistent. In this multimodal study we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 46 patients with AD and 39 matched healthy controls HCs. Graph-theory analysis was used to investigate the topological organization of the FCN and SCN simultaneously. Compared with HCs both the FCN and SCN of patients with AD showed disrupted network integration i.e. increased characteristic path length and segregation i.e. decreased intramodular connections in the default mode network. Moreover the FCN but not the SCN exhibited a reduced clustering coefficient and reduced rich club connections in AD. The coupling i.e. correlation of the FCN and SCN in AD was increased in connections of the default mode network and the rich club. These findings demonstrated overlapping and distinct network disruptions in the FCN and SCN and a strengthened correlation between FCNs and SCNs in AD which provides a novel perspective for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD."
