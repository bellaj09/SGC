"We developed a rehabilitation system by using the virtual reality technique and the Kinect in this paper. The system combines rehabilitation training with HMI and serious game organically and provides a game and motion database to meet different patients demands. Extended interface of game database is provided in two ways: personalized games can be developed by Virtools and Flash games which are suitable for patients rehabilitation can be download from the Internet directly. In addition the system provides patients with flexible interaction and easy control mode and also presents real time data recording. An objective and subjective evaluation method is proposed to review the effectiveness of the rehabilitation training. According to the results of short questionnaires and the evaluation results of patients rehabilitation training the system compared with traditional rehabilitation can record and analyze the training data which is useful to make rehabilitation plans. More entertainment and lower cost will increase patients motivation which helps to increase the rehabilitation effectiveness."
