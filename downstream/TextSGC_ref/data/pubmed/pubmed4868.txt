Spontaneous neural activities are endowed with specific patterning characterized by synchronizations within functionally relevant distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks RSNs. Although the mechanisms that organize the large-scale neural systems are still largely unknown recent studies have proposed a hypothesis that network-specific coactivations indeed emerge as the result of globally propagating neural activities with specific paths of transmission. However the extent to which such a centralized global regulation rather than network-specific control contributes to the RSN synchronization remains unknown. In the present study we investigated the contribution from each mechanism by directly identifying the global as well as local component of resting-state functional MRI fMRI data provided by human connectome project using temporal independent component analysis ICA. Based on the spatial distribution pattern each ICA component was classified as global or local. Time lag mapping of each IC revealed several paths of global or semi-global propagations that are partially overlapping yet spatially distinct to each other. Consistent with previous studies the time lag of global oscillation although being less spatially homogenous than what was assumed to be contributed to the RSN synchronization. However an equivalent contribution was also shown on the part of the more locally confined activities that are independent to each other. While allowing the view that network-specific coactivation occurs as part of the sequences of global neural activities these results further confirm an equally important role of the network-specific regulation for its coactivation regardless of whether vascular artifacts contaminate the global component in fMRI measures.
