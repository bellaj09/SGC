Automatic segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis MS lesions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI images is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning of MS. Recent years have seen an increasing use of Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs for this task. Although these methods provide accurate segmentation their applicability in clinical settings remains limited due to a reproducibility issue across different image domains. MS images can have highly variable characteristics across patients MRI scanners and imaging protocols; retraining a supervised model with data from each new domain is not a feasible solution because it requires manual annotation from expert radiologists. In this work we explore an unsupervised solution to the problem of domain shift. We present a framework Seg-JDOT which adapts a deep model so that samples from a source domain and samples from a target domain sharing similar representations will be similarly segmented. We evaluated the framework on a multi-site dataset MICCAI 2016 and showed that the adaptation toward a target site can bring remarkable improvements in a model performance over standard training.
