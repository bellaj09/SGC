In this report we present a mobile brain/body imaging MoBI dataset that allows study of source-resolved cortical dynamics supporting coordinated gait movements in a rhythmic auditory cueing paradigm. Use of an auditory pacing stimulus stream has been recommended to identify deficits and treat gait impairments in neurologic populations. Here the rhythmic cueing paradigm required healthy young participants to walk on a treadmill constant speed while attempting to maintain step synchrony with an auditory pacing stream and to adapt their step length and rate to unanticipated shifts in tempo of the pacing stimuli e.g. sudden shifts to a faster or slower tempo. High-density electroencephalography EEG 108 channels surface electromyography EMG bilateral tibialis anterior pressure sensors on the heel to register timing of heel strikes and goniometers knee hip and ankle joint angles were concurrently recorded in 20 participants. The data is provided in the Brain Imaging Data Structure BIDS format to promote data sharing and reuse and allow the inclusion of the data into fully automated data analysis workflows. High-density EEG mobile brain/body imaging data recorded during a challenging auditory gait pacing task.
