"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs can use brain signals from the scalp EEG the cortical surface ECoG or within the cortex to restore movement control to people who are paralyzed. Like muscle-based skills BCIs use requires activity-dependent adaptations in the brain that maintain stable relationships between the persons intent and the signals that convey it. This study shows that humans can learn over a series of training sessions to use EEG for three-dimensional control. The responsible EEG features are focused topographically on the scalp and spectrally in specific frequency bands. People acquire simultaneous control of three independent signals one for each dimension and reach targets in a virtual three-dimensional space. Such BCI control in humans has not been reported previously. The results suggest that with further development noninvasive EEG-based BCIs might control the complex movements of robotic arms or neuroprostheses."
