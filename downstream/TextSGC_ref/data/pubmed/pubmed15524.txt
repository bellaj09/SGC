Objective: To assess the effectiveness of home videogame-based exercise exergaming as an additional rehabilitative tool in young patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA. Materials and Methods: After a baseline T0 evaluation 40 RA inpatients 18-35 years of age underwent both a 4-week-lasting traditional rehabilitation program and a training by Nintendo Wii-Fit videogame system. At discharge T1 subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to two groups: Group A experimental group including subjects who continued Wii-Fit training at home for additional 8 weeks and Group B control group including subjects maintaining their habitual activity during the 8-week follow-up T2. Measures of disease activity quality of life and fatigue were evaluated at each time point. Results: From T0 to T1 a significant improvement in most evaluated outcomes was reported in both study groups. At T2 assessment only Group A patients experienced a significant improvement of quality of life and fatigue with a 13.4% reduction in Global Health GH values only a slight increase 4.2% in Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ score and a 19.1% Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy FACIT improvement as compared with T1. In contrast Group B patients reported a 65.8% increase in GH values a 33% increase in HAQ score and a 53.4% reduction in FACIT values from T1 to T2. The extended videogame-based home training was an independent predictor of %GH \u2009=\u20090.851; P\u2009<\u20090.001 %HAQ \u2009=\u20090.542; P\u2009<\u20090.001 and %FACIT \u2009=\u2009-0.505; P\u2009<\u20090.001. Conclusions: Home exergaming may be an effective additional rehabilitative tool in RA since it allows to maintain the benefits of traditional multidisciplinary rehabilitation.
