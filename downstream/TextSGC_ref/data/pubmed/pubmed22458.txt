The use of simulation in health professional education has increased rapidly over the past 2 decades. While simulation has predominantly been used to train health professionals and students for a variety of clinically related situations there is an increasing trend to use simulation as an assessment tool especially for the development of technical-based skills required during clinical practice. However there is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of using simulation for the assessment of competency. Therefore the aim of this systematic review was to examine simulation as an assessment tool of technical skills across health professional education. Simulation-based assessments in health professional education: a systematic review.
