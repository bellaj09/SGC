Virtual-reality solutions have successfully been used to train distributed teams. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between user characteristics and sense of presence in an online virtual-reality environment where distributed teams are trained. A greater sense of presence has the potential to make training in the virtual environment more effective leading to the formation of teams that perform better in a real environment. Being able to identify before starting online training those user characteristics that are predictors of a greater sense of presence can lead to the selection of trainees who would benefit most from the online simulated training. Measuring sense of presence and user characteristics to predict effective training in an online simulated virtual environment.
