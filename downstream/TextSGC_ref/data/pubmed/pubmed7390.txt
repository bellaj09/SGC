Massively parallel genetic sequencing allows rapid testing of known intellectual disability ID genes. However the discovery of novel syndromic ID genes requires molecular confirmation in at least a second or a cluster of individuals with an overlapping phenotype or similar facial gestalt. Using computer face-matching technology we report an automated approach to matching the faces of non-identical individuals with the same genetic syndrome within a database of 3681\xa0images 1600 images of one of 10 genetic syndrome subgroups together with 2081 control images. Using the leave-one-out method two research questions were specified: 1 Using two-dimensional 2D photographs of individuals with one of 10 genetic syndromes within a database of images did the technology correctly identify more than expected by chance: i a top match? ii at least one match within the top five matches? or iii at least one in the top 10 with an individual from the same syndrome subgroup? 2 Was there concordance between correct technology-based matches and whether two out of three clinical geneticists would have considered the diagnosis based on the image alone? Computer face-matching technology using two-dimensional photographs accurately matches the facial gestalt of unrelated individuals with the same syndromic form of intellectual disability.
