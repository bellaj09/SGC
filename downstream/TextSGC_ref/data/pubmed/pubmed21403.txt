"Everyday locomotion and obstacle avoidance requires effective gait adaptation in response to sensory cues. Many studies have shown that efficient motor actions are associated with  rhythm 8-13 Hz and  band 13-35 Hz local field desynchronizations in sensorimotor and parietal cortex whereas a number of cognitive task studies have reported higher behavioral accuracy to be associated with increases in  band power in prefrontal and sensory cortex. How these two distinct patterns of  band oscillations interplay during gait adaptation however has not been established. Here we recorded 108 channel EEG activity from 18 participants 10 males 22-35 years old attempting to walk on a treadmill in synchrony with a series of pacing cue tones and quickly adapting their step rate and length to sudden shifts in pacing cue tempo. Independent component analysis parsed each participants EEG data into maximally independent component IC source processes which were then grouped across participants into distinct spatial/spectral clusters. Following cue tempo shifts mean  band power was suppressed for IC sources in central midline and parietal regions whereas mean  band power increased in IC sources in or near medial prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex IC cluster the  band power increase was stronger during more effortful step shortening than during step lengthening. These results thus show that two distinct patterns of  band activity modulation accompany gait adaptations: one likely serving movement initiation and execution; and the other motor control and inhibition."
