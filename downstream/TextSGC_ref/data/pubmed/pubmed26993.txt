"Patients in a locked-in state LIS due to severe neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS require seamless emergency care by their caregivers or guardians. However it is a difficult job for the guardians to continuously monitor the patients state especially when direct communication is not possible. In the present study we developed an emergency call system for such patients using a steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain switch. Although there have been previous studies to implement SSVEP-based brain switch system they have not been applied to patients in LIS and thus their clinical value has not been validated. In this study we verified whether the SSVEP-based brain switch system can be practically used as an emergency call system for patients in LIS. The brain switch used for our system adopted a chromatic visual stimulus which proved to be visually less stimulating than conventional checkerboard-type stimuli but could generate SSVEP responses strong enough to be used for brain-computer interface BCI applications. To verify the feasibility of our emergency call system 14 healthy participants and 3 patients with severe ALS took part in online experiments. All three ALS patients successfully called their guardians to their bedsides in about 6.56 seconds. Furthermore additional experiments with one of these patients demonstrated that our emergency call system maintains fairly good performance even up to 4 weeks after the first experiment without renewing initial calibration data. Our results suggest that our SSVEP-based emergency call system might be successfully used in practical scenarios."
