A peripherally inserted central catheter PICC is a thin catheter that is inserted via arm veins and threaded near the heart providing intravenous access. The final catheter tip position is always confirmed on a chest radiograph CXR immediately after insertion since malpositioned PICCs can cause potentially life-threatening complications. Although radiologists interpret PICC tip location with high accuracy delays in interpretation can be significant. In this study we proposed a fully-automated deep-learning system with a cascading segmentation AI system containing two fully convolutional neural networks for detecting a PICC line and its tip location. A preprocessing module performed image quality and dimension normalization and a post-processing module found the PICC tip accurately by pruning false positives. Our best model trained on 400 training cases and selectively tuned on 50 validation cases obtained absolute distances from ground truth with a mean of 3.10\xa0mm a standard deviation of 2.03\xa0mm and a root mean squares error RMSE of 3.71\xa0mm on 150 held-out test cases. This system could help speed confirmation of PICC position and further be generalized to include other types of vascular access and therapeutic support devices.
