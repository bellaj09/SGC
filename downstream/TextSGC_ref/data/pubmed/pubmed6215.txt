"Peoples ability to think creatively is a primary means of technological and cultural progress yet the neural architecture of the highly creative brain remains largely undefined. Here we employed a recently developed method in functional brain imaging analysis-connectome-based predictive modeling-to identify a brain network associated with high-creative ability using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data acquired from 163 participants engaged in a classic divergent thinking task. At the behavioral level we found a strong correlation between creative thinking ability and self-reported creative behavior and accomplishment in the arts and sciences r = 0.54. At the neural level we found a pattern of functional brain connectivity related to high-creative thinking ability consisting of frontal and parietal regions within default salience and executive brain systems. In a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis we show that this neural model can reliably predict the creative quality of ideas generated by novel participants within the sample. Furthermore in a series of external validation analyses using data from two independent task fMRI samples and a large task-free resting-state fMRI sample we demonstrate robust prediction of individual creative thinking ability from the same pattern of brain connectivity. The findings thus reveal a whole-brain network associated with high-creative ability comprised of cortical hubs within default salience and executive systems-intrinsic functional networks that tend to work in opposition-suggesting that highly creative people are characterized by the ability to simultaneously engage these large-scale brain networks."
