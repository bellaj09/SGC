Virtual reality VR can be a useful tool for conducting consumer behavior experiments. The aim of this research was to examine whether people standing in front of a supermarket shelf make similar decisions and process similar information as those in front of a shelf in a VR shop. In Study 1 participants were asked to select a cereal from among 33 commercially available types of cereals placed on a shelf. One group performed the task in front of a real shelf while the other performed it in VR. Eye-tracking data were collected for both groups. No statistically significant differences were observed in the selection of the cereals by the two groups in the two conditions. Eye-tracking data only revealed few differences in the information-seeking behavior. In Study 2 results observed using real products were replicated in VR. Participants were asked to walk through a virtual supermarket and select either a healthy cereal healthy condition or a tasty cereal hedonic condition. Results showed that participants in the healthy condition paid more attention to the nutrition information than those in the hedonic condition. The results of these two experiments suggest that a VR condition wherein participants can walk around and behave as in the real world is a useful tool for conducting experiments related to food decisions.
