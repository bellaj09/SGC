A right-sided aortic arch is normally asymptomatic. We report the case of an 84-year-old man with right internal jugular vein thrombosis caused by an aneurysm in a right-sided aortic arch. The patient had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and had an uneventful postoperative course. However a routine postoperative contrast-enhanced thoracic and abdominal computed tomography scan showed right internal jugular vein thrombosis. The patient had no history of catheter insertion in the right jugular veins and had no hereditary coagulopathy. It was presumed that the cause of this thrombosis was compression of the right brachiocephalic vein by an aneurysm of the right-sided ascending aorta that was considered too small to require surgical repair. The right internal jugular vein thrombosis was successfully treated with edoxaban. <Learning objective: This case report alerts us to consider that a right-sided aortic arch aneurysm considered too small for surgery can later cause upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis.>.
