Virtual reality simulators track all movements and forces of simulated instruments generating enormous datasets which can be further analyzed with machine learning algorithms. These advancements may increase the understanding assessment and training of psychomotor performance. Consequently the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate performance on virtual reality simulators has led to an increase in the volume and complexity of publications which bridge the fields of computer science medicine and education. Although all disciplines stand to gain from research in this field important differences in reporting exist limiting interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer. Thus our objective was to develop a checklist to provide a general framework when reporting or analyzing studies involving virtual reality surgical simulation and machine learning algorithms. By including a total score as well as clear subsections of the checklist authors and reviewers can both easily assess the overall quality and specific deficiencies of a manuscript.
