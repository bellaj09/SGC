In the clinical office during surgical planning or in the operating room neurosurgeons have been surrounded by the digital world either recreating old tools or introducing new ones. Technological refinements chiefly based on the use of computer systems have altered the modus operandi for neurosurgery. In the emergency room or in the office patient data are entered digitally dictated or gathered from electronic medical records. Images from every modality can be examined on a Picture Archiving and Communication System PACS or can be seen remotely on cell phones. Surgical planning is based on high-resolution reconstructions and microsurgical or radiosurgical approaches can be assessed precisely using stereotaxy. Tumor resection abscess or hematoma evacuation or the management of vascular lesions can be assisted intraoperatively by new imaging resources integrated into the surgical microscope. Mathematical models can dictate how a lesion may recur as well as how often a particular patient should be followed. Finally virtual reality is being developed as a training tool for residents and surgeons by preoperatively simulating complex surgical scenarios. Altogether computerization at each level of patient care has been affected by digital technology to help enhance the safety of procedures and thereby improve outcomes of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures.
