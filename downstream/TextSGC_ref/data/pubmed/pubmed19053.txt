Ability to drive was an important factor of quality of life for subjects with spinal cord injuries SCI. However the effect of virtual reality VR environment on driving ability and simulation-based driving training of people with SCI has not yet been investigated in any systematic objective study. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the virtual reality created by a driving simulator and determine the number of simulator sessions necessary for patients with spinal cord injuries to reach maximum driving competence. The effect of virtual reality-enhanced driving protocol in patients following spinal cord injury.
