A growing amount of evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs lncRNAs play important roles in the regulation of biological processes in many human diseases. However the number of experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations is very limited. Thus various computational approaches are proposed to predict lncRNA-disease associations. Current matrix factorization-based methods cannot capture the complex non-linear relationship between lncRNAs and diseases and traditional machine learning-based methods are not sufficiently powerful to learn the representation of lncRNAs and diseases. Thus we propose a deep matrix factorization model to predict lncRNA-disease associations DMFLDA in short. DMFLDA uses a cascade of non-linear hidden layers to learn latent semantic vectors to represent lncRNAs and diseases. By using non-linear hidden layers DMFLDA captures the more complex non-linear relationship between lncRNAs and diseases than traditional matrix factorization-based methods.The low dimensional representations of the lncRNAs and diseases are fused to estimate the new interaction value. To evaluate the performance of DMFLDA we perform leave-one-out cross-validation on known experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations. The experimental results show that DMFLDA performs better than the existing methods. The case studies show that many predicted interactions for colorectal cancer prostate cancer and renal cancer have been verified by recent biomedical literatures.
