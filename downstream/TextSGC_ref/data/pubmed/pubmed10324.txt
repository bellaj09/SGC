The marriage between the deep convolutional neural network CNN and region proposals has made breakthroughs for object detection in recent years. While the discriminative object features are learned via a deep CNN for classification the large intra-class variation and deformation still limit the performance of the CNN based object detection. We propose a subcategory-aware CNN S-CNN to solve the object intra-class variation problem. In the proposed technique the training samples are first grouped into multiple subcategories automatically through a novel instance sharing maximum margin clustering process. A multi-component Aggregated Channel Feature ACF detector is then trained to produce more latent training samples where each ACF component corresponds to one clustered subcategory. The produced latent samples together with their subcategory labels are further fed into a CNN classifier to filter out false proposals for object detection. An iterative learning algorithm is designed for the joint optimization of image subcategorization multi-component ACF detector and subcategory-aware CNN classifier. Experiments on INRIA Person dataset Pascal VOC 2007 dataset and MS COCO dataset show that the proposed technique clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for generic object detection.
