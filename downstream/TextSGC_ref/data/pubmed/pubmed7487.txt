In this paper we present a deep regression approach for face alignment. The deep regressor is a neural network that consists of a global layer and multistage local layers. The global layer estimates the initial face shape from the whole image while the following local layers iteratively update the shape with local image observations. Combining standard derivations and numerical approximations we make all layers able to backpropagate error differentials so that we can apply the standard backpropagation to jointly learn the parameters from all layers. We show that the resulting deep regressor gradually and evenly approaches the true facial landmarks stage by stage avoiding the tendency that often occurs in the cascaded regression methods and deteriorates the overall performance: yielding early stage regressors with high alignment accuracy gains but later stage regressors with low alignment accuracy gains. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach brings significant improvements over previous cascaded regression algorithms. Face Alignment With Deep Regression.
