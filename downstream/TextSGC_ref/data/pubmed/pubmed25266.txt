In recent years research has progressed steadily in regard to the use of computers to recognize and render sign language. This paper reviews significant projects in the field beginning with finger-spelling hands such as "Ralph" robotics CyberGloves virtual reality sensors to capture isolated and continuous signs camera-based projects such as the CopyCat interactive American Sign Language game computer vision and sign recognition software Hidden Markov Modeling and neural network systems. Avatars such as "Tessa" Text and Sign Support Assistant; three-dimensional imaging and spoken language to sign language translation systems such as Poland\s project entitled "THETOS" Text into Sign Language Automatic Translator which operates in Polish; natural language processing are addressed. The application of this research to education is also explored. The "ICICLE" Interactive Computer Identification and Correction of Language Errors project for example uses intelligent computer-aided instruction to build a tutorial system for deaf or hard-of-hearing children that analyzes their English writing and makes tailored lessons and recommendations. Finally the article considers synthesized sign which is being added to educational material and has the potential to be developed by students themselves. Sign language recognition and translation: a multidisciplined approach from the field of artificial intelligence.
