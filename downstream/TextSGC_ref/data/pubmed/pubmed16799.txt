Participation in sailing by people with disabilities particularly in small sailboats is widely regarded as having positive outcomes on self-esteem and general health for the participants. However a major hurdle for people with no previous experience of sailing even by those without disabilities is the perception that sailing is elitist expensive and dangerous. Real-time "ride-on" sailing simulators have the potential to bridge the gap between dry-land and on-the-water sailing. These provide a realistic safe and easily supervised medium in which nonsailors can easily and systematically learn the required skills before venturing out on the water. The authors report a 12-wk pilot therapeutic sailing program using the VSail-Access sailing simulation system followed by on-water experience. After completion of the training all subjects demonstrated the ability to navigate a simple course around marker buoys triangular configuration on the computer screen the ability to sail independently in winds of moderate strength up to 14 knots on water and measurable improvements in their psychologic health. In addition the subjects were able to participate in a sports activity with their respective family members and experienced a sense of optimism about their future. Use of a virtual reality physical ride-on sailing simulator as a rehabilitation tool for recreational sports and community reintegration: a pilot study.
