This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false alarms in the intensive care units ICUs without ignoring the true alarms using single- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature are either rule-based methods requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build rules or classical machine learning approaches depending on hand-engineered features. In this work we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically extract time-invariant features an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signals that are more likely to contribute to an alarm and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently using a two-step training algorithm i.e. pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed network on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification considering three different signals. In addition our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results where we just consider a single-lead ECG e.g. a sensitivity of 90.71% a specificity of 88.30% an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia. Single-modal and multi-modal false arrhythmia alarm reduction using attention-based convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
