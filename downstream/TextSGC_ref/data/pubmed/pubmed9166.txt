In medicine white blood cells WBCs play an important role in the human immune system. The different types of WBC abnormalities are related to different diseases so that the total number and classification of WBCs are critical for clinical diagnosis and therapy. However the traditional method of white blood cell classification is to segment the cells extract features and then classify them. Such method depends on the good segmentation and the accuracy is not high. Moreover the insufficient data or unbalanced samples can cause the low classification accuracy of model by using deep learning in medical diagnosis. To solve these problems this paper proposes a new blood cell image classification framework which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network DC-GAN and a residual neural network ResNet. In particular we introduce a new loss function which is improved the discriminative power of the deeply learned features. The experiments show that our model has a good performance on the classification of WBC images and the accuracy reaches 91.7%. Graphical Abstract Overview of the proposed method we use the deep convolution generative adversarial networks DC-GAN to generate new samples that are used as supplementary input to a ResNet the transfer learning method is used to initialize the parameters of the network the output of the DC-GAN and the parameters are applied the final classification network. In particular we introduced a modified loss function for classification to increase inter-class variations and decrease intra-class differences. Combining DC-GAN with ResNet for blood cell image classification.
