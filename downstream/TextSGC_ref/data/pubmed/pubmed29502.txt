Brain-computer interface BCI is a new communication pathway for users with neurological deficiencies. The implementation of a BCI system requires complex electroencephalography EEG signal processing including filtering feature extraction and classification algorithms. Most of current BCI systems are implemented on personal computers. Therefore there is a great interest in implementing BCI on embedded platforms to meet system specifications in terms of time response cost effectiveness power consumption and accuracy. An embedded implementation based on adaptive filter bank for brain-computer interface systems.
