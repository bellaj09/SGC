Adipose-derived stem cells ASC are becoming one of the most exploited cells in peripheral nerve repair. They are fast-growing and able to protect neurons from apoptosis; they can reduce post-injury latency and the risk of muscle atrophy. This study evaluates laminin-loaded fibrin gel as an ASC-carrying scaffold for nerve repair. In vitro ASC retained their proliferative activity but showed significant increase in proliferation rate when encapsulated in gels with low laminin concentrations i.e. 1\xa0g/mL. We observed a linear decrease of ASC proliferation rate with increasing laminin concentration from 1 to 100\xa0g/mL. We next examined the effect of the ASC-carrying fibrin gels on in vitro dorsal root ganglia DRG neurite extension then in vivo sciatic nerve regeneration in adult rats. The ASC-carrying gel was embedded in 15-mm-long 1.5-mm-diameter polydimethylsiloxane regenerative conduits for in vivo evaluation. At 8-week post implantation robust regeneration was observed across the long gap. Taken together these results suggest ASC-carrying gels are a potential path to improve the efficacy of nerve regeneration through artificial guidance conduits and electrode nerve interfaces.
