In recent years several automatic sleep stage classification methods based on convolutional neural networks CNN by learning hierarchical feature representation automatically from raw EEG data have been proposed. However the state-of-the-art of such methods are quite complex. Using a simple CNN architecture to classify sleep stages is important for portable sleep devices. In addition employing CNNs to learn rich and diverse representations remains a challenge. Therefore we propose a novel CNN model for sleep stage classification. Orthogonal convolutional neural networks for automatic sleep stage classification based on single-channel EEG.
