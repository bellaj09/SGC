OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to compare image quality and clinically significant lesion detection on deep learning reconstruction DLR and iterative reconstruction IR images of submillisievert chest and abdominopelvic CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Our prospective multiinstitutional study included 59 adult patients 33 women 26 men; mean age  SD 65  12 years old; mean body mass index weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters = 27  5 who underwent routine chest n = 22; 16 women six men and abdominopelvic n = 37; 17 women 20 men CT on a 640-MDCT scanner Aquilion ONE Canon Medical Systems. All patients gave written informed consent for the acquisition of low-dose LD CT LDCT after a clinically indicated standard-dose SD CT SDCT. The SDCT series 120 kVp 164-644 mA were reconstructed with interactive reconstruction IR adaptive iterative dose reduction AIDR 3D Canon Medical Systems and the LDCT 100 kVp 120 kVp; 30-50 mA were reconstructed with filtered back-projection FBP IR AIDR 3D and forward-projected model-based iterative reconstruction solution FIRST Canon Medical Systems and deep learning reconstruction DLR Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine AiCE Canon Medical Systems. Four subspecialty-trained radiologists first read all LD image sets and then compared them side-by-side with SD AIDR 3D images in an independent randomized and blinded fashion. Subspecialty radiologists assessed image quality of LDCT images on a 3-point scale 1 = unacceptable 2 = suboptimal 3 = optimal. Descriptive statistics were obtained and the Wilcoxon sign rank test was performed. RESULTS. Mean volume CT dose index and dose-length product for LDCT 2.1  0.8 mGy 49  13mGycm were lower than those for SDCT 13  4.4 mGy 567  249 mGycm p < 0.0001. All 31 clinically significant abdominal lesions were seen on SD AIDR 3D and LD DLR images. Twenty-five 18 and seven lesions were detected on LD AIDR 3D LD FIRST and LD FBP images respectively. All 39 pulmonary nodules detected on SD AIDR 3D images were also noted on LD DLR images. LD DLR images were deemed acceptable for interpretation in 97% 35/37 of abdominal and 95-100% 21-22/22 of chest LDCT studies p = 0.2-0.99. The LD FIRST LD AIDR 3D and LD FBP images had inferior image quality compared with SD AIDR 3D images p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION. At submillisievert chest and abdominopelvic CT doses DLR enables image quality and lesion detection superior to commercial IR and FBP images.
