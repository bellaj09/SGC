"As a new type of Virtual Reality VR headset VR glasses rise rapidly in a number of areas. Its essential to understand the importance of user experience UX on VR glasses design. This study aimed to develop questionnaires for evaluating VR glasses UX as well as to investigate the relationship between various UX variables. With using lab-based usability tests this study analyzed participants self-reports and performance based on testing eight VR glasses and seven mobile applications. A nine-item questionnaire and a ten-item questionnaire were successfully developed to measure VR glasses systems UX quality in terms of hardware and application respectively. Within a proposed UX evaluation framework the perceived UX quality relative to VR glasses hardware emerged as a core predictor in predicting interactive operation performance whereas the application UX perception was a significant predictor of motion sickness." An evaluation for VR glasses system user experience: The influence factors of interactive operation and motion sickness.
