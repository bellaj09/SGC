"Persons with Schizophrenia experience difficulties with Executive Functioning EF that affect independence and participation in activities. Specifically EF impacts performance in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living IADL that require flexible thinking and accommodation to complex environments. However less is known how schizophrenia affects EF and individuals performance in activities. IADL performance can be tested using a virtual reality VR environment that simulates real life activities. The purpose of this study was: 1 to examine the feasibility and validity of the Virtual Action Planning-Supermarket VAP-S to assess EF in persons with schizophrenia as compared to a standardized EF measure the Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome BADS; 2 to compare performance of persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls in the VAP-S; 3 to assess the ability of the VAP-S to differentiate between different levels of EF within schizophrenia; 4 to explore the relationships between negative and positive symptoms and performance on the tests. Thirty persons with schizophrenia were matched with 30 healthy controls. Significant differences in performance between research and control groups were detected on the VAP-S and BADS with the research group performing worse. Large variations in number of purchases within the VAP-S by the research group point to level of task completion thus secondary analysis was conducted. There was a significant negative correlation between level of the negative signs and overall performance on the BADS and on most measures of the VAP-S. Results of this study support the use the VAP-S to assess EF among persons with Schizophrenia." Using virtual reality to evaluate executive functioning among persons with schizophrenia: a validity study.
