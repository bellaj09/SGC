There are many different types of microRNAs miRNAs and elucidating their functions is still under intensive research. A fundamental step in functional annotation of a new miRNA is to classify it into characterized miRNA families such as those in Rfam and miRBase. With the accumulation of annotated miRNAs it becomes possible to use deep learning-based models to classify different types of miRNAs. In this work we investigate several key issues associated with successful application of deep learning models for miRNA classification. First as secondary structure conservation is a prominent feature for noncoding RNAs including miRNAs we examine whether secondary structure-based encoding improves classification accuracy. Second as there are many more non-miRNA sequences than miRNAs instead of assigning a negative class for all non-miRNA sequences we test whether using softmax output can distinguish in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Finally we investigate whether deep learning models can correctly classify sequences from small miRNA families. Fast and accurate microRNA search using CNN.
