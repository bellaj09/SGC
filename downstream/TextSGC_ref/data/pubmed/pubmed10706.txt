"In the past decade advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning tools in digital pathology which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might ultimately improve patient management. In this Perspective we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology focusing on deep neural networks and hand-crafted feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating AI and machine learning tools into clinical oncology with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of AI including the need for well-curated validation datasets regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology." Artificial intelligence in digital pathology - new tools for diagnosis and precision oncology.
