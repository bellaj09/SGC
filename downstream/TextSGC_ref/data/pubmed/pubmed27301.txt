Applications of brain-computer interfacing BCI in neurorehabilitation have received increasing attention. The intention to perform a motor task can be detected from scalp EEG and used to control rehabilitation devices resulting in a patient-driven rehabilitation paradigm. In this study we present and validate a BCI system for detection of gait initiation using movement related cortical potentials MRCP. A brain-computer interface for single-trial detection of gait initiation from movement related cortical potentials.
