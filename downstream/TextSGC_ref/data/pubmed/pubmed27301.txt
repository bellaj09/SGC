The development of the information age has made resistive random access memory RRAM a critical nanoscale memristor device MD. However due to the randomness of the area formed by the conductive filaments CFs the RRAM MD still suffers from a problem of insufficient reliability. In this study the memristor of Ag/ZrO2/WS2/Pt structure is proposed for the first time and a layer of two-dimensional 2D WS2 nanosheets was inserted into the MD to form 2D material and oxide double-layer MD 2DOMD to improve the reliability of single-layer devices. The results indicate that the electrochemical metallization memory cell exhibits a highly stable memristive switching and concentrated ON- and OFF-state voltage distribution high speed 10 ns and robust endurance >109 cycles. This result is superior to MDs with a single-layer ZrO2 or WS2 film because two layers have different ion transport rates thereby limiting the rupture/rejuvenation of CFs to the bilayer interface region which can greatly reduce the randomness of CFs in MDs. Moreover we used the handwritten recognition dataset i.e. the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology MNIST database for neuromorphic simulations. Furthermore biosynaptic functions and plasticity including spike-timing-dependent plasticity and paired-pulse facilitation have been successfully achieved. By incorporating 2D materials and oxides into a double-layer MD the practical application of RRAM MD can be significantly enhanced to facilitate the development of artificial synapses for brain-enhanced computing systems in the future.
