Mindfulness meditation training interventions have been shown to improve markers of health but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not known. Building on initial cross-sectional research showing that mindfulness meditation may increase default mode network DMN resting-state functional connectivity rsFC with regions important in top-down executive control dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlPFC here we test whether mindfulness meditation training increases DMN-dlPFC rsFC and whether these rsFC alterations prospectively explain improvements in interleukin IL-6 in a randomized controlled trial.
