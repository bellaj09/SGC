Based upon cytoarchitectonic properties the primate prefrontal cortex has been partitioned into different subregions that show unique structural connectivity patterns with ongoing efforts to provide more fine-grained divisions. While meaningful divisions may be found within the sub-millimeter range the subdivisions exist within an overall hierarchical architecture and at higher levels likely share similar activity patterns and functionality. Here we used resting-state fMRI in lightly anesthetized macaque monkeys to measure the intrinsic functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex. At a gross anatomical level the data driven approach revealed five broad clusters that showed distinct brain-wide functional connectivity. Although each cluster encompasses several cytoarchitectonic subregions the clusters overlap with the intrinsic structural connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and each cluster may subserve common functions.
