The role of inheritance in ascertaining susceptibility to epilepsy is well established although the pathogenetic mechanisms are still not very clear. Interviewing for a positive family history is a popular epidemiological tool in the understanding of this susceptibility. Our aim was to visualize and localize network abnormalities that could be associated with a positive family history in a group of patients with hot water epilepsy HWE using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI. Reduced small world brain connectivity in probands with a family history of epilepsy.
