"When environments lack compelling goals humans often let their minds wander to thoughts with greater personal relevance; however we currently do not understand how this context-dependent prioritisation process operates. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC maintains goal representations in a context-dependent manner. Here we show this region is involved in prioritising off-task thought in an analogous way. In a whole brain analysis we established that neural activity in DLPFC is high both when on-task under demanding conditions and off-task in a non-demanding task. Furthermore individuals who increase off-task thought when external demands decrease show lower correlation between neural signals linked to external tasks and lateral regions of the DMN within DLPFC as well as less cortical grey matter in regions sensitive to these external task relevant signals. We conclude humans prioritise daydreaming when environmental demands decrease by aligning cognition with their personal goals using DLPFC." Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supports context-dependent prioritisation of off-task thought.
