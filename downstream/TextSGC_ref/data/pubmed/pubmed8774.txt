Drugs modulate disease states through their actions on targets in the body. Determining these targets aids the focused development of new treatments and helps to better characterize those already employed. One means of accomplishing this is through the deployment of in silico methodologies harnessing computational analytical and predictive power to produce educated hypotheses for experimental verification. Here we provide an overview of the current state of the art describe some of the well-established methods in detail and reflect on how they and emerging technologies promoting the incorporation of complex and heterogeneous data-sets can be employed to improve our understanding of polypharmacology. In Silico Target Prediction for Small Molecules.
