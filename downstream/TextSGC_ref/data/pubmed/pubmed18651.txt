Cerebrovascular accidents CVA and spinal cord injuries SCI are the most common causes of paralysis and paresis with reported prevalence of 12000 cases per million and 800 cases per million respectively. Disabilities that follow CVA hemiplegia or SCI paraplegia tetraplegia severely impair motor functions e.g. standing walking reaching and grasping and prevent the affected individuals from healthy-like full and autonomous participation in daily activities. Our research focuses on the development of a new virtual reality VR system combined with wearable neurorobotics NR motor-neuroprosthetics MNP and brain neuro-machine interface BNMI to overcome the major limitations of current rehabilitation solutions. Virtual reality system in conjunction with neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics for rehabilitation of motor disorders.
