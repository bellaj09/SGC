The Electroencephalography EEG is not just a mere clinical tool anymore. It has become the de-facto mobile portable non-invasive brain imaging sensor to harness brain information in real time. It is now being used to translate or decode brain signals to diagnose diseases or to implement Brain Computer Interface BCI devices. The automatic decoding is mainly implemented by using quantitative algorithms to detect the cloaked information buried in the signal. However clinical EEG is based intensively on waveforms and the structure of signal plots. Hence the purpose of this work is to establish a bridge to fill this gap by reviewing and describing the procedures that have been used to detect patterns in the electroencephalographic waveforms benchmarking them on a controlled pseudo-real dataset of a P300-Based BCI Speller and verifying their performance on a public dataset of a BCI Competition.
