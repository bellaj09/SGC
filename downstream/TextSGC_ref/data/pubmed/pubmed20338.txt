The present cutting-edge communication technology applied to the rehabilitation may change the real possibility of providing therapeutic treatments to the patients at their home. In order to confirm this assertion a current study on motor telerehabilitation was undertaken. Through a virtual reality based system and a complementary video conference apparatus we supplied five post stroke patients with a motor rehabilitation therapy. The rehabilitation technique was based on the augmented feedback. Subjects underwent the telerehabilitation program for six weeks. Before and after the evaluated therapy arm motor performance and the activities of daily living were evaluated by the means of clinical scales and measuring the affected arm velocity end-effector. This pilot study suggested that telerehabilitation could promote the learning of arm motor abilities at distance from the health facilities. From an economic point of view it could be proposed also as an opportune strategy for saving resources. Virtual environment system for motor tele-rehabilitation.
