Modern medicine incorporates minimally invasive approaches in virtually all areas of surgery and its application will continue to expand. The laparoscopic approach to many complex procedures is accompanied by a long learning curve that is not easily overcome or bypassed. Current training methods involve box trainers virtual reality simulators and live animal models that all attempt to replicate laparoscopic scenarios with varying degrees of success. The emphasis in training is now on intensive fellowship courses in high-volume centers that may overcome the learning curves associated with de novo development of laparoscopy. The many attempts to devise tools to assess laparoscopic skills have at best served as tests to discriminate between existing skill levels but do not provide a reliable tool to predict eventual laparoscopic ability. The traditional attributes of sound knowledge and clinical judgement that make a good surgeon are true of a good laparoscopist with perhaps the added requirement of stamina and motivation to complete the arduous training programs that are now needed to become competent in laparoscopy. Teaching laparoscopy to residents: how can we select good candidates?
