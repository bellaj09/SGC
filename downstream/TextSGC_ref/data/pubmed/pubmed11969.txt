The safety of an Internet Data Center IDC is directly determined by the reliability and stability of its chiller system. Thus combined with deep learning technology an innovative hybrid fault diagnosis approach 1D-CNN_GRU based on the time-series sequences is proposed in this study for the chiller system using 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network 1D-CNN and Gated Recurrent Unit GRU. Firstly 1D-CNN is applied to automatically extract the local abstract features of the sensor sequence data. Secondly GRU with long and short term memory characteristics is applied to capture the global features as well as the dynamic information of the sequence. Moreover batch normalization and dropout are introduced to accelerate network training and address the overfitting issue. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed hybrid algorithm are assessed on the RP-1043 dataset; based on the experimental results 1D-CNN_GRU displays the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further the experimental results reveal that 1D-CNN_GRU has a superior identification rate for minor faults.
