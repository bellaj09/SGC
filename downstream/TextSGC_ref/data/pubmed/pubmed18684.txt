"Linking neural microcircuit function to emergent properties of the mammalian brain requires fine-scale manipulation and measurement of neural activity during behavior where each neurons coding and dynamics can be characterized. We developed an optical method for simultaneous cellular-resolution stimulation and large-scale recording of neuronal activity in behaving mice. Dual-wavelength two-photon excitation allowed largely independent functional imaging with a green fluorescent calcium sensor GCaMP3  = 920  6 nm and single-neuron photostimulation with a red-shifted optogenetic probe C1V1  = 1064  6 nm in neurons coexpressing the two proteins. We manipulated task-modulated activity in individual hippocampal CA1 place cells during spatial navigation in a virtual reality environment mimicking natural place-field activity or biasing to reveal subthreshold dynamics. Notably manipulating single place-cell activity also affected activity in small groups of other place cells that were active around the same time in the task suggesting a functional role for local place cell interactions in shaping firing fields."
