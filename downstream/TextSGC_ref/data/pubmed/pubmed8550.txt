Process monitoring based on deep learning has attracted considerable attention. Generally several hidden layers exist in the deep-learning model and only the output information of the last hidden layer neurons extracted by deep learning is applied. Considering that each hidden layer is a kind of information representation of the original data the information of different hidden layers may contain positive elements for process monitoring. In this article we found that when a fault occurs there are some neurons in each hidden layer that the information they output are different compared with the normal condition. These neurons are called unstable neurons. Obviously the information they output are beneficial for process monitoring. Motivated by theoretical analysis and experimental studies on unstable neurons a novel method UN-DBN based on the unstable neurons in hidden layers is proposed to integrate the useful information for process monitoring the Euclidean metric the moving average filter and the kernel density estimation technique are employed to provide an intuitionistic expression of the working state. The comparable result applied on a mathematic simulation process and the TE process with other advanced monitoring methods confirms the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method UN-DBN in this article.
