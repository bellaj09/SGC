Reverse-engineering how complex multicellular systems develop and function is a grand challenge for systems bioengineers. This challenge has motivated the creation of a suite of bioengineering tools to develop increasingly quantitative descriptions of multicellular systems. Here we survey a selection of these tools including microfluidic devices imaging and computer vision techniques. We provide a selected overview of the emerging cross-talk between engineering methods and quantitative investigations within developmental biology. In particular the review highlights selected recent examples from the Drosophila system an excellent platform for understanding the interplay between genetics and biophysics. In sum the integrative approaches that combine multiple advances in these fields are increasingly necessary to enable a deeper understanding of how to analyze both natural and synthetic multicellular systems.
