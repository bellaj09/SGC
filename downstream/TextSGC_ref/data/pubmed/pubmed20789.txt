"Under natural viewing conditions the accommodation and vergence systems adjust the focus and the binocular alignment of the eyes in response to changes in viewing distance. The two responses are linked via cross-coupling and proceed almost simultaneously. Some optical devices such as virtual reality or helmet mounted displays create an oculomotor conflict by modifying demands on both vergence and accommodation. Previous studies extensively investigated the effect of such a conflict on the cross-coupling between vergence and accommodation but little is known about the plasticity of the whole oculomotor system. In the present study an oculomotor conflict was induced by a telestereoscope which magnified the standard inter-pupillary separation threefold and thus increased the convergence demand while accommodation remained almost unchanged. The effect of a 10 min exposure was assessed via a series of optometric parameters selected on the basis of existing oculomotor models. Associated with subjects visual complaints most of the oculomotor parameters tested were modified: there was 1 deterioration of stereoscopic threshold; 2 increase in AC/A ratio; 3 increase in near and far phorias; and 4 shift of the zone of clear and single binocular vision towards convergence. These results showed a change in gain of accommodative vergence and a shift of vergence reserves towards convergence in response to telestereoscopic viewing. The subjects binocular behaviour tended towards esophoria with convergence excess as confirmed by Sheards and Percivals criteria. Such changes in oculomotor parameters support adaptive behaviour linked with telestereoscopic viewing." Short exposure to telestereoscope affects the oculomotor system.
