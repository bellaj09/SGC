Major calcifications are of great concern when performing percutaneous coronary interventions because they inhibit proper stent deployment. We created a comprehensive software to segment calcifications in intravascular optical coherence tomography IVOCT images and to calculate their impact using the stent-deployment calcification score as reported by Fujino et\xa0al. We segmented the vascular lumen and calcifications using the pretrained SegNet convolutional neural network which was refined for our task. We cleaned segmentation results using conditional random field processing. We evaluated the method on manually annotated IVOCT volumes of interest VOIs without lesions and with calcifications lipidous or mixed lesions. The dataset included 48 VOIs taken from 34 clinical pullbacks giving a total of 2640 in vivo images. Annotations were determined from consensus between two expert analysts. Keeping VOIs intact we performed 10-fold cross-validation over all data. Following segmentation noise cleaning we obtained sensitivities of 0.85  0.04  0.99  0.01  and 0.97  0.01 for calcified lumen and other tissue classes respectively. From segmented regions we automatically determined calcification depth angle and thickness attributes. Bland-Altman analysis suggested strong correlation between manually and automatically obtained lumen and calcification attributes. Agreement between manually and automatically obtained stent-deployment calcification scores was good four of five lesions gave exact agreement. Results are encouraging and suggest our classification approach could be applied clinically for assessment and treatment planning of coronary calcification lesions.
