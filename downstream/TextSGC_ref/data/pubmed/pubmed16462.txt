Currently more than 800000 diagnostic procedures and 300000 percutaneous coronary interventions are performed annually in 556 catheter laboratories in Germany. These numbers document the importance of training programs in interventional cardiology. However this need is in sharp contrast to the time constraints for continuing medical education in Germany due to personnel and financial restrictions. A possible solution for this dilemma could be new training programs which partially supplement conventional clinical training by simulation-based medical education. Currently five virtual reality simulators for diagnostic procedures and percutaneous coronary interventions are available. These simulators provide a realistic hands-on training comparable to flight simulation in aviation.The simulator of choice for a defined training program depending on the underlying learning objectives could either be a simple mechanical model for puncture training or even a combination of virtual reality simulator and a full-scale mannequin for team training and crisis resource management. For the selection of the adequate training program the basic skills of the trainee the learning objectives and the underlying curriculum have to be taken into account. Absolutely mandatory for the success of simulation-based training is a dedicated teacher providing feedback and guidance. This teacher should be an experienced interventional cardiologist who knows both the simulator and the selected training cases which serve as a vehicle for transferring knowledge and skills.In this paper the potential of virtual reality simulation in cardiology will be discussed and the conditions which must be fulfilled to achieve quality improvement by simulation-based training will be defined. Improved quality of coronary diagnostics and interventions by virtual reality simulation.
