"We studied 23 Parkinsons disease PD non-demented patients and 15 controls in Virtual Reality VR environments reproducing usual daily living situations. In VR sessions PD patients performed their actions worse than controls in terms of time of execution in exploration and pointing precision as objects avoiding and in semantic incidental memory task. We observed clear differences of performances between on and off status medication with a global worsening during off phase. Moreover all six patients with motor fluctuations described visual hallucinations during off state with occurrence of images not included in the virtual environment."
