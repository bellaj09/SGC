Human Activity Recognition HAR aims to identify the actions performed by humans using signals collected from various sensors embedded in mobile devices. In recent years deep learning techniques have further improved HAR performance on several benchmark datasets. In this paper we propose one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network 1D CNN for HAR that employs a divide and conquer-based classifier learning coupled with test data sharpening. Our approach leverages a two-stage learning of multiple 1D CNN models; we first build a binary classifier for recognizing abstract activities and then build two multi-class 1D CNN models for recognizing individual activities. We then introduce test data sharpening during prediction phase to further improve the activity recognition accuracy. While there have been numerous researches exploring the benefits of activity signal denoising for HAR few researches have examined the effect of test data sharpening for HAR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two popular HAR benchmark datasets and show that our approach outperforms both the two-stage 1D CNN-only method and other state of the art approaches.
