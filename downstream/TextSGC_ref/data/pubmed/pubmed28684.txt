Over the years of research Electroencephalogram EEG signal study has grown to give promising outcomes. A lot of research has been done on implementing brain-computer-interfaces and the brain-computer interface BCI algorithm as well as the study of the effects of different stimuli on brain signals. This paper intends to make progress toward that goal by developing a responsive real-time EEG-based brain-to-machine communication system by generating distinct EEG signals at will and identification of the explicit pattern that they reflect for the presented self-induced internal visual and auditory stimuli. The brain-to-machine communication system delivers the real-time capture analysis and visualization of the brain signal patterns that can be used for smart medical applications such as rehabilitation robotic control smart wheelchair etc. Active brainwave pattern generation for brain-to-machine communication.
