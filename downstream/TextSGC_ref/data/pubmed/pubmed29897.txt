Although animal studies provided significant insights in understanding the neural basis of learning and adaptation they often cannot dissociate between different learning mechanisms due to the lack of verbal communication. To overcome this limitation we examined the mechanisms of learning and its limits in a human intracortical brain-machine interface BMI paradigm. A tetraplegic participant controlled a 2D computer cursor by modulating single-neuron activity in the anterior intraparietal area AIP. By perturbing the neuron-to-movement mapping the participant learned to modulate the activity of the recorded neurons to solve the perturbations by adopting a target re-aiming strategy. However when no cognitive strategies were adequate to produce correct responses AIP failed to adapt to perturbations. These findings suggest that learning is constrained by the pre-existing neuronal structure although it is possible that AIP needs more training time to learn to generate novel activity patterns when cognitive re-adaptation fails to solve the perturbations.
