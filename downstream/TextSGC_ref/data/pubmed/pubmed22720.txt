Purpose: To carry out a systematic review about the information about the application of of virtual reality and videogames in cardiac rehabilitation. Methods: A systematic review was conducted. Jadad scale was applied to evaluate the methodological quality of the articles included and the degree of evidence and the level of recommendation were determined through the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. PRISMA guidelines statement for systematic reviews were followed. Results: The total number of articles included in the present review was 10 with heterogeneity in the study populations cardiac rehabilitation phases technology used and protocols. Most of the studies showed an increase in heart rate less pain a greater ability to walk higher energy levels an increase in physical activity and improvements of motivation and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was between acceptable and poor. Conclusions: The use of virtual reality and videogames could be considered as complementary tools of physical training in patients with cardiovascular diseases in the different phases of cardiac rehabilitation. However it is also necessary to carry out studies with adequate methodological quality to determine the ideal technological systems target populations and clearly protocols to study their effects in the short medium and long-term assessments. Implications for rehabilitation The use of virtual reality and videogames could be considered as complementary tools for physical training in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Interactive virtual reality using exergames may promote heart rate fatigue perception physical activity and reduce pain in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Virtual reality and videogames enhance motivation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Virtual reality and video games in cardiac rehabilitation programs. A systematic review.
