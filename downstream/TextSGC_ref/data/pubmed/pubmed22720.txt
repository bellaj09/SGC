"The goal of the current study is to find a suitable classifier for electroencephalogram EEG data derived from a new learning paradigm which aims at communication in paralysis. A reflexive semantic classical Pavlovian conditioning paradigm is explored as an alternative to the operant learning paradigms currently used in most brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Comparable with a lie-detection experiment subjects are presented with true and false statements. The EEG activity following true and false statements was classified with the aim to separate covert yes from covert no responses. Four classification algorithms are compared for classifying off-line data collected from a group of 14 healthy participants: i stepwise linear discriminant analysis SWLDA ii shrinkage linear discriminant analysis SLDA iii linear support vector machine LIN-SVM and iv radial basis function kernel support vector machine RBF-SVM. The results indicate that all classifiers perform at chance level when separating conditioned yes from conditioned no responses. However single conditioned reactions could be successfully classified on a single-trial basis single conditioned reaction against a baseline interval. All of the four investigated classification methods achieve comparable performance however results with RBF-SVM show the highest single-trial classification accuracy of 68.8%. The results suggest that the proposed paradigm may allow affirmative and negative disapproving negative communication in a BCI experiment."
