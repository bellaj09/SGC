"An eye-tracking study of face and object recognition was conducted to clarify the character of face gaze in autistic spectrum disorders. Experimental participants were a group of individuals diagnosed with Aspergers disorder or high-functioning autistic disorder according to their medical records and confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ADI-R. Controls were selected on the basis of age gender and educational level to be comparable to the experimental group. In order to maintain attentional focus stereoscopic images were presented in a virtual reality VR headset in which the eye-tracking system was installed. Preliminary analyses show impairment in face recognition in contrast with equivalent and even superior performance in object recognition among participants with autism-related diagnoses relative to controls. Experimental participants displayed less fixation on the central face than did control-group participants. The findings within the limitations of the small number of subjects and technical difficulties encountered in utilizing the helmet-mounted display suggest an impairment in face processing on the part of the individuals in the experimental group. This is consistent with the hypothesis of disruption in the first months of life a period that may be critical to typical social and cognitive development and has important implications for selection of appropriate targets of intervention."
