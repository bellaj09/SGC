"We established a strategy to perform cross-validation of serial optical coherence scanner imaging SOCS and diffusion tensor imaging DTI on a postmortem human medulla. Following DTI the sample was serially scanned by SOCS which integrates a vibratome slicer and a multi-contrast optical coherence tomography rig for large-scale three-dimensional imaging at microscopic resolution. The DTI dataset was registered to the SOCS space. An average correlation coefficient of 0.9 was found between the co-registered fiber maps constructed by fractional anisotropy and retardance contrasts. Pixelwise comparison of fiber orientations demonstrated good agreement between the DTI and SOCS measures. Details of the comparison were studied in regions exhibiting a variety of fiber organizations. DTI estimated the preferential orientation of small fiber tracts; however it didnt capture their complex patterns as SOCS did. In terms of resolution and imaging depth SOCS and DTI complement each other and open new avenues for cross-modality investigations of the brain."
