The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading at an alarming rate and has created an unprecedented health emergency around the globe. There is no effective vaccine or approved drug treatment against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. The development of antiviral agents is an urgent priority. Biochemical events critical to the coronavirus replication cycle provided a number of attractive targets for drug development. These include spike protein for binding to host cell surface receptor proteolytic enzymes that are essential for processing polyproteins into mature viruses and RNA dependent RNA polymerase for RNA replication. There has been much ground work for drug discovery and development against these targets. Also high throughput screening efforts led to identification of diverse lead structures including product-derived molecules. The present review highlights past and present drug discovery and medicinal chemistry approaches against SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and COVID-19 targets. The review will stimulate further research and will be a useful guide to the development of effective therapy against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.
