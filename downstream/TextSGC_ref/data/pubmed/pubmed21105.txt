Constraint-Induced Movement therapy CI therapy is shown to reduce disability increase use of the more affected arm/hand and promote brain plasticity for individuals with upper extremity hemiparesis post-stroke. Randomized controlled trials consistently demonstrate that CI therapy is superior to other rehabilitation paradigms yet it is available to only a small minority of the estimated 1.2 million chronic stroke survivors with upper extremity disability. The current study aims to establish the comparative effectiveness of a novel patient-centered approach to rehabilitation utilizing newly developed inexpensive and commercially available gaming technology to disseminate CI therapy to underserved individuals. Video game delivery of CI therapy will be compared against traditional clinic-based CI therapy and standard upper extremity rehabilitation. Additionally individual factors that differentially influence response to one treatment versus another will be examined.
