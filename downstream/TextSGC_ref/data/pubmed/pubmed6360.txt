Digital pathology is today a widely used technology and the digitalization of microscopic slides into whole slide images WSIs allows the use of machine learning algorithms as a tool in the diagnostic process. In recent years "deep learning" algorithms for image analysis have been applied to digital pathology with great success. The training of these algorithms requires a large volume of high-quality images and image annotations. These large image collections are a potent source of information and to use and share the information standardization of the content through a consistent terminology is essential. The aim of this project was to develop a pilot dataset of exhaustive annotated WSI of normal and abnormal human tissue and link the annotations to appropriate ontological information. Annotations Ontologies and Whole Slide Images - Development of an Annotated Ontology-Driven Whole Slide Image Library of Normal and Abnormal Human Tissue.
