A large proportion of users do not achieve adequate control using current non-invasive brain-computer interfaces BCIs. This issue has being coined "BCI-Illiteracy" and is observed among different BCI modalities. Here we compare the performance and the BCI-illiteracy rate of a tactile selective sensation SS and motor imagery MI BCI for a large subject samples. We analyzed 80 experimental sessions from 57 subjects with two-class SS protocols. For SS the group average performance was 79.8  10.6% with 43 out of the 57 subjects 75.4% exceeding the 70% BCI-illiteracy threshold for left- and right-hand SS discrimination. When compared with previous results this tactile BCI outperformed all other tactile BCIs currently available. We also analyzed 63 experimental sessions from 43 subjects with two-class MI BCI protocols where the group average performance was 77.2  13.3% with 69.7% of the subjects exceeding the 70% performance threshold for left- and right-hand MI. For within-subject comparison the 24 subjects who participated to both the SS and MI experiments the BCI performance was superior with SS than MI especially in beta frequency band p < 0.05 with enhanced R2 discriminative information in the somatosensory cortex for the SS modality. Both SS and MI showed a functional dissociation between lower alpha 8 10 Hz and upper alpha 10 13 Hz bands with BCI performance significantly better in the upper alpha than the lower alpha p < 0.05 band. In summary we demonstrated that SS is a promising BCI modality with low BCI illiteracy issue and has great potential in practical applications reaching large population.
