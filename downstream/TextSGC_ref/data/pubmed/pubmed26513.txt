Due to the redundant information contained in multichannel electroencephalogram EEG signals the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface BCI systems may deteriorate to a large extent. Channel selection methods can help to remove task-independent electroencephalogram EEG signals and hence improve the performance of BCI systems. However in different frequency bands brain areas associated with motor imagery are not exactly the same which will result in the inability of traditional channel selection methods to extract effective EEG features. An Optimized Channel Selection Method Based on Multifrequency CSP-Rank for Motor Imagery-Based BCI System.
