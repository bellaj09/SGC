Vision impairment due to pathological damage of the retina can largely be prevented through periodic screening using fundus color imaging. However the challenge with large-scale screening is the inability to exhaustively detect fine blood vessels crucial to disease diagnosis. In this work we present a computational imaging framework using deep and ensemble learning based hybrid architecture for reliable detection of blood vessels in fundus color images. A deep neural network DNN is used for unsupervised learning of vesselness dictionaries using sparse trained denoising auto-encoders DAE followed by supervised learning of the DNN response using a random forest for detecting vessels in color fundus images. In experimental evaluation with the DRIVE database we achieve the objective of vessel detection with max. avg. accuracy of 0.9327 and area under ROC curve of 0.9195.
