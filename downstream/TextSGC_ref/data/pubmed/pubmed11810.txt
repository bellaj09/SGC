Delineation of Computed Tomography CT abdominal anatomical structure specifically spleen segmentation is useful for not only measuring tissue volume and biomarkers but also for monitoring interventions. Recently segmentation algorithms using deep learning have been widely used to reduce time humans spend to label CT data. However the computerized segmentation has two major difficulties: managing intermediate results e.g. resampled scans 2D sliced image for deep learning and setting up the system environments and packages for autonomous execution. To overcome these issues we propose an automated pipeline for the abdominal spleen segmentation. This pipeline provides an end-to-end synthesized process that allows users to avoid installing any packages and to deal with the intermediate results locally. The pipeline has three major stages: pre-processing of input data segmentation of spleen using deep learning 3D reconstruction with the generated labels by matching the segmentation results with the original image dimensions which can then be used later and for display or demonstration. Given the same volume scan the approach described here takes about 50\u202fs on average whereas the manual segmentation takes about 30\u202fmin on the average. Even if it includes all subsidiary processes such as preprocessing and necessary setups the whole pipeline process requires on the average 20\u202fmin from beginning to end.
