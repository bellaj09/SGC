Predicting the risk of mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction AMI using electronic health records EHRs data can help identify risky patients who might need more tailored care. In our previous work we built computational models to predict one-year mortality of patients admitted to an intensive care unit ICU with AMI or post myocardial infarction syndrome. Our prior work only used the structured clinical data from MIMIC-III a publicly available ICU clinical database. In this study we enhanced our work by adding the word embedding features from free-text discharge summaries. Using a richer set of features resulted in significant improvement in the performance of our deep learning models. The average accuracy of our deep learning models was 92.89% and the average F-measure was 0.928. We further reported the impact of different combinations of features extracted from structured and/or unstructured data on the performance of the deep learning models.
