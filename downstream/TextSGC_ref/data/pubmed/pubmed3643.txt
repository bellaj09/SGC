Preclinical applications of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI offer the possibility to non-invasively probe whole-brain network dynamics and to investigate the determinants of altered network signatures observed in human studies. Mouse rsfMRI has been increasingly adopted by numerous laboratories worldwide. Here we describe a multi-centre comparison of 17 mouse rsfMRI datasets via a common image processing and analysis pipeline. Despite prominent cross-laboratory differences in equipment and imaging procedures we report the reproducible identification of several large-scale resting-state networks RSN including a mouse default-mode network in the majority of datasets. A combination of factors was associated with enhanced reproducibility in functional connectivity parameter estimation including animal handling procedures and equipment performance. RSN spatial specificity was enhanced in datasets acquired at higher field strength with cryoprobes in ventilated animals and under medetomidine-isoflurane combination sedation. Our work describes a set of representative RSNs in the mouse brain and highlights key experimental parameters that can critically guide the design and analysis of future rodent rsfMRI investigations.
