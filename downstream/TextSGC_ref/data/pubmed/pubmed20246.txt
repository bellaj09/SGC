"Virtual Reality has made computer interfaces more intuitive but not more intelligent. This paper shows how an expert system can be coupled with multimodal input in a virtual environment to provide an intelligent simulation tool or surgical assistant. This is accomplished in three steps. First voice and gestural input is interpreted and represented in a common semantic form. Second a rule-based expert system is used to infer context and user actions from this semantic representation. Finally the inferred user actions are matched against steps in a surgical procedure to monitor the users progress and provide automatic feedback. In addition the system can respond immediately to multimodal commands for navigational assistance and/or identification of critical anatomical structures. To show how these methods are used we present a prototype sinus surgery interface. The approach described here may easily be extended to a wide variety of medical and non-medical training applications by making simple changes to the expert system database and virtual environment models. Successful implementation of an expert system in both simulated and real surgery has enormous potential for the surgeon both in training and clinical practice." The expert surgical assistant.
