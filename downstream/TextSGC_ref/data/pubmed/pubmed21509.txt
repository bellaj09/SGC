Current research in brain computer interface BCI technology is advancing beyond preclinical studies with trials beginning in human patients. To date these trials have been carried out with several different types of recording interfaces. The success of these devices has varied widely but different factors such as the level of invasiveness timescale of recorded information and ability to maintain stable functionality of the device over a long period of time all must be considered in addition to accuracy in decoding intent when assessing the most practical type of device moving forward. Here we discuss various approaches to BCIs distinguishing between devices focusing on control of operations extrinsic to the subject e.g. prosthetic limbs computer cursors and those focusing on control of operations intrinsic to the brain e.g. using stimulation or external feedback including closed-loop or adaptive devices. In this discussion we consider the current challenges facing the translation of various types of BCI technology to eventual human application. Current Challenges Facing the Translation of Brain Computer Interfaces from Preclinical Trials to Use in Human Patients.
