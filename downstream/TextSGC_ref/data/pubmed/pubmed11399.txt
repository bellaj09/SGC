Hip Osteoarthritis OA is a common disease among the middle-aged and elderly people. Conventionally hip OA is diagnosed by manually assessing X-ray images. This study took the hip joint as the object of observation and explored the diagnostic value of deep learning in hip osteoarthritis. A deep convolutional neural network CNN was trained and tested on 420 hip X-ray images to automatically diagnose hip OA. This CNN model achieved a balance of high sensitivity of 95.0% and high specificity of 90.7% as well as an accuracy of 92.8% compared to the chief physicians. The CNN model performance is comparable to an attending physician with 10 years of experience. The results of this study indicate that deep learning has promising potential in the field of intelligent medical image diagnosis practice. A preliminary examination of the diagnostic value of deep learning in hip osteoarthritis.
