Implantable Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs are designed to provide real-time control signals for prosthetic devices study brain function and/or restore sensory information lost as a result of injury or disease. Using Radio Frequency RF to wirelessly power a BCI could widely extend the number of applications and increase chronic in-vivo viability. However due to the limited size and the electromagnetic loss of human brain tissues implanted miniaturized antennas suffer low radiation efficiency. This work presents simulations analysis and designs of implanted antennas for a wireless implantable RF-powered brain computer interface application. The results show that thin on the order of 100 micrometers thickness biocompatible insulating layers can significantly impact the antenna performance. The proper selection of the dielectric properties of the biocompatible insulating layers and the implantation position inside human brain tissues can facilitate efficient RF power reception by the implanted antenna. While the results show that the effects of the human head shape on implanted antenna performance is somewhat negligible the constitutive properties of the brain tissues surrounding the implanted antenna can significantly impact the electrical characteristics input impedance and operational frequency of the implanted antenna. Three miniaturized antenna designs are simulated and demonstrate that maximum RF power of up to 1.8 milli-Watts can be received at 2 GHz when the antenna implanted around the dura without violating the Specific Absorption Rate SAR limits.
