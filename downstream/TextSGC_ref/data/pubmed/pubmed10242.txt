Attenuation correction AC of positron emission tomography PET data poses a challenge when no transmission data or computed tomography CT data are available e.g. in stand alone PET scanners or PET/magnetic resonance imaging MRI. In these cases external imaging data or morphological imaging data are normally used for the generation of attenuation maps. Newly introduced machine learning methods however may allow for direct estimation of attenuation maps from non attenuation-corrected PET data PETNAC. Our purpose was thus to establish and evaluate a method for independent AC of brain fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-FDG PET images only based on PETNAC using Generative Adversarial Networks GAN. Independent brain 18F-FDG PET attenuation correction using a deep learning approach with Generative Adversarial Networks.
