In the underlay cognitive radio networks the radio environment maps REMs estimation is the main challenge in sensing the idle wireless spectrum resources. Traditional deep learning-based algorithms estimate the REMs on the basis of the high-quality large-scale complete training images. However collecting the complete radio environment images is time-consuming and requires a numerous number of power spectrum sensing nodes. For this reason we propose a generative adversarial networks-based pixel regression framework PRF for underlay cognitive radio networks. The PRF algorithm relaxes the requirement of the complete training images and estimates the radio environment maps only on the basis of the incomplete REMs images which are easier to be collected. First we transform the radio environment maps estimation task into a pixel regression task through the color mapping progress. Then to extract helpful information from the incomplete training data we design a feature enhancing module for the PRF algorithm which intelligently learns and emphasizes the important features from the training images. Finally we use the trained pixel regression framework to reconstruct the radio environment maps in the target area. The proposed algorithm learns accurate radio environment characteristics from the incomplete training data rather than making direct biased or imprecise radio propagation assumptions as in the traditional methods. Thus the PRF algorithm has a better REMs reconstruction performance than the traditional methods as verified by simulations.
