"This research explores the design and evaluation of visualization techniques of targets that reside outside of users view or are occluded by other elements within a virtual reality environment VE. We first compare four techniques 3DWedge 3DArrow 3DMinimap and Radar that can provide direction and distance information of targets. To give structure to their evaluation we also develop a framework of four tasks one for direction and three for distance and their assessment criteria. The results show that 3DWedge is the best-performing and most usable technique. However all techniques including 3DWedge have poor performance in dense scenarios with a large number of targets. To improve their support in dense scenarios a fifth technique 3DWedge+ is developed by using 3DWedge as its foundation and including the visual elements of the other three techniques that are useful. A second study is conducted to evaluate the performance of 3DWedge+ in relation to the other techniques. The results show that both 3DWedge and 3DWedge+ are significantly better in distinguishing user-to-target distance and that 3DWedge+ is particularly suitable for dense scenarios. Based on these results we provide a set of recommendations for the design of visualization techniques of off-screen and occluded targets in 3D VE."
