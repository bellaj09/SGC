"Staging third molar development is commonly used for age assessment in sub-adults. Current staging techniques are at most semi-automated and rely on manual interactions prone to operator variability. The aim of this study was to fully automate the staging process by employing the full potential of deep learning using convolutional neural networks CNNs in every step of the procedure. The dataset used to train the CNNs consisted of 400 panoramic radiographs OPGs with 20 OPGs per developmental stage per sex staged in consensus between three observers. The concepts of transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs and data augmentation were used to mitigate the issues when dealing with a limited dataset. In this work a three-step procedure was proposed and the results were validated using fivefold cross-validation. First a CNN localized the geometrical center of the lower left third molar around which a square region of interest ROI was extracted. Second another CNN segmented the third molar within the ROI. Third a final CNN used both the ROI and the segmentation to classify the third molar into its developmental stage. The geometrical center of the third molar was found with an average Euclidean distance of 63 pixels. Third molars were segmented with an average Dice score of 93%. Finally the developmental stages were classified with an accuracy of 54% a mean absolute error of 0.69 stages and a linear weighted Cohens kappa coefficient of 0.79. The entire automated workflow on average took 2.72 s to compute which is substantially faster than manual staging starting from the OPG. Taking into account the limited dataset size this pilot study shows that the proposed fully automated approach shows promising results compared with manual staging."
