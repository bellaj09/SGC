With deep convolutional neural networks and fiber optic Raman spectroscopy this study presents a novel classification method that discriminates tongue squamous cell carcinoma TSCC from non-tumorous tissue. To achieve this purpose 24 tissues spectral data were first collected from 12 patients who had undergone a surgical resection due to the tongue squamous cell carcinomas. Then 6 blocks with each block including 1 convolutional layer and 1 max-pooling layer are used to extract the nonlinear feature representations from Raman spectra. The derived features form a representative vector which is fed into a fully-connected network for performing classification task. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high sensitivity 99.31% and specificity 94.44%. To show the superiority for the ConvNets classifier comparison results with the state-of-the-art methods show it had a competitive classification accuracy. Moreover these promising results may pave the way to apply the deep ConvNets model in the fiber optic Raman instrument for intra-operative evaluation of TSCC resection margins and improve patient survival.
