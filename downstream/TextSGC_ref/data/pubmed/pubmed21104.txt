"Craniofacial reconstruction is to estimate an individuals face model from its skull. It has a widespread application in forensic medicine archeology medical cosmetic surgery and so forth. However little attention is paid to the evaluation of craniofacial reconstruction. This paper proposes an objective method to evaluate globally and locally the reconstructed craniofacial faces based on the geodesic network. Firstly the geodesic networks of the reconstructed craniofacial face and the original face are built respectively by geodesics and isogeodesics whose intersections are network vertices. Then the absolute value of the correlation coefficient of the features of all corresponding geodesic network vertices between two models is taken as the holistic similarity where the weighted average of the shape index values in a neighborhood is defined as the feature of each network vertex. Moreover the geodesic network vertices of each model are divided into six subareas that is forehead eyes nose mouth cheeks and chin and the local similarity is measured for each subarea. Experiments using 100 pairs of reconstructed craniofacial faces and their corresponding original faces show that the evaluation by our method is roughly consistent with the subjective evaluation derived from thirty-five persons in five groups."
