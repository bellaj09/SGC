"Tremor is one of the main symptoms of Parkinsons Disease PD that reduces the quality of life. Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale UPDRS part III. However the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patients tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that combined with wearable sensors can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory LSTM networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based leave-one-out cross-validation between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based leave-one-out cross-validation. These results indicate that our approach holds great promise in providing a full spectrum of the patients tremor from continuous monitoring of the subjects movement in their natural environment."
