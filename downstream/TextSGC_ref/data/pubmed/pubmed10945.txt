State monitoring of the complex system needs a large number of sensors. Especially studies in soft electronics aim to attain complete measurement of the body mapping various stimulations like temperature electrophysiological signals and mechanical strains. However conventional approach requires many sensor networks that cover the entire curvilinear surfaces of the target area. We introduce a new measuring system a novel electronic skin integrated with a deep neural network that captures dynamic motions from a distance without creating a sensor network. The device detects minute deformations from the unique laser-induced crack structures. A single skin sensor decodes the complex motion of five finger motions in real-time and the rapid situation learning RSL ensures stable operation regardless of its position on the wrist. The sensor is also capable of extracting gait motions from pelvis. This technology is expected to provide a turning point in health-monitoring motion tracking and soft robotics.
