Super-resolution which is one of the trend issues of recent times increases the resolution of the images to higher levels. Increasing the resolution of a vital image in terms of the information it contains such as brain magnetic resonance image MRI makes the important information in the MRI image more visible and clearer. Thus it is provided that the borders of the tumors in the related image are found more successfully. In this study brain tumor detection based on fuzzy C-means with super-resolution and convolutional neural networks with extreme learning machine algorithms SR-FCM-CNN approach has been proposed. The aim of this study has been segmented the tumors in high performance by using Super Resolution Fuzzy-C-Means SR-FCM approach for tumor detection from brain MR images. Afterward feature extraction and pretrained SqueezeNet architecture from convolutional neural network CNN architectures and classification process with extreme learning machine ELM were performed. In the experimental studies it has been determined that brain tumors have been better segmented and removed using SR-FCM method. Using the SquezeeNet architecture features were extracted from a smaller neural network model with fewer parameters. In the proposed method 98.33% accuracy rate has been detected in the diagnosis of segmented brain tumors using SR-FCM. This rate is greater 10% than the rate of recognition of brain tumors segmented with fuzzy C-means FCM without SR.
