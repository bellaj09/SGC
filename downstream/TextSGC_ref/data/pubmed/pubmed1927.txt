"Brocas area is crucially involved in language processing. The sub-regions of Brocas area pars triangularis pars opercularis presumably are connected via corticocortical pathways. However growing evidence suggests that the thalamus may also be involved in language and share some of the linguistic functions supported by Brocas area. Functional connectivity is thought to be achieved via corticothalamic/thalamocortical white matter pathways. Our study investigates structural connectivity between Brocas area and the thalamus specifically ventral anterior nucleus and pulvinar. We demonstrate that Brocas area shares direct connections with these thalamic nuclei and suggest a local Brocas area-thalamus network potentially involved in linguistic processing. Thalamic connectivity with Brocas area may serve to selectively recruit cortical regions storing multimodal features of lexical items and to bind them together during lexical-semantic processing. In addition Brocas area-thalamic circuitry may enable cortico-thalamo-cortical information transfer and modulation between BA 44 and 45 during language comprehension and production."
