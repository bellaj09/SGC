"Cognitive training approaches using virtual environments VEs might counter age-related visuospatial memory decline and associated difficulties in wayfinding. However the effects of the visual design of a VE in route learning are not fully understood. Therefore we created a custom-designed VE optimized for route learning with adjusted levels of realism and highlighted landmark locations MixedVE. Herein we tested participants route recall performance in identifying direction of turn at the intersection with this MixedVE against two baseline alternatives AbstractVE RealisticVE. An older vs. a younger group solved the tasks in two stages immediate vs. delayed recall by one week. Our results demonstrate that the MixedVE facilitates better recall accuracy than the other two VEs for both age groups. Importantly this pattern persists a week later. Additionally our older participants were mostly overconfident in their route recall performance but the MixedVE moderated this potentially detrimental overconfidence. Before the experiment participants clearly preferred the RealisticVE whereas after the experiment most of the younger and many of the older participants preferred the MixedVE. Taken together our findings provide insights into the importance of tailoring visualization design in route learning with VEs. Furthermore we demonstrate the great potential of the MixedVE and by extension of similar VEs as memory training devices for route learning especially for older participants."
