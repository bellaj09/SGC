For large-scale image retrieval hashing has been extensively explored in approximate nearest neighbor search methods due to its low storage and high computational efficiency. With the development of deep learning deep hashing methods have made great progress in image retrieval. Most existing deep hashing methods cannot fully consider the intra-group correlation of hash codes which leads to the correlation decrease problem of similar hash codes and ultimately affects the retrieval results. In this article we propose an end-to-end siamese dilated inception hashing SDIH method that takes full advantage of multi-scale contextual information and category-level semantics to enhance the intra-group correlation of hash codes for hash codes learning. First a novel siamese inception dilated network architecture is presented to generate hash codes with the intra-group correlation enhancement by exploiting multi-scale contextual information and category-level semantics simultaneously. Second we propose a new regularized term which can force the continuous values to approximate discrete values in hash codes learning and eventually reduces the discrepancy between the Hamming distance and the Euclidean distance. Finally experimental results in five public data sets demonstrate that SDIH can outperform other state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.
