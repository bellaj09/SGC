It has been demonstrated that the performance of typical unimodal brain-computer interfaces BCIs can be noticeably improved by combining two different BCI modalities. This so-called "hybrid BCI" technology has been studied for decades; however hybrid BCIs that particularly combine electroencephalography EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS hereafter referred to as hBCIs have not been widely used in practical settings. One of the main reasons why hBCI systems are so unpopular is that their hardware is generally too bulky and complex. Therefore to make hBCIs more appealing it is necessary to implement a lightweight and compact hBCI system with minimal performance degradation. In this study we investigated the feasibility of implementing a compact hBCI system with significantly less EEG channels and fNIRS source-detector SD pairs but that can achieve a classification accuracy high enough to be used in practical BCI applications. EEG and fNIRS data were acquired while participants performed three different mental tasks consisting of mental arithmetic right-hand motor imagery and an idle state. Our analysis results showed that the three mental states could be classified with a fairly high classification accuracy of 77.6  12.1% using an hBCI system with only two EEG channels and two fNIRS SD pairs.
