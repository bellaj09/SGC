Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that results in abnormal blood glucose BG regulations. The BG level is preferably maintained close to normality through self-management practices which involves actively tracking BG levels and taking proper actions including adjusting diet and insulin medications. BG anomalies could be defined as any undesirable reading because of either a precisely known reason normal cause variation or an unknown reason special cause variation to the patient. Recently machine-learning applications have been widely introduced within diabetes research in general and BG anomaly detection in particular. However irrespective of their expanding and increasing popularity there is a lack of up-to-date reviews that materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies for BG anomaly classification and detection in people with diabetes.
