A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity PA is done on sidewalks and streets necessitating the development of a reliable measure of PA performed in these settings. The Block Walk Method BWM is one of the more common approaches for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a nontechnical labor-intensive first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of PA behavior.
