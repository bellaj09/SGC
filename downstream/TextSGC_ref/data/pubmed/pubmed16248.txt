"Child analysis has much to teach us about analytic technique. Children have an innate developmentally driven sense of analytic process. Children in analysis underscore the importance of an understanding and belief in the therapeutic action of play the provisional aspects of play and that not all play will be understood.

Child analysis emphasizes the emergence and integration of dissociated states the negotiation of self-other relationships the importance of co-creation and the childs awareness of the analysts sensibility.
