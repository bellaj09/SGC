During a laparoscopic hernia surgery a preperitoneal mesh is tacked or stapled to the defect on the inside in order to close the fissure created by the hernia. Here we have proposed and implemented a novel technique for simulating the movement and stapling of the mesh for use in a virtual reality based laparoscopic trainer. The use of particle based system and Mass-Spring model in simulating the movement of the mesh is also discussed. Simulation of a preperitoneal mesh in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy.
