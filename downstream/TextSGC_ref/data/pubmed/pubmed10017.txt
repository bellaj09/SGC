"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision utilizing the increased availability of big data and the power of parallel computational units such as graphical processing units. The vast majority of deep learning research is conducted using images as training data however the biomedical domain is rich in physiological signals that are used for diagnosis and prediction problems. It is still an open research question how to best utilize signals to train deep neural networks.In this paper we define the term Signal2Image S2Is as trainable or non-trainable prefix modules that convert signals such as Electroencephalography EEG to image-like representations making them suitable for training image-based deep neural networks defined as `base models. We compare the accuracy and time performance of four S2Is `signal as image spectrogram one and two layer Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs combined with a set of `base models LeNet AlexNet VGGnet ResNet DenseNet along with the depth-wise and 1D variations of the latter. We also provide empirical evidence that the one layer CNN S2I performs better in eleven out of fifteen tested models than non-trainable S2Is for classifying EEG signals and present visual comparisons of the outputs of some of the S2Is."
