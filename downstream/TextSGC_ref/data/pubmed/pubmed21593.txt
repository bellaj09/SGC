Recent studies support the involvement of supraspinal networks in control of bipedal human walking. Part of this evidence encompasses studies including our previous work demonstrating that gait kinematics and limb coordination during treadmill walking can be inferred from the scalp electroencephalogram EEG with reasonably high decoding accuracies. These results provide impetus for development of non-invasive brain-machine-interface BMI systems for use in restoration and/or augmentation of gait- a primary goal of rehabilitation research. To date studies examining EEG decoding of activity during gait have been limited to treadmill walking in a controlled environment. However to be practically viable a BMI system must be applicable for use in everyday locomotor tasks such as over ground walking and turning. Here we present a novel protocol for non-invasive collection of brain activity EEG muscle activity electromyography EMG and whole-body kinematic data head torso and limb trajectories during both treadmill and over ground walking tasks. By collecting these data in the uncontrolled environment insight can be gained regarding the feasibility of decoding unconstrained gait and surface EMG from scalp EEG. Simultaneous scalp electroencephalography EEG electromyography EMG and whole-body segmental inertial recording for multi-modal neural decoding.
