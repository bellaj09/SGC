Virtual Reality VR has been used for some time for training various skills. The results obtained are generally very reassuring suggesting that Virtual Environments VEs are an effective new kind of educational tool. There are some however who argue that there are cases in which a 2D approach would achieve the same training effect. The literature suggests that the key features that distinguish VR from other training approaches is the sense of presence which provides a first-person experience of the world. Usually real world learning is multisensory and gives ownership and control over the experience increases learner motivation and triggers the construction of knowledge. Despite technical limitations a VE is the most effective form of information technology for providing multisensory experience including visual auditory and to some extend haptic and tactile cues. The sense of presence ensures that the perceived experience is interpreted as being real and makes it likely that skills learned in the VE will be transferred to the real world. We argue that for training time-limited decision-making skills the learner should also have an opportunity to reflect on actions/strategies to improve performance. Therefore a virtual environment for training should also provide support for students to reflect on their performance. This paper describes a prototype training system that aims to support both construction of knowledge and cognitive learning. It is also intended to trigger a sense of presence as well as provide support mechanisms not available in the real world that the students can exercise to reflect on the training experience. Presence and reflection in training: support for learning to improve quality decision-making skills under time limitations.
