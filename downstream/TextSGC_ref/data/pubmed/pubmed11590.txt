"Recent applications of artificial intelligence AI and deep learning DL in health care include enhanced diagnostic imaging modalities to support clinical decisions and improve patients outcomes. Focused on using automated DL-based systems to improve point-of-care ultrasound POCUS we look at DL-based automation as a key field in expanding and improving POCUS applications in various clinical settings. A promising additional value would be the ability to automate training model selections for teaching POCUS to medical trainees and novice sonologists. The diversity of POCUS applications and ultrasound equipment each requiring specialized AI models and domain expertise limits the use of DL as a generic solution. In this article we highlight the most advanced potential applications of AI in POCUS tailored to high-yield models in automated image interpretations with the premise of improving the accuracy and efficacy of POCUS scans."
