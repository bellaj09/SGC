Whole brain dynamics intuitively depend upon the internal wiring of the brain; but to which extent the individual structural connectome constrains the corresponding functional connectome is unknown even though its importance is uncontested. After acquiring structural data from individual mice we virtualized their brain networks and simulated in silico functional MRI data. Theoretical results were validated against empirical awake functional MRI data obtained from the same mice. We demonstrate that individual structural connectomes predict the functional organization of individual brains. Using a virtual mouse brain derived from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas we further show that the dominant predictors of individual structure-function relations are the asymmetry and the weights of the structural links. Model predictions were validated experimentally using tracer injections identifying which missing connections not measurable with diffusion MRI are important for whole brain dynamics in the mouse. Individual variations thus define a specific structural fingerprint with direct impact upon the functional organization of individual brains a key feature for personalized medicine. Individual structural features constrain the mouse functional connectome.
