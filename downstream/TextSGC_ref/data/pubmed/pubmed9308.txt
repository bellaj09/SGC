RNA secondary structure prediction is an important issue in structural bioinformatics and RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction represents an NP-hard problem. Recently many different machine-learning methods Markov models and neural networks have been employed for this problem with encouraging results regarding their predictive accuracy; however their performances are usually limited by the requirements of the learning model and over-fitting which requires use of a fixed number of training features. Because most natural biological sequences have variable lengths the sequences have to be truncated before the features are employed by the learning model which not only leads to the loss of information but also destroys biological-sequence integrity.
