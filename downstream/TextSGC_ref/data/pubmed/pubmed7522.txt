"Quality control/assessment of ultrasound US images is an essential step in clinical diagnosis. This process is usually done manually suffering from some drawbacks such as dependence on operators experience and extensive labors as well as high inter- and intra-observer variation. Automatic quality assessment of US images is therefore highly desirable. Fetal US cardiac four-chamber plane CFP is one of the most commonly used cardiac views which was used in the diagnosis of heart anomalies in the early 1980s. In this paper we propose a generic deep learning framework for automatic quality control of fetal US CFPs. The proposed framework consists of three networks: 1 a basic CNN B-CNN roughly classifying four-chamber views from the raw data; 2 a deeper CNN D-CNN determining the gain and zoom of the target images in a multi-task learning manner; and 3 the aggregated residual visual block net ARVBNet detecting the key anatomical structures on a plane. Based on the output of the three networks overall quantitative score of each CFP is obtained so as to achieve fully automatic quality control. Experiments on a fetal US dataset demonstrated our proposed method achieved a highest mean average precision mAP of 93.52% at a fast speed of 101 frames per second FPS. In order to demonstrate the adaptability and generalization capacity the proposed detection network i.e. ARVBNet has also been validated on the PASCAL VOC dataset obtaining a highest mAP of 81.2% when input size is approximately 300  300."
