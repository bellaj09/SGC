In this paper the effectiveness of deep learning for automatic classification of grouper species by their vocalizations has been investigated. In the proposed approach wavelet denoising is used to reduce ambient ocean noise and a deep neural network is then used to classify sounds generated by different species of groupers. Experimental results for four species of groupers show that the proposed approach achieves a classification accuracy of around 90% or above in all of the tested cases a result that is significantly better than the one obtained by a previously reported method for automatic classification of grouper calls. Automatic classification of grouper species by their sounds using deep neural networks.
