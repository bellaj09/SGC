The enhanced electrochemical activity of nanostructured materials is readily exploited in energy devices but their utility in scalable and human-compatible implantable neural interfaces can significantly advance the performance of clinical and research electrodes. We utilize low-temperature selective dealloying to develop scalable and biocompatible one-dimensional platinum nanorod PtNR arrays that exhibit superb electrochemical properties at various length scales stability and biocompatibility for high performance neurotechnologies. PtNR arrays record brain activity with cellular resolution from the cortical surfaces in birds and nonhuman primates. Significantly strong modulation of surface recorded single unit activity by auditory stimuli is demonstrated in European Starling birds as well as the modulation of local field potentials in the visual cortex by light stimuli in a nonhuman primate and responses to electrical stimulation in mice. PtNRs record behaviorally and physiologically relevant neuronal dynamics from the surface of the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution which paves the way for less invasive brain-machine interfaces.
