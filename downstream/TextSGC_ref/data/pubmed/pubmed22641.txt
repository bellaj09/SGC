The objective of this study was to determine whether physical performance during virtual environment VE tasks in the Computer-Assisted Rehabilitation Environment CAREN could differentiate between service members SMs with a history of traumatic brain injury TBI with and without comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. Data were obtained by independent review of clinical notes objective outcomes and validated questionnaires from 214 SMs 208 males with a history of TBI assessed in the CAREN from 2010 to 2015. Three preliminary VEs acclimatized patients to the CAREN: Balance Balls weight shifting on a static platform timed; Balance Cubes step shifting with and without platform motion timed; and Continuous Road flat ambulation self-selected speed. Multiple regression analyses revealed that patients with comorbid TBI-PTSD were significantly slower in completing the VE tasks than patients without PTSD. Logistic regression showed that the Balance Cubes VE without platform motion significantly predicted diagnostic category i.e. no PTSD vs. comorbid PTSD. In conclusion in SMs with a history of TBI physical performance on the CAREN effectively distinguished those with comorbid PTSD as their performance was significantly slower than SMs without PTSD. These results portray the potential of the CAREN as a novel assessment tool in SMs with a history of TBI.
