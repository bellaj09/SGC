We developed a virtual intraoperative surgical photoacoustic microscopy system by combining with a commercial surgical microscope and photoacoustic microscope PAM. By sharing the common optical path in the microscope and PAM system we could acquire the PAM and microscope images simultaneously. Moreover by employing a beam projector to back-project 2D PAM images onto the microscope view plane as augmented reality the conventional microscopic and 2D cross-sectional PAM images are concurrently mapped on the plane via an ocular lens of the microscope in real-time. Further we guided needle insertion into phantom ex vivo and mice skins in vivo. In vivo virtual intraoperative surgical photoacoustic microscopy.
