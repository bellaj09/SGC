Segmentation of thigh muscle and adipose tissue is important for the understanding of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Therefore the purpose of this work is a to evaluate whether a fully automated approach provides accurate segmentation of muscles and adipose tissue cross-sectional areas CSA compared with manual segmentation and b to evaluate the validity of this method based on a previous clinical study. Clinical evaluation of fully automated thigh muscle and adipose tissue segmentation using a U-Net deep learning architecture in context of osteoarthritic knee pain.
