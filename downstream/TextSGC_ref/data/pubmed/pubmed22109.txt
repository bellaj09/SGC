"Virtual and augmented reality surgery calls for reliable and efficient tracking of the surgical instruments in the virtual or real operating theatre. The most diffused approach uses three or more not aligned markers attached to each instrument and surveyed by a set of cameras. However the structure required to carry the markers does modify the instruments mass distribution and can interfere with surgeon movements. To overcome these problems we propose here a new methodology based on structured markers to compute the six degrees of freedom of a surgical instrument. Two markers are attached on the instrument axis and one of them has a stripe painted over its surface. We also introduce a procedure to compute with high accuracy the markers center on the cameras image even when partially occluded by the instruments axis or by other structures. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach. The introduction of structured passive markers can open new possibilities to accurate tracking combining markers detection with real-time image processing."
