Recent progress in deep learning extends the capability of artificial intelligence to various practical tasks making the deep neural network DNN an extremely versatile hypothesis. While such DNN is virtually built on contemporary data centers of the von Neumann architecture physical in part DNN of non-von Neumann architecture also known as neuromorphic computing can remarkably improve learning and inference efficiency. Particularly resistance-based nonvolatile random access memory NVRAM highlights its handy and efficient application to the multiply-accumulate MAC operation in an analog manner. Here an overview is given of the available types of resistance-based NVRAMs and their technological maturity from the material- and device-points of view. Examples within the strategy are subsequently addressed in comparison with their benchmarks virtual DNN in deep learning. A spiking neural network SNN is another type of neural network that is more biologically plausible than the DNN. The successful incorporation of resistance-based NVRAM in SNN-based neuromorphic computing offers an efficient solution to the MAC operation and spike timing-based learning in nature. This strategy is exemplified from a material perspective. Intelligent machines are categorized according to their architecture and learning type. Also the functionality and usefulness of NVRAM-based neuromorphic computing are addressed. Nonvolatile Memory Materials for Neuromorphic Intelligent Machines.
