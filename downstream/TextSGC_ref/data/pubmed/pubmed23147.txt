Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs provide means for communication and control without muscular movement and therefore can offer significant clinical benefits. Electrical brain activity recorded by electroencephalography EEG can be interpreted into software commands by various classification algorithms according to the descriptive features of the signal. In this paper we propose a novel EEG BCI feature extraction method employing EEG source reconstruction and Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns FBCSP based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization JAD. The proposed method is evaluated by the commonly used reference EEG dataset yielding an average classification accuracy of 77.1  10.1 %. It is shown that FBCSP feature extraction applied to reconstructed source components outperforms conventional CSP and FBCSP feature extraction methods applied to signals in the sensor domain.
