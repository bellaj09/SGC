"The nucleus basalis of Meynert nbM was first described at the end of the 19th century and named after its discoverer Theodor Meynert. The nbM contains a large population of cholinergic neurons that project their axons to the entire cortical mantle the olfactory tubercle and the amygdala. It has been functionally associated with the control of attention and maintenance of arousal both key functions for appropriate learning and memory formation. This structure is well-conserved across vertebrates although its degree of organization varies between species. Since early in the investigation of its functional and pathological significance its degeneration has been linked to various major neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance Lewy bodies a hallmark in the diagnosis of Parkinsons disease were originally described in the nbM. Since then its involvement in other Lewy body and dementia-related disorders has been recognized. In the context of recent positive outcomes following nbM deep brain stimulation in subjects with dementia-associated disorders we review the literature from an historical perspective focusing on how the nbM came into focus as a promising therapeutic option for patients with Alzheimers disease. Moreover we will discuss what is needed to further develop and widely implement this approach as well as examine novel medical indications for which nbM deep brain stimulation may prove beneficial."
