"By learning the optimal policy with a double deep Q-learning network DDQN we design ultra-broadband biomimetic perfect absorbers with various materials based the structure of a moths eye. All absorbers achieve over 90% average absorption from 400 to 1600 nm. By training a DDQN with moth-eye structures made up of chromium we transfer the learned knowledge to other similar materials to quickly and efficiently find the optimal parameters from the 1 billion possible options. The knowledge learned from previous optimisations helps the network to find the best solution for a new material in fewer steps dramatically increasing the efficiency of finding designs with ultra-broadband absorption."
