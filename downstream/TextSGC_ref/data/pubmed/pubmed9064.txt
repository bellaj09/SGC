The ballistocardiography BCG signal is a measurement of the vibrations of the center of mass of the body due to the cardiac cycle and can be used for noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring. The seismocardiography SCG signals measure the local vibrations of the chest wall due to the cardiac cycle. While BCG is a more well known modality it requires the use of a modified bathroom scale or a force plate and cannot be measured in a wearable setting whereas SCG signals can be measured using wearable accelerometers placed on the sternum. In this work we explore the idea of finding a mapping between zero mean and unit l2-norm SCG and BCG signal segments such that the BCG signal can be acquired using wearable accelerometers without retaining amplitude information. We use neural networks to find such a mapping and make use of the recently introduced UNet architecture. We trained our models on 26 healthy subjects and tested them on 10 subjects. Our results show that we can estimate the aforementioned segments of the BCG signal with a median Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a median absolute deviation MAD of 0.17. Furthermore our model can estimate the R-I R-J and R-K timing intervals with median absolute errors and MAD of 10.00 8.90 6.00 5.93 and 8.00 5.93 respectively. We show that using all three axis of the SCG accelerometer produces the best results while the head-to-foot SCG signal produces the best results when a single SCG axis is used.
