As restricted resources have seriously limited the computational performance of massive Internet of things IoT devices better processing capability is urgently required. As an innovative technology multi-access edge computing can provide cloudlet capabilities by offloading computation-intensive services from devices to a nearby edge server. This paper proposes an intelligent rapid adaptive offloading IRAO algorithm for a dynamic IoT system to increase overall computational performance and simultaneously keep the fairness of multiple participants which can achieve agile centralized control and solve the joint optimization problems related to offloading policy and resource allocation. For reducing algorithm execution time we apply machine learning methods and construct an adaptive learning-based framework consisting of offloading decision-making radio resource slicing and algorithm parameters updating. In particular the offloading policy can be rapidly derived from an estimation algorithm based on a deep neural network which uses an experience replay training method to improve model accuracy and adopts an asynchronous sampling trick to enhance training convergence performance. Extensive simulations with different parameters are conducted to maintain the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency of the IRAO algorithm. Compared with other candidates the results illustrate that the IRAO algorithm can achieve superior performance in terms of scalability effectiveness and efficiency.
