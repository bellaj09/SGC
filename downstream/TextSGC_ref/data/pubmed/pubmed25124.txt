We proposed a multi-class tactile brain-computer interface that utilizes stimulus-induced oscillatory dynamics. It was hypothesized that somatosensory attention can modulate tactile-induced oscillation changes which can decode different sensation attention tasks. Subjects performed four tactile attention tasks prompted by cues presented in random order and while both wrists were simultaneously stimulated: 1 selective sensation on left hand SS-L; 2 selective sensation on right hand SS-R; 3 bilateral selective sensation; and 4 selective sensation suppressed or idle state SS-S. The classification accuracy between SS-L and SS-R 79.9  8.7% was comparable with that of a previous tactile BCI system based on selective sensation. Moreover the accuracy could be improved to an average of 90.3  4.9% by optimal class-pair and frequency-band selection. Three-class discrimination had an accuracy of 75.2  8.3% with the best discrimination reached for the classes SS-L SS-R and SS-S. Finally four classes were classified with an accuracy of 59.4  7.3%. These results show that the proposed system is a promising new paradigm for multi-class BCI. A Multi-Class Tactile Brain-Computer Interface Based on Stimulus-Induced Oscillatory Dynamics.
