"Despite fast technological developments in virtual reality VR methodologies and guidelines for evaluating the design of virtual environments VEs are lacking. The theory of perceptual opportunities POs has previously been proposed as a basis of such a design methodology. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the effect of representation of POs on users behavior in VEs. The effects of both direction and movement of attractor on choice of objects in a simple VE were studied. Results showed that vertical static attractors were chosen least frequently. Furthermore there was an effect of direction for static attractors in favor of the take-off direction. Implications for VE design in the framework of POs are discussed."
