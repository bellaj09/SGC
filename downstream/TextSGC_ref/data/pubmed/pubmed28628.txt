Two-dimensional movement control is a popular issue in brain-computer interface BCI research and has many applications in the real world. In this paper we introduce a combined control strategy to a binary class-based BCI system that allows the user to move a cursor in a two-dimensional 2D plane. Users focus on a single moving vector to control 2D movement instead of controlling vertical and horizontal movement separately. A binary motor imagery tasks based brain-computer interface for two-dimensional movement control.
