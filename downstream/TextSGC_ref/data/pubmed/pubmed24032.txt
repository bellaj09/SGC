Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy is an effective way to treat lumbar disc herniation. Traditional preoperative planning based on a 2-dimensional method by magnetic resonance/computed tomography may cause inaccuracy of puncture during surgery. We used virtual reality to stimulate a surgery environment and measured relevant 3-dimensional data. We then explored its applicability for increasing puncture accuracy during actual surgeries.
