Colon cancer generally begins as a neoplastic growth of tissue called polyps originating from the inner lining of the colon wall. Most colon polyps are considered harmless but over time they can evolve into colon cancer which when diagnosed in later stages is often fatal. Hence time is of the essence in the early detection of polyps and the prevention of colon cancer.
