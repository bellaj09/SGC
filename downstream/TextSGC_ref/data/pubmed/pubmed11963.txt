Fluorescence lifetime imaging FLI provides unique quantitative information in biomedical and molecular biology studies but relies on complex data-fitting techniques to derive the quantities of interest. Herein we propose a fit-free approach in FLI image formation that is based on deep learning DL to quantify fluorescence decays simultaneously over a whole image and at fast speeds. We report on a deep neural network DNN architecture named fluorescence lifetime imaging network FLI-Net that is designed and trained for different classes of experiments including visible FLI and near-infrared NIR FLI microscopy FLIM and NIR gated macroscopy FLI MFLI. FLI-Net outputs quantitatively the spatially resolved lifetime-based parameters that are typically employed in the field. We validate the utility of the FLI-Net framework by performing quantitative microscopic and preclinical lifetime-based studies across the visible and NIR spectra as well as across the 2 main data acquisition technologies. These results demonstrate that FLI-Net is well suited to accurately quantify complex fluorescence lifetimes in cells and in real time in intact animals without any parameter settings. Hence FLI-Net paves the way to reproducible and quantitative lifetime studies at unprecedented speeds for improved dissemination and impact of FLI in many important biomedical applications ranging from fundamental discoveries in molecular and cellular biology to clinical translation.
