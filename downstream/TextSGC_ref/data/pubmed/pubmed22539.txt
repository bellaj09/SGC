"It is widely acknowledged that the use of general anesthetics can undermine the relevance of electrophysiological or microscopical data obtained from a living animals brain. Moreover the lengthy recovery from anesthesia limits the frequency of repeated recording/imaging episodes in longitudinal studies. Hence new methods that would allow stable recordings from non-anesthetized behaving mice are expected to advance the fields of cellular and cognitive neurosciences. Existing solutions range from mere physical restraint to more sophisticated approaches such as linear and spherical treadmills used in combination with computer-generated virtual reality. Here a novel method is described where a head-fixed mouse can move around an air-lifted mobile homecage and explore its environment under stress-free conditions. This method allows researchers to perform behavioral tests e.g. learning habituation or novel object recognition simultaneously with two-photon microscopic imaging and/or patch-clamp recordings all combined in a single experiment. This video-article describes the use of the awake animal head fixation device mobile homecage demonstrates the procedures of animal habituation and exemplifies a number of possible applications of the method."
