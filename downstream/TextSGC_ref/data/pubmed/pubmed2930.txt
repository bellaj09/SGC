"The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical feedback loops that consist of distinct white matter pathways are important for understanding in vivo imaging studies of functional and anatomical connectivity and for localizing subthalamic white matter structures in surgical approaches for movement disorders such as Parkinsons disease. Connectomic analysis in animals has identified fiber connections between the basal ganglia and thalamus which pass through the fields of Forel where other fiber pathways related to motor sensory and cognitive functions co-exist. We now report these pathways in the human brain on ex vivo mesoscopic 250\xa0m diffusion tensor imaging and on tractography. The locations of the tracts were identified relative to the adjacent gray matter structures such as the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus; the zona incerta; the subthalamic nucleus; the substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta; and the thalamus. The connectome atlas of the human subthalamic region may serve as a resource for imaging studies and for neurosurgical planning."
