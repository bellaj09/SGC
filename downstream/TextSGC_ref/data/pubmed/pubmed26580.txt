"Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis e.g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI or for Mental State Monitoring. While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis ICA to clean EEG data is widespread the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individuals artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts." Automatic classification of artifactual ICA-components for artifact removal in EEG signals.
