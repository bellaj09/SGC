"Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs are systems that establish a direct communication pathway between the users brain activity and external effectors. They offer the potential to improve the quality of life of motor-impaired patients. Motor BCIs aim to permit severely motor-impaired users to regain limb mobility by controlling orthoses or prostheses. In particular motor BCI systems benefit patients if the decoded actions reflect the users intentions with an accuracy that enables them to efficiently interact with their environment. One of the main challenges of BCI systems is to adapt the BCIs signal translation blocks to the user to reach a high decoding accuracy. This paper will review the literature of data-driven and user-specific transducer design and identification approaches and it focuses on internally-paced motor BCIs. In particular continuous kinematic biomimetic and mental-task decoders are reviewed. Furthermore static and dynamic decoding approaches linear and non-linear decoding offline and real-time identification algorithms are considered. The current progress and challenges related to the design of clinical-compatible motor BCI transducers are additionally discussed."
