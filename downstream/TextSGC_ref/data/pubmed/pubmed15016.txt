Severe spinal cord injury SCI leads to skeletal muscle atrophy and adipose tissue infiltration in the skeletal muscle which can result in compromised muscle mechanical output and lead to health-related complications. In this study we developed a novel automatic 3-D approach for volumetric segmentation and quantitative assessment of thigh Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI volumes in individuals with chronic SCI as well as non-disabled individuals. In this framework subcutaneous adipose tissue inter-muscular adipose tissue and total muscle tissue are segmented using linear combination of discrete Gaussians algorithm. Also three thigh muscle groups were segmented utilizing the proposed 3-D Joint Markov Gibbs Random Field model that integrates first order appearance model spatial information and shape model to localize the muscle groups. The accuracy of the automatic segmentation method was tested both on SCI N = 16 and on non-disabled N = 14 individuals showing an overall 0.930.06 accuracy for adipose tissue and muscle compartments segmentation based on Dice Similarity Coefficient. The proposed framework for muscle compartment segmentation showed an overall higher accuracy compared to ANTs and STAPLE two previously validated atlas-based segmentation methods. Also the framework proposed in this study showed similar Dice accuracy and better Hausdorff distance measure to that obtained using DeepMedic Convolutional Neural Network structure a well-known deep learning network for 3-D medical image segmentation. The automatic segmentation method proposed in this study can provide fast and accurate quantification of adipose and muscle tissues which have important health and functional implications in the SCI population. Novel stochastic framework for automatic segmentation of human thigh MRI volumes and its applications in spinal cord injured individuals.
