Experience-dependent plasticity the ability of the brain to constantly adapt to an ever-changing environment has been suggested to be highest during childhood and to decline thereafter. However empirical evidence for this is rather scarce. Slow-wave activity SWA; EEG activity of 1-4.5 Hz during deep sleep can be used as a marker of experience-dependent plasticity. For example performing a visuomotor adaptation task in adults increased SWA during subsequent sleep over a locally restricted region of the right parietal cortex which is known to be involved in visuomotor adaptation. Here we investigated whether local experience-dependent changes in SWA vary as a function of brain maturation. Three age groups children adolescents and adults participated in a high-density EEG study with two conditions baseline and adaptation of a visuomotor learning task. Compared with the baseline condition sleep SWA was increased after visuomotor adaptation in a cluster of eight electrodes over the right parietal cortex. The local boost in SWA was highest in children. Baseline SWA in the parietal cluster and right parietal gray matter volume which both indicate region-specific maturation were significantly correlated with the local increase in SWA. Our findings indicate that processes of brain maturation favor experience-dependent plasticity and determine how sensitive a specific brain region is for learning experiences. Moreover our data confirm that SWA is a highly sensitive tool to map maturational differences in experience-dependent plasticity. Sleep slow-wave activity reveals developmental changes in experience-dependent plasticity.
