Cue reactivity assessments have been widely used to assess craving and attention to cues among cigarette smokers. Cue reactivity has the potential to offer insights into treatment decisions; however the use of cue reactivity in treatment studies has been limited. This study assessed the feasibility of using a virtual reality-based cue reactivity assessment approach VR-NCRAS during treatment. In a clinical smoking cessation treatment study 46 treatment-seeking nicotine-dependent adult smokers were assessed for cue reactivity at baseline Week 4 and Week 10 of treatment. Measures of cue reactivity included subjective craving and attention to cues after exposure to two neutral and two smoking cue environments. Overall feasibility of using VR-NCRAS was demonstrated and these findings support the use of the cue reactivity assessment during treatment which can inform treatment decisions.
