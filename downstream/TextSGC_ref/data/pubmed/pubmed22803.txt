"Motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs allow disabled individuals to control external devices voluntarily helping us to restore lost motor functions. However the number of control commands available in MI-based BCIs remains limited limiting the usability of BCI systems in control applications involving multiple degrees of freedom DOF such as control of a robot arm. To address this problem we developed a novel Morse code-inspired method for MI-based BCI design to increase the number of output commands. Using this method brain activities are modulated by sequences of MI sMI tasks which are constructed by alternately imagining movements of the left or right hand or no motion. The codes of the sMI task was detected from EEG signals and mapped to special commands. According to permutation theory an sMI task with N-length allows 2  2N-1 possible commands with the left and right MI tasks under self-paced conditions. To verify its feasibility the new method was used to construct a six-class BCI system to control the arm of a humanoid robot. Four subjects participated in our experiment and the averaged accuracy of the six-class sMI tasks was 89.4%. The Cohens kappa coefficient and the throughput of our BCI paradigm are 0.88  0.060 and 23.5bits per minute bpm respectively. Furthermore all of the subjects could operate an actual three-joint robot arm to grasp an object in around 49.1s using our approach. These promising results suggest that the Morse code-inspired method could be used in the design of BCIs for multi-DOF control."
