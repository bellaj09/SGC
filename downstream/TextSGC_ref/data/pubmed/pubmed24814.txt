Using electroencephalogram EEG signal to control external devices has always been the research focus in the field of brain-computer interface BCI. This is especially significant for those disabilities who have lost capacity of movements. In this paper the P300-based BCI and the microcontroller-based wireless radio frequency RF technology are utilized to design a smart home control system which can be used to control household appliances lighting system and security devices directly. Experiment results showed that the system was simple reliable and easy to be populirised. Research of controlling of smart home system based on P300 brain-computer interface.
