There is a dearth of empirical evidence about prospective memory remembering to perform actions in the future in stroke patients. A probable reason for this is that it is difficult to perform a realistic and controlled assessment of prospective memory ability in a rehabilitation setting. Virtual reality may provide a solution to this difficulty by allowing prospective memory to be tested in a simulation of a real-life situation whilst retaining a laboratory level of scientific control. This exploratory study assessed the performance of stroke patients and age-matched control participants on event- time- and activity-based prospective memory retrieval tasks in a personal computer-based virtual environment. Stroke patients were severely impaired at the event- and activity-based tasks compared with age-matched controls but only marginally impaired at the time-based task. The additional knowledge gained from this form of assessment could direct rehabilitation more effectively towards specific impairments of individual patients.
