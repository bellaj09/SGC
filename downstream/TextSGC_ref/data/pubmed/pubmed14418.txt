In order to meet the unmet medical needs for effective cancer treatment multifunctional nanocarriers based on iron oxide nanoparticles hold tremendous promise. Here we report a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles based hexa-functional nanosystem for synergistic cancer theranostic applications by offering active tumour targeting accumulation and complementary imaging capability by combining magnetic resonance imaging as well as near-infrared fluorescence magnetophotothermia and chemotherapy. The uniquely designed nanosystem exhibited a paramount increase in the antitumour efficacy through the simultaneous application of multiple thermal effects called magnetophotothermia which outweighed the therapeutic efficacy of the current thermo-chemo therapies or stand-alone therapies. The active tumour-seeking property with prolonged tumour accumulation and complementary imaging capability with improved sensitivity and resolution also augments the therapeutic efficacy of the proposed nanosystem. Additionally the work proposes a deep-learning-based tumour cell nuclei detection technique from H&E stained images in anticipation of providing much inspiration for the future of precision histology.
