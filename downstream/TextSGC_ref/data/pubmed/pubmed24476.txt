Motor imagery MI based brain-computer interface systems BCIs are highly in demand for many real-time applications such as hands and touch-free text entry prosthetic arms virtual reality movement of wheelchairs etc. Traditional sparse representation based classification SRC is a thriving technique in recent years and has been a successful approach for classifying MI EEG signals. To further improve the capability of SRC in this paper a weighted SRC WSRC has been proposed for classifying two-class MI tasks right-hand right-foot. WSRC constructs a weighted dictionary according to the dissimilarity information between the test data and the training samples. Then for the given test data the sparse coefficients are computed over the weighted dictionary using l0-minimization problem. The sparse solution obtained using WSRC gives better discriminative information than SRC and as a consequence WSRC proves to be superior for MI EEG classification. The experimental results substantiate that WSRC is more efficient and accurate than SRC. Weighted sparse representation for classification of motor imagery EEG signals.
