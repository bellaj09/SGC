Brain-machine interfaces BMIs offer the promise of restoring communication enabling control of assistive devices and allowing volitional control of extremities in paralyzed individuals. Working in multidisciplinary teams neurosurgeons can play an invaluable role in the design development and demonstration of novel BMI technology. At the National Institutes of Health the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has a long history of supporting neural engineering and prosthetics efforts including BMI and these research opportunities continue today. The author provides a brief overview of the opportunities and programs currently available to support BMI projects. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke support for brain-machine interface technology.
