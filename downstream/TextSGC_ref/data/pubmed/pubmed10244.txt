Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron AQFP logic is an adiabatic superconductor logic family that has been proposed as a future technology towards building extremely energy-efficient computing systems. In AQFP logic dynamic energy dissipation can be drastically reduced due to the adiabatic switching operations using AC excitation currents which serve as both clock signals and power supplies. As a result AQFP could overcome the power/energy dissipation limitation in conventional superconductor logic families such as rapid-single-flux-quantum RSFQ. Simulation and experimental results show that AQFP logic can achieve an energy-delay-product EDP near quantum limit using practical circuit parameters and available fabrication processes. To shed some light on the design automation and guidelines of AQFP circuits in this paper we present an automatic synthesis framework for AQFP and perform synthesis on 18 circuits including 11 ISCAS-85 circuit benchmarks 6 deep-learning accelerator components and a 32-bit RISC-V ALU based on our developed standard cell library of AQFP technology. Synthesis results demonstrate the significant advantage of AQFP technology. We forecast 9313 25242 and 48466 energy-per-operation advantage compared to the synthesis results of TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 12\u2009nm fin field-effect transistor FinFET 28\u2009nm and 40\u2009nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor CMOS technology nodes respectively.
