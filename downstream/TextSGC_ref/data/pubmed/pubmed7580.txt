The cerebellum with its layered structure and stereotyped and conserved connectivity has long puzzled neurobiologists. While it is well established that the cerebellum functions in regulating balance motor coordination and motor learning how it achieves these end results has not been very clear. Recent technical advances have made it possible to tease apart the contributions of cerebellar cell types to movement in behaving animals. We review these studies focusing on the three major cerebellar cell types namely: granule cells Purkinje neurons and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Further we also review our current understanding of cortico-cerebellar and basal ganglia-cerebellar interactions that play vital roles in motor planning and motor learning. Contributions of the Cerebellum for Predictive and Instructional Control of Movement.
