Dopamine DA neuron projections to the striatum are functionally heterogeneous with diverse behavioral roles. We focus here on DA neuron projections to the nucleus accumbens NAc medial Shell their distinct anatomical and functional connections and discuss their role in motivated behavior. We first review rodent studies showing that a subpopulation of DA neurons in the medial ventral tegmental area VTA project to the NAc medial Shell. Using a combinatorial strategy we show that the majority of DA neurons projecting to the NAc Shell express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 VGLUT2 making them capable of glutamate co-transmission DA-GLU neurons. In the NAc dorsal medial Shell all of the DA neuron terminals arise from DA-GLU neurons while in the lateral NAc Shell DA neuron terminals arise from both DA-GLU neurons and DA-only neurons without VGLUT2. DA-GLU neurons make excitatory connections to the three major cells types spiny projection neurons fast-spiking interneuron and cholinergic interneurons ChIs. The strongest DA-GLU neuron excitatory connections are to ChIs. Photostimulation of DA-GLU neuron terminals in the slice drives ChIs to burst fire. Finally we review studies that address specially the behavioral function of this subpopulation of DA neurons in extinction learning and latent inhibition. Taking into account findings from anatomical and functional connectome studies we propose that DA-GLU neuron connections to ChIs in the medial Shell play a crucial role in switching behavioral responses under circumstances of altered cue-reinforcer contingencies. Dopamine-glutamate neuron projections to the nucleus accumbens medial shell and behavioral switching.
