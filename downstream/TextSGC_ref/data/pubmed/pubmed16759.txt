In recent years head-mounted display technologies have greatly advanced. In order to overcome the accommodation-convergence conflict light field displays reconstruct three-dimensional 3D images with a focusing cue but sacrifice resolution. In this paper a hybrid head-mounted display system that is based on a liquid crystal microlens array is proposed. By using a time-multiplexed method the display signals can be divided into light field and two-dimensional 2D modes to show comfortable 3D images with high resolution compensated by the 2D image. According to the experimental results the prototype supports a 12.28 ppd resolution in the diagonal direction which reaches 82% of the traditional virtual reality VR head-mounted display HMD.
