Single-cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data always involves various unwanted variables which would be able to mask the true signal to identify cell-types. More efficient way of dealing with this issue is to extract low dimension information from high dimensional gene expression data to represent cell-type structure. In the past two years several powerful matrix factorization tools were developed for scRNAseq data such as NMF ZIFA pCMF and ZINB-WaVE. But the existing approaches either are unable to directly model the raw count of scRNAseq data or are really time-consuming when handling a large number of cells e.g. n>500. A fast and efficient count-based matrix factorization method for detecting cell types from single-cell RNAseq data.
