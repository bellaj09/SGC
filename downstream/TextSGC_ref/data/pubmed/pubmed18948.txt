Available literature on medical education charts an emerging trend in the field of anatomy. In the past decade assisted by innovations in informatics and the paradigm shift in medical education the hands-on experience of cadaver dissection has progressively become a relic of the past. Within the context of the situation in Gulf Cooperation Council countries this paper compares the traditional teaching approach with the modern one that tends to emphasise technical gadgetry virtual reality and plastic models rather than hands-on-experience to impart knowledge and skill. However cadaver-based learning is an important building block for the future physician and surgeon since clinical astuteness is likely to rely on skills gained from hands-on experience rather than the tendency to learning through virtual reality found in modern curricula.
