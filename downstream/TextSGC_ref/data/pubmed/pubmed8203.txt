Manually tracing regions of interest ROIs within the liver is the de facto standard method for measuring liver attenuation on computed tomography CT in diagnosing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD. However manual tracing is resource intensive. To address these limitations and to expand the availability of a quantitative CT measure of hepatic steatosis we propose the automatic liver attenuation ROI-based measurement ALARM method for automated liver attenuation estimation. Fully automatic liver attenuation estimation combing CNN segmentation and morphological operations.
