Sleep deprivation SD can degrade cognitive functioning but growing evidence suggests that there are large individual differences in the vulnerability to this effect. Some evidence suggests that baseline differences in the responsiveness of a fronto-parietal attention system that is activated during working memory WM tasks may be associated with the ability to sustain vigilance during sleep deprivation. However the neurocircuitry underlying this network remains virtually unexplored. In this study we employed diffusion tensor imaging DTI to investigate the association between the microstructure of the axonal pathway connecting the frontal and parietal regions--i.e. the superior longitudinal fasciculus SLF--and individual resistance to SD. Thirty healthy participants 15 males aged 20-43 years underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging DTI at rested wakefulness prior to a 28-hour period of SD. Task-related fronto-parietal fMRI activation clusters during a Sternberg WM Task were localized and used as seed regions for probabilistic fiber tractography. DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy mean diffusivity axial and radial diffusivity were measured in the SLF. The psychomotor vigilance test PVT was used to evaluate resistance to SD. We found that activation in the left inferior parietal lobule IPL and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC positively correlated with resistance. Higher fractional anisotropy of the left SLF comprising the primary axons connecting IPL and DLPFC was also associated with better resistance. These findings suggest that individual differences in resistance to SD are associated with the functional responsiveness of a fronto-parietal attention system and the microstructural properties of the axonal interconnections. Microstructure of frontoparietal connections predicts individual resistance to sleep deprivation.
