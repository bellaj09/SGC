The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of brain-computer interface BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation FES training on shoulder subluxation of patients with stroke. Twenty subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the BCI-FES group n\u2009=\u200910 and the FES group n\u2009=\u200910. Patients in the BCI-FES group were administered conventional therapy with the BCI-FES on the shoulder subluxation area of the paretic upper extremity five times per week during 6\u2009weeks while the FES group received conventional therapy with FES only. All patients were assessed for shoulder subluxation vertical distance VD; horizontal distance HD pain visual analogue scale VAS and the Manual Function Test MFT at the time of recruitment to the study and after 6\u2009weeks of the intervention. The BCI-FES group demonstrated significant improvements in VD HD VAS and MFT after the intervention period while the FES group demonstrated significant improvements in HD VAS and MFT. There were also significant differences in the VD and two items shoulder flexion and abduction of the MFT between the two groups. The results of this study suggest that BCI-FES training may be effective in improving shoulder subluxation of patients with stroke by facilitating motor recovery.
