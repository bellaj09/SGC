Several treatments are effective in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. We tested the effectiveness of an experimental intervention that consists of elements from two of these: virtual reality VR exposure therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. The latter is characterized by a dual-task approach: the patient holds a traumatic memory in mind while simultaneously making voluntary eye movements resulting in reduced vividness and emotionality of the traumatic memory. If the experimental intervention is effective it could provide a useful approach for highly avoidant individuals. Dual-tasking during recall of negative memories or during visual perception of images: Effects on vividness and emotionality.
