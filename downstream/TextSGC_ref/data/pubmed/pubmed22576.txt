"Considerable research suggests that cigarette craving is complex with psychological emotional cognitive and behavioral aspects that are inadequately captured by typical craving assessments that focus on level of severity. That is the experience of craving for cigarette smokers remains poorly understood. This study immersed smokers in different virtual reality VR scenarios with and without cigarette cues present collected detailed craving assessments and analyzed the data using a multidimensional analytic approach. Non-treatment-seeking nicotine dependent smokers N=22 experienced two different virtual reality scenarios one with cigarette cues and one without and rated 24 descriptors related to craving. Multidimensional scaling MDS models demonstrate that smokers experience of craving is qualitatively structurally different under VR smoking cue conditions versus neutral conditions. This finding sheds new light on the complexity of craving as well as implications for its measurement." Location and longing: the nicotine craving experience in virtual reality.
