An accurate estimation of PM2.5 fine particulate matters with diameters\u202f\u202f2.5\u202fm concentration is critical for health risk assessment and generating air pollution control strategies. In this study a hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations which integrates Random Forest RF one of machine learning ML models and aerosol optical depth AOD one of remote sensing RS products. The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization of real-time spatiotemporal PM2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships among a large number of meteorological environmental and air pollutant factors as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region BTH region during 2015-2017. Deep Blue DB AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 C_61 aerosol products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS is validated with Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM2.5 concentrations. It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM2.5 and relevant factors such as DB AOD meteorological and air pollutant variables but also can provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during haze periods.
