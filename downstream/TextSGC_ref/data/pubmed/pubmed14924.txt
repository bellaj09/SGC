"Identifying genes associated with Parkinsons disease plays an extremely important role in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsons disease. In recent years based on the guilt-by-association hypothesis many methods have been proposed to predict disease-related genes but few of these methods are designed or used for Parkinsons disease gene prediction. In this paper we propose a novel prediction method for Parkinsons disease gene prediction named N2A-SVM. N2A-SVM includes three parts: extracting features of genes based on network reducing the dimension using deep neural network and predicting Parkinsons disease genes using a machine learning method. The evaluation test shows that N2A-SVM performs better than existing methods. Furthermore we evaluate the significance of each step in the N2A-SVM algorithm and the influence of the hyper-parameters on the result. In addition we train N2A-SVM on the recent dataset and used it to predict Parkinsons disease genes. The predicted top-rank genes can be verified based on literature study."
