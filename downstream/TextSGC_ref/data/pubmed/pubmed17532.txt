"Autism spectrum disorder ASD is categorized by deficits in social communication and interaction alongside repetitive restrictive behaviors or interests RRBIs. Previous research supports the efficacy of virtual reality VR to train a variety of specific skills i.e. riding a bus or crossing the street as well as more complex social skills such as emotion recognition and functional communication. The present reports the implementation of a VR-based air travel functional communication activity in five children diagnosed with ASD. Using an iPhone X and Google Cardboard device researchers delivered the VR intervention once per week for 3 weeks to each participant. During these interventions researchers measured activity completion ability on a 4-point scale. At week 4 all children participated in a real-world air travel rehearsal at the San Diego International Airport. Parents were asked to rate their childs air travel abilities before week 1 and after week 4. All children improved their air travel skills from pre- to postintervention reflected in both the researchers and parents observations. All children navigated the real-world airport under their own power. This preliminary report suggests the efficacy of VR to teach basic air travel skills to young children diagnosed with autism. Clinician observations regarding attention to the VR and strategies for helping participants accept the intervention technique are discussed. Future iterations of this program will require larger sample sizes and more robust clinical measurements-such as communication samples and physiological monitoring."
