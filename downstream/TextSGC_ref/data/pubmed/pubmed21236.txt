"Brain activity associated with attention sustained on the task of safe driving has received considerable attention recently in many neurophysiological studies. Those investigations have also accurately estimated shifts in drivers levels of arousal fatigue and vigilance as evidenced by variations in their task performance by evaluating electroencephalographic EEG changes. However monitoring the neurophysiological activities of automobile drivers poses a major measurement challenge when using a laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. This work presents a novel dry EEG sensor based mobile wireless EEG system referred to herein as Mindo to monitor in real time a drivers vigilance status in order to link the fluctuation of driving performance with changes in brain activities. The proposed Mindo system incorporates the use of a wireless and wearable EEG device to record EEG signals from hairy regions of the driver conveniently. Additionally the proposed system can process EEG recordings and translate them into the vigilance level. The study compares the system performance between different regression models. Moreover the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for online analysis. A case study involving 15 study participants assigned a 90 min sustained-attention driving task in an immersive virtual driving environment demonstrates the reliability of the proposed system. Consistent with previous studies power spectral analysis results confirm that the EEG activities correlate well with the variations in vigilance. Furthermore the proposed system demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the drivers vigilance in real time." Wireless and wearable EEG system for evaluating driver vigilance.
