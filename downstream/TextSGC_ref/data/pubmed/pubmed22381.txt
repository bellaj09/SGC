Psychophysical functions for perceived roughness relating ln magnitude estimate of roughness to ln groove width were obtained for blind and sighted participants in virtual reality using the PHANToM force feedback device. The stimuli were sinusoidal surfaces with groove widths between 0.675 mm and 20.700 mm. Group functions showed a similar nonlinearity to those obtained in physical reality using rigid probes Klatzky Lederman Hamilton Grindley & Swendsen 2003; Lederman Klatzky Hamilton & Ramsay 1999. Individual functions gave a different picture. Of 23 total participants there were 13 with wholly descending linear psychometric functions 7 with quadratic functions similar to the group function and 3 with anomalous functions. Individual power law exponents showed no significant effects of visual status. All analyses gave a power law exponent close to -0.80. The implications for theories of roughness methodologies of data analysis and the design of haptic virtual reality interfaces are considered.
