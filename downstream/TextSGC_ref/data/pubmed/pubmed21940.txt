"Is virtual reality VR already a reality in behavioral health? To answer this question a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders eating and weight disorders and pain management with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience to regulate and control the body in the world effectively the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions concepts and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individuals movements providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this the VR system like the brain maintains a model simulation of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations concepts are embodied simulations and VR is an embodied technology this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body."
