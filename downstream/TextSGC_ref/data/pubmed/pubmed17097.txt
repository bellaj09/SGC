MRI research in multiple sclerosis MS samples reveals pathology in both the cerebral cortex and deep grey matter DGM. The classical subcortical dementia hypothesis has been ascribed to MS and is supported by studies highlighting the role of thalamic atrophy in neuropsychological outcomes. However the importance of mesial temporal lobe MTL atrophy in MS is largely untested and poorly understood. New structural imaging techniques permit volumetric measures of multiple regions within the MTL lobe and DGM.
