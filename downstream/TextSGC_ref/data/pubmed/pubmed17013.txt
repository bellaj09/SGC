Hysteroscopy simulation complements conventional training on patients yet evidence-based recommendations about its implementation and use are lacking. This systematic review analyzes and critically discusses hysteroscopy simulation literature published over the last 30 years. Systematic searches on PubMed Embase PsychINFO ERIC and the Cochrane Library produced 27 original articles published through 2017. Strategies based on different simulation models e.g. animal organs vegetables synthetic uteri virtual reality were evaluated by users and appeared to facilitate learning. Observational studies have suggested a large impact on the knowledge and technical skills of novices for a wide range of hysteroscopic procedures including for diagnosis resection and sterilization. Pretest/posttest studies show large improvements in performance time 6 studies; pooled effect size 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.85 and overall performance scores 4 studies; pooled effect size 3.19; 95% confidence interval 1.45-4.94. Additionally performance assessment on simulated models distinguishes novices from experts. Caution should be exercised because the available evidence largely originates from heterogeneous studies with weak designs conducted in experimental settings with nonclinical participants i.e. medical students. Moreover neither clinical outcomes nor the clinical value of simulation-based assessment has been addressed. Hysteroscopy simulation may be supported ethically and pedagogically but its role should be evaluated in pragmatic contexts with robust interventional studies and broader competence-defining outcomes that include nontechnical skills.
