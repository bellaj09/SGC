"Traditional dysphagia prescreening diagnostic methods require doctors specialists to give patients a total score based on a water swallow test scale. This method is limited by the high dimensionality of the diagnostic elements in the water swallow test scale with heavy workload Towards each patient the scale requires the doctors give score for 18 diagnostic elements respectively as well as the difficulties of extracting and using the diagnostic scale datas non-linear features and hidden expertise information Even with the scale scores specific diagnostic conclusions are still given by expert doctors under the expertise. In this paper a hybrid classifier model based on Nonlinear-Principal Component Analysis NPCA and Deep Belief Networks DBN is proposed in order to effectively extract the diagnostic scale datas nonlinear features and hidden information and to provide the key scale elements locating methods towards the diagnostic results The key scale elements that affect different diagnostic conclusions are given to improve the efficiency and pertinence of diagnosis and reduce the workload of diagnosis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using the frame of information entropy theory. Real dysphagia diagnosis examples from the China-Japanese Friendship Hospital are used to demonstrate applications of the proposed methods. The examples show satisfactory results compared to the traditional classifier." A hybrid classifier based on nonlinear-PCA and deep belief networks with applications in dysphagia diagnosis.
