An extension to multivariate empirical mode decomposition MEMD termed adaptive-projection intrinsically transformed MEMD APIT-MEMD is proposed to cater for power imbalances and inter-channel correlations in real-world multichannel data. It is shown that the APIT-MEMD exhibits similar or better performance than MEMD for a large number of projection vectors whereas it outperforms MEMD for the critical case of a small number of projection vectors within the sifting algorithm. We also employ the noise-assisted APIT-MEMD within our proposed intrinsic multiscale analysis framework and illustrate the advantages of such an approach in notoriously noise-dominated cooperative brain-computer interface BCI based on the steady-state visual evoked potentials and the P300 responses. Finally we show that for a joint cognitive BCI task the proposed intrinsic multiscale analysis framework improves system performance in terms of the information transfer rate.
