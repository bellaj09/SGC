"Neuropeptide signalling has been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes in diverse organisms from invertebrates to humans. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome has at least 154 neuropeptide precursor genes encoding over 300 bioactive peptides. These neuromodulators are thought to largely signal beyond wired chemical/electrical synapse connections therefore creating a wireless network for neuronal communication. Here we investigated how behavioural states are affected by neuropeptide signalling through the G protein-coupled receptor SEB-3 which belongs to a bilaterian family of orphan secretin receptors. Using reverse pharmacology we identified the neuropeptide NLP-49 as a ligand of this evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide receptor. Our findings demonstrate novel roles for NLP-49 and SEB-3 in locomotion arousal and egg-laying. Specifically high-content analysis of locomotor behaviour indicates that seb-3 and nlp-49 deletion mutants cause remarkably similar abnormalities in movement dynamics which are reversed by overexpression of wild-type transgenes. Overexpression of NLP-49 in AVK interneurons leads to heightened locomotor arousal an effect that is dependent on seb-3. Finally seb-3 and nlp-49 mutants also show constitutive egg-laying in liquid medium and alter the temporal pattern of egg-laying in similar ways. Together these results provide in vivo evidence that NLP-49 peptides act through SEB-3 to modulate behaviour and highlight the importance of neuropeptide signalling in the control of behavioural states.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution." Neuropeptides encoded by nlp-49 modulate locomotion arousal and egg-laying behaviours in Caenorhabditis elegans via the receptor SEB-3.
