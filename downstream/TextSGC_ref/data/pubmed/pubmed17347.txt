"To maintain a reliable registration of the virtual world with the real world augmented reality AR applications require highly accurate low-latency tracking of the device. In this paper we propose a novel method for performing this fast 6-DOF head pose tracking using a cluster of rolling shutter cameras. The key idea is that a rolling shutter camera works by capturing the rows of an image in rapid succession essentially acting as a high-frequency 1D image sensor. By integrating multiple rolling shutter cameras on the AR device our tracker is able to perform 6-DOF markerless tracking in a static indoor environment with minimal latency. Compared to state-of-the-art tracking systems this tracking approach performs at significantly higher frequency and it works in generalized environments. To demonstrate the feasibility of our system we present thorough evaluations on synthetically generated data with tracking frequencies reaching 56.7 kHz. We further validate the methods accuracy on real-world images collected from a prototype of our tracking system against ground truth data using standard commodity GoPro cameras capturing at 120 Hz frame rate."
