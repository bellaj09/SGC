Phase contrast X-ray computed tomography PCI-CT has been demonstrated to be effective for visualization of the human cartilage matrix at micrometer resolution thereby capturing osteoarthritis induced changes to chondrocyte organization. This study aims to systematically assess the efficacy of deep transfer learning methods for classifying between healthy and diseased tissue patterns. We extracted features from two different convolutional neural network architectures CaffeNet and Inception-v3 for characterizing such patterns. These features were quantitatively evaluated in a classification task measured by the area AUC under the Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve as well as qualitative visualization through a dimension reduction approach t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding t-SNE. The best classification performance for CaffeNet was observed when using features from the last convolutional layer and the last fully connected layer AUCs >0.91. Meanwhile off-the-shelf features from Inception-v3 produced similar classification performance AUC >0.95. Visualization of features from these layers further confirmed adequate characterization of chondrocyte patterns for reliably distinguishing between healthy and osteoarthritic tissue classes. Such techniques can be potentially used for detecting the presence of osteoarthritis related changes in the human patellar cartilage.
