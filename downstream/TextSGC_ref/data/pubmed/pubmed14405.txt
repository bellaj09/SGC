Quantitative image analysis has deep roots in the usage of positron emission tomography PET in clinical and research settings to address a wide variety of diseases. It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states in oncology cardiology neurology and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging the limitations of the instrumentation used and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metrics that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features radiomics from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large. In this report we summarize recent developments and future tendencies in quantitative PET imaging and present example applications in clinical decision support to illustrate its potential in the context of clinical oncology. Novel Quantitative PET Techniques for Clinical Decision Support in Oncology.
