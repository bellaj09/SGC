"No study has yet assessed the efficacy of virtual reality VR simulation for teaching orthopedic surgery residents. In this blinded randomized and controlled trial we asked if the use of VR simulation improved postgraduate year PGY-1 orthopedic residents performance in cadaver total hip arthroplasty and if the use of VR simulation had a preferentially beneficial effect on specific aspects of surgical skills or knowledge." Virtual Reality Simulation Facilitates Resident Training in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
