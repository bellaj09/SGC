There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex PFC connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the onset anatomical specificity and clinical correlates of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis.
