"The P300 speller is a popular brain-computer interface BCI system that has been investigated as a potential communication alternative for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. To achieve acceptable accuracy levels for communication the system requires repeated data measurements in a given signal condition to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of elicited brain responses. These elicited brain responses which are used as control signals are embedded in noisy electroencephalography EEG data. The discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses defines a users performance with the system. A previous P300 speller model has been proposed to estimate system accuracy given a certain amount of data collection. However the approach was limited to a static stopping algorithm i.e. averaging over a fixed number of measurements and the row-column paradigm. A generalized method that is also applicable to dynamic stopping DS algorithms and other stimulus paradigms is desirable." Using the detectability index to predict P300 speller performance.
