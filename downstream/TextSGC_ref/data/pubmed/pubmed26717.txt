Human subjects can learn to control a one-dimensional electrocorticographic ECoG brain-computer interface BCI using modulation of primary motor M1 high-gamma activity signal power in the 75-200 Hz range. However the stability and dynamics of the signals over the course of new BCI skill acquisition have not been investigated. In this study we report 3 characteristic periods in evolution of the high-gamma control signal during BCI training: initial low task accuracy with corresponding low power modulation in the gamma spectrum followed by a second period of improved task accuracy with increasing average power separation between activity and rest and a final period of high task accuracy with stable or decreasing power separation and decreasing trial-to-trial variance. These findings may have implications in the design and implementation of BCI control algorithms. Neural correlates of learning in an electrocorticographic motor-imagery brain-computer interface.
