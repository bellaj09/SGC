This work proposes principled strategies for self-adaptations in EEG-based Brain-computer interfaces BCIs as a way out of the bandwidth bottleneck resulting from the considerable mismatch between the low-bandwidth interface and the bandwidth-hungry application and a way to enable fluent and intuitive interaction in embodiment systems. The main focus is laid upon inferring the hidden target goals of users while navigating in a remote environment as a basis for possible adaptations. Goal-recognition-based adaptive brain-computer interface for navigating immersive robotic systems.
