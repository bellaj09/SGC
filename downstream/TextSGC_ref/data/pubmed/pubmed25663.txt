Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of lower extremity limb kinematics from noninvasive electroencephalography EEG showing feasibility for development of an EEG-based brain-machine interface BMI to restore mobility following paralysis. Here we present a new technique that preserves the statistical richness of EEG data to classify movement state from time-embedded low frequency EEG signals. We tested this new classifier using cross-validation procedures during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activity in 10 subjects and found decoding accuracy of greater than 95% on average. These results suggest that this classification technique could be used in a BMI system that when combined with a robotic exoskeleton can restore functional movement to individuals with paralysis. Classification of stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand movement from low frequency EEG with locality preserving dimensionality reduction.
