"The present era of precision medicine sees cancer as a consequence of molecular derangements occurring at the commencement of the disease process with morphologic changes happening much later in the process of tumorigenesis. Conventional imaging techniques such as computed tomography CT ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging MRI play an integral role in the detection of disease at a macroscopic level. However molecular functional imaging MFI techniques entail the visualisation and quantification of biochemical and physiological processes occurring during tumorigenesis and thus has the potential to play a key role in heralding the transition from the concept of one size fits all to precision medicine. Integration of MFI with other fields of tumour biology such as genomics has spawned a novel concept called radiogenomics which could serve as an indispensable tool in translational cancer research. With recent advances in medical image processing such as texture analysis deep learning and artificial intelligence AI the future seems promising; however their clinical utility remains unproven at present. Despite the emergence of novel imaging biomarkers a majority of these require validation before clinical translation is possible. In this two-part review we discuss the systematic collaboration across structural anatomical and molecular imaging techniques that constitute MFI. Part\xa0I reviews positron emission tomography radiogenomics AI and optical imaging while part\xa0II reviews MRI CT and ultrasound their current status and recent advances in the field of precision oncology."
