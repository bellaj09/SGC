Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is an indispensable tool in diagnosing brain-tumor patients. Automated tumor segmentation is being widely researched to accelerate the MRI analysis and allow clinicians to precisely plan treatment-accurate delineation of brain tumors is a critical step in assessing their volume shape boundaries and other characteristics. However it is still a very challenging task due to inherent MR data characteristics and high variability e.g. in tumor sizes or shapes. We present a new deep learning approach for accurate brain tumor segmentation which can be trained from small and heterogeneous datasets annotated by a human reader providing high-quality ground-truth segmentation is very costly in practice.
