The integration of the RNST with Med Squadron was the main objective of Exercise Rolling Deep. This objective was achieved most effectively and clearly indicated that should we be required to attend an operational deployment the teams are now much better prepared. The opportunity to experiment with the new surgical equipment was most useful and the experience of living in second line field conditions were both interesting and eye-opening! Med Squadron made a particular effort to make the exercise taxing but enjoyable which was appreciated by us all. In conclusion the most poignant message felt by many was how valuable the senior and more experienced members of the team are. Appreciation must be expressed to those certain few who put so much effort into making the exercise such a valuable learning experience. All-in-all however a highly beneficial exercise to have been allowed to experience--roll on Norway! "Exercise Rolling Deep September 1997: a nurses perspective."
