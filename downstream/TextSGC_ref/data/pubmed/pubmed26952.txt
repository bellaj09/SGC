We have developed a multichannel electrode array-termed Formula: see text-foil-that comprises ultrathin and flexible electrodes protruding from a thin foil at fixed distances. In addition to allowing some of the active sites to reach less compromised tissue the barb-like protrusions that also serves the purpose of anchoring the electrode array into the tissue. This paper is an early evaluation of technical aspects and performance of this electrode array in acute in vitro/in vivo experiments. The interface impedance was reduced by up to two decades by electroplating the active sites with platinum black. The platinum black also allowed for a reduced phase lag for higher frequency components. The distance between the protrusions of the electrode array was tailored to match the architecture of the rat cerebral cortex. In vivo acute measurements confirmed a high signal-to-noise ratio for the neural recordings and no significant crosstalk between recording channels. -Foil Polymer Electrode Array for Intracortical Neural Recordings.
