Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq pred value of 72.71% and an R-sq adjusted value of 86.64% indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq pred is 67.45% which is not very high indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq pred value of 73.32% and an R-sq adjusted value of 79.49% indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier Optimization MOGA-II 2014 four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality and other necessary design attributes.
