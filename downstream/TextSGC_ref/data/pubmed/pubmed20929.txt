In this paper a remote stimulator is developed for rat-robot navigation based on the technique of Brain-Computer-Interface BCI. The stimulator can output constant current from 0 to 1000 A which overcome several shortages of our previous constant voltage stimulator. The constant current stimulator consists of four major components including power supply micro control unit MCU constant current source and bluetooth transceiver for downloading stimulation commands. The stimulator has a weight of about 20 g and size of 32 mm*25 mm*6mm. It has five channels of stimulation which are connected with implanted microelectrodes in rat brain. The electrical parameters were characterized on three rats with different recovery time after brain surgery. Increasing current stimulations were applied on the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray dlPAG area to prove the effect of current stimulation on rat behavior. A remote constant current stimulator designed for rat-robot navigation.
