Advances in three-dimensional 3D video recording and playback have expanded the availability of stereoscopic videos for consumption with specialized televisions computer monitors and virtual reality VR headsets. The built-in stereoscopic vision of the da vinci surgical system Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvale CA enables the recording of both camera views. However medical-grade devices for direct stereoscopic video recording can be cost-prohibitive. We describe methods of producing and viewing 3D videos in transoral robotic surgery TORS without acquisition of dedicated 3D recording equipment. The video output from the left and right cameras of the da Vinci Si endoscope were recorded during a TORS radical tonsillectomy using non-stereoscopic media devices. Raw video was processed using commercially available video-editing software to create stereoscopic videos clips. 3D videos were successfully observed using a low-cost mobile phone VR headset. 3D stereoscopic surgical videos were successfully developed using widely available software applications computer peripherals and mobile devices. The methods described confer significant cost savings when compared to the purchase of specialized recording equipment despite the requirements of time and intermediate computer skills. Future studies will investigate the utility of stereoscopic videos in medical student and resident education.
