Ensemble learning has been proved to improve the generalization ability effectively in both theory and practice. In this paper we briefly outline the current status of research on it first. Then a new deep neural network-based ensemble method that integrates filtering views local views distorted views explicit training implicit training subview prediction and Simple Average is proposed for biomedical time series classification. Finally we validate its effectiveness on the Chinese Cardiovascular Disease Database containing a large number of electrocardiogram recordings. The experimental results show that the proposed method has certain advantages compared to some well-known ensemble methods such as Bagging and AdaBoost.
