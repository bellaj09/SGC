Big data has had a great share in the success of deep learning in computer vision. Recent works suggest that there is significant further potential to increase object detection performance by utilizing even bigger datasets. In this paper we introduce the EuroCity Persons dataset which provides a large number of highly diverse accurate and detailed annotations of pedestrians cyclists and other riders in urban traffic scenes. The images for this dataset were collected on-board a moving vehicle in 31 cities of 12 European countries. With over 238200 person instances manually labeled in over 47300 images EuroCity Persons is nearly one order of magnitude larger than datasets used previously for person detection in traffic scenes. The dataset furthermore contains a large number of person orientation annotations over 211200. We optimize four state-of-the-art deep learning approaches Faster R-CNN R-FCN SSD and YOLOv3 to serve as baselines for the new object detection benchmark. We analyze the generalization capabilities of these detectors when trained with the new dataset. We furthermore study the effect of the training set size the dataset diversity day- vs. night-time geographical region the dataset detail i.e. availability of object orientation information and the annotation quality on the detector performance. Finally we analyze error sources and discuss the road ahead. EuroCity Persons: A Novel Benchmark for Person Detection in Traffic Scenes.
