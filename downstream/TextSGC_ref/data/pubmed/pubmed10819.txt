Over the recent years various research has been conducted to investigate methods for verifying users with a short randomized pass-phrase due to the increasing demand for voice-based authentication systems. In this paper we propose a novel technique for extracting an i-vector-like feature based on an adversarially learned inference ALI model which summarizes the variability within the Gaussian mixture model GMM distribution through a nonlinear process. Analogous to the previously proposed variational autoencoder VAE-based feature extractor the proposed ALI-based model is trained to generate the GMM supervector according to the maximum likelihood criterion given the Baum-Welch statistics of the input utterance. However to prevent the potential loss of information caused by the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL divergence regularization adopted in the VAE-based model training the newly proposed ALI-based feature extractor exploits a joint discriminator to ensure that the generated latent variable and the GMM supervector are more realistic. The proposed framework is compared with the conventional i-vector and VAE-based methods using the TIDIGITS dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method can represent the uncertainty caused by the short duration better than the VAE-based method. Furthermore the proposed approach has shown great performance when applied in association with the standard i-vector framework.
