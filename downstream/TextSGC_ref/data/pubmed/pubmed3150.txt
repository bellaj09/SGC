Neuroimaging studies have identified a variety of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in students experiencing reading difficulties. The present study adopted a novel approach to assess the dynamics of resting-state neuromagnetic recordings in the form of symbolic sequences i.e. repeated patterns of neuromagnetic fluctuations within and/or between sensors. Participants were 25 students experiencing severe reading difficulties RD and 27 age-matched non-impaired readers NI aged 7-14\u202fyears. Sensor-level data were first represented as symbolic sequences in eight conventional frequency bands. Next dominant types of sensor-to-sensor interactions in the form of intra and cross-frequency coupling were computed and subjected to graph modeling to assess group differences in global network characteristics. As a group RD students displayed predominantly within-frequency interactions between neighboring sensors which may reflect reduced overall global network efficiency and cost-efficiency of information transfer. In contrast sensor networks among NI students featured a higher proportion of cross-frequency interactions. Brain-reading achievement associations highlighted the role of left hemisphere temporo-parietal functional networks at rest for reading acquisition and ability.
