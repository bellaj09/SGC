"Bodily self-consciousness BSC refers to experience of ones self as located within an owned body self-identification and as occupying a specific location in space self-location. BSC can be altered through multisensory stimulation as in the Full Body Illusion FBI. If participants view a virtual body from a distance being stroked while receiving synchronous tactile stroking on their physical body they feel as if the virtual body were their own and they experience subjectively to drift toward the virtual body. Here we hypothesized that--while normally the experience of the body in space depends on the integration of multisensory body-related signals within a limited space surrounding the body i.e. peripersonal space PPS--during the FBI the boundaries of PPS would shift toward the virtual body that is toward the position of experienced self-location. To test this hypothesis we used synchronous visuo-tactile stroking to induce the FBI as contrasted with a control condition of asynchronous stroking. Concurrently we applied an audio-tactile interaction paradigm to estimate the boundaries of PPS. PPS was measured in front of and behind the participants body as the distance where tactile information interacted with auditory stimuli looming in space toward the participants physical body. We found that during synchronous stroking i.e. when participants experienced the FBI PPS boundaries extended in the front-space toward the avatar and concurrently shrunk in the back-space as compared to the asynchronous stroking control condition when FBI was induced. These findings support the view that during the FBI PPS boundaries translate toward the virtual body such that the PPS representation shifts from being centered at the location of the physical body to being now centered at the subjectively experienced location of the self." Peripersonal space as the space of the bodily self.
