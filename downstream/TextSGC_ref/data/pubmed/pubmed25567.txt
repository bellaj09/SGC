This study proposes a brain-computer interface BCI system for the recognition of single-trial electroencephalogram EEG data. With the combination of independent component analysis ICA and multiresolution asymmetry ratio a support vector machine SVM is used to classify left and right finger lifting or motor imagery. First ICA and similarity measures are proposed to eliminate the electrooculography EOG artifacts automatically. The features are then extracted from the wavelet data by means of an asymmetry ratio. Finally the SVM classifier is used to discriminate between the features. Compared to the EEG data without EOG artifact removal band power and adoptive autoregressive AAR parameter features the proposed system achieves promising results in BCI applications. Independent component analysis and multiresolution asymmetry ratio for brain-computer interface.
