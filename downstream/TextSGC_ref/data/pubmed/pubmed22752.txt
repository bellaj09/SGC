"Successful interactions within the environment are contingent upon the perceivers ability to perceive the maximum extent over which they can perform actions commonly referred to as action boundaries. Individuals are extremely calibrated to their action boundaries and the perceptual system can quickly and flexibly recalibrate to changes in the size of action boundaries in the event of physiological and/or environmental changes. However because even the most basic motor activities are subject to variability over time the information upon which action boundaries are based must also be subject to variability. In this set of studies we examined the effect of random and systematic variability in reaching experience on the perception of action boundaries for reaching using virtual reality. Participants were asked to estimate their reachability following experience reaching with either a long virtual arm short virtual arm or a virtual arm that varied in size. Overall we found that individuals tended toward liberal estimates of their reachability; however individuals can be influenced to be slightly more conservative after a higher percentage of short reaches. Consequently when anticipating our reaching capability in the event of perceptual motor variability individuals employ a liberal approach as it would result in the highest number of successful attempts.
