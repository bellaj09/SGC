Motor imagery MI based Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs are a viable option for giving locked-in syndrome patients independence and communicability. BCIs comprising expensive medical-grade EEG systems evaluated in carefully-controlled artificial environments are impractical for take-home use. Previous studies evaluated low-cost systems; however performance was suboptimal or inconclusive. Here we evaluated a low-cost EEG system OpenBCI in a natural environment and leveraged neurofeedback deep learning and wider temporal windows to improve performance. $\\mu-$rhythm data collected over the sensorimotor cortex from healthy participants performing relaxation and right-handed MI tasks were used to train a multi-layer perceptron binary classifier using deep learning. We showed that our method outperforms previous OpenBCI MI-based BCIs thereby extending the BCI capabilities of this low-cost device. A Robust Low-Cost EEG Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interface.
