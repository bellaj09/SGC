Visual saliency on stereoscopic 3D S3D images has been shown to be heavily influenced by image quality. Hence this dependency is an important factor in image quality prediction image restoration and discomfort reduction but it is still very difficult to predict such a nonlinear relation in images. In addition most algorithms specialized in detecting visual saliency on pristine images may unsurprisingly fail when facing distorted images. In this paper we investigate a deep learning scheme named Deep Visual Saliency DeepVS to achieve a more accurate and reliable saliency predictor even in the presence of distortions. Since visual saliency is influenced by low-level features contrast luminance and depth information from a psychophysical point of view we propose seven low-level features derived from S3D image pairs and utilize them in the context of deep learning to detect visual attention adaptively to human perception. During analysis it turns out that the low-level features play a role to extract distortion and saliency information. To construct saliency predictors we weight and model the human visual saliency through two different network architectures a regression and a fully convolutional neural networks CNNs. Our results from thorough experiments confirm that the predicted saliency maps are up to 70 % correlated with human gaze patterns which emphasize the need for the hand-crafted features as input to deep neural networks in S3D saliency detection.
