With biomedical research transitioning into data-rich science machine learning provides a powerful toolkit for extracting knowledge from large-scale biological data sets. The increasing availability of comprehensive kidney omics compendia transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics and genome sequencing as well as other data modalities such as electronic health records digital nephropathology repositories and radiology renal images makes machine learning approaches increasingly essential for analyzing human kidney data sets. Here we discuss how machine learning approaches can be applied to the study of kidney disease with a particular focus on how they can be used for understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Machine learning the kidney and genotype-phenotype analysis.
