Resting-state functional connectivity rsFC is widely used to examine cerebral functional organization. The ventral striatum VS is critical to motivated behavior with extant studies suggesting functional hemispheric asymmetry. The current work investigated differences in rsFC between the left L and right R VS and explored gender differences in the extent of functional lateralization. In 106 adults we computed a laterality index fcLI to query whether a target region shows greater or less connectivity to the L vs R VS. A total of 45 target regions with hemispheric masks were examined from the Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas. One-sample t test was performed to explore significant laterality in the whole sample and in men and women separately. Two-sample t test was performed to examine gender differences in fcLI. At a corrected threshold p\u2009<\u20090.05/45\u2009=\u20090.0011 the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex dmPFC and posterior cingulate cortex pCC showed L lateralization and the intraparietal sulcus IPS and supramarginal gyrus SMG showed R lateralization in VS connectivity. Except for the pCC these findings were replicated in a different data set n\u2009=\u200997 from the Human Connectome Project. Furthermore the fcLI of VS-pCC was negatively correlated with a novelty seeking trait in women but not in men. Together the findings may suggest a more important role of the L VS in linking saliency response to self control and other internally directed processes. Right lateralization of VS connectivity to the SMG and IPS may support attention and action directed to external behavioral contingencies.
