To test whether paired-play will induce longer path length and ranges of movement of the center of pressure COP which reflects on balance performance and stability compared to solo-play and to test the difference in the path length and ranges of movement of the COP while playing the virtual reality VR game with the dominant hand compared to playing it with the nondominant hand. Comparison of Path Length and Ranges of Movement of the Center of Pressure and Reaction Time and Between Paired-Play and Solo-Play of a Virtual Reality Game.
