Annotation of surgical activities becomes increasingly important for many recent applications such as surgical workflow analysis surgical situation awareness and the design of the operating room of the future especially to train machine learning methods in order to develop intelligent assistance. Currently annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper we propose a way to eliminate or at least limit the human intervention in the annotation process. Automatic annotation of surgical activities using virtual reality environments.
