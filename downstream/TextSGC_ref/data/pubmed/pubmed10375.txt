"Recently online health expert question-answering HQA services systems have attracted more and more health consumers to ask health-related questions everywhere at any time due to the convenience and effectiveness. However the quality of answers in existing HQA systems varies in different situations. It is significant to provide effective tools to automatically determine the quality of the answers. Two main characteristics in HQA systems raise the difficulties of classification: 1 physicians answers in an HQA system are usually written in short text which yields the data sparsity issue; 2 HQA systems apply the quality control mechanism which refrains the wisdom of crowd. The important information such as the best answer and the number of users votes is missing. To tackle these issues we prepare the first HQA research data set labeled by three medical experts in 90days and formulate the problem of predicting the quality of answers in the system as a classification task. We not only incorporate the standard textual feature of answers but also introduce a set of unique non-textual features i.e. the popular used surface linguistic features and the novel social features from other modalities. A multimodal deep belief network DBN-based learning framework is then proposed to learn the high-level hidden semantic representations of answers from both textual features and non-textual features while the learned joint representation is fed into popular classifiers to determine the quality of answers. Finally we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of including the non-textual features and the proposed multimodal deep learning framework."
