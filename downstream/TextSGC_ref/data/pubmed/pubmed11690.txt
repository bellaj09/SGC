Although deep learning approaches have had tremendous success in image video and audio processing computer vision and speech recognition their applications to three-dimensional 3D biomolecular structural data sets have been hindered by the geometric and biological complexity. To address this problem we introduce the element-specific persistent homology ESPH method. ESPH represents 3D complex geometry by one-dimensional 1D topological invariants and retains important biological information via a multichannel image-like representation. This representation reveals hidden structure-function relationships in biomolecules. We further integrate ESPH and deep convolutional neural networks to construct a multichannel topological neural network TopologyNet for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and protein stability changes upon mutation. To overcome the deep learning limitations from small and noisy training sets we propose a multi-task multichannel topological convolutional neural network MM-TCNN. We demonstrate that TopologyNet outperforms the latest methods in the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities mutation induced globular protein folding free energy changes and mutation induced membrane protein folding free energy changes.
