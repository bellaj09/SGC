The incidence of skin tumors has steadily increased. Although most are benign and do not affect survival some of the more malignant skin tumors present a lethal threat if a delay in diagnosis permits them to become advanced. Ideally an inspection by an expert dermatologist would accurately detect malignant skin tumors in the early stage; however it is not practical for every single patient to receive intensive screening by dermatologists. To overcome this issue many studies are ongoing to develop dermatologist-level computer-aided diagnostics. Whereas many systems that can classify dermoscopic images at this dermatologist-equivalent level have been reported a much fewer number of systems that can classify conventional clinical images have been reported thus far. Recently the introduction of deep-learning technology a method that automatically extracts a set of representative features for further classification has dramatically improved classification efficacy. This new technology has the potential to improve the computer classification accuracy of conventional clinical images to the level of skilled dermatologists. In this review this new technology and present development of computer-aided skin tumor classifiers will be summarized. The Possibility of Deep Learning-Based Computer-Aided Skin Tumor Classifiers.
