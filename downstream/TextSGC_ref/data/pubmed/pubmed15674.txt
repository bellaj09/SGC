"Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the effect of indoor horseback riding and virtual reality exercises on the dynamic balance ability of normal adults. Subjects This study enrolled 24 normal adults and divided them into two groups: an indoor horseback riding exercise group IHREG n = 12 and a virtual reality exercise group VREG n = 12. Methods IHREG exercised on indoor horseback riding equipment and VREG exercised using the Nintendo Wii Fit three times a week for six weeks. The Biodex Balance System was used to analyze dynamic balance as measured by the overall stability index OSI anteroposterior stability index APSI and mediolateral stability index MLSI. Results In the within-group comparison IHREG and VERG both showed significant decreases in the dynamic balance indexes of OSI APSI and MLSI after the intervention but no significant difference was found between the groups. Conclusion Both indoor horseback riding and virtual reality exercises were effective at improving the subjects dynamic balance ability as measured by OSI APSI and MLSI and can be used as additional exercises for patients with conditions affecting postural control."
