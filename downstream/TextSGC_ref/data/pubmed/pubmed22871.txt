This study describes the analysis of hand preshaping using Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA to predict hand formation during reaching and grasping tasks of the hemiparetic hand following a series of upper extremity motor intervention treatments. The purpose of this study is to use classification of hand posture as an additional tool for evaluating the effectiveness of therapies for upper extremity rehabilitation such as virtual reality VR therapy and conventional physical therapy. Classification error for discriminating between two objects during hand preshaping is obtained for the hemiparetic and unimpaired hands pre and post training. Classification of hand preshaping in persons with stroke using Linear Discriminant Analysis.
