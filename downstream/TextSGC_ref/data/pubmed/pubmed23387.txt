Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies have identified specific neural patterns related to three different categories of movements: intransitive i.e. meaningful gestures that do not include the use of objects transitive i.e. actions involving an object and tool-mediated i.e. actions involving a tool to interact with an object. However fMRI intrinsically limits the exploitation of these results in a real scenario such as a brain-machine interface. In this paper we propose a new approach to automatically predict intransitive transitive or tool-mediated movements of the upper limb using electroencephalography EEG spectra estimated during a motor planning phase. To this end high-resolution EEG data gathered from 33 healthy subjects were used as input of a three-class k-nearest neighbors classifier. Different combinations of EEG-derived spatial and frequency information were investigated to find the most accurate feature vector. In addition we studied gender differences further splitting the dataset into only-male data and only-female data. A remarkable difference was found between accuracies achieved with male and female data the latter yielding the best performance 78.55% of accuracy for the prediction of intransitive transitive and tool-mediated actions. These results potentially suggest that different gender-based models should be employed for the future BMI applications.
