Flexible neuromorphic electronics that emulate biological neuronal systems constitute a promising candidate for next-generation wearable computing soft robotics and neuroprosthetics. For realization with the achievement of simple synaptic behaviors in a single device the construction of artificial synapses with various functions of sensing and responding and integrated systems to mimic complicated computing sensing and responding in biological systems is a prerequisite. Artificial synapses that have learning ability can perceive and react to events in the real world; these abilities expand the neuromorphic applications toward health monitoring and cybernetic devices in the future Internet of Things. To demonstrate the flexible neuromorphic systems successfully it is essential to develop artificial synapses and nerves replicating the functionalities of the biological counterparts and satisfying the requirements for constructing the elements and the integrated systems such as flexibility low power consumption high-density integration and biocompatibility. Here the progress of flexible neuromorphic electronics is addressed from basic backgrounds including synaptic characteristics device structures and mechanisms of artificial synapses and nerves to applications for computing soft robotics and neuroprosthetics. Finally future research directions toward wearable artificial neuromorphic systems are suggested for this emerging area.
