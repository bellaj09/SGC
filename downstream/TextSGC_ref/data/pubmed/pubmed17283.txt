Vehicle analysis involves license-plate recognition LPR vehicle-type classification VTC and vehicle make and model recognition MMR. Among these tasks MMR plays an important complementary role in respect to LPR. In this paper we propose a novel framework for MMR using local tiled deep networks. The frontal views of vehicle images are first extracted and fed into the local tiled deep networks for training and testing. A local tiled convolutional neural network LTCNN is proposed to alter the weight sharing scheme of CNN with local tiled structure. The LTCNN unties the weights of adjacent units and then ties the units k steps from each other within a local map. This architecture provides the translational rotational and scale invariance as well as locality. In addition to further deal with the colour and illumination variation we applied the histogram oriented gradient HOG to the frontal view of images prior to the LTCNN. The experimental results show that our LTCNN framework achieved a 98% accuracy rate in terms of vehicle MMR. Local Tiled Deep Networks for Recognition of Vehicle Make and Model.
