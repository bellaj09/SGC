"Experts explanations have been shown to better enhance novices transfer as compared with advanced students explanations. Based on research on expertise and text comprehension we investigated whether the abstractness or the cohesion of experts and intermediates explanations accounted for novices learning. In Study 1 we showed that the superior cohesion of experts explanations accounted for most of novices transfer whereas the degree of abstractness did not impact novices transfer performance. In Study 2 we investigated novices processing while learning with experts and intermediates explanations. We found that novices studying experts explanations actively self-regulated their processing of the explanations as they showed mainly deep-processing activities whereas novices learning with intermediates explanations were mainly engaged in shallow-processing activities by paraphrasing the explanations. Thus we concluded that subject-matter expertise is a crucial prerequisite for instructors. Despite the abstract character of experts explanations their subject-matter expertise enables them to generate highly cohesive explanations that serve as a valuable scaffold for students construction of flexible knowledge by engaging them in deep-level processing." "Bothered by abstractness or engaged by cohesion? Experts explanations enhance novices deep-learning."
