Sitting ability and function are commonly impaired after stroke. Balance training has been shown to be helpful but abundant repetitions are required for optimal recovery and patients must be motivated to perform rehabilitation exercises repeatedly to maximize treatment intensity. Virtual reality training VRT which allows patients to interact with a virtual environment using computer software and hardware is enjoyable and may encourage greater repetition of therapeutic exercises. However the potential for VRT to promote sitting balance has not yet been explored. The objective of this study is to determine if supplemental VRT-based sitting balance exercises improve sitting balance ability and function in stroke rehabilitation inpatients. Does the addition of virtual reality training to a standard program of inpatient rehabilitation improve sitting balance ability and function after stroke?
