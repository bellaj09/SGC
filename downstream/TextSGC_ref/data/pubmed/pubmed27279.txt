With advances in brain-computer interface BCI research a portable few- or single-channel BCI system has become necessary. Most recent BCI studies have demonstrated that the common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is a powerful tool in extracting features for multiple-class motor imagery. However since the CSP algorithm requires multi-channel information it is not suitable for a few- or single-channel system. In this study we applied a short-time Fourier transform to decompose a single-channel electroencephalography signal into the time-frequency domain and construct multi-channel information. Using the reconstructed data the CSP was combined with a support vector machine to obtain high classification accuracies from channels of both the sensorimotor and forehead areas. These results suggest that motor imagery can be detected with a single channel not only from the traditional sensorimotor area but also from the forehead area.
