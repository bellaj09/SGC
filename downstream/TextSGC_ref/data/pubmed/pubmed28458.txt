There is a step of significant difficulty experienced by brain-computer interface BCI users when going from the calibration recording to the feedback application. This effect has been previously studied and a supervised adaptation solution has been proposed. In this paper we suggest a simple unsupervised adaptation method of the linear discriminant analysis LDA classifier that effectively solves this problem by counteracting the harmful effect of nonclass-related nonstationarities in electroencephalography EEG during BCI sessions performed with motor imagery tasks. For this we first introduce three types of adaptation procedures and investigate them in an offline study with 19 datasets. Then we select one of the proposed methods and analyze it further. The chosen classifier is offline tested in data from 80 healthy users and four high spinal cord injury patients. Finally for the first time in BCI literature we apply this unsupervised classifier in online experiments. Additionally we show that its performance is significantly better than the state-of-the-art supervised approach. Toward unsupervised adaptation of LDA for brain-computer interfaces.
