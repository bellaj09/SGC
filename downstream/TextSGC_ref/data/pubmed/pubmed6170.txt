Early diagnosis of schizophrenia could improve the outcomes and limit the negative effects of untreated illness. Although participants with schizophrenia show aberrant functional connectivity in brain networks these between-group differences have a limited diagnostic utility. Novel methods of magnetic resonance imaging MRI analyses such as machine learning ML may help bring neuroimaging from the bench to the bedside. Here we used ML to differentiate participants with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder FES from healthy controls based on resting-state functional connectivity rsFC. Connectivity of the anterior insula differentiates participants with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders from controls: a machine-learning study.
