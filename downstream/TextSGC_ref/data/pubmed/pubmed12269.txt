The stance and swing phases of the gait cycle are defined by foot strike FS and foot off FO. Accurate determination of these events is thus an essential component of 3D motion recordings processing. Several methods have been developed for the automatic detection of these events based on the heuristics of 3D marker position velocity and acceleration however the results may be inaccurate due to the high variability that is intrinsic to pathological gait. For this reason gait events are still commonly determined manually which is a tedious process. Here we propose a new application DeepEvent of a long short term memory recurrent neural network for the automatic detection of gait events. The 3D position and velocity of the markers on the heel toe and lateral malleolus were used by the network to determine FS and FO. The method was developed from 10526 FS and 9375 FO from 226 children. DeepEvent predicted FS within 5.5\u202fms and FO within 10.7\u202fms of the gold standard automatic determination using force platform data and was more accurate than common heuristic marker trajectory-based methods proposed in the literature and another deep learning method. A sensitivity analysis showed that DeepEvent mainly used the toe and heel markers z-axis longitudinal position and velocity at the beginning and end of gait cycle to predict FS and the toe marker x-axis anterior/posterior velocity and z-axis position and velocity at around 60% of the gait cycle to predict FO. A new deep learning-based method for the detection of gait events in children with gait disorders: Proof-of-concept and concurrent validity.
