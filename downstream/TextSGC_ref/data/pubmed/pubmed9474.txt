Quantitative SPECT/CT is potentially useful for more accurate and reliable measurement of glomerular filtration rate GFR than conventional planar scintigraphy. However manual drawing of a volume of interest VOI on renal parenchyma in CT images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. The aim of this study is to develop a fully automated GFR quantification method based on a deep learning approach to the 3D segmentation of kidney parenchyma in CT. We automatically segmented the kidneys in CT images using the proposed method with remarkably high Dice similarity coefficient relative to the manual segmentation mean\u2009=\u20090.89. The GFR values derived using manual and automatic segmentation methods were strongly correlated R2\u2009=\u20090.96. The absolute difference between the individual GFR values using manual and automatic methods was only 2.90%. Moreover the two segmentation methods had comparable performance in the urolithiasis patients and kidney donors. Furthermore both segmentation modalities showed significantly decreased individual GFR in symptomatic kidneys compared with the normal or asymptomatic kidney groups. The proposed approach enables fast and accurate GFR measurement. Measurement of Glomerular Filtration Rate using Quantitative SPECT/CT and Deep-learning-based Kidney Segmentation.
