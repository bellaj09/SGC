"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of virtual reality VR technology on balance and gait in patients with Parkinsons disease PD. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study design was a single-blinded randomized controlled study. Twenty-eight patients with PD were randomly divided into the experimental group n=14 and the control group n=14. The experimental group received VR training and the control group received conventional physical therapy. Patients performed 45 minutes per session 5 days a week for 12 weeks. Individuals were assessed pre- and post-rehabilitation with the Berg Balance Scale BBS Timed Up and Go Test TUGT Third Part of Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS3 and Functional Gait Assessment FGA. RESULTS After treatment BBS TUGT and FGA scores had improved significantly in both groups P<0.05. However there was no significant difference in the UPDRS3 between the pre- and post-rehabilitation data of the control group P>0.05. VR training resulted in significantly better performance compared with the conventional physical therapy group P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that 12 weeks of VR rehabilitation resulted in a greater improvement in the balance and gait of individuals with PD when compared to conventional physical therapy."
