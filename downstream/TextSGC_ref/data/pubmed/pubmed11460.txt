Intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT is commonly employed for treating head and neck H&N cancer with uniform tumor dose and conformal critical organ sparing. Accurate delineation of organs-at-risk OARs on H&N CT images is thus essential to treatment quality. Manual contouring used in current clinical practice is tedious time-consuming and can produce inconsistent results. Existing automated segmentation methods are challenged by the substantial inter-patient anatomical variation and low CT soft tissue contrast. To overcome the challenges we developed a novel automated H&N OARs segmentation method that combines a fully convolutional neural network FCNN with a shape representation model SRM. Fully automatic multi-organ segmentation for head and neck cancer radiotherapy using shape representation model constrained fully convolutional neural networks.
