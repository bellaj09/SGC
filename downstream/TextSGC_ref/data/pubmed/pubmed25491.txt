Previous studies have suggested that the dysfunction of the human mirror neuron system hMNS plays an important role in the autism spectrum disorder ASD. In this work we propose a novel training program from our interdisciplinary research to improve mirror neuron functions of autistic individuals by using a BCI system with virtual reality technology. It is a promising approach for the autism to learn and develop social communications in a VR environment. A test method for this hypothesis is also provided. Mirror neural training induced by virtual reality in brain-computer interfaces may provide a promising approach for the autism therapy.
