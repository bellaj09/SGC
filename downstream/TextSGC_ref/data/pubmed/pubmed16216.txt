"Sixty-one acute and 17 chronic vascular left-hemisphere damaged patients were tested with five memory tasks that investigated verbal short-term digit span and long-term paired-associate and story learning memory and spatial short- and long-term memory Corsis span and learning. Both brain-damaged groups were significantly impaired in all memory tasks except for chronic patients in the story learning task compared to normal controls. The presence of aphasia and locus of lesion anterior posterior and deep had no effect on the memory impairment with only one exception of paired-associate learning that was better performed by non-aphasic than aphasic patients. Eleven subjects were better at paired-associate learning than story recall the reverse dissociation was never found. Finally chronic patients performed significantly better than acute patients only in the Corsis learning task." Memory and aphasia.
