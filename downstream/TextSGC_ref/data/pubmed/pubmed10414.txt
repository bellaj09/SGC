Aims: Some hypoglycemic therapies are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated the incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes using antidiabetic drugs from three classes which were sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors SGLT-2is glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists GLP-1RAs and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors DPP-4is.Materials and methods: We compared the risk of myocardial infarction MI among these drugs and developed a machine learning model for predicting MI in patients without prior heart disease. We analyzed US health plan data for patients without prior MI or insulin therapy who were aged 40 years at initial prescription and had not received oral antidiabetic drugs for 6 months previously. After developing a machine learning model to predict MI proportional hazards analysis of MI incidence was conducted using the risk obtained with this model and the drug classes as explanatory variables.Results: We analyzed 199116 patients mean age: years comprising 110278 58.6 prescribed DPP-4is 43538 55.1 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 45300 55.3 prescribed SGLT-2is. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed higher precision of machine learning over logistic regression analysis. Proportional hazards analysis by machine learning revealed a significantly lower risk of MI with SGLT-2is or GLP-1RAs than DPP-4is hazard ratio: 0.81 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.91 p = .0004 vs. 0.63 0.56-0.72 p < .0001. MI risk was also significantly lower with GLP-1RAs than SGLT-2is 0.77 0.66-0.90 p = .001.Limitations: All patients analyzed were covered by US commercial health plans so information on patients aged 65 years was limited and the socioeconomic background may have been biased. Also the observation period differed among the three classes of drugs due to differing release dates.Conclusions: Machine learning analysis suggested the risk of MI was 37% lower for type 2 diabetes patients without prior MI using GLP-1RAs versus DPP-4is while the risk was 19% lower for SGLT-2is versus DPP-4is.
