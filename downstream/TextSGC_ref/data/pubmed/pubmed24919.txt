The local field potential LFP has recently been widely used in brain computer interfaces BCI. Here we used power of LFP recorded from area MT of a macaque monkey to decode where the animal covertly attended. Support vector machines SVM were used to learn the pattern of power at different frequencies for attention to two possible positions. We found that LFP power at both low <9 Hz and high 31-120 Hz frequencies contains sufficient information to decode the focus of attention. Highest decoding performance was found for gamma frequencies 31-120 Hz and reached 82%. In contrast low frequencies <9 Hz could help the classifier reach a higher decoding performance with a smaller amount of training data. Consequently we suggest that low frequency LFP can provide fast but coarse information regarding the focus of attention while higher frequencies of the LFP deliver more accurate but less timely information about the focus of attention.
