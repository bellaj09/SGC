Deep learning models for prediction of three key LC-MS/MS properties from peptide sequences were developed. The LC-MS/MS properties or behaviors are indexed retention times iRT MS1 or survey scan charge state distributions and sequence ion intensities of HCD spectra. A common core deep supervised learning architecture bidirectional long-short term memory LSTM recurrent neural networks was used to construct the three prediction models. Two featurization schemes were proposed and demonstrated to allow for efficient encoding of modifications. The iRT and charge state distribution models were trained with on order of 105 data points each. An HCD sequence ion prediction model was trained with 2  106 experimental spectra. The iRT prediction model and HCD sequence ion prediction model provide improved accuracies over the start-of-the-art models available in literature. The MS1 charge state distribution prediction model offers excellent performance. The prediction models can be used to enhance peptide identification and quantification in data-dependent acquisition and data-independent acquisition DIA experiments as well as to assist MRM multiple reaction monitoring and PRM parallel reaction monitoring experiment design.
