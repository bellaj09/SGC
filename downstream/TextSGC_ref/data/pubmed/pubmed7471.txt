"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN has shown clinical potential for relieving the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinsons disease. While accurate localization of the STN is critical for consistent across-patients effective DBS clear visualization of the STN under standard clinical MR protocols is still challenging. Therefore intraoperative microelectrode recordings MER are incorporated to accurately localize the STN. However MER require significant neurosurgical expertise and lengthen the surgery time. Recent advances in 7 T MR technology facilitate the ability to clearly visualize the STN. The vast majority of centers however still do not have 7 T MRI systems and fewer have the ability to collect and analyze the data. This work introduces an automatic STN localization framework based on standard clinical MRIs without additional cost in the current DBS planning protocol. Our approach benefits from a large database of 7 T MRI and its clinical MRI pairs. We first model in the 7 T database using efficient machine learning algorithms the spatial and geometric dependency between the STN and its adjacent structures predictors. Given a standard clinical MRI our method automatically computes the predictors and uses the learned information to predict the patient-specific STN. We validate our proposed method on clinical T2 W MRI of 80 subjects comparing with experts-segmented STNs from the corresponding 7 T MRI pairs. The experimental results show that our framework provides more accurate and robust patient-specific STN localization than using state-of-the-art atlases. We also demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the proposed technique assessing the post-operative electrode active contact locations."
