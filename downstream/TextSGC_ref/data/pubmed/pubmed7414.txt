The purpose of this work is to introduce a novel deep learning strategy to obtain highly accurate dose plan by transforming from a dose distribution calculated using a low-cost algorithm or algorithmic settings. 25\u2009168 slices of dose distribution are calculated using Eclipse treatment planning system V15.6 Varian Medical Systems Palo Alto CA on ten patient CTs whose treatment sites ranging from lung brain abdomen and pelvis with a grid size of 1.25\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20091.25\u2009\u2009\u2009\u20091.25\u2009mm using both anisotropic analytical algorithm AAA in 5\u2009mm resolution and Acuros XB algorithm AXB in 1.25\u2009mm resolution. The AAA dose slices and the corresponding down sampled CT slices are combined to form a tensor with a size of 2\u2009\u2009\u2009\u200964\u2009\u2009\u2009\u200964 working as the input to the deep learning-based dose calculation network deep DoseNet which outputs the calculated Acuros dose with a size of 256\u2009\u2009\u2009\u2009256. The deep DoseNet DDN consists of a feature extraction component and an upscaling part. The DDN converges after ~100 epochs with a learning rate of Formula: see text using ADAM. We compared up sampled AAA dose and DDN output with that of AXB. For the evaluation set the average mean-square-error decreased from 4.7\u2009\u2009\u2009\u2009Formula: see text between AAA and AXB to 7.0\u2009\u2009\u2009\u200910-5 between DDN and AXB with an average improvement of ~12 times. The average Gamma index passing rate at 3mm3% improved from 76% between AAA and AXB to 91% between DDN and AXB. The average calculation time is less than 1\u2009ms for a single slice on a NVIDIA DGX workstation. DDN trained with a large amount of dosimetric data can be employed as a general-purpose dose calculation acceleration engine across various dose calculation algorithms.
