We have developed a haptic virtual reality system for dental skill training. In this study we examined several kinds of kinematic information about the movement provided by the system supplement knowledge of results KR in dental skill acquisition. The kinematic variables examined involved force utilization F and mirror view M. This created three experimental conditions that received augmented kinematic feedback F M FM and one control condition that did not KR-only. Thirty-two dental students were randomly assigned to four groups. Their task was to perform access opening on the upper first molar with the haptic virtual reality system. An acquisition session consisted of two days of ten trials of practice in which augmented kinematic feedback was provided for the appropriate experimental conditions after each trial. One week after a retention test consisting of two trials without augmented feedback was completed. The results showed that the augmented kinematic feedback groups had larger mean performance scores than the KR-only group in Day 1 of the acquisition and retention sessions ANOVA p<0.05. The apparent differences among feedback groups were not significant in Day 2 of the acquisition session ANOVA p>0.05. The trends in acquisition and retention sessions suggest that the augmented kinematic feedback can enhance the performance earlier in the skill acquisition and retention sessions.
