There have been increasing studies demonstrating that emotion processing in humans is realized by the interaction within or among the large-scale intrinsic functional brain networks. Identifying those meaningful intrinsic functional networks based on task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging task fMRI with specific emotional stimuli and responses and exploring the underlying functional working mechanisms of interregional neural communication within the intrinsic functional networks are thus of great importance to understand the neural basis of emotion processing. In this paper we propose a novel cortical folding pattern-guided model of intrinsic networks in emotion processing: gyri serve as global functional connection centers that perform interregional neural communication among distinct regions via long distance dense axonal fibers and sulci serve as local functional units that directly communicate with neighboring gyri via short distance fibers and indirectly communicate with other distinct regions via the neighboring gyri. We test the proposed model by adopting a computational framework of dictionary learning and sparse representation of emotion task fMRI data of 68 subjects in the publicly released Human Connectome Project. The proposed model provides novel insights of functional mechanisms in emotion processing. A Cortical Folding Pattern-Guided Model of Intrinsic Functional Brain Networks in Emotion Processing.
