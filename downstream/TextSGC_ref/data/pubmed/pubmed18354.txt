"In this paper we propose PPAP an augmented reality platform with an actuated projector for dynamic user-perspective projection. In PPAP a stationary camera is used jointly with a pan-tilt motorized projector-camera unit. With the servo control of the steerable pan-tilt system the system is able to continuously orient itself to match the users view center of the projection-mapped surface. This provides users with greatly widened viewing angles in the augmented scene when compared to the stationary projection. Through user studies in which users judged the size and distance of a projected virtual object we verified that the perspective projection with the actuated projector helps users better understand the spatial relationship of the virtual object in the augmented scene in terms of depth perception."
