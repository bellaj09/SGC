High-frequency band HFB activity measured using implanted sensors over the cortex is increasingly considered as a feature for the study of brain function and the design of neural-implants such as Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs. One common way of extracting these power signals is using a wavelet dictionary which involves the selection of different temporal sampling and temporal smoothing parameters such that the resulting HFB signal best represents the temporal features of the neuronal event of interest. Typically the use of neuro-electrical signals for closed-loop BCI control requires a certain level of signal downsampling and smoothing in order to remove uncorrelated noise optimize performance and provide fast feedback. However a fixed setting of the sampling and smoothing parameters may lead to a suboptimal representation of the underlying neural responses and poor BCI control. This problem can be resolved with a systematic assessment of parameter settings. Optimization of sampling rate and smoothing improves classification of high frequency power in electrocorticographic brain signals.
