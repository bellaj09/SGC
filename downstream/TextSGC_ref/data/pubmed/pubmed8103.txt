The present study used a deep learning model recurrent neural network for testing: i whether social determinants are major determinants of the association among cerebrovascular disease hearing loss and cognitive impairment in a middle-aged or older population hypothesis\u20091; and ii whether the association among the three diseases is very strong in the middle-aged or older population hypothesis\u20092.
