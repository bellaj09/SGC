"Brain function is thought to become less specialized with age. However this view is largely based on findings of increased activation during tasks that fail to separate task-related processes e.g. attention decision making from the cognitive process under examination. Here we take a systems-level approach to separate processes specific to language comprehension from those related to general task demands and to examine age differences in functional connectivity both within and between those systems. A large population-based sample N = 111; 22-87 years from the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience Cam-CAN was scanned using functional MRI during two versions of an experiment: a natural listening version in which participants simply listened to spoken sentences and an explicit task version in which they rated the acceptability of the same sentences. Independent components analysis across the combined data from both versions showed that although task-free language comprehension activates only the auditory and frontotemporal FTN syntax networks performing a simple task with the same sentences recruits several additional networks. Remarkably functionality of the critical FTN is maintained across age groups showing no difference in within-network connectivity or responsivity to syntactic processing demands despite gray matter loss and reduced connectivity to task-related networks. We found no evidence for reduced specialization or compensation with age. Overt task performance was maintained across the lifespan and performance in older but not younger adults related to crystallized knowledge suggesting that decreased between-network connectivity may be compensated for by older adults richer knowledge base."
