"The specificity and sensitivity of resting state functional MRI rs-fMRI measurements depend on preprocessing choices such as the parcellation scheme used to define regions of interest ROIs. In this study we critically evaluate the effect of brain parcellations on machine learning models applied to rs-fMRI data. Our experiments reveal an intriguing trend: On average models with stochastic parcellations consistently perform as well as models with widely used atlases at the same spatial scale. We thus propose an ensemble learning strategy to combine the predictions from models trained on connectivity data extracted using different e.g. stochastic parcellations. We further present an implementation of our ensemble learning strategy with a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network CNN approach. The proposed CNN approach takes advantage of the full-resolution 3D spatial structure of rs-fMRI data and fits non-linear predictive models. Our ensemble CNN framework overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning models for connectomes that often rely on region-based summary statistics and/or linear models. We showcase our approach on a classification autism patients versus healthy controls and a regression problem prediction of subjects age and report promising results."
