Aging is accompanied by changes in neurotransmission. To advance our understanding of how aging modifies specific neural circuitries we examined serotonergic and cholinergic stimulation with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging RS-fMRI in young and older adults. The instant response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram 30\u202fmg and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine 8\u202fmg was measured in 12 young and 17 older volunteers during a randomized double blind placebo-controlled crossover study. A powerful dataset consisting of 522 RS-fMRI scans was obtained by acquiring multiple scans per subject before and after drug administration. Group\u202f\u202ftreatment interaction effects on voxelwise connectivity with ten functional networks were investigated p\u202f<\u202f.05 FWE-corrected using a non-parametric multivariate analysis technique with cerebrospinal fluid white matter heart rate and baseline measurements as covariates. Both groups showed a decrease in sensorimotor network connectivity after citalopram administration. The comparable findings after citalopram intake are possibly due to relatively similar serotonergic systems in the young and older subjects. Galantamine altered connectivity between the occipital visual network and regions that are implicated in learning and memory in the young subjects. The lack of a cholinergic response in the elderly might relate to the well-known association between cognitive and cholinergic deterioration at older age.
