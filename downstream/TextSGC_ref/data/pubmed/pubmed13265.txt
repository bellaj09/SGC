As a large amount of genetic data are accumulated an effective analytical method and a significant interpretation are required. Recently various methods of machine learning have emerged to process genetic data. In addition machine learning analysis tools using statistical models have been proposed. In this study we propose adding an integrated layer to the deep learning structure which would enable the effective analysis of genetic data and the discovery of significant biomarkers of diseases. We conducted a simulation study in order to compare the proposed method with metalogistic regression and meta-SVM methods. The objective function with lasso penalty is used for parameter estimation and the Youden J index is used for model comparison. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is more robust for the variance of the data than metalogistic regression and meta-SVM methods. We also conducted real data breast cancer data TCGA analysis. Based on the results of gene set enrichment analysis we obtained that TCGA multiple omics data involve significantly enriched pathways which contain information related to breast cancer. Therefore it is expected that the proposed method will be helpful to discover biomarkers. Integrative Deep Learning for Identifying Differentially Expressed DE Biomarkers.
