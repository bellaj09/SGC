360-degree video streaming for high-quality virtual reality VR is challenging for current wireless systems because of the huge bandwidth it requires. However millimeter wave mmWave communications in the 60 GHz band has gained considerable interest from the industry and academia because it promises gigabit wireless connectivity in the huge unlicensed bandwidth i.e. up to 7 GHz. This massive unlicensed bandwidth offers great potential for addressing the demand for 360-degree video streaming. This paper investigates the problem of 360-degree video streaming for mobile VR using the SHVC the scalable of High-Efficiency Video Coding HEVC standard and PC offloading over 60 GHz networks. We present a conceptual architecture based on advanced tiled-SHVC and mmWave communications. This architecture comprises two main parts. 1 Tile-based SHVC for 360-degree video streaming and optimizing parallel decoding. 2 Personal Computer PC offloading mechanism for transmitting uncompressed video viewport only. The experimental results show that our tiled extractor method reduces the bandwidth required for 360-degree video streaming by more than 47% and the tile partitioning mechanism was improved by up to 25% in terms of the decoding time. The PC offloading mechanism was also successful in offloading 360-degree decoded or viewport only video to mobile devices using mmWave communication and the proposed transmission schemes.
