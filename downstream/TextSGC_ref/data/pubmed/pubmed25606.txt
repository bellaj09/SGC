Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments but also by patients and end-users controlling applications in their homes or clinics without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications - like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots - requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train nave end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications? Transferring brain-computer interfaces beyond the laboratory: successful application control for motor-disabled users.
