"People with Parkinsons disease PD commonly experience postural instability resulting in poor balance and an increased risk of falls. Exercise-based video gaming exergaming is a form of physical training that is delivered through virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is efficacious in improving balance in aged populations. In addition studies have shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation a-tDCS when applied to the primary motor cortex can augment motor learning when combined with physical training. However no studies have investigated the combined effects of exergaming and tDCS on balance in people with PD."
