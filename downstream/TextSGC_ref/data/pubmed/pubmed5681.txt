The high resolution multi-shell diffusion MRI dMRI data from the Human Connectome Project HCP provides a great opportunity to map fine-grained fiber pathways in human brainstem but the severe susceptibility-induced distortion around the brainstem poses a significant challenge. While the correction tools used in the HCP Pipeline greatly reduce the distortion artifacts in the preprocessed data significant residual distortions are still widely present especially in the brainstem region. One fundamental reason is that the topup tool used in the HCP Pipeline only relies on the B0 images which lack sufficient contrast about white matter pathways to estimate the distortion displacement between opposite phase encodings PEs. To fully utilize the rich information of HCP data that includes dMRI data from two opposite PEs we compute the fiber orientation distributions FODs from the data of each PE and propose a novel method to estimate and correct the residual distortion using FOD-based registration. Using the dMRI data of 94 HCP subjects we show quantitatively that our method can reduce the misalignment of main fiber direction in the brainstem by 21% as compared to the topup tool used in the HCP Pipeline. Our method is fully compatible with the HCP Pipeline and thus can be readily integrated with it to enhance distortion correction in connectome imaging research.
