Work hour restrictions and current quality financial and legal concerns have reduced resident operative volume and autonomy. Although laboratory cadaveric or animal dissection has a rich history in neurosurgery its current role in resident training is unclear. Recent literature suggests educators have looked to simulation to accelerate the learning curve of acquiring neurosurgical technical skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence characteristics and extent of laboratory dissection in neurosurgical residency programs in the United States. The role of laboratory dissection training in neurosurgical residency: results of a national survey.
