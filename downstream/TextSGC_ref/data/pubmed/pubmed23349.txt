Virtual reality training is considered as an effective intervention method of stroke patients and the virtual reality system for therapeutic rehabilitation has emphasized the cognitive factors to improve walking function. The purpose of current study was to investigate the effect of virtual reality training with cognitive load VRTCL on walking function of chronic stroke. Chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to the VRTCL group 11 patients including 5 men; mean age 60.0 years; post-stroke duration 273.9 days or control group 11 patients including 2 men; mean age 58.6 years; post-stroke duration 263.9 days. All subjects participated in the standard rehabilitation program that consisted of physical and occupational therapies. In addition VRTCL group participated in the VRTCL for 4 weeks 30 min per day and five times a week while those in the control group participated in virtual reality treadmill training. Walking function under single walking alone and dual task walking with cognitive tasks conditions was assessed using an electrical walkway system. After the 4-week intervention under both single and dual task conditions significant improvement on walking function was observed in VRTCL and control groups P < 0.05. In addition in the dual task condition greater improvement on walking function was observed in the VRTCL group compared with the control group P < 0.05. These findings demonstrated the efficacy of VRTCL on the walking function under the dual task condition. Therefore we suggest that VRTCL may be an effective method for the achievement of independent walking in chronic stroke patients.
