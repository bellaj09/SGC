An immersive virtual environment for viewing and interacting with three-dimensional representations of medical image data is presented. Using a newly developed automatic segmentation method a segmented object e.g. tumor or organ can also be viewed in the context of the original patient data. Real time interaction is established using joystick movements and button presses on a wireless gamepad. Several open-source platforms have been utilized such as DCMTK for processing of DICOM formatted data Coin3D for scenegraph management SimVoleon for volume rendering and VRJuggler to handle the immersive visualization. The application allows the user to manipulate representations with features such as fast pseudo-coloring to highlight details of the patient data windowing to select a range of tissue densities for display and multiple clipping planes to allow the user to slice into the patient. A framework for interactive examination of automatic segmented tumors in a virtual environment.
