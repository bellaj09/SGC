Visual realism is defined as the extent to which an image appears to people as a photo rather than computer generated. Assessing visual realism is important in applications like computer graphics rendering and photo retouching. However current realism evaluation approaches use either labor-intensive human judgments or automated algorithms largely dependent on comparing renderings to reference images. We develop a reference-free computational framework for visual realism prediction to overcome these constraints. First we construct a benchmark dataset of 2520 images with comprehensive human annotated attributes. From statistical modeling on this data we identify image attributes most relevant for visual realism. We propose both empirically-based guided by our statistical modeling of human data and deep convolutional neural network models to predict visual realism of images. Our framework has the following advantages: 1 it creates an interpretable and concise empirical model that characterizes human perception of visual realism; 2 it links computational features to latent factors of human image perception.
