Brain-computer interface BCI systems allow users to communicate with the external world by recognizing the brain activity without the assistance of the peripheral motor nervous system. P300-based BCI is one of the most common used BCI systems that can obtain high classification accuracy and information transfer rate ITR. Face stimuli can result in large event-related potentials and improve the performance of P300-based BCI. However previous studies on face stimuli focused mainly on the effect of various face types i.e. face expression face familiarity and multifaces on the BCI performance. Studies on the influence of face transparency differences are scarce. Therefore we investigated the effect of semitransparent face pattern STF-P the subject could see the target character when the stimuli were flashed and traditional face pattern F-P the subject could not see the target character when the stimuli were flashed on the BCI performance from the transparency perspective. Results showed that STF-P obtained significantly higher classification accuracy and ITR than those of F-P p < 0.05. Comparison of the BCI Performance between the Semitransparent Face Pattern and the Traditional Face Pattern.
