Mobile devices wearables and Internet-of-Things are crammed into smaller form factors and batteries yet they encounter demanding applications such as big data analysis data mining machine learning augmented reality and virtual reality. To meet such high demands in the multi-device ecology multiple devices should communicate collectively to share computation burdens and stay energy-efficient. In this paper we present a cross-device computation coordination method for scenarios of mobile collocated interactions with wearables. We formally define a cross-device computation coordination problem and propose a method for solving this problem. Lastly we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through experiments and exemplar cases using 12 commercial Android devices with varying computation capabilities.
