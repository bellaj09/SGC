Advances in Virtual Reality VR technologies allow the investigation of simulated moral actions in visually immersive environments. Using a robotic manipulandum and an interactive sculpture we now also incorporate realistic haptic feedback into virtual moral simulations. In two experiments we found that participants responded with greater utilitarian actions in virtual and haptic environments when compared to traditional questionnaire assessments of moral judgments. In experiment one when\xa0incorporating a robotic manipulandum we found that the physical power of simulated utilitarian responses calculated as the product of force and speed was predicted by individual levels of psychopathy. In experiment two which integrated an interactive and life-like sculpture of a human into a VR simulation greater utilitarian actions continued to be observed. Together these results support a disparity between simulated moral action and moral judgment. Overall this research combines state-of-the-art virtual reality robotic movement simulations and realistic human sculptures to enhance moral paradigms that are often contextually impoverished. As such this combination provides a better assessment of simulated moral action and illustrates the embodied nature of morally-relevant actions.
