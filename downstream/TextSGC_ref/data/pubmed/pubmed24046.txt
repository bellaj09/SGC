Effective common spatial pattern CSP feature extraction for motor imagery MI electroencephalogram EEG recordings usually depends on the filter band selection to a large extent. Subband optimization has been suggested to enhance classification accuracy of MI. Accordingly this study introduces a new method that implements sparse Bayesian learning of frequency bands named SBLFB from EEG for MI classification. CSP features are extracted on a set of signals that are generated by a filter bank with multiple overlapping subbands from raw EEG data. Sparse Bayesian learning is then exploited to implement selection of significant features with a linear discriminant criterion for classification. The effectiveness of SBLFB is demonstrated on the BCI Competition IV IIb dataset in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the SBLFB method is promising for development of an effective classifier to improve MI classification.
