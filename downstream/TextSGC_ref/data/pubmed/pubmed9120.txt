Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that leads to irreversible vision loss. Most of the existing automatic screening methods first segment the main structure and subsequently calculate the clinical measurement for the detection and screening of glaucoma. However these measurement-based methods rely heavily on the segmentation accuracy and ignore various visual features. In this paper we introduce a deep learning technique to gain additional image-relevant information and screen glaucoma from the fundus image directly. Specifically a novel disc-aware ensemble network for automatic glaucoma screening is proposed which integrates the deep hierarchical context of the global fundus image and the local optic disc region. Four deep streams on different levels and modules are respectively considered as global image stream segmentation-guided network local disc region stream and disc polar transformation stream. Finally the output probabilities of different streams are fused as the final screening result. The experiments on two glaucoma data sets SCES and new SINDI data sets show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.
