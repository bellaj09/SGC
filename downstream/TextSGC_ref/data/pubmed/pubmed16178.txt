"Effective facilitation has been identified in the literature as one of three elements along with context and evidence that have a dynamic and coexisting relationship to enable the successful uptake of evidence into practice. This paper presents an overview of the concept of facilitation within the context of practice development ahead of a personal and professional reflective account of a developing facilitator. In the summer of 2001 the author was instrumental in organising the first Practice Development School in Melbourne. Thrown in at the deep end she found herself co-facilitating with an experienced practice developer from the United Kingdom. Having never facilitated in the arena of an action learning group nor worked in the field of practice development there was initially a sense of impending overload and drowning in the new knowledge and skills that needed to be acquired. Drawing upon the work of narrative inquiry the author shares her experiences in the anticipation that in telling her story it will assist others in their journey of becoming a facilitator."
