Burst-suppression BS is an electroencephalography EEG pattern consisting of alternant periods of slow waves of high amplitude burst and periods of so called flat EEG suppression. It is generally associated with coma of various etiologies hypoxia drug-related intoxication hypothermia and childhood encephalopathies but also anesthesia. Animal studies suggest that both the cortex and the thalamus are involved in the generation of BS. However very little is known about mechanisms of BS in humans. The aim of this study was to identify the neuronal network underlying both burst and suppression phases using source reconstruction and analysis of functional and effective connectivity in EEG.
