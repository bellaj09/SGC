While machine learning has been making enormous strides in many technical areas it is still massively underused in transmission electron microscopy. To address this a convolutional neural network model was developed for reliable classification of crystal structures from small numbers of electron images and diffraction patterns with no preferred orientation. Diffraction data containing 571340 individual crystals divided among seven families 32 genera and 230 space groups were used to train the network. Despite the highly imbalanced dataset the network narrows down the space groups to the top two with over 70% confidence in the worst case and up to 95% in the common cases. As examples we benchmarked against alloys to two-dimensional materials to cross-validate our deep-learning model against high-resolution transmission electron images and diffraction patterns. We present this result both as a research tool and deep-learning application for diffraction analysis.
