"According to the survey on various health centres smart log-based multi access physical monitoring system determines the health conditions of humans and their associated problems present in their lifestyle. At present deficiency in significant nutrients leads to deterioration of organs which creates various health problems particularly for infants children and adults. Due to the importance of a multi access physical monitoring system children and adolescents physical activities should be continuously monitored for eliminating difficulties in their life using a smart environment system. Nowadays in real-time necessity on multi access physical monitoring systems information requirements and the effective diagnosis of health condition is the challenging task in practice. In this research wearable smart-log patch with Internet of Things IoT sensors has been designed and developed with multimedia technology. Further the data computation in that smart-log patch has been analysed using edge computing on Bayesian deep learning network EC-BDLN which helps to infer and identify various physical data collected from the humans in an accurate manner to monitor their physical activities. Then the efficiency of this wearable IoT system with multimedia technology is evaluated using experimental results and discussed in terms of accuracy efficiency mean residual error delay and less energy consumption. This state-of-the-art smart-log patch is considered as one of evolutionary research in health checking of multi access physical monitoring systems with multimedia technology."
