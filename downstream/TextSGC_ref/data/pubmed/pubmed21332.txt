"Patients with schizophrenia have thinking disorders such as delusions or hallucinations because they have a deficit in the ability to systematize and integrate information. Therefore they cannot integrate or systematize visual auditory and tactile stimuli. The multimodal integration model of the brain can provide a theoretical background from which one can approach multimodal stimulus integration. In this study we suggest a virtual reality system for the multi-modal assessment of cognitive ability of schizophrenia patients. The virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli such as visual and auditory stimuli to the patient and can evaluate the patients multimodal integration and working memory integration abilities by making the patient interpret and react to multimodal stimuli which must be remembered for a given period of time. The clinical study showed that the virtual reality program developed is comparable to those of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test WCST and the Standard Progressive Matrices SPM and it provides some information related to the schizophrenic patients behavior in 3D virtual environment."
