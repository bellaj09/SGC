"We present the results from a qualitative and quantitative user study comparing fishtank virtual-reality VR and CAVE displays. The results of the qualitative study show that users preferred the fishtank VR display to the CAVE system for our scientific visualization application because of perceived higher resolution brightness and crispness of imagery and comfort of use. The results of the quantitative study show that users performed an abstract visual search task significantly more quickly and more accurately on the fishtank VR display system than in the CAVE. The same study also showed that visual context had no significant effect on task performance for either of the platforms. We suggest that fishtank VR displays are more effective than CAVEs for applications in which the task occurs outside the users reference frame the user views and manipulates the virtual world from the outside in and the size of the virtual object that the user interacts with is smaller than the users body and fits into the fishtank VR display. The results of both studies support this proposition." CAVE and fishtank virtual-reality displays: a qualitative and quantitative comparison.
