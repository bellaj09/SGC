Brain science accelerates the study of intelligence and behavior contributes fundamental insights into human cognition and offers prospective treatments for brain disease. Faced with the challenges posed by imaging technologies and deep learning computational models big data and high-performance computing HPC play essential roles in studying brain function brain diseases and large-scale brain models or connectomes. We review the driving forces behind big data and HPC methods applied to brain science including deep learning powerful data analysis capabilities and computational performance solutions each of which can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy and research output. This work reinforces predictions that big data and HPC will continue to improve brain science by making ultrahigh-performance analysis possible by improving data standardization and sharing and by providing new neuromorphic insights.
