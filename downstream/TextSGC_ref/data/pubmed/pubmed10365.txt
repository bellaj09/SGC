Surgical cancer resection requires an accurate and timely diagnosis of the cancer margins in order to achieve successful patient remission. Hyperspectral imaging HSI has emerged as a useful noncontact technique for acquiring spectral and optical properties of tissue. A convolutional neural network CNN classifier is developed to classify excised squamous-cell carcinoma thyroid cancer and normal head and neck tissue samples using HSI. The CNN classification was validated by the manual annotation of a pathologist specialized in head and neck cancer. The preliminary results of 50 patients indicate the potential of HSI and deep learning for automatic tissue-labeling of surgical specimens of head and neck patients. Deep convolutional neural networks for classifying head and neck cancer using hyperspectral imaging.
