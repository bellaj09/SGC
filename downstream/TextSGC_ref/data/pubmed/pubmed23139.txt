Andreeva Bay in northwest Russia hosts one of the former coastal technical bases of the Northern Fleet. Currently this base is designated as the Andreeva Bay branch of Northwest Center for Radioactive Waste Management SevRAO and is a site of temporary storage STS for spent nuclear fuel SNF and other radiological waste generated during the operation and decommissioning of nuclear submarines and ships. According to an integrated expert evaluation this site is the most dangerous nuclear facility in northwest Russia. Environmental rehabilitation of the site is currently in progress and is supported by strong international collaboration. This paper describes how the optimization principle ALARA has been adopted during the planning of remediation work at the Andreeva Bay STS and how Russian-Norwegian collaboration greatly contributed to ensuring the development and maintenance of a high level safety culture during this process. More specifically this paper describes how integration of a system specifically designed for improving the radiological safety of workers during the remediation work at Andreeva Bay was developed in Russia. It also outlines the 3D radiological simulation and virtual reality based systems developed in Norway that have greatly facilitated effective implementation of the ALARA principle through supporting radiological characterisation work planning and optimization decision making communication between teams and with the authorities and training of field operators. 3D simulation as a tool for improving the safety culture during remediation work at Andreeva Bay.
