Zherlock is an open source software that provides state-of-the-art data analysis tools to the user in an intuitive and flexible way. It is a front-end to different numerical "engines" to produce a seamless integration of algorithms written in different computer languages. Of particular interest is creating an interface to high-level scientific languages such as Octave a Matlab clone and R an S-PLUS clone to enable efficient porting of new data analytical methods. Zherlock uses advanced scientific visualization tools in 2-D and 3-D and has been extended to work on virtual reality VR systems. Central to Zherlock is a visual programming environment VPE which enables diagram based programming. These diagrams consist of nodes and connection lines where each node is an operator or a method and lines describe the flow of data between nodes. A VPE is chosen for Zherlock because it forms an effective way to control the processing pipeline in complex data analyses. The VPE is similar in functionality to other programs such as IRIS Explorer AVS or LabVIEW. Zherlock: an open source data analysis software.
