"The concept and instantiation of real-time tomographic holography RTTH for augmented reality is presented. RTTH enables natural hand-eye coordination to guide invasive medical procedures without requiring tracking or a head-mounted device. It places a real-time virtual image of an objects cross section into its actual location without noticeable viewpoint dependence e.g. parallax error. The virtual image is viewed through a flat narrowband holographic optical element HOE with optical power that generates an in-situ virtual image within 1 m of the HOE from a small spatial light modulator display without obscuring a direct view of the physical world. Rigidly fixed upon a medical ultrasound probe an RTTH device could show the scan in its actual location inside the patient even as the probe was moved relative to the patient."
