The 6-minute walk test 6MWT in a regular hallway is commonly used to assess functional exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. However treadmill walking might provide additional advantages over overground walking especially if virtual reality and self-paced treadmill walking are combined. Therefore this study aimed to assess the reproducibility and validity of the 6MWT using the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab GRAIL in patients with COPD and healthy elderly. Reproducibility and Validity of the 6-Minute Walk Test Using the Gait Real-Time Analysis Interactive Lab in Patients with COPD and Healthy Elderly.
