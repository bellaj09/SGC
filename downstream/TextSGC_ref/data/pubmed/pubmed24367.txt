Electroencephalographic EEG brain-computer interfaces BCIs hold promise in restoring communication for patients with completely locked-in stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. However these patients cannot use existing EEG-based BCIs arguably because such systems rely on brain processes that are impaired in the late stages of ALS. In this work we introduce a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS based on high-level cognitive processes that are less likely to be affected by ALS. Self-regulation of brain rhythms in the precuneus: a novel BCI paradigm for patients with ALS.
