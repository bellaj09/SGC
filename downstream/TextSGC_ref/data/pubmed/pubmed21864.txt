The objective of this study was to compare the relative impact of two simulation-based methods for training emergency medicine EM residents in disaster triage using the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment START algorithm full-immersion virtual reality VR and standardized patient SP drill. Specifically are there differences between the triage performances and posttest results of the two groups and do both methods differentiate between learners of variable experience levels? Virtual reality triage training provides a viable solution for disaster-preparedness.
