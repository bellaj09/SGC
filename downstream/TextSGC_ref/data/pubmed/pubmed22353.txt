Evidence exists that virtual worlds reduce pain perception by providing distraction. However there is no experimental study to show that the type of world used in virtual reality VR distraction influences pain perception. Therefore we investigated whether pain triggered by heat or cold stimuli is modulated by "warm "or "cold " virtual environments and whether virtual worlds reduce pain perception more than does static picture presentation. We expected that cold worlds would reduce pain perception from heat stimuli while warm environments would reduce pain perception from cold stimuli. Additionally both virtual worlds should reduce pain perception in general. Heat and cold pain stimuli thresholds were assessed outside VR in 48 volunteers in a balanced crossover design. Participants completed three 4-minute assessment periods: virtual "walks " through 1 a winter and 2 an autumn landscape and static exposure to 3 a neutral landscape. During each period five heat stimuli or three cold stimuli were delivered via a thermode on the participant\s arm and affective and sensory pain perceptions were rated. Then the thermode was changed to the other arm and the procedure was repeated with the opposite pain stimuli heat or cold. We found that both warm and cold virtual environments reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness for heat and cold pain stimuli when compared to the control condition. Since participants wore a head-mounted display HMD in both the control condition and VR we concluded that the distracting value of virtual environments is not explained solely by excluding perception of the real world. Although VR reduced pain unpleasantness we found no difference in efficacy between the types of virtual world used for each pain stimulus.
