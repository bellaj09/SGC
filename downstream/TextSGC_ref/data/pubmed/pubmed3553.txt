Animals exhibit innate behaviours to a variety of sensory stimuli including olfactory cues. In Drosophila one higher olfactory centre the lateral horn LH is implicated in innate behaviour. However our structural and functional understanding of the LH is scant in large part due to a lack of sparse neurogenetic tools for this region. We generate a collection of split-GAL4 driver lines providing genetic access to 82 LH cell types. We use these to create an anatomical and neurotransmitter map of the LH and link this to EM connectomics data. We find ~30% of LH projections converge with outputs from the mushroom body site of olfactory learning and memory. Using optogenetic activation we identify LH cell types that drive changes in valence behavior or specific locomotor programs. In summary we have generated a resource for manipulating and mapping LH neurons providing new insights into the circuit basis of innate and learned olfactory behavior. Neurogenetic dissection of the Drosophila lateral horn reveals major outputs diverse behavioural functions and interactions with the mushroom body.
