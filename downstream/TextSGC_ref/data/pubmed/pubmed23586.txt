Feedback is an important way of information transmission in motor function output. Movement-related information can be transmitted as proprioceptive haptic visual and/or audial information to the central nervous system for control and modification of the temporal and spatial precision of motor output. Here presented is a systematic discussion on the principle technique and effect for some typical motor function rehabilitation methods such as treatment based on EMG feedback robot-aided movement therapy high-level perceptional feedback and motor training effect with 3-D virtual reality environment. Application of feedback techniques in motor function rehabilitation.
