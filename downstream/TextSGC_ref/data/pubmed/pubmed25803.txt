This is the first case report to demonstrate the efficacy of immersive computer-generated virtual reality VR and mixed reality touching real objects which patients also saw in VR for the treatment of spider phobia. The subject was a 37-yr-old female with severe and incapacitating fear of spiders. Twelve weekly 1-hr sessions were conducted over a 3-month period. Outcome was assessed on measures of anxiety avoidance and changes in behavior toward real spiders. VR graded exposure therapy was successful for reducing fear of spiders providing converging evidence for a growing literature showing the effectiveness of VR as a new medium for exposure therapy.
