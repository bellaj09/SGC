A good data sampling scheme is important for diffusion MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Diffusion Weighted Imaging DWI data is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. The samples in different shells are typically distributed uniformly because they should be invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue or the laboratory coordinate frame. The Electrostatic Energy Minimization EEM method originally proposed for single shell sampling scheme in dMRI by Jones et al. was recently generalized to the multi-shell case called generalized EEM GEEM. GEEM has been successfully used in the Human Connectome Project HCP. Recently the Spherical Code SC concept was proposed to maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells producing a larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the GEEM method. In this paper we propose two novel algorithms based on the SC concept: 1 an efficient incremental constructive method called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction IMOC to generate a sampling scheme on a discretized sphere; 2 a constrained non-linear optimization CNLO method to update a given initial scheme on the continuous sphere. Compared to existing incremental estimation methods IMOC obtains schemes with much larger separation angles between samples which are very close to the best known solutions in single shell case. Compared to the existing Riemannian gradient descent method CNLO is more robust and stable. Experiments demonstrated that the two proposed methods provide larger separation angles and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art GEEM and methods based on the SC concept.
