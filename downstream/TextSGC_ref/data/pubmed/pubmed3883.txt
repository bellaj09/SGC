There is a great need to identify potential long-term consequences of contact sport exposure and to identify molecular pathways that may be associated with these changes. We tested the hypothesis that football players with Ath-mTBI n\u2009=\u200925 and without a concussion history Ath n\u2009=\u200924 have altered resting state functional connectivity in regions with previously documented structural changes relative to healthy controls without football or concussion history HC n\u2009=\u200927. As a secondary aim we tested the hypothesis that group differences in functional connectivity are moderated by the relative ratio of neuroprotective to neurotoxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway. Ath-mTBI had significantly increased connectivity of motor cortex to the supplementary motor area relative to Ath and HC. In contrast both Ath-mTBI and Ath had increased connectivity between the left orbital frontal cortex and the right lateral frontal cortex and between the left cornu ammonis areas 2 and 3/dentate gyrus CA2-3/DG of the hippocampus and the middle and posterior cingulate cortices relative to HC. The relationship between the ratio of plasma concentrations of kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid KYNA/QUIN and left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex connectivity to multiple regions as well as KYNA/QUIN and right CA2-3/DG connectivity to multiple regions differed significantly according to football and concussion history. The results suggest that football exposure with and without concussion history can have a significant effect on intrinsic brain connectivity and implicate the kynurenine metabolic pathway as one potential moderator of functional connectivity dependent on football exposure and concussion history.
