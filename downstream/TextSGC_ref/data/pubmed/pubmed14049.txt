"Human gait recognition is one of the most promising biometric technologies especially for unobtrusive video surveillance and human identification from a distance. Aiming at improving recognition rate in this paper we study gait recognition using deep learning and propose a novel method based on convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Conv-LSTM. First we present a variation of Gait Energy Images i.e. frame-by-frame GEI ff-GEI to expand the volume of available Gait Energy Images GEI data and relax the constraints of gait cycle segmentation required by existing gait recognition methods. Second we demonstrate the effectiveness of ff-GEI by analyzing the cross-covariance of one persons gait data. Then making use of the temporality of our human gait we design a novel gait recognition model using Conv-LSTM. Finally the proposed method is evaluated extensively based on the CASIA Dataset B for cross-view gait recognition furthermore the OU-ISIR Large Population Dataset is employed to verify its generalization ability. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms based on these two datasets. The results indicate that the proposed ff-GEI model using Conv-LSTM coupled with the new gait representation can effectively solve the problems related to cross-view gait recognition."
