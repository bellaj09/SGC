Brain-computer interfaces BCIs allow for translating brain signals into control commands e.g. to control games. One of the biggest quests of the BCI community is to realize new exciting applications. In this paper we present a two player online chess application where both players control their pieces solely with their brain activity. Control is realized in a two-step process where players first select the desired chess piece and then the field they want to move it to. A selection is accomplished with visual event-related potentials that are elicited by highlighting each possible piece or field one by one. Six healthy volunteers participated in our study by playing a game against each other in pairs over a free chess server. They successfully completed at least one match per pair. Our results show that even BCI-naive players obtain almost perfect control over the application. On average 96% of the moves were correct. Most of the errors came from technical problems that can be corrected in future versions of the application. Given the high popularity of chess this intuitive BCI game is an appealing new application for patients and for healthy users that want to explore BCIs. Two Player Online Brain-Controlled Chess.
