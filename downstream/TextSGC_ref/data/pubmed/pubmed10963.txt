Lattice degeneration and/or retinal breaks defined as notable peripheral retinal lesions NPRLs are prone to evolving into rhegmatogenous retinal detachment which can cause severe visual loss. However screening NPRLs is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore we aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning DL system for automated identifying NPRLs based on ultra-widefield fundus UWF images. A deep learning system for identifying lattice degeneration and retinal breaks using ultra-widefield fundus images.
