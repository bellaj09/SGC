Abdominal organs are very susceptible to trauma. In order to protect them properly against car crash and other impact consequences we need to be able to simulate the abdominal organ deformation. Such simulation should account for proper stress-strain relation as well as stress dependence on strain rate. As the step in this direction this paper presents three-dimensional non-linear viscoelastic constitutive models for liver and kidney tissue. The models have been constructed basing on in vivo experiments conducted in Highway Safety Research Institute and the Medical Centre of The University of Michigan Melvin et al. 1973. The proposed models are valid for compressive nominal strains up to 35% and fast impact strain rates between 0.2 and 22.5 s-1. Similar models can find applications in computer and robot assisted surgery e.g. the realistic simulation of surgical procedures including virtual reality and non-rigid registration.
