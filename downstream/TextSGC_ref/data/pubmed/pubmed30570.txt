Determining neuronal topographical information in the cerebral cortex is of fundamental importance for developing neuroprosthetics. Significant progress has been achieved in decoding hand voluntary movement with cortical neuronal activity in nonhuman primates. However there are few successful reports in scientific literature for decoding lower limb voluntary movement with the cortical neuronal firing. We once reported an experimental system which consists of a specially designed chair a visually guided stand and squat task training paradigm and an acute neuron recording setup. With this system we can record high quality cortical neuron activity to investigate the correlation between these neuronal signals and stand/squat movement.
