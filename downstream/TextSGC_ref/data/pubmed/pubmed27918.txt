Multimodal recordings of EEG and NIRS of 14 subjects are analyzed in the context of sensory-motor based Brain Computer Interface BCI. Our findings indicate that performance fluctuations of EEG-based BCI control can be predicted by preceding Near-Infrared Spectroscopy NIRS activity. These NIRS-based predictions are then employed to generate new more robust EEG-based BCI classifiers which enhance classification significantly while at the same time minimize performance fluctuations and thus increase the general stability of BCI performance. Using NIRS as a predictor for EEG-based BCI performance.
