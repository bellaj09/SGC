The aim of this study was to use Recurrent Neural Network RNN to predict the orientation and amplitude of the applied force during the push phase of manual wheelchair propulsion. Trunk and the right-upper limb kinematics data were assessed with an optoeletronic device Qualisys and the force applied on the handrim was recorded with an instrumented wheel SMARTWheel. Data acquisitions were performed at 60/80/10/120/140% of the freely chosen frequency at submaximal and maximal conditions. The final database consisted of d\u202f=\u202f5708 push phases. The input data were the trunk and right upper-limb kinematics joint angle angular velocity and acceleration and anthropometric data height weight segment length and the output data were the applied forces orientation and amplitude. A ratio of 70/15/15 was used to train validate and test the RNN dtrain\u202f=\u202f3996 dvalidation\u202f=\u202f856 and dtest\u202f=\u202f856. The angle and amplitude errors between the measured and predicted force was assessed from dtest. Results showed that for most of the push phase 70% the force direction prediction errors were less than 12. The mean absolute amplitude errors were less than 8\u202fN and the mean absolute amplitude percentage errors were less than 20% for most of the push phase 80%.
