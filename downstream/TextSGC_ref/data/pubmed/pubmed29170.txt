Brain-computer interface BCI provides a new choice for people who lose communication ability so the recognition of EEG has been paid attention. In this paper wavelet packet transform WPT and transfer learning TL were used to classify right-hand and foot motion imagery tasks. Firstly based on analyzing the channels and frequency bands closely related to event-related desynchronization ERD the EEG signals are decomposed by WPT. Then the relevant nodes were selected to calculate wavelet packet energy. Finally TL was used to classify the BCI competition  data IVa. The ideal classification result was obtained. The results show that the method is simple and effective and it is valuable for online application of BCI. Task Classifcation of Right-hand and Foot Motion Imagery Based on Wavelet Packet Transform.
