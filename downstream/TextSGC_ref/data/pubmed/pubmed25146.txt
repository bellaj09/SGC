Shoulder arthroscopy is a difficult procedure commonly used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Until now the majority of training has been done in theatre assisting and practising under supervision. Few good simulations exist. Procedicus VA from Prosolvia Clarus is a virtual reality simulation of shoulder arthroscopy with interactive graphics and haptic feedback. The simulator has various modes including anatomy manipulation pathology subacromial decompression. We describe our experience with the simulator attempting to validate some of the scoring mechanisms and highlighting some of the pitfalls discovered as the simulator is first trialled by surgeons. This early experience has highlighted both successful aspects of the simulator and some of the initial pitfalls. Our initial experience confirms the need for close collaboration between virtual programmers and surgical trainers. We are revising the assessment criteria over the coming months. Early experience and validation work with Procedicus VA--the Prosolvia virtual reality shoulder arthroscopy trainer.
