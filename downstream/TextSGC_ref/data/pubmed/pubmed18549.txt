Human balance is a complex process in healthy adults requiring precisely timed coordination among sensory information cognitive processing and motor control. It has been difficult to quantify brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine whether by using high-density electroencephalography EEG and independent component analysis we can identify common cortical responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the waist or viewing brief 20 field-of-view rotations in virtual reality. We recorded high-density EEG motion capture lower leg electromyography EMG and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit time-frequency fluctuations in theta 4-8 Hz and beta 13-30 Hz bands with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. For both perturbations we found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta 8-30 Hz desynchronization following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when humans respond to sensorimotor conflict but with substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus physical perturbations. Our findings may have important implications for assessing and training balance in individuals with and without motor disabilities.
