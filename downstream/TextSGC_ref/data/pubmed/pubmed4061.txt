"The human brain and its temporal behavior correlated with development structure and function is a complex natural system even for its own kind. Coding and automation are necessary for modeling analyzing and understanding the 86.1 +/- 8.1 +/- billion neurons an almost equal number of non-neuronal glial cells and the neuronal networks of the human brain comprising about 100 trillion connections. Computational neuroscience which is heavily dependent on biology physics mathematics and computation addresses such problems while the archival retrieval and merging of the huge amount of generated data in the form of clinical records scientific literature and specialized databases are carried out by neuroinformatics approaches. Neuroinformatics is thus an interface between computer science and experimental neuroscience. This article provides an introduction to computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields along with their state-ofthe- art tools software and resources. Furthermore it describes a few innovative applications of these fields in predicting and detecting brain network organization complex brain disorder diagnosis large-scale 3D simulation of the brain brain- computer and brain-to-brain interfaces. It provides an integrated overview of the fields in a non-technical way appropriate for broad general readership. Moreover the article is an updated unified resource of the existing knowledge and sources for researchers stepping into these fields."
