Video compression algorithms are widely used to reduce the huge size of video data but they also introduce unpleasant visual artifacts due to the lossy compression. In order to improve the quality of the compressed videos we proposed a deep non-local Kalman network for compression artifact reduction. Specifically the video restoration is modeled as a Kalman filtering procedure and the decoded frames can be restored from the proposed deep Kalman model. Instead of using the noisy previous decoded frames as temporal information the less noisy previous restored frame is employed in a recursive way which provides the potential to generate high quality restored frames. In the proposed framework several deep neural networks are utilized to estimate the corresponding states in the Kalman filter and integrated together in the deep Kalman filtering network. More importantly we also exploit the non-local prior information by incorporating the spatial and temporal non-local networks for better restoration. Our approach takes the advantages of both the model-based methods and learning-based methods by combining the recursive nature of the Kalman model and powerful representation ability of neural networks. Extensive experimental results on the Vimeo-90k and HEVC benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
