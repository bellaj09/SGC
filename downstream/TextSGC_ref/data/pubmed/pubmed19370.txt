This study investigated the neural correlates of virtual reality analgesia. Virtual reality significantly reduced subjective pain ratings i.e. analgesia. Using fMRI pain-related brain activity was measured for each participant during conditions of no virtual reality and during virtual reality order randomized. As predicted virtual reality significantly reduced pain-related brain activity in all five regions of interest; the anterior cingulate cortex primary and secondary somatosensory cortex insula and thalamus p<0.002 corrected. Results showed direct modulation of human brain pain responses by virtual reality distraction. Modulation of thermal pain-related brain activity with virtual reality: evidence from fMRI.
