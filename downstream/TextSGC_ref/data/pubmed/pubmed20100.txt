Virtual reality VR assessment paradigms have the potential to address the limited ecological validity of pen and paper measures of executive function EF and the pragmatic and reliability issues associated with functional measures. To investigate the ecological validity and construct validity of a newly developed VR measure of EF the Virtual Library Task VLT; a real life analogous task--the Real Library Task RLT; and five neuropsychological measures of EF were administered to 30 patients with traumatic brain injury TBI and 30 healthy Controls. Significant others for each participant also completed the Dysexecutive Questionnaire DEX which is a behavioral rating scale of everyday EF. Performances on the VLT and the RLT were significantly positively correlated indicating that VR performance is similar to real world performance. The TBI group performed significantly worse than the Control group on the VLT and the Modified Six Elements Test MSET but the other four neuropsychological measures of EF failed to differentiate the groups. Both the MSET and the VLT significantly predicted everyday EF suggesting that they are both ecologically valid tools for the assessment of EF. The VLT has the advantage over the MSET of providing objective measurement of individual components of EF.
