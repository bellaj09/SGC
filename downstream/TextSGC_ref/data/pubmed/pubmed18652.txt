We benefited from the flexibility provided by virtual reality to enhance a classical paradigm on array and self mental rotations and related questions on a set of items. We used this paradigm to investigate how the Level of Schizotypy in nonclinical subjects might influence their behavior in egocentric and allocentric mental transformations. Three elements of novelty were introduced: i we separated the phases of mental transformation Imagined Rotation Phase and task performance Task Phase ii we measured the time required for Imagined Rotation Phase and Task Phase separately and iii we cued self-rotations with a virtual human being self-avatar or an inanimate object self-chair. Twenty-four nonclinical participants were categorized in low- and high-schizotypal subjects Low-S High-S. A mixed-design analysis of variance showed that High-S were significantly faster than Low-S during the Imagined Rotation Phase array and self-chair rotations and during the Task Phase self-chair. High-S were also faster in the self-chair than in the self-avatar rotation supporting the existence of a dissociation between perspective changing and perspective taking in High-S. In line with the literature we found that participant performances decreased with increasing angular difference between the initial and the imagined perspective.
