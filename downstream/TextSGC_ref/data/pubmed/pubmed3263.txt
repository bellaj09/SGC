Levels of the adrenal hormones dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA its sulfate DHEAS and testosterone have all been linked to behavior and mental health during adrenarche and preclinical studies suggest that these hormones influence brain development. However little is known about how variation in these hormones is associated with white matter structure during this period of life. The current study aimed to examine associations between DHEA DHEAS and testosterone and white matter microstructure during adrenarche. To avoid the confounding effect of age on hormone levels we tested these associations in 87 children within a narrow age range mean age 9.56 years SD=0.34 but varying in hormone levels. All children provided saliva samples directly after waking and completed a diffusion-weighted MRI scan. Higher levels of DHEA were associated with higher mean diffusivity MD in a widespread cluster of white matter tracts which was partially explained by higher radial diffusivity RD and partially by higher axial diffusivity AD. In addition there was an interaction between DHEA and testosterone with higher levels of testosterone being associated with higher fractional anisotropy FA and lower MD and RD when DHEA levels were relatively high but with lower FA and higher MD and RD when DHEA levels were low. These findings suggest that relatively early exposure to DHEA as well as an imbalance between the adrenal hormones may be associated with alterations in white matter microstructure. These findings highlight the potential relevance of adrenarcheal hormones for structural brain development.
