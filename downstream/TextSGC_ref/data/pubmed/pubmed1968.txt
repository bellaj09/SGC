This systematic review aimed to assess the reproducibility of graph-theoretic brain network metrics. Primary research studies of test-retest reliability conducted on healthy human subjects were included that quantified test-retest reliability using either the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC or the coefficient of variance. The MEDLINE Web of Knowledge Google Scholar and OpenGrey databases were searched up to February 2014. Risk of bias was assessed with 10 criteria weighted toward methodological quality. Twenty-three studies were included in the review n=499 subjects and evaluated for various characteristics including sample size 5-45 retest interval <1 h to >1 year acquisition method and test-retest reliability scores. For at least one metric ICCs reached the fair range ICC 0.40-0.59 in one study the good range ICC 0.60-0.74 in five studies and the excellent range ICC>0.74 in 16 studies. Heterogeneity of methods prevented further quantitative analysis. Reproducibility was good overall. For the metrics having three or more ICCs reported for both functional and structural networks six of seven were higher in structural networks indicating that structural networks may be more reliable over time. The authors were also able to highlight and discuss a number of methodological factors affecting reproducibility. Reproducibility of graph-theoretic brain network metrics: a systematic review.
