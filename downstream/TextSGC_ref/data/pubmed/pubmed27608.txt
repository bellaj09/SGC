We propose a new hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system that integrates two different EEG tasks: tactile selective attention TSA using a vibro-tactile stimulator on the left/right finger and motor imagery MI of left/right hand movement. Event-related desynchronization ERD from the MI task and steady-state somatosensory evoked potential SSSEP from the TSA task are retrieved and combined into two hybrid senses. Achieving a hybrid brain-computer interface with tactile selective attention and motor imagery.
