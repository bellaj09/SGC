Finding testing and demonstrating efficacy of new treatments for stroke recovery is a multifaceted challenge. We believe that to advance the field neurorehabilitation trials need a conceptually rigorous starting framework. An essential first step is to agree on definitions of sensorimotor recovery and on measures consistent with these definitions. Such standardization would allow pooling of participant data across studies and institutions aiding meta-analyses of completed trials more detailed exploration of recovery profiles of our patients and the generation of new hypotheses. Here we present the results of a consensus meeting about measurement standards and patient characteristics that we suggest should be collected in all future stroke recovery trials. Recommendations are made considering time post stroke and are aligned with the international classification of functioning and disability. A strong case is made for addition of kinematic and kinetic movement quantification. Further work is being undertaken by our group to form consensus on clinical predictors and pre-stroke clinical data that should be collected as well as recommendations for additional outcome measurement tools. To improve stroke recovery trials we urge the research community to consider adopting our recommendations in their trial design.
