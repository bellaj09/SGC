"In recent years many attempts have been made to connect electrical circuits with the human nervous system. The objective of type of research was diverse - from the desire to understand the physiology of the nervous system through attempting to substitute nervous tissue defects with synthetic systems to creating an interface that allows computers to be controlled directly with ones thought. Regardless of the original purpose the creation of any form of such a combination would entail a series of subsequent discoveries allowing for a real revolution in both theoretical and clinical neuroscience. Computers based on neurons neurochips or mind prostheses are just some examples of technologies that could soon become part of everyday life. Despite numerous attempts there is still no interface that meets all the expectations of the scholars. However many scientific groups seem to be on the right track and their achievements raise extraordinary expectations. This paper evaluates historical theories and contemporary ideas about such interfaces to smoothly describe the major medical and scientific utility of the subject. Thus it presents the main issues surrounding the concept of integrating the human nervous system with electronic circuits." Methods of integrating the human nervous system with electronic circuits.
