"In this study we propose a recognition system for single-trial analysis of motor imagery MI electroencephalogram EEG data. Applying event-related brain potential ERP data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices the system chiefly consists of automatic artifact elimination feature extraction feature selection and classification. In addition to the use of independent component analysis a similarity measure is proposed to further remove the electrooculographic EOG artifacts automatically. Several potential features such as wavelet-fractal features are then extracted for subsequent classification. Next quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization QPSO is used to select features from the feature combination. Finally selected sub-features are classified by support vector machine SVM. Compared with without artifact elimination feature selection using a genetic algorithm GA and feature classification with Fishers linear discriminant FLD on MI data from two data sets for eight subjects the results indicate that the proposed method is promising in brain-computer interface BCI applications."
