The mu-opioid receptor OPRM1 A118G polymorphism underpins different pain sensitivity and opioid-analgesic outcome with unclear effect on the descending pain modulatory system DPMS. Primary dysmenorrhea PDM the most prevalent gynecological problem with clear painful and pain free conditions serves as a good clinical model of spontaneous pain. The objective of this imaging genetics study was therefore to explore if differences in functional connectivity FC of the DPMS between the OPRM1 A118G polymorphisms could provide a possible explanation for the differences in pain experience. Sixty-one subjects with PDM and 65 controls participated in the current study of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI during the menstruation and peri-ovulatory phases; blood samples were taken for genotyping. We studied 3 aspects of pain experience namely mnemonic pain recalled overall menstrual pain present pain spontaneous menstrual pain and experimental pain thermal pain intensities. We report that G allele carriers in comparison to AA homozygotes exhibited functional hypo-connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex ACC and periaqueductal gray PAG. Furthermore G allele carriers lost the correlation with spontaneous pain experience and exhibited dysfunctional DPMS by means of PAG-seeded FC dynamics. This OPRM1 A118G-DPMS interaction is one plausible neurological mechanism underlying the individual differences in pain experience. The OPRM1 A118G polymorphism modulates the descending pain modulatory system for individual pain experience in young women with primary dysmenorrhea.
