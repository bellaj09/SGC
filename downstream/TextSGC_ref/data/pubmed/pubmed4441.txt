The default network DN is a brain network with correlated activities spanning frontal parietal and temporal cortical lobes. The DN activates for high-level cognition tasks and deactivates when subjects are actively engaged in perceptual tasks. Despite numerous observations the role of DN deactivation remains unclear. Using computational neuroimaging applied to a large dataset of the Human Connectome Project HCP and to two individual subjects scanned over many repeated runs we demonstrate that the DN selectively deactivates as a function of the position of a visual stimulus. That is we show that spatial vision is encoded within the DN by means of deactivation relative to baseline. Our results suggest that the DN functions as a set of high-level visual regions opening up the possibility of using vision-science tools to understand its putative function in cognition and perception.
