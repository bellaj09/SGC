"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are being developed to assist paralyzed people and amputees by translating neural activity into movements of a computer cursor or prosthetic limb. Here we introduce a novel BCI task paradigm intended to help accelerate improvements to BCI systems. Through this task we can push the performance limits of BCI systems we can quantify more accurately how well a BCI system captures the users intent and we can increase the richness of the BCI movement repertoire."
