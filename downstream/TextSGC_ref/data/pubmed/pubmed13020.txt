Bioelectronic phenomena related to the activity of the Autonomic Nervous System ANS activity mainly take place in the deep part of the brain where they are difficult to record. The hand skin being richly innervated by sympathetic efferent fibres offers an interface from which relevant ANS-related signals can be recorded. Two non-invasive bioelectronic measurements skin resistance and potential reflecting the activity of the ANS were performed at the skin surface. These measurements were complemented by thermovascular skin microcirculation and skin temperature and cardiorespiratory instantaneous heart rate and instantaneous respiratory frequency measurements. The bioelectric measurements were performed using noninvasive Ag/AgCl electrodes. Non-metallic NASICON Na Super Ionic Conductor electrodes were tested and compared with traditional electrodes for the optimization of bioelectric measurements. Signal analysis and data processing was accomplished by means of original indices on a specially designed PC-based software. The methodology was used to evaluate vigilance level mental workload and emotional response during tasks sporting activity mental calculation olfactive stimuli and in critical situations car crash avoidance. Bioelectric and microcirculation cutaneous sensors for the study of vigilance and emotional response during tasks and tests.
