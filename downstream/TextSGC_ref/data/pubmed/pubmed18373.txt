We attempted to evaluate the clinical efficiency of a novel three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system 3D-ARS for balance and mobility rehabilitation. This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants age 56-76 years who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group n\u2009=\u200918 underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group n\u2009=\u200918 experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week 1 session\u2009=\u200930 minutes for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise cave game for knee exercise and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores fall index and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax posturography before during and after training. Significant group 3D-ARS vs. control\u2009\u2009time before and after exercise interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale BBS scores p\u2009=\u20090.04 and timed-up-and-go TUG; p\u2009<\u20090.001. Overall improvements occurred in stability index weight distribution index fall risk index and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups. However score changes were significantly greater in the 3D-ARS group. Significant group\u2009\u2009time interaction effect was observed for the fall risk index. This demonstrates that the 3D-ARS system can improve balance in the elderly more effectively.
