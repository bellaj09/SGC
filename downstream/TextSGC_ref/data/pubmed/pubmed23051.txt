This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery MI brain-computer interface BCI by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars at the machine subject and application level as equally significant could lead to a BCI-user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury SCI were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface-application BCI output and electroencephalography EEG neuroimaging-with two end-users sufficiently longitudinal evaluation and importantly under real-world and even adverse conditions.
