"Saliency refers to the visual perception quality that makes objects in a scene to stand out from others and attract attention. While computational saliency models can simulate the experts visual attention there is little evidence about how these models perform when used to predict the cytopathologists eye fixations. Saliency models may be the key to instrumenting fast object detection on large Pap smear slides under real noisy conditions artifacts and cell occlusions. This paper describes how our computational schemes retrieve regions of interest ROI of clinical relevance using visual attention models. We also compare the performance of different computed saliency models as part of cell screening tasks aiming to design a computer-aided diagnosis systems that supports cytopathologists." Saliency-driven system models for cell analysis with deep learning.
