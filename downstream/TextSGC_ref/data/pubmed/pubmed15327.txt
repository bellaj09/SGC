Epicardial adipose tissue EAT is a metabolically activated beige adipose tissue non-homogeneously surrounding the myocardium. Physiologically EAT regulates toxic fatty acids protects the coronary arteries against mechanical strain regulates proinflammatory cytokines stimulates the production of nitric oxide reduces oxidative stress and works as a thermogenic source against hypothermia. Conversely EAT has pathologic paracrine interactions with the surrounded vessels and might favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. In addition initial atherosclerotic lesions can promote inflammation and trigger the EAT production of cytokines increasing vascular inflammation which in turn may help the development of collateral vessels but also of self-stimulating dysregulated inflammatory process increasing coronary artery disease severity. Variations in EAT were also linked to metabolic syndrome. Echocardiography first estimated EAT measuring its thickness on the free wall of the right ventricle but does not allow accurate volumetric EAT estimates. Cardiac CT CCT and cardiac MR CMR allow for three-dimensional EAT estimates the former showing higher spatial resolution and reproducibility but being limited by radiation exposure and long segmentation times the latter being radiation-free but limited by lower spatial resolution and reproducibility higher cost and difficulties for obese patients. EAT radiodensity at CCT could to be related to underlying metabolic processes. The correlation between EAT and response to certain pharmacological therapies has also been investigated showing promising results. In the future semi-automatic or fully automatic techniques machine/deep-learning methods if validated will facilitate research for various EAT measures and may find a place in CCT/CMR reporting.
