"Recently local field potentials LFPs have been successfully used to extract information of arm and hand movement in some brain-machine interfaces BMIs studies which suggested that LFPs would improve the performance of BMI applications because of its long-term stability. However the performance of LFPs in different frequency bands has not been investigated in decoding hand grasp types. Here the LFPs from the monkeys dorsal premotor cortices were collected by microelectrode array when monkey was performing grip-specific grasp task. A K-nearest neighbor classifier performed on the power spectrum of LFPs was used to decode grasping movements. The decoding powers of LFPs in different frequency bands channels and trials used for training were also studied. The results show that the broad high frequency band 200-400Hz LFPs achieved the best performance with classification accuracy reaching over 0.9. It infers that high frequency band LFPs in PMd cortex could be a promising source of control signals in developing functional BMIs for hand grasping."
