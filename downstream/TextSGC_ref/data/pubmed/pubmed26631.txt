Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs now enable an individual without limb function to "move" a detached mechanical arm to perform simple actions such as feeding herself. This technology may eventually offer almost everyone a way to move objects at a distance by exercising cognitive control of a mechanical device. At that point BCIs may be seen less as an assistive technology for disabled people and more as a tool like the internet which can benefit all users. We will argue that BCIs will have a significant but uncertain impact on attitudes toward disabilities and on norms of bodily form and function. It may be liberating oppressive or both. Its impact we argue will depend - though not in any simple way - on whether BCIs come to be seen as parts of the body itself or as external tools.
