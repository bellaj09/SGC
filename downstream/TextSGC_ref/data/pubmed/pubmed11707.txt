Single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq is a rapidly evolving technology that enables measurement of gene expression levels at an unprecedented resolution. Despite the explosive growth in the number of cells that can be assayed by a single experiment scRNA-seq still has several limitations including high rates of dropouts which result in a large number of genes having zero read count in the scRNA-seq data and complicate downstream analyses.
