"Although dopaminergic replacement therapy is believed to improve sensory processing in PD while delayed perceptual speed is thought to be caused by a predominantly cholinergic deficit it is unclear whether sensory-perceptual deficits are a result of corrupt sensory processing or a delay in updating perceived feedback during movement. The current study aimed to examine these two hypotheses by manipulating visual flow speed and dopaminergic medication to examine which influenced distance estimation in PD. Fourteen PD and sixteen HC participants were instructed to estimate the distance of a remembered target by walking to the position the target formerly occupied. This task was completed in virtual reality in order to manipulate the visual flow VF speed in real time. Three conditions were carried out: 1 BASELINE: VF speed was equal to participants real-time movement speed; 2 SLOW: VF speed was reduced by 50 %; 2 FAST: VF speed was increased by 30 %. Individuals with PD performed the experiment in their ON and OFF state. PD demonstrated significantly greater judgement error during BASELINE and FAST conditions compared to HC although PD did not improve their judgement error during the SLOW condition. Additionally PD had greater variable error during baseline compared to HC; however during the SLOW conditions PD had significantly less variable error compared to baseline and similar variable error to HC participants. Overall dopaminergic medication did not significantly influence judgement error. Therefore these results suggest that corrupt processing of sensory information is the main contributor to sensory-perceptual deficits during movement in PD rather than delayed updating of sensory feedback."
