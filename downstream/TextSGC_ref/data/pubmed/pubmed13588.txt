The high-background glucose metabolism of normal gray matter on 18F-fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose FDG positron emission tomography PET of the brain results in a low signal-to-background ratio potentially increasing the possibility of missing important findings in patients with intracranial malignancies. To explore the strategy of using a deep learning classifier to aid in distinguishing normal versus abnormal findings on PET brain images this study evaluated the performance of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network 2D-CNN to classify FDG PET brain scans as normal N or abnormal A.
