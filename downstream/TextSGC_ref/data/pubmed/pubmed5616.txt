Motor recovery after stroke has been shown to be correlated with both the fractional anisotropy FA of the affected corticospinal tract CST and the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity rsFC of the primary motor cortex M1. However the role of the restoration or enhancement of the M1-M1 rsFC in motor recovery remains largely unknown. We aimed to clarify this issue by investigating the correlations between the M1-M1 rsFC and the integrity of the M1-M1 anatomic connection and the affected CST in chronic subcortical stroke patients with good motor outcomes. Enhanced interhemispheric functional connectivity compensates for anatomical connection damages in subcortical stroke.
