The hybrid brain computer interface BCI based on motor imagery MI and P300 has been a preferred strategy aiming to improve the detection performance through combining the features of each. However current methods used for combining these two modalities optimize them separately which does not result in optimal performance. Here we present an efficient framework to optimize them together by concatenating the features of MI and P300 in a block diagonal form. Then a linear classifier under a dual spectral norm regularizer is applied to the combined features. Under this framework the hybrid features of MI and P300 can be learned selected and combined together directly. Experimental results on the data set of hybrid BCI based on MI and P300 are provided to illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method against other conventional methods. This provides an evidence that the method used here contributes to the discrimination performance of the brain state in hybrid BCI.
