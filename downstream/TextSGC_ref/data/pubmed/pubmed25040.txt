In the 20th century virtual reality has predominantly played a role in training pilots and in the entertainment industry. Despite much publicity virtual reality did not live up to its perceived potential. During the past decade it has also been applied for medical uses particularly as training simulators for minimally invasive surgery. Because of advances in computer technology virtual reality is on the cusp of becoming an effective medical educational tool. At the University of Washington we are developing a virtual reality soft tissue surgery simulator. Based on fast finite element modeling and using a personal computer this device can simulate three-dimensional human skin deformations with real-time tactile feedback. Although there are many cutaneous biomechanical challenges to solve it will eventually provide more realistic dermatologic surgery training for medical students and residents than the currently used models. Virtual reality for dermatologic surgery: virtually a reality in the 21st century.
