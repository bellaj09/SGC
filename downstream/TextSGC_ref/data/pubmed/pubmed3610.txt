Autism spectrum disorder ASD is characterized by core sociocommunicative impairments. Atypical intrinsic functional connectivity iFC has been reported in numerous studies of ASD. A majority of findings has indicated long-distance underconnectivity. However fMRI studies have thus far exclusively examined static iFC across several minutes of scanning. We examined temporal variability of iFC using sliding window analyses in selected high-quality low-motion consortium datasets from 76 ASD and 76 matched typically developing TD participants Study 1 and in-house data from 32 ASD and 32 TD participants. Mean iFC and standard deviation of the sliding window correlation SD-iFC were computed for regions of interest ROIs from default mode and salience networks as well as amygdala and thalamus. In both studies ROI pairings with significant underconnectivity ASD<TD were identified. Mediation analyses showed that decreased mean iFC in the ASD groups was significantly affected by increased SD-iFC. Our study is the first to identify temporal variability across time as a significant contributing factor to the common finding of static underconnectivity in ASD. Since peak connectivity across time was not significantly reduced in ASD static underconnectivity findings may have to be reinterpreted suggesting that connections are not actually "broken" in ASD but subject to greater intra-individual variability across time. Our findings indicate the need for dynamic approaches to iFC in clinical functional connectivity MRI fcMRI investigations. Underconnected But Not Broken? Dynamic Functional Connectivity MRI Shows Underconnectivity in Autism Is Linked to Increased Intra-Individual Variability Across Time.
