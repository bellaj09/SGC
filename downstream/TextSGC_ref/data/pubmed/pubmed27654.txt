In this work we present--for the first time--the online operation of an electroencephalogram EEG brain-computer interface BCI system based on covert visuospatial attention CVSA without relying on any evoked responses. Electrophysiological correlates of pure top-down CVSA have only recently been proposed as a control signal for BCI. Such systems are expected to share the ease of use of stimulus-driven BCIs e.g. P300 steady state visually evoked potential with the autonomy afforded by decoding voluntary modulations of ongoing activity e.g. motor imagery. An online EEG BCI based on covert visuospatial attention in absence of exogenous stimulation.
