Minimal invasive surgery has become the primary technique-of-choice for uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis. Skills needed for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be extrapolated directly from the open surgical technique. An obvious need exists for a valid objective and repetitive teaching and training setting for minimally invasive surgery. The surgical skills laboratory may have an important role in acquisition of such skills. New technologies such as virtual-reality surgical simulation provide objective trainee-friendly methods of training. Both surgeons and residents believe it is important to train residents in minimally invasive surgical techniques using virtual-reality surgical simulation within the context of the surgical skills laboratory. This article highlights the features of one of the most promising technical novelties in the area of surgical virtual- reality simulation the Xitact LS500 laparoscopy simulator. Introducing the Xitact LS500 laparoscopy simulator: toward a revolution in surgical education.
