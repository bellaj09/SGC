The FLS trainer lacks objective and automated assessments of laparoscopic performance and requires a large supply of relatively expensive consumables. Virtual reality simulation has a great potential as a training and assessment tool of laparoscopic skills and can overcome some limitations of the FLS trainer. This study was carried out to assess the value of our Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer VBLaST in the peg transfer task compared to the FLS trainer and its ability to differentiate performance between novice intermediate and expert groups. Validation of the VBLaST peg transfer task: a first step toward an alternate training standard.
