Neural coding is an essential process for neuroprosthetic design in which adaptive filters have been widely utilized. In a practical application it is needed to switch between different filters which could be based on continuous observations or point process when the neuron models conditions or system requirements have changed. As candidates of coding chip for neural prostheses low-power general purpose processors are not computationally efficient especially for large scale neural population coding. Application specific integrated circuits ASICs do not have flexibility to switch between different adaptive filters while the cost for design and fabrication is formidable. In this research work we explore an application specific instruction set processor ASIP for adaptive filters in neural decoding activity. The proposed architecture focuses on efficient computation for the most time-consuming matrix/vector operations among commonly used adaptive filters being able to provide both flexibility and throughput. Evaluation and implementation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed ASIP design is area-efficient while being competitive to commercial CPUs in computational performance.
