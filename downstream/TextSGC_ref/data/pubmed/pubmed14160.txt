"Parkinsons disease PD is a serious neurodegenerative disorder. It is reported that most of PD patients have voice impairments. But these voice impairments are not perceptible to common listeners. Therefore different machine learning methods have been developed for automated PD detection. However these methods either lack generalization and clinically significant classification performance or face the problem of subject overlap."
