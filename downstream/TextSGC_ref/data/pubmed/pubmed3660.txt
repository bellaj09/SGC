There is increasing neuroimaging evidence that type 2 diabetes patients with retinal microvascular complications show abnormal brain functional and structural architecture and are at an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. However changes in the topological properties of the functional brain connectome in diabetic retinopathy DR patients remain unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the topological organization of the brain connectome in DR patients using graph theory approaches. Disrupted topological organization of human brain connectome in diabetic retinopathy patients.
