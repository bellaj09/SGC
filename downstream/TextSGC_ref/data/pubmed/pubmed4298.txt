Behavioral and personality disorders in temporal lobe epilepsy TLE have been a topic of interest and controversy for decades with less attention paid to alterations in normal personality structure and traits. In this investigation core personality traits the Big 5 and their neurobiological correlates in TLE were explored using the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness-Five Factor Inventory NEO-FFI and structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI through the Epilepsy Connectome Project ECP. NEO-FFI scores from 67 individuals with TLE 34.6\u202f\u202f9.5\u202fyears; 67% women were compared to 31 healthy controls 32.8\u202f\u202f8.9\u202fyears; 41% women to assess differences in the Big 5 traits agreeableness openness conscientiousness neuroticism and extraversion. Individuals with TLE showed significantly higher neuroticism with no significant differences on the other traits. Neural correlates of neuroticism were then determined in participants with TLE including cortical and subcortical volumes. Distributed reductions in cortical gray matter volumes were associated with increased neuroticism. Subcortically hippocampal and amygdala volumes were negatively associated with neuroticism. These results offer insight into alterations in the Big 5 personality traits in TLE and their brain-related correlates.
