In this study for the first time we show how to formulate a structured support vector machine SSVM as two layers in a convolutional neural network where the top layer is a loss augmented inference layer and the bottom layer is the normal convolutional layer. We show that a deformable part model can be learned with the proposed structured SVM neural network by backpropagating the error of the deformable part model to the convolutional neural network. The forward propagation calculates the loss augmented inference and the backpropagation calculates the gradient from the loss augmented inference layer to the convolutional layer. Thus we obtain a new type of convolutional neural network called an Structured SVM convolutional neural network which we applied to the human pose estimation problem. This new neural network can be used as the final layers in deep learning. Our method jointly learns the structural model parameters and the appearance model parameters. We implemented our method as a new layer in the existing Caffe library. Application of structured support vector machine backpropagation to a convolutional neural network for human pose estimation.
