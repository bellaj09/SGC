This paper presents a sharable and individual multi-view metric learning MvML approach for visual recognition. Unlike conventional metric leaning methods which learn a distance metric on either a single type of feature representation or a concatenated representation of multiple types of features the proposed MvML jointly learns an optimal combination of multiple distance metrics on multi-view representations where not only it learns an individual distance metric for each view to retain its specific property but also a shared representation for different views in a unified latent subspace to preserve the common properties. The objective function of the MvML is formulated in the large margin learning framework via pairwise constraints under which the distance of each similar pair is smaller than that of each dissimilar pair by a margin. Moreover to exploit the nonlinear structure of data points we extend MvML to a sharable and individual multi-view deep metric learning MvDML method by utilizing the neural network architecture to seek multiple nonlinear transformations. Experimental results on face verification kinship verification and person re-identification show the effectiveness of the proposed sharable and individual multi-view metric learning methods.
