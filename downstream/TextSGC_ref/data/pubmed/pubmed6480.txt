The stoichiometry of protein complexes is precisely regulated in cells and is fundamental to protein function. Singe-molecule fluorescence imaging based photobleaching event counting is a new approach for protein stoichiometry determination under physiological conditions. Due to the interference of the high noise level and photoblinking events accurately extracting real bleaching steps from single-molecule fluorescence traces is still a challenging task. Here we develop a novel method of using convolutional and long-short-term memory deep learning neural network CLDNN for photobleaching event counting. We design the\xa0 convolutional layers\xa0to accurately extract features of steplike photobleaching drops and long-short-term memory LSTM recurrent layers to distinguish between photobleaching and photoblinking events. Compared with traditional algorithms CLDNN shows higher accuracy with at least 2 orders of magnitude improvement of efficiency and it does not require user-specified parameters. We have verified our CLDNN method using experimental data from imaging of single dye-labeled molecules in vitro and epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR on cells. Our CLDNN method is expected to provide a new strategy to stoichiometry study and time series analysis in chemistry.
