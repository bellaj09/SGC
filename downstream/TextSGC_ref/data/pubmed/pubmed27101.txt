The age-related impairment is an increasing problem due to the aging suffered by the population especially in developed countries. It is usual to use electroencephalogram EEG-based Brain Computer Interface BCI systems by means of the signal in order to assist and to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. However a parallel research line addresses the problem by the use of BCI systems as a way to train cognitive areas to achieve a deceleration of cognitive impairment or even an improvement. In this regard a neurofeedback training NFT tool using motor imagery-based BCI was developed. Training consists on imagery motor exercises combined with memory and logical relation tasks. In order to assess the effectiveness of the application 40 subjects older than 59 years old took part in this study. Our NFT application was tested by 20 subjects and their scores of a neuropsychological test were compared with the remaining 20 subjects who did not perform the NFT. Results show a significant improvement of three cognitive features after performing the NFT: visual perception expressive speech and immediate memory. Therefore evidences show that the performance of a NFT tool based on motor imagery tasks could be a positive activity for slow down the aging effects. Assessment of neurofeedback training by means of motor imagery based-BCI for cognitive rehabilitation.
