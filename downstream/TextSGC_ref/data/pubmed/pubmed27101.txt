The classification of electroencephalographic EEG data recorded from multiple users simultaneously is an important challenge in the field of Brain-Computer Interface BCI. In this paper we compare different approaches for classification of single-trials Event-Related Potential ERP on two subjects playing a collaborative BCI game. The minimum distance to mean MDM classifier in a Riemannian framework is extended to use the diversity of the inter-subjects spatio-temporal statistics MDM-hyper or to merge multiple classifiers MDM-multi. We show that both these classifiers outperform significantly the mean performance of the two users and analogous classifiers based on the step-wise linear discriminant analysis. More importantly the MDM-multi outperforms the performance of the best player within the pair. Single-Trial Classification of Multi-User P300-Based Brain-Computer Interface Using Riemannian Geometry.
