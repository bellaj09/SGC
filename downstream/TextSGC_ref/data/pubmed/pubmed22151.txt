Recent evidence has suggested certain advantages of the intraoperative use of ultrasonography US for urology. Advances in US technology include availability of compact specially-formed US probes i.e. endoluminal laparoscopic transrectal and transvaginal and new US functions such as Doppler harmonic 3D virtual sonography 4D contrast-enhanced elastography the fusion system with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and augmented reality. These have the potential to enhance visualization of the surgical anatomy even beyond the surgical view and thus increase the precision of surgery. US has been demonstrated to be the most widely-used intraoperative imaging with the advantages of its real-time nature non-invasiveness and easy-handling. Importantly it can be performed by urologists who in contemporary practice are going to need increasing familiarity with intraoperative imaging. This review article focused on US intervention and intraoperative US and current data were summarized regarding the advantages limitations and future potential of US technology in the modern era of minimally-invasive urology. Intraoperative ultrasonography in an era of minimally invasive urology.
