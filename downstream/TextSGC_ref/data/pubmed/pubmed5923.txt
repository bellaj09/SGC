Self-experience anomalies are elementary features of schizophrenic pathology. Such deficits can have a profound impact on self-other relationship but how they are related through aberrant brain function remains poorly understood. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study we provide new evidence for a cortical link between aberrant self-experience and social cognition in first-episode schizophrenia FES. As identified in previous studies ventral premotor cortex vPMC and posterior insula pIC are candidate brain regions underlying disturbances in both self-experience and self-other relationship due to their processing of predominantly externally guided vPMC; goal-oriented behavior and internally guided pIC; interoception stimuli. Results from functional interaction analysis in a sample of 24 FES patients and 22 healthy controls show aberrant functional interactions background/intrinsic connectivity of right vPMC and bilateral pIC with posterior cingulate cortex PCC a midline region that has been shown central in mediating self-experience. More specifically our results show increased functional coupling between vPMC and PCC which positively correlated with basic symptoms subjective self-experience disturbances. pIC showed reduced functional coupling with PCC and postcentral gyrus and increased functional interactions with anterior insula. Taken together our results suggest an imbalance in the processing between internally and externally guided information and its abnormal integration with self-referential processing as mediated by PCC. Due to our correlation findings we suggest this imbalance to be closely related to basic symptoms in FES and thus anomalous self-experience. The findings further disentangle the cortical basis of how self-experience anomalies may pervade the social domain.
