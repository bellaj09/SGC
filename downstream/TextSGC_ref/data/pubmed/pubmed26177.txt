The present study proposed a novel projection display system based on a virtual reality enhancement environment. The proposed system displays stereoscopic images of fractures and enhances the computed tomography CT images. The diagnosis and treatment of fractures primarily depend on the post-processing of CT images. However two-dimensional 2D images do not show overlapping structures in fractures since they are displayed without visual depth and these structures are too small to be simultaneously observed by a group of clinicians. Stereoscopic displays may solve this problem and allow clinicians to obtain more information from CT images. Hardware with which to generate stereoscopic images was designed. This system utilized the conventional equipment found in meeting rooms. The off-axis algorithm was adopted to convert the CT images into stereo image pairs which were used as the input for a stereo generator. The final stereoscopic images were displayed using a projection system. Several CT fracture images were imported into the system for comparison with traditional 2D CT images. The results showed that the proposed system aids clinicians in group discussions by producing large stereoscopic images. The results demonstrated that the enhanced stereoscopic CT images generated by the system appear clearer and smoother such that the sizes displacement and shapes of bone fragments are easier to assess. Certain fractures that were previously not visible on 2D CT images due to vision overlap became vividly evident in the stereo images. The proposed projection display system efficiently economically and accurately displayed three-dimensional 3D CT images. The system may help clinicians improve the diagnosis and treatment of fractures. A novel stereoscopic projection display system for CT images of fractures.
