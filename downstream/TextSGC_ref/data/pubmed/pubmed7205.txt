Hashing algorithm has been widely used to speed up image retrieval due to its compact binary code and fast distance calculation. The combination with deep learning boosts the performance of hashing by learning accurate representations and complicated hashing functions. So far the most striking success in deep hashing have mostly involved discriminative models which require labels. To apply deep hashing on datasets without labels we propose a deep self-taught hashing algorithm DSTH which generates a set of pseudo labels by analyzing the data itself and then learns the hash functions for novel data using discriminative deep models. Furthermore we generalize DSTH to support both supervised and unsupervised cases by adaptively incorporating label information. We use two different deep learning framework to train the hash functions to deal with out-of-sample problem and reduce the time complexity without loss of accuracy. We have conducted extensive experiments to investigate different settings of DSTH and compared it with state-of-the-art counterparts in six publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that DSTH outperforms the others in all datasets. Deep Self-Taught Hashing for Image Retrieval.
