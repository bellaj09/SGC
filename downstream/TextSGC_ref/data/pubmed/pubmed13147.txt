Congenital anomalies are seen at 1-3% of the population probabilities of which are tried to be found out primarily through double triple and quad tests during pregnancy. Also ultrasonographical evaluations of fetuses enhance detecting and defining these abnormalities. About 60-70% of the anomalies can be diagnosed via ultrasonography while the remaining 30-40% can be diagnosed after childbirth. Medical diagnosis and prediction is a topic that is closely related with e-Health and machine learning. e-Health applications are critically important especially for the patients unable to see a doctor or any health professional. Our objective is to help clinicians and families to better predict fetal congenital anomalies besides the traditional pregnancy tests using machine learning techniques and e-Health applications. Fetal health status prediction based on maternal clinical history using machine learning techniques.
