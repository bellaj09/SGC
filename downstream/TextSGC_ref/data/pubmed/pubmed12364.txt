Perforator flaps have recently gained considerable popularity in reconstructive surgery and their importance and advantages over conventional flaps have been widely accepted. Given the improvements in microsurgical techniques researchers have encouraged the search for further perforator flap sources such as a perforator flap with a short pedicle only. The purpose of this study was to describe a true perforator flap model with a short vascular pedicle in the abdominal region in the rat. A supermicrosurgical flap model in the rat: a free true abdominal perforator flap with a short pedicle.
