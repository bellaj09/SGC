Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI has become very important for noninvasively characterizing BOLD signal fluctuations which reflect the changes in neuronal firings in the brain. Unlike the activation detection strategy utilized with fMRI which only emphasizes the synchronicity between the functional nodes activated regions and the task design brain connectivity and network theory are able to decipher the interactive structure across the entire brain. However little is known about whether and how the activated/less-activated interactions are associated with the functional changes that occur when the brain changes from the resting state to a task state. What are the key networks that play important roles in the brain state changes? Both activated and less-activated regions identified by functional MRI reconfigure to support task executions.
