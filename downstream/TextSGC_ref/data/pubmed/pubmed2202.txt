"Parkinsons disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the motor system. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI has demonstrated deficits in anisotropy as well as increased diffusivity in the sub-cortical structures primarily in the substantia nigra in PD. However the clinical spectrum of PD is not limited to motor symptoms; rather it encompasses several nonmotor symptoms such as depression psychosis olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment. These nonmotor symptoms underscore PD as a complex neurological disorder arising from dysfunction of several network components. Therefore to decipher the underlying neuropathology it is crucial to employ novel network-based methods that can elucidate associations between specific network changes. This study aimed at assessing the large-scale structural network changes in PD. Structural connectomes were computed by using probabilistic fiber tracking on diffusion MRI between 86 regions of interest. Graph theoretic analysis on the connectome was carried out at several levels of granularity: global local nodal lobar and edge wise. Our findings demonstrate lower network clustering capability overall lower neural connectivity and significantly reduced nodal influence of the hippocampus in PD. In addition extensive patterns of reduced connectivity were observed within and between the temporal parietal and occipital areas. In summary our findings corroborate widespread structural disconnectivity that can be potentially linked to the nonmotor symptoms in PD."
