"Recently it has been shown to be possible to ascertain the target of a subjects attention in a cocktail party environment from single-trial ~60 s electroencephalography EEG data. Specifically this was shown in the context of a dichotic listening paradigm where subjects were cued to attend to a story in one ear while ignoring a different story in the other and were required to answer questions on both stories. This paradigm resulted in a high decoding accuracy that correlated with task performance across subjects. Here we extend this finding by showing that the ability to accurately decode attentional selection in a dichotic speech paradigm is robust to the particular attention task at hand. Subjects attended to one of two dichotically presented stories under four task conditions. These conditions required subjects to 1 answer questions on the content of both stories 2 detect irregular frequency fluctuations in the voice of the attended speaker 3 answer questions on both stories and detect frequency fluctuations in the attended story and 4 detect target words in the attended story. All four tasks led to high decoding accuracy ~89%. These results offer new possibilities for creating user-friendly brain computer interfaces BCIs." Decoding of attentional selection in a cocktail party environment from single-trial EEG is robust to task.
