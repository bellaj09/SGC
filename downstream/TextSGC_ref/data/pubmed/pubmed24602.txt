Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is a non-invasive multi-channel imaging tool for assessing brain activities which has shown its high potential in brain-computer interface BCI technique. Most previous studies have focused on constructing high dimensional features from whole channels adding to the complexity of their classifiers. Another multi-channel source for BCI is electroencephalograph EEG which possesses different spatial and temporal features from fNIRS. In EEG field Common Spatial Pattern CSP algorithm is widely used aimed at dimensionality reduction. In our article we modified it based on the characteristics of fNIRS and evaluated its effectiveness in discriminating Mental Arithmetic MA against resting status in an open-access dataset. The Modified Common Spatial Pattern algorithm significantly outperforms CSP algorithm in fNIRS-based BCI and shows its potential in further BCI related explorations. A Modified Common Spatial Pattern Algorithm Customized for Feature Dimensionality Reduction in fNIRS-Based BCIs.
