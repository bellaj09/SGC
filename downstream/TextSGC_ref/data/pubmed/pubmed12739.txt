Classification of protein sequences is one big task in bioinformatics and has many applications. Different machine learning methods exist and are applied on these problems such as support vector machines SVM random forests RF and neural networks NN. All of these methods have in common that protein sequences have to be made machine-readable and comparable in the first step for which different encodings exist. These encodings are typically based on physical or chemical properties of the sequence. However due to the outstanding performance of deep neural networks DNN on image recognition we used frequency matrix chaos game representation FCGR for encoding of protein sequences into images. In this study we compare the performance of SVMs RFs and DNNs trained on FCGR encoded protein sequences. While the original chaos game representation CGR has been used mainly for genome sequence encoding and classification we modified it to work also for protein sequences resulting in n-flakes representation an image with several icosagons.
