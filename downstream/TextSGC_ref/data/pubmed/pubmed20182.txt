Few interventions address multiple sclerosis MS arm dysfunction but robotics and functional electrical stimulation FES appear promising. This paper investigates the feasibility of combining FES with passive robotic support during virtual reality VR training tasks to improve upper limb function in people with multiple sclerosis pwMS. The system assists patients in following a specified trajectory path employing an advanced model-based paradigm termed iterative learning control ILC to adjust the FES to improve accuracy and maximise voluntary effort. Reaching tasks were repeated six times with ILC learning the optimum control action from previous attempts. A convenience sample of five pwMS was recruited from local MS societies and the intervention comprised 18 one-hour training sessions over 10 weeks. The accuracy of tracking performance without FES and the amount of FES delivered during training were analyzed using regression analysis. Clinical functioning of the arm was documented before and after treatment with standard tests. Statistically significant results following training included: improved accuracy of tracking performance both when assisted and unassisted by FES; reduction in maximum amount of FES needed to assist tracking; and less impairment in the proximal arm that was trained. The system was well tolerated by all participants with no increase in muscle fatigue reported. This study confirms the feasibility of FES combined with passive robot assistance as a potentially effective intervention to improve arm movement and control in pwMS and provides the basis for a follow-up study.
