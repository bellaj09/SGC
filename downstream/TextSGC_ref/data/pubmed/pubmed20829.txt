With respect to single trial detection of event-related potentials ERPs spatial and spectral filters are two of the most commonly used pre-processing techniques for signal enhancement. Spatial filters reduce the dimensionality of the data while suppressing the noise contribution and spectral filters attenuate frequency components that most likely belong to noise subspace. However the frequency spectrum of ERPs overlap with that of the ongoing electroencephalogram EEG and different types of artifacts. Therefore proper selection of the spectral filter cutoffs is not a trivial task. In this research work we developed a supervised method to estimate the spatial and finite impulse response FIR spectral filters simultaneously. We evaluated the performance of the method on offline single trial classification of ERPs in datasets recorded during an oddball paradigm. The proposed spatio-spectral filter improved the overall single-trial classification performance by almost 9% on average compared with the case that no spatial filters were used. We also analyzed the effects of different spectral filter lengths and the number of retained channels after spatial filtering. A periodic spatio-spectral filter for event-related potentials.
