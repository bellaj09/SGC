"In this paper a deep learning DL-based physical PHY layer authentication framework is proposed to enhance the security of industrial wireless sensor networks IWSNs. Three algorithms the deep neural network DNN-based sensor nodes authentication method the convolutional neural network CNN-based sensor nodes authentication method and the convolution preprocessing neural network CPNN-based sensor nodes authentication method have been adopted to implement the PHY-layer authentication in IWSNs. Among them the improved CPNN-based algorithm requires few computing resources and has extremely low latency which enable a lightweight multi-node PHY-layer authentication. The adaptive moment estimation Adam accelerated gradient algorithm and minibatch skill are used to accelerate the training of the neural networks. Simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm and a brief analysis of the application scenarios for each algorithm is discussed. Moreover the experiments have been performed with universal software radio peripherals USRPs to evaluate the authentication performance of the proposed algorithms. Due to the trainings being performed on the edge sides the proposed method can implement a lightweight authentication for the sensor nodes under the edge computing EC system in IWSNs."
