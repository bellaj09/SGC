Neuroimaging data have demonstrated brain functional alterations in patients with somatization disorder SD. However there is little information on interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity FC in SD. In this study resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity VMHC were applied to examine the changes of interhemispheric FC of the whole brain in patients with SD. A total of 25 first-episode medication-naive SD patients and 28 age- sex- education-matched healthy controls HC underwent resting-state fMRI and the data were analyzed by VMHC. Compared with HC patients had lower VMHC in the angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus AG/SG and insula. The reproducibility of the results was validated using the split-half and leave-one-out validations. No significant correlation was found between the VMHC in AG/SG or insula and clinical variables. Our findings indicate that the interhemispheric FC in the AG/SG and insula is decreased in first-episode treatment-naive patients with SD and thus provide new insight for disruption of interhemispheric FC in the pathophysiological mechanism of SD. Decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity in insula and angular gyrus/supramarginal gyrus: Significant findings in first-episode drug-naive somatization disorder.
