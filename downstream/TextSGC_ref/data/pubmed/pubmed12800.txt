"Alzheimers Disease AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease where biomarkers for disease based on pathophysiology may be able to provide objective measures for disease diagnosis and staging. Neuroimaging scans acquired from MRI and metabolism images obtained by FDG-PET provide in-vivo measurements of structure and function glucose metabolism in a living brain. It is hypothesized that combining multiple different image modalities providing complementary information could help improve early diagnosis of AD. In this paper we propose a novel deep-learning-based framework to discriminate individuals with AD utilizing a multimodal and multiscale deep neural network. Our method delivers 82.4% accuracy in identifying the individuals with mild cognitive impairment MCI who will convert to AD at 3 years prior to conversion 86.4% combined accuracy for conversion within 1-3 years a 94.23% sensitivity in classifying individuals with clinical diagnosis of probable AD and a 86.3% specificity in classifying non-demented controls improving upon results in published literature."
