Recent years have seen growing interest in measuring axonal water fraction AWF using the spherical mean diffusion weighted signal but information about the reproducibility of this method is needed before applying it in large-scale studies. The current study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of AWF derived from the spherical mean signal method. This retrospective study analyzed the Human Connectome Project HCP test-retest diffusion data of ten healthy adults. The diffusion scan was performed two times for each subject. Diffusion tensor imaging-based fractional anisotropy FA was calculated with b\u202f=\u202f1000\u202fs/mm2. AWF was calculated with b\u202f=\u202f3000\u202fs/mm2 using the spherical mean signal method. Gradient nonlinearities were corrected in both methods. Reproducibility was assessed using the reproducibility error which is the percent absolute change relative to the mean. The mean reproducibility error of fractional anisotropy FA is 9.7\u202f\u202f1.0% in white matter and 18.0\u202f\u202f2.0% in gray matter. The mean reproducibility error of AWF is 4.6\u202f\u202f0.6% in white matter and 7.0\u202f\u202f1.5% in gray matter. Spherical mean signal-based AWF is more reproducible than FA for the HCP high resolution low signal-to-noise ratio diffusion data.
