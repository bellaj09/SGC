Sanjad-Sakati syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that was first reported by Sanjad et al. in 1988. It is characterized by congenital hypoparathyroidism severe growth failure and dysmorphic features. The clinical features include deep set eyes microcephaly thin lips depressed nasal bridge with beaked nose external ear anomalies and learning difficulties. This report presents the case of a 4-year-old patient who was referred to our dental clinic because of pain in her mouth and poor dental health. Oral findings included micrognathic mandible and maxilla microdontia enamel hypoplasia as well as severely decayed teeth. Treatment was carried out under general anaesthesia to extract the most severely affected teeth and restore those which could be conserved. It was concluded that these patients have special dental needs; early diagnosis of the affected children is therefore important in order to commence preventive dental therapy and carry out appropriate dental treatment at the optimum time.
