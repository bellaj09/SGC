In humans the extent to which body-based cues such as vestibular somatosensory and motoric cues are necessary for normal expression of spatial representations remains unclear. Recent breakthroughs in immersive virtual reality technology allowed us to test how body-based cues influence spatial representations of large-scale environments in humans. Specifically we manipulated the availability\xa0of body-based cues during navigation using an omnidirectional treadmill and a head-mounted display investigating brain differences in levels of activation i.e. univariate analysis patterns of activity i.e. multivariate pattern analysis and putative network interactions between spatial retrieval tasks using fMRI. Our behavioral and neuroimaging results support the idea that there is a core modality-independent network supporting spatial memory retrieval in the human brain. Thus for well-learned spatial environments at least in humans primarily visual input may be sufficient for expression of complex representations of spatial environments. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
