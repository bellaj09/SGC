"Computer systems are being used increasingly to aid the assessment and self-treatment of mental health problems in adults. Systems vary hugely in the extent to which they meet all patients assessment and therapy needs and save clinicians time. Hardly any single system 1 performs every task required from initial screening to the end of follow-up 2 works 100% independently of contact with a clinician or technician and 3 is widely available and supported. Most systems use desk- or laptop computers. Some now use palmtop hand-held computers. A few employ computerized phone interviews interactive voice response usually from home. Virtual reality as a tool is embryonic. Computer aids save time in screening and outcome-tracking in a wide variety of problems. Computer aids to treatment have had promising outcomes in phobic anxiety panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders nonsuicidal depression obesity and smoking cessation. Some systems are installed in a few places as part of everyday clinical care. A growing number should soon be robust enough to ease the lives of many patients practitioners and researchers if use of the systems is carefully integrated into normal clinical practice."
