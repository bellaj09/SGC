Diabetes is responsible for considerable morbidity healthcare utilisation and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Currently methods of treating diabetes are inadequate and costly so prevention becomes an important step in reducing the burden of diabetes and its complications. Electronic health records EHRs for each individual or a population have become important tools in understanding developing trends of diseases. Using EHRs to predict the onset of diabetes could improve the quality and efficiency of medical care. In this paper we apply a wide and deep learning model that combines the strength of a generalised linear model with various features and a deep feed-forward neural network to improve the prediction of the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM. Predicting the onset of type 2 diabetes using wide and deep learning with electronic health records.
