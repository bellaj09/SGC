Error-related potentials ErrP have been proposed as an intuitive feedback signal decoded from the ongoing electroencephalogram EEG of a human observer for improving human-robot interaction HRI. While recent demonstrations of this approach have successfully studied the use of ErrPs as a teaching signal for robot skill learning so far no efforts have been made towards HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required. These are collaborative or social interactive scenarios without predefined dominancy of the human partner and robots being perceived as intentional agents. Here we explore the usability of ErrPs as a feedback signal from the human for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction. Human-agent co-adaptation using error-related potentials.
