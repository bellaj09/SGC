"Modularity modifiability reusability and API usability are important software qualities that determine the maintainability of software architectures. Virtual Augmented and Mixed Reality VR AR MR systems modern computer games as well as interactive human-robot systems often include various dedicated input- output- and processing subsystems. These subsystems collectively maintain a real-time simulation of a coherent application state. The resulting interdependencies between individual state representations mutual state access overall synchronization and flow of control implies a conceptual close coupling whereas software quality asks for a decoupling to develop maintainable solutions. This article presents five semantics-based software techniques that address this contradiction: Semantic grounding code from semantics grounded actions semantic queries and decoupling by semantics. These techniques are applied to extend the well-established entity-component-system ECS pattern to overcome some of this patterns deficits with respect to the implied state access. A walk-through of central implementation aspects of a multimodal speech and gesture VR-interface is used to highlight the techniques benefits. This use-case is chosen as a prototypical example of complex architectures with multiple interacting subsystems found in many VR AR and MR architectures. Finally implementation hints are given lessons learned regarding maintainability pointed-out and performance implications discussed."
