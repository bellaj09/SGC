Simultaneous recordings of neural activity at large scale in the long term and under bio-safety conditions can provide essential data. These data can be used to advance the technology for brain-machine interfaces in clinical applications and to understand brain function. For this purpose we present a new multichannel neural recording system that can record up to 4096-channel ch electrocorticogram data by multiple connections of customized application-specific integrated circuits ASICs. The ASIC includes 64-ch low-noise amplifiers analog time-division multiplexers and 12-bit successive approximation register ADCs. Recorded data sampled at a rate of 1 kS/s are multiplexed with time division via an integrated multiplex board and in total 51.2 Mbps of raw data for 4096 ch are generated. This system has an ultra-wideband UWB wireless unit for transmitting the recorded neural signals. The ASICs multiplex boards and UWB transmitter unit are designed with the aim of implanting them. From preliminary experiments with a human body-equivalent liquid phantom we confirmed 4096-ch UWB wireless data transmission at 128 Mbps for distances below 20 mm .
