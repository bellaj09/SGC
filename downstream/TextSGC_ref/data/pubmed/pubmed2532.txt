Physical and chemical cues from the environment are used to direct animal behavior through a complex network of connections originating in exteroceptors. In chordates mechanosensory and chemosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system PNS must signal to the motor circuits of the central nervous system CNS through a series of pathways that integrate and regulate the output to motor neurons MN; ultimately these drive contraction of the tail and limb muscles. We used serial-section electron microscopy to reconstruct PNS neurons and their hitherto unknown synaptic networks in the tadpole larva of a sibling chordate the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. The larva has groups of neurons in its apical papillae epidermal neurons in the rostral and apical trunk caudal neurons in the dorsal and ventral epidermis and a single tail tip neuron. The connectome reveals that the PNS input arises from scattered groups of these epidermal neurons 54 in total and has three main centers of integration in the CNS: in the anterior brain vesicle which additionally receives input from photoreceptors of the ocellus the motor ganglion which contains five pairs of MN and the tail all of which in turn are themselves interconnected through important functional relay neurons. Some neurons have long collaterals that form autapses. Our study reveals interconnections with other sensory systems and the exact inputs to the motor system required to regulate contractions in the tail that underlie larval swimming or to the CNS to regulate substrate preference prior to the induction of larval settlement and metamorphosis.
