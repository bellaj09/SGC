Automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk OARs is a key step in radiation treatment planning to reduce human efforts and bias. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN have shown great success in many medical image segmentation applications but there are still challenges in dealing with large 3D images for optimal results. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel DCNN method for thoracic OARs segmentation using cropped 3D images. Deep convolutional neural network for segmentation of thoracic organs-at-risk using cropped 3D images.
