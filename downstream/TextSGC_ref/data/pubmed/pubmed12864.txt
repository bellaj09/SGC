The identification of patients with aggressive cancer who require immediate therapy is a health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries. Limited pathology resources high healthcare costs and large-case loads call for the development of advanced standalone diagnostics. Here we report and validate an automated low-cost point-of-care device for the molecular diagnosis of aggressive lymphomas. The device uses contrast-enhanced microholography and a deep-learning algorithm to directly analyse percutaneously obtained fine-needle aspirates. We show the feasibility and high accuracy of the device in cells as well as the prospective validation of the results in 40 patients clinically referred for image-guided aspiration of nodal mass lesions suspicious for lymphoma. Automated analysis of human samples with the portable device should allow for the accurate classification of patients with benign and malignant adenopathy. Design and clinical validation of a point-of-care device for the diagnosis of lymphoma via contrast-enhanced microholography and machine learning.
