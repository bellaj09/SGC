Humans are capable of learning a new fine-grained concept with very little supervision e.g. few exemplary images for a species of bird yet our best deep learning systems need hundreds or thousands of labeled examples. In this paper we try to reduce this gap by studying the fine-grained image recognition problem in a challenging few-shot learning setting termed few-shot fine-grained recognition FSFG. The task of FSFG requires the learning systems to build classifiers for the novel fine-grained categories from few examples only one or less than five. To solve this problem we propose an end-to-end trainable deep network which is inspired by the state-of-the-art fine-grained recognition model and is tailored for the FSFG task. Specifically our network consists of a bilinear feature learning module and a classifier mapping module: while the former encodes the discriminative information of an exemplar image into a feature vector the latter maps the intermediate feature into the decision boundary of the novel category. The key novelty of our model is a "piecewise mappings" function in the classifier mapping module which generates the decision boundary via learning a set of more attainable sub-classifiers in a more parameter-economic way. We learn the exemplar-to-classifier mapping based on an auxiliary dataset in a meta-learning fashion which is expected to be able to generalize to novel categories. By conducting comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained datasets we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over the competing baselines.
