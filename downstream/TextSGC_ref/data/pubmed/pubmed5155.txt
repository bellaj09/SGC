Moral competence MC refers to the ability to apply certain moral orientations in a consistent and differentiated manner when judging moral issues. People greatly differ in terms of MC however little is known about how these differences are implemented in the brain. To investigate this question we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and examined resting-state functional connectivity RSFC in n=31 individuals with MC scores in the highest 15% of the population and n=33 individuals with MC scores in the lowest 15% selected from a large sample of 730 Master of Business Administration MBA students. Compared to individuals with lower MC individuals with higher MC showed greater amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal connectivity which may reflect better ability to cope with emotional conflicts elicited by moral dilemmas. Moreover individuals with higher MC showed less inter-network connectivity between the amygdalar and fronto-parietal networks suggesting a more independent operation of these networks. Our findings provide novel insights into how individual differences in moral judgment are associated with RSFC in brain circuits related to emotion processing and cognitive control.
