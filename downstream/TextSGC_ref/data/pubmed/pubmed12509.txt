"The integration of the latest breakthroughs in bioinformatics technology from one side and artificial intelligence from another side enables remarkable advances in the fields of intelligent security guard computational biology healthcare and so on. Among them biometrics based automatic human identification is one of the most fundamental and significant research topic. Human gait which is a biometric features with the unique capability has gained significant attentions as the remarkable characteristics of remote accessed robust and security in the biometrics based human identification. However the existed methods cannot well handle the indistinctive inter-class differences and large intra-class variations of human gait in real-world situation. In this paper we have developed an efficient spatial-temporal gait features with deep learning for human identification. First of all we proposed a gait energy image GEI based Siamese neural network to automatically extract robust and discriminative spatial gait features for human identification. Furthermore we exploit the deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks to learn the human gait convolutional 3D C3D as the temporal gait features. Finally the GEI and C3D gait features are embedded into the null space by the Null Foley-Sammon Transform NFST. In the new space the spatial-temporal features are sufficiently combined with distance metric learning to drive the similarity metric to be small for pairs of gait from the same person and large for pairs from different persons. Consequently the experiments on the worlds largest gait database show our framework impressively outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
