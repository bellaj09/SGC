Arthroplasty skills need to be acquired safely during training yet operative experience is increasingly hard to acquire by trainees. Virtual reality VR training using headsets and motion-tracked controllers can simulate complex open procedures in a fully immersive operating theatre. The present study aimed to determine if trainees trained using VR perform better than those using conventional preparation for performing total hip arthroplasty THA. Virtual reality training improves trainee performance in total hip arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial.
