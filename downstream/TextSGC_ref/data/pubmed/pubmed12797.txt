Lower extremity and low back injuries represent a significant financial burden on the military healthcare system. Subsequent injuries often occur during the recuperation period or in the period directly after physical therapy ends when the patient returns to full duty. Medical providers have relatively few objective tools with which to determine if someone is ready for return to duty RTD. The purpose of this study is to assess interrater and test-retest reliability of a novel gender-neutral RTD screening tool that requires minimal training equipment and time. Reliability of a Novel Return to Duty Screening Tool for Military Clinicians.
