In the United States the Federal Communications Commission has adopted rules permitting commercial wireless networks to share spectrum with federal incumbents in the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service band. These rules require commercial systems to vacate the band when sensors detect radars operated by the U.S. military; a key example being the SPN-43 air traffic control radar. Such sensors require highly-accurate detection algorithms to meet their operating requirements. In this paper using a library of over 14000 3.5 GHz band spectrograms collected by a recent measurement campaign we investigate the performance of thirteen methods for SPN-43 radar detection. Namely we compare classical methods from signal detection theory and machine learning to several deep learning architectures. We demonstrate that machine learning algorithms appreciably outperform classical signal detection methods. Specifically we find that a three-layer convolutional neural network offers a superior tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. Last we apply this three-layer network to generate descriptive statistics for the full 3.5 GHz spectrogram library. Our findings highlight potential weaknesses of classical methods and strengths of modern machine learning algorithms for radar detection in the 3.5 GHz band.
