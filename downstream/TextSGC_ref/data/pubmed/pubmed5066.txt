Objective: To determine whether the rich-club organization essential for information transport in the human connectome is an important biomarker of functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke AIS. Methods: Consecutive AIS patients N = 344 with acute brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI <48 h were eligible for this study. Each patient underwent a clinical MRI protocol which included diffusion weighted imaging DWI. All DWIs were registered to a template on which rich-club regions have been defined. Using manual outlines of stroke lesions we automatically counted the number of affected rich-club regions and assessed its effect on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale mRS; obtained at 90 days post-stroke scores through ordinal regression. Results: Of 344 patients median age 65 inter-quartile range 54-76 years with a median DWI lesion volume DWIv of 3cc 64% were male. We established that an increase in number of rich-club regions affected by a stroke increases the odds of poor stroke outcome measured by NIHSS OR: 1.77 95%CI 1.41-2.21 and mRS OR: 1.38 95%CI 1.11-1.73. Additionally we demonstrated that the OR exceeds traditional markers such as DWIv ORNIHSS 1.08 95%CI 1.06-1.11; ORmRS 1.05 95%CI 1.03-1.07 and age ORNIHSS 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05; ORmRS 1.05 95%CI 1.03-1.07. Conclusion: In this proof-of-concept study the number of rich-club nodes affected by a stroke lesion presents a translational biomarker of stroke outcome which can be readily assessed using standard clinical AIS imaging protocols and considered in functional outcome prediction models beyond traditional factors.
