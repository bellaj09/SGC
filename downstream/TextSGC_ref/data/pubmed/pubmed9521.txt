Cerebral stroke has become a significant global public health issue in recent years. The ideal solution to this concern is to prevent in advance by controlling related metabolic factors. However it is difficult for medical staff to decide whether special precautions are needed for a potential patient only based on the monitoring of physiological indicators unless they are obviously abnormal. This paper will develop a hybrid machine learning approach to predict cerebral stroke for clinical diagnosis based on the physiological data with incompleteness and class imbalance. A hybrid machine learning approach to cerebral stroke prediction based on imbalanced medical dataset.
