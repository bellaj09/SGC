"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the practice of rotating Virtual Reality VR three-dimensional 3D objects will enhance the spatial rotation thinking of deaf and hard-of-hearing children compared to the practice of rotating two-dimensional 2D objects. Two groups were involved in this study: an experimental group which included 21 deaf and hardof-hearing children who played a VR 3D game and a control group of 23 deaf and hard-of-hearing children who played a similar 2D not VR game. The results clearly indicate that practicing with VR 3D spatial rotations significantly improved the childrens performance of spatial rotation which enhanced their ability to perform better in other intellectual skills as well as in their sign language skills."
