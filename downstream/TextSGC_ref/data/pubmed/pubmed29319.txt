We developed a brain-machine interface BMI system for poststroke patients with severe hemiplegia to detect event-related desynchronization ERD on scalp electroencephalogram EEG and to operate a motor-driven hand orthosis combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation. ERD arises when the excitability of the ipsi-lesional sensorimotor cortex increases.
