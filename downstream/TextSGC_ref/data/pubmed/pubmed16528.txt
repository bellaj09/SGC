"Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients overall survival are important for diagnosis treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through a majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction we extract 4524 radiomic features from segmented tumor regions then a decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. The 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge BraTS ranks our method at 2nd and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams for survival prediction tasks and segmentation tasks respectively achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on the classification of short-survivors mid-survivors and long-survivors."
