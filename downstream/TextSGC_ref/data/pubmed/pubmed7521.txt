We hypothesize that convolutional neural networks CNN can be used to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy NAC response using a breast MRI tumor dataset prior to initiation of chemotherapy. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of our database from January 2009 to June 2016 identified 141 locally advanced breast cancer patients who 1 underwent breast MRI prior to the initiation of NAC 2 successfully completed adriamycin/taxane-based NAC and 3 underwent surgical resection with available final surgical pathology data. Patients were classified into three groups based on their NAC response confirmed on final surgical pathology: complete group 1 partial group 2 and no response/progression group 3. A total of 3107 volumetric slices of 141 tumors were evaluated. Breast tumor was identified on first T1 postcontrast dynamic images and underwent 3D segmentation. CNN consisted of ten convolutional layers four max-pooling layers and dropout of 50% after a fully connected layer. Dropout augmentation and L2 regularization were implemented to prevent overfitting of data. Non-linear functions were modeled by a rectified linear unit ReLU. Batch normalization was used between the convolutional and ReLU layers to limit drift of layer activations during training. A three-class neoadjuvant prediction model was evaluated group 1 group 2 or group 3. The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in three-class prediction of neoadjuvant treatment response. Three-class prediction discriminating one group from the other two was analyzed. Group 1 had a specificity of 95.1%\u2009\u20093.1% sensitivity of 73.9%\u2009\u20094.5% and accuracy of 87.7%\u2009\u20090.6%. Group 2 partial response had a specificity of 91.6%\u2009\u20091.3% sensitivity of 82.4%\u2009\u20092.7% and accuracy of 87.7%\u2009\u20090.6%. Group 3 no response/progression had a specificity of 93.4%\u2009\u20092.9% sensitivity of 76.8%\u2009\u20095.7% and accuracy of 87.8%\u2009\u20090.6%. It is feasible for current deep CNN architectures to be trained to predict NAC treatment response using a breast MRI dataset obtained prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Larger dataset will likely improve our prediction model. Prior to Initiation of Chemotherapy Can We Predict Breast Tumor Response?
