Basic science courses are extremely important as a foundation for scaffolding knowledge and then applying it in future courses clinical situations as well as in a professional career. Anatomical sciences which include tooth morphology oral histology oral embryology and head and neck anatomy form a core part of the preclinical courses in dental technology programs. In this article the importance and relevance of anatomical sciences to dental personnel with no direct contact with patients dental technicians and limited discipline related contact with patients dental prosthetists is highlighted. Some light is shed on the role of anatomical sciences in the pedagogical framework and its significance in the educational process and interprofessional learning of dental technicians and prosthetists using oral biology as an example in the dental curriculum. To conclude anatomical sciences allow dental technicians and prosthetists to a gain a better insight of how tissues function leading to a better understanding of diagnosis comprehensive treatment planning and referrals if needed. Patient communication and satisfaction also increases as a result of this deep understanding of oral tissues. Anatomical sciences bridge the gap between basic science preclinical and clinical courses which leads to a holistic approach in patient management. Finally treatment outcomes are positively affected due to the appreciation of the macro and micro structure of oral tissues. Anat Sci Educ 10: 395-404. Anatomical sciences: A foundation for a solid learning experience in dental technology and dental prosthetics.
