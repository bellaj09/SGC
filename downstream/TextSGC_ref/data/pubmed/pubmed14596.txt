The contradiction between the field of view FOV luminance uniformity LU and weight has always restricted the development of augmented reality display systems. An on-axis near-eye display NED system based on directional scattering holographic waveguide DSHW and curved goggle is proposed in order to realize a large FOV with high LU light weight and conformal design capability. The DSHW which consists of a linear volume holographic grating and holographic diffuser is used to deliver the virtual image and construct a transparent directional emission display screen with high LU. The curved goggle is used to project the image on the display screen into human eye and form a large FOV with a suitable exit pupil diameter EPD and eye relief distance ERF and while keeping the external scene visible. Our proposed NED achieved an FOV of 44 horizontal H  12 vertical V easily which is almost consistent with the theoretical design. The EPD is 6 mm ERF is 18.6 mm and LU is about 88.09% at full viewing angle. The system is lightweight and flexible which can be further applied in the next-generation integrated protection-display helmet system through conformal optical design.
