A P300-based brain-computer interface BCI enables a wide range of people to control devices that improve their quality of life. Ensemble classifiers with naive partitioning were recently applied to the P300-based BCI and these classification performances were assessed. However they were usually trained on a large amount of training data e.g. 15300. In this study we evaluated ensemble linear discriminant analysis LDA classifiers with a newly proposed overlapped partitioning method using 900 training data. In addition the classification performances of the ensemble classifier with naive partitioning and a single LDA classifier were compared. One of three conditions for dimension reduction was applied: the stepwise method principal component analysis PCA or none. The results show that an ensemble stepwise LDA SWLDA classifier with overlapped partitioning achieved a better performance than the commonly used single SWLDA classifier and an ensemble SWLDA classifier with naive partitioning. This result implies that the performance of the SWLDA is improved by overlapped partitioning and the ensemble classifier with overlapped partitioning requires less training data than that with naive partitioning. This study contributes towards reducing the required amount of training data and achieving better classification performance.
