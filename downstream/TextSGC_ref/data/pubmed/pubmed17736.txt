Profiling gene expression in brain structures at various spatial and temporal scales is essential to understanding how genes regulate the development of brain structures. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas provides high-resolution 3-D in situ hybridization ISH gene expression patterns in multiple developing stages of the mouse brain. Currently the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms manually. In this paper we propose a computational approach to annotate gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural levels over the course of development. Deep convolutional neural networks for annotating gene expression patterns in the mouse brain.
