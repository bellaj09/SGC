Proteins play important roles in living organisms and their function is directly linked with their structure. Due to the growing gap between the number of proteins being discovered and their functional characterization in particular as a result of experimental limitations reliable prediction of protein function through computational means has become crucial. This paper reviews the machine learning techniques used in the literature following their evolution from simple algorithms such as logistic regression to more advanced methods like support vector machines and modern deep neural networks. Hyperparameter optimization methods adopted to boost prediction performance are presented. In parallel the metamorphosis in the features used by these algorithms from classical physicochemical properties and amino acid composition up to text-derived features from biomedical literature and learned feature representations using autoencoders together with feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques are also reviewed. The success stories in the application of these techniques to both general and specific protein function prediction are discussed. Machine learning techniques for protein function prediction.
