"With the advancement of treatment modalities in radiation therapy for cancer patients outcomes have improved but at the cost of increased treatment plan complexity and planning time. The accurate prediction of dose distributions would alleviate this issue by guiding clinical plan optimization to save time and maintain high quality plans. We have modified a convolutional deep network model U-net originally designed for segmentation purposes for predicting dose from patient image contours of the planning target volume PTV and organs at risk OAR. We show that as an example we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT for prostate cancer patients where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in max mean dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose specifically for each structure is 1.80% 1.03%PTV 1.94% 4.22%Bladder 1.80% 0.48%Body 3.87% 1.79%L Femoral Head 5.07% 2.55%R Femoral Head and 1.26% 1.62%Rectum of the prescription dose. We thus managed to map a desired radiation dose distribution from a patients PTV and OAR contours. As an additional advantage relatively little data was used in the techniques and models described in this paper."
