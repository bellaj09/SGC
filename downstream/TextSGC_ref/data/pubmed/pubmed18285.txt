Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of morbidity and premature mortality in the United States. Approved pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation are marginally effective underscoring the need for improved pharmacotherapies. A novel approach might use glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 agonists which reduce alcohol and drug use in preclinical studies. GLP-1 is produced in the intestinal L-cells and in the hindbrain. The peptide maintains glucose homeostasis and reduces food intake. Several GLP-1 agonists are used clinically to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity but none have been tested in humans to reduce smoking.
