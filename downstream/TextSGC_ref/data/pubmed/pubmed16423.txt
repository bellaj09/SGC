"As affordable equipment electronic portal imaging devices EPIDs are wildly used in radiation therapy departments to verify patients positions for accurate radiotherapy. However these devices tend to produce visually ambiguous and low-contrast planar digital radiographs under megavoltage x ray MV-DRs which poses a tremendous challenge for clinicians to perform multimodal registration between the MV-DRs and the kilovoltage digital reconstructed radiographs KV-DRRs developed from the planning computed tomography. Furthermore the existent of strong appearance variations also makes accurate registration beyond the reach of current automatic algorithms." A modality conversion approach to MV-DRs and KV-DRRs registration using information bottlenecked conditional generative adversarial network.
