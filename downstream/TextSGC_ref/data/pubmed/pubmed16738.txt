"Phantom limb pain PLP is a clinically relevant consequence of limb amputation and its treatment is still challenging. Mirror therapy in other words observing and engaging in the intact limbs mirrored movements offers a promising mechanism-based treatment for PLP. However intervention and patient characteristics such as the realism of mirrored exercises and perceptions related to the phantom limb might influence treatment effectiveness. Novel approaches using augmented and virtual reality setups represent an alternative to traditional mirror therapy. In this paper based on recent studies in the field we compare both approaches and discuss their unique advantages and disadvantages. We argue for the necessity of a tailored treatment for PLP that is personalized to the patients characteristics preferences and psychological needs." Mirror therapy versus augmented/virtual reality applications: towards a tailored mechanism-based treatment for phantom limb pain.
