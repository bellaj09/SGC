The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a non-conventional input and output device virtual reality in a total hip replacement surgical planner. A test was performed asking five users to position a cup in a defined position. Every user performed the task using three different hardware configurations: I conventional mouse and monitor II mouse and auto-stereoscopic monitor and III 12-DOF tracker haptic device and auto-stereoscopic monitor. The results were evaluated in terms of root mean square error of the obtained position with respect to the target one and in terms of learning curve. The results showed that the examined VR technology does not show a sufficient positioning accuracy to be considered for clinical assessment. Effect of a virtual reality interface on the learning curve and on the accuracy of a surgical planner for total hip replacement.
