In this review we present immunohistochemical methods for visualization of capillaries and muscle fibres in thick muscle sections. Special attention is paid to the procedures that preserve good morphology. Applying confocal microscopy and virtual 3D stereological grids or tracing of capillaries in virtual reality length of capillaries within a muscle volume or length of capillaries adjacent to a muscle fibre per fibre length fibre surface area or fibre volume can be evaluated by an unbiased approach. Moreover 3D models of capillaries and muscle fibres can be produced. Comparison of the developed methods with counting capillary profiles from 2D sections is discussed and the reader is warned that counting capillary profiles from 2D sections can underestimate the capillary length by as much as 75 percent. Application of the described 3D methodology is illustrated by the anatomical remodelling of capillarity during acute denervation and early reinnervation in the rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Characterization of the capillary network in skeletal muscles from 3D data.
