Our aim was to characterize health beliefs about the human papillomavirus HPV vaccine in a large set of Twitter posts tweets. We collected a Twitter data set related to the HPV vaccine from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2017. We proposed a deep-learning-based framework to mine health beliefs on the HPV vaccine from Twitter. Deep learning achieved high performance in terms of sensitivity specificity and accuracy. A retrospective analysis of health beliefs found that HPV vaccine beliefs may be evolving on Twitter. Leveraging deep learning to understand health beliefs about the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine from social media.
