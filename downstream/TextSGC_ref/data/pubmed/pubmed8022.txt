Bipolar disorder BD is a common and disabling psychiatric condition with a severe socioeconomic impact. BD is treated with mood stabilizers among which lithium represents the first-line treatment. Lithium alone or in combination is effective in 60% of chronically treated patients but response remains\xa0heterogenous and a large number of patients require a change in therapy after several weeks or months. Many studies have so far tried to identify molecular and genetic markers that could help us to predict response to mood stabilizers\xa0or the risk for adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetic studies in BD\xa0have been for the most part focused on lithium but the complexity and variability of the response\xa0phenotype together with the unclear mechanism of action of lithium limited the power of these studies to identify robust biomarkers. Recent pharmacogenomic studies on lithium response have provided promising findings suggesting that the integration of genome-wide investigations with deep phenotyping in silico analyses and machine learning could lead us closer to personalized treatments for BD. Nevertheless to date none of the genes suggested by pharmacogenetic studies on mood stabilizers have been included in any of the genetic tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA for drug efficacy. On the other hand genetic information has been included in drug labels to test for the safety of carbamazepine and valproate. In this review we will outline available studies investigating the pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of lithium and other mood stabilizers with a specific focus on the limitations of these studies and potential strategies to overcome them. We will also discuss FDA-approved pharmacogenetic tests for treatments commonly used in the management of BD. The Role of Pharmacogenomics in Bipolar Disorder: Moving Towards Precision Medicine.
