"Understanding the function and connectivity of thalamic nuclei is critical for understanding normal and pathological brain function. The medial geniculate nucleus MGN has been studied mostly in the context of auditory processing and its connection to the auditory cortex. However there is a growing body of evidence that the MGN and surrounding associated areas MGN/S have a diversity of projections including those to the globus pallidus caudate/putamen amygdala hypothalamus and thalamus. Concomitantly pathways projecting to the medial geniculate include not only the inferior colliculus but also the auditory cortex insula cerebellum and globus pallidus. Here we expand our understanding of the connectivity of the MGN/S by using comparative diffusion weighted imaging with probabilistic tractography in both human and mouse brains most previous work was in rats. In doing so we provide the first report that attempts to match probabilistic tractography results between human and mice. Additionally we provide anterograde tracing results for the mouse brain which corroborate the probabilistic tractography findings. Overall the study provides evidence for the homology of MGN/S patterns of connectivity across species for understanding translational approaches to thalamic connectivity and function. Further it points to the utility of DTI in both human studies and small animal modeling and it suggests potential roles of these connections in human cognition behavior and disease."
