"The Turkish script is characterised by completely transparent bidirectional mappings between orthography and phonology. To date there has been no reported evidence of acquired dyslexia in Turkish speakers leading to the nave view that reading and writing problems in Turkish are probably rare. We examined the extent to which phonological impairment and orthographic transparency influence reading disorders in a native Turkish speaker. BRB is a bilingual Turkish-English speaker with deep dysphasia accompanied by acquired dyslexia in both languages. The main findings are an effect of imageability on reading in Turkish coincident with surface dyslexia in English and preserved nonword reading. BRBs acquired dyslexia suggests that damage to phonological representations might have a consequence for learning to read in Turkish. We argue that BRBs acquired dyslexia has a common locus in chronic underactivation of phonological representations in Turkish and English. Despite a common locus reading problems manifest themselves differently according to properties of the script and the type of task." Acquired dyslexia in a Turkish-English speaker.
