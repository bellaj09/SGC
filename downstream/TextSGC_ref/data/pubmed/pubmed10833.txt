The importance of T cells in immunotherapy has motivated developing technologies to improve therapeutic efficacy. One objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can distinguish T cell activity states in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NADPH. However recognizing robust activity patterns is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels. We demonstrate machine learning methods that can accurately classify T cell activity across human donors from NADPH intensity images. Using 8260 cropped single-cell images from six donors we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks CNNs pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone. Visualizing the images with dimension reduction provides intuition into why the CNNs achieve higher accuracy than other approaches.
