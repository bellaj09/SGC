We describe a fluorescence in situ hybridization method that permits detection of the localization and abundance of single mRNAs smFISH in cleared whole-mount adult Drosophila brains. The approach is rapid and multiplexable and does not require molecular amplification; it allows facile quantification of mRNA expression with subcellular resolution on a standard confocal microscope. We further demonstrate single-mRNA detection across the entire brain using a custom Bessel beam structured illumination microscope BB-SIM. Quantitative mRNA imaging throughout the entire Drosophila brain.
