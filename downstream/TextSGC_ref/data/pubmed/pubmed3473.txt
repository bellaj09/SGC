The insular cortex supports the conscious awareness of physical and emotional sensations and the ability to modulate the insula could have important clinical applications in psychiatry. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS uses transient magnetic fields to induce electrical currents in the superficial cortex. Given its deep location in the brain the insula may not be directly stimulated by rTMS; however rTMS may modulate the insula via its functional connections with superficial cortical regions. Furthermore low- versus high-frequency rTMS is thought to have opposing effects on cortical excitability and the present study investigated these effects on brain activity and functional connectivity with the insula. Separate groups of healthy participants n\u2009=\u200914 per group received low 1\u2009Hz- or high 10\u2009Hz-frequency rTMS in five daily sessions to the right postcentral gyrus a superficial region known to be functionally connected to the insula. Resting-state functional connectivity RSFC was measured pre- and post-rTMS. Both 1 and 10\u2009Hz rTMS increased RSFC between the right postcentral gyrus and the left insula. These results suggest that low- and high-frequency rTMS has similar long-term effects on brain activity and RSFC. However given the lack of difference we cannot exclude the possibility that these effects are simply due to a nonspecific effect. Given this limitation these unexpected results underscore the need for acoustic- and stimulation-matched sham control conditions in rTMS research.
