Virtual reality simulators allow trainees to practice techniques without consequences reduce potential risk associated with training minimize animal use and help to develop standards and optimize procedures. Current intravenous IV catheter placement training methods utilize plastic arms however the lack of variability can diminish the educational stimulus for the student. This study compares the effectiveness of an interactive multimedia virtual reality computer IV catheter simulator with a traditional laboratory experience of teaching IV venipuncture skills to both nursing and medical students. Intravenous catheter training system: computer-based education versus traditional learning methods.
