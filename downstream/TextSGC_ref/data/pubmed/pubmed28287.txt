One of the most common types of brain-computer interfaces BCIs is called a P300 BCI since it relies on the P300 and other event-related potentials ERPs. In the canonical P300 BCI approach items on a monitor flash briefly to elicit the necessary ERPs. Very recent work has shown that this approach may yield lower performance than alternate paradigms in which the items do not flash but instead change in other ways such as moving changing colour or changing to characters overlaid with faces. The changing face of P300 BCIs: a comparison of stimulus changes in a P300 BCI involving faces emotion and movement.
