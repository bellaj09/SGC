"B-mode ultrasonography and sonoelastography are used in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer PCa. A combination of the two ultrasound US modalities using computer aid may be helpful for improving the diagnostic performance. A technique for computer-aided diagnosis CAD of PCa is presented based on multimodal US. Firstly quantitative features are extracted from both B-mode US images and sonoelastograms including intensity statistics regional percentile features gray-level co-occurrence matrix GLCM texture features and binary texture features. Secondly a deep network named PGBM-RBM2 is proposed to learn and fuse multimodal features which is composed of the point-wise gated Boltzmann machine PGBM and two layers of the restricted Boltzmann machines RBMs. Finally the support vector machine SVM is used for prostatic disease classification. Experimental evaluation was conducted on 313 multimodal US images of the prostate from 103 patients with prostatic diseases 47 malignant and 56 benign. Under five-fold cross-validation the classification sensitivity specificity accuracy Youdens index and area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve with the PGBM-RBM2 were 87.0% 88.8% 87.9% 75.8% and 0.851 respectively. The results demonstrate that multimodal feature learning and fusion using the PGBM-RBM2 can assist in the diagnosis of PCa. This deep network is expected to be useful in the clinical diagnosis of PCa."
