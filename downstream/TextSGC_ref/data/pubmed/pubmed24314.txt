The Lokomat gait orthosis was developed in the Spinal Cord Injury Center at the University Hospital Balgrist Zurich and provides automatic gait training for patients with neurological gait impairments such as Cerebral Palsy CP. Each patient undergoes a task-oriented Lokomat rehabilitation training program via a virtual reality setup. In four virtual scenarios the patient is able to exercise tasks such as wading through water playing soccer overstepping obstacles or training in a street scenario each task offering varying levels of difficulty. Patients provided positive feedback in reference to the utilized haptic method specifically addressing the sufficient degree of realism. In a single case study we verified the task difficulty.
