We present a closed-loop system able to control the frequency of slow oscillations SO spontaneously generated by the cortical network in vitro. The frequency of SO can be controlled by direct current DC electric fields within a certain range. Here we set out to design a system that would be able to autonomously bring the emergent oscillatory activity to a target frequency determined by the experimenter. Control of cortical oscillatory frequency by a closed-loop system.
