"Holograms of colloidal particles can be analyzed with the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering to measure individual particles three-dimensional positions with nanometer precision while simultaneously estimating their sizes and refractive indexes. Extracting this wealth of information begins by detecting and localizing features of interest within individual holograms. Conventionally approached with heuristic algorithms this image analysis problem can be solved faster and more generally with machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate that two popular machine-learning algorithms cascade classifiers and deep convolutional neural networks CNN can solve the feature-localization problem orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our CNN implementation localizes holographic features precisely enough to bootstrap more detailed analyses based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering. The wavelet-based Haar cascade proves to be less precise but is so computationally efficient that it creates new opportunities for applications that emphasize speed and low cost. We demonstrate its use as a real-time targeting system for holographic optical trapping." Machine-learning techniques for fast and accurate feature localization in holograms of colloidal particles.
