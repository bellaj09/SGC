The existing surgical adhesives are not ideal for wet tissue adhesion required in many surgeries such as those for internal organs. Developing surgical adhesives with strong wet tissue adhesion controlled degradability and mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility has been a significant challenge. Herein learning from nature we report a one-step synthesis of a family of injectable citrate-based mussel-inspired bioadhesives iCMBAs for surgical use. Within the formulations investigated iCMBAs showed 2.5-8.0 folds stronger wet tissue adhesion strength over the clinically used fibrin glue demonstrated controlled degradability and tissue-like elastomeric mechanical properties and exhibited excellent cyto/tissue-compatibility both in vitro and in vivo. iCMBAs were able to stop bleeding instantly and suturelessly and close wounds 2 cm long0.5 cm deep created on the back of Sprague-Dawley rats which is impossible when using existing gold standard fibrin glue due to its weak wet tissue adhesion strength. Equally important the new bioadhesives facilitate wound healing and are completely degraded and absorbed without eliciting significant inflammatory response. Our results support that iCMBA technology is highly translational and could have broad impact on surgeries where surgical tissue adhesives sealants and hemostatic agents are used.
