Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA. It can be detected and diagnosed using computed tomography images. For an automated classifier identifying predictive features from medical images is a key concern. Deep feature extraction using pretrained convolutional neural networks CNNs has recently been successfully applied in some image domains. Here we applied a pretrained CNN to extract deep features from 40 computed tomography images with contrast of non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer and combined deep features with traditional image features and trained classifiers to predict short- and long-term survivors. We experimented with several pretrained CNNs and several feature selection strategies. The best previously reported accuracy when using traditional quantitative features was 77.5% area under the curve AUC 0.712 which was achieved by a decision tree classifier. The best reported accuracy from transfer learning and deep features was 77.5% AUC 0.713 using a decision tree classifier. When extracted deep neural network features were combined with traditional quantitative features we obtained an accuracy of 90% AUC 0.935 with the 5 best post-rectified linear unit features extracted from a vgg-f pretrained CNN and the 5 best traditional features. The best results were achieved with the symmetric uncertainty feature ranking algorithm followed by a random forests classifier.
