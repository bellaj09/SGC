"We aimed to use deep learning to detect tuberculosis in chest radiographs in annual workers health examination data and compare the performances of convolutional neural networks CNNs based on images only I-CNN and CNNs including demographic variables D-CNN. The I-CNN and D-CNN models were trained on 1000 chest X-ray images both positive and negative for tuberculosis. Feature extraction was conducted using VGG19 InceptionV3 ResNet50 DenseNet121 and InceptionResNetV2. Age weight height and gender were recorded as demographic variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve AUC was calculated for model comparison. The AUC values of the D-CNN models were greater than that of I-CNN. The AUC values for VGG19 increased by 0.0144 0.957 to 0.9714 in the training set and by 0.0138 0.9075 to 0.9213 in the test set both p < 0.05. The D-CNN models show greater sensitivity than I-CNN models 0.815 vs. 0.775 respectively at the same cut-off point for the same specificity of 0.962. The sensitivity of D-CNN does not attenuate as much as that of I-CNN even when specificity is increased by cut-off points. Conclusion: Our results indicate that machine learning can facilitate the detection of tuberculosis in chest X-rays and demographic factors can improve this process."
