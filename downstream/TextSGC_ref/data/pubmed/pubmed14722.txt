Automatic identification of term variants or acceptable alternative free-text terms for gene and protein names from the millions of biomedical publications is a challenging task. Ontologies such as the Cardiovascular Disease Ontology CVDO capture domain knowledge in a computational form and can provide context for gene/protein names as written in the literature. This study investigates: 1 if word embeddings from Deep Learning algorithms can provide a list of term variants for a given gene/protein of interest; and 2 if biological knowledge from the CVDO can improve such a list without modifying the word embeddings created. Deep learning meets ontologies: experiments to anchor the cardiovascular disease ontology in the biomedical literature.
