"The virtual reality arthroscopic knee simulator VR-AKS consists of a computer platform a video display and two force-feedback haptic interfaces which also monitor the position of the instruments in the users hands. The forces that the user would normally apply to the lower limb during arthroscopy are directed through an instrumented surrogate leg. Proprietary software furnishes the mathematical representation of the physical world and replicates the visual mechanical and behavioral aspects of the knee while task-oriented programs monitor and record specific areas of user performance. A prototype has demonstrated the feasibility of the system and work on the first fully functional simulator will begin soon." Development of a virtual reality arthroscopic knee simulator.
