"Huntingtons disease the most common inherited neurodegenerative disease is characterized by a dramatic loss of deep-layer cortical and striatal neurons as well as morbidity in midlife. Human genetic studies led to the identification of the causative gene huntingtin. Recent genomic advances have also led to the identification of hundreds of potential interacting partners for huntingtin protein and many hypotheses as to the molecular mechanisms whereby mutant huntingtin leads to cellular dysfunction and death. However the multitude of possible interacting partners and cellular pathways affected by mutant huntingtin has complicated efforts to understand the etiology of this disease and to date no curative therapeutic exists. To address the general problem of identifying the disease-phenotype contributing genes from a large number of correlative studies here we develop a synthetic lethal screening methodology for the mammalian central nervous system called SLIC for synthetic lethal in the central nervous system. Applying SLIC to the study of Huntingtons disease we identify the age-regulated glutathione peroxidase 6 Gpx6 gene as a modulator of mutant huntingtin toxicity and show that overexpression of Gpx6 can dramatically alleviate both behavioral and molecular phenotypes associated with a mouse model of Huntingtons disease. SLIC can in principle be used in the study of any neurodegenerative disease for which a mouse model exists promising to reveal modulators of neurodegenerative disease in an unbiased fashion akin to screens in simpler model organisms."
