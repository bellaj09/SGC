Endoscopy has traditionally been taught with novices practicing on real patients under the supervision of experienced endoscopists. Recently the growing awareness of the need for patient safety has brought simulation training to the forefront. Simulation training can provide trainees with the chance to practice their skills in a learner-centred risk-free environment. It is important to ensure that skills gained through simulation positively transfer to the clinical environment. This updated review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality VR simulation training in gastrointestinal endoscopy.
