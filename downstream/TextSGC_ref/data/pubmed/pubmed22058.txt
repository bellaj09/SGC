Many professions place significant mental and/or physical strain on their workers. Some professionals such as firefighters soldiers and pilots have an inherent responsibility for the safety of others. Making sure that workers in these remain fit for duty is an important health/safety concern for the workers and those they serve. This paper explores the viability of using EEG as a non-invasive cost efficient method for assessing fatigue sleep deprivation physical exertion and stress. Specifically P300 evoked potentials are generated in response to certain stimuli. Variations in the response characteristics magnitude shape and peak shift are explored in relation to sleep deprivation caffeine usage and physical exertion. Preliminary data suggests that there are quantifiable changes to the P300 response that may be attributed to fatigue. Changes in behavior of evoked potentials in the brain as a possible indicator of fatigue in people.
