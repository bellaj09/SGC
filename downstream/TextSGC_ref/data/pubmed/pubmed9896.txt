The annotation of a large corpus of Electroencephalography EEG reports is a crucial step in the development of an EEG-specific patient cohort retrieval system. The annotation of multiple types of EEG-specific medical concepts along with their polarity and modality is challenging especially when automatically performed on Big Data. To address this challenge we present a novel framework which combines the advantages of active and deep learning while producing annotations that capture a variety of attributes of medical concepts. Results obtained through our novel framework show great promise. Active Deep Learning-Based Annotation of Electroencephalography Reports for Cohort Identification.
