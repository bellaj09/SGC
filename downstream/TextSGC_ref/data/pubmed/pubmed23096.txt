P300 spellers are among the most popular brain-computer interface paradigms and they are used for many clinical applications. However building the classifier for identifying event-related potential ERP responses i.e. calibrating the P300 speller is still a time-consuming and user-dependent problem. This paper proposes a novel method to reduce calibration times significantly. In the proposed method a small number of ERP epochs from the current user were used to build a reference epoch. Based on this reference the Riemannian distance measurement was used to select similar ERP samples from an existing data pool which contained other-subject ERP responses. Linear discriminant analysis LDA support vector machine and stepwise LDA were trained as ERP classifiers on the selected database and then were used to identify the user-attended character. With only 12 s of EEG data to calibrate an average character recognition accuracy for 55 subjects of up to 87.82% was obtained. The LDA that built on other-subject samples that were selected by Riemannian distance outperformed the other classifiers. Compared with other state-of-the-art studies this method significantly reduces P300 speller calibration times while maintaining the character recognition accuracy.
