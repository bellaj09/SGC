In order to clarify whether neurophysiological profiles affect the performance of brain machine interfaces BMI we examined the relationships between amplitudes of movement-related cortical fields MRCFs and decoding performances during movement. Neuromagnetic activities were recorded in nine healthy participants during three types of unilateral upper limb movements. The movement types were inferred by a support vector machine. The amplitude of MRCF components motor field MF movement-evoked field I MEFI and movement-evoked field II MEFII were compared with the decoding accuracies in all participants. Decoding accuracies at the latencies of MF MEFI and MEFII surpassed the chance level in all participants. In particular accuracies at MEFI and MEFII were significantly higher in comparison with that of MF. The amplitudes and decoding accuracies were strongly correlated MF rs=0.90; MEFI rs=0.90; and MEFII rs=0.87. Our results show that the variation of MRCF components among participants reflects decoding performance. Neurophysiological profiles may serve as a predictor of individual BMI performance and assist in the improvement of general BMI performance.
