Custom software was developed to integrate intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography CBCT images with endoscopic video for surgical navigation and guidance. A cadaveric head was used to assess the accuracy and potential clinical utility of the following functionality: 1 real-time tracking of the endoscope in intraoperative 3-dimensional 3D CBCT; 2 projecting an orthogonal reconstructed CBCT image at or beyond the endoscope which is parallel to the tip of the endoscope corresponding to the surgical plane; 3 virtual reality fusion of endoscopic video and 3D CBCT surface rendering; and 4 overlay of preoperatively defined contours of anatomical structures of interest. Real-time tracking and virtual endoscopy in cone-beam CT-guided surgery of the sinuses and skull base in a cadaver model.
