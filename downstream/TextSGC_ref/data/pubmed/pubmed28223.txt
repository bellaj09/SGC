In electroencephalographic EEG data signals from distinct sources within the brain are widely spread by volume conduction and superimposed such that sensors receive mixtures of a multitude of signals. This reduction of spatial information strongly hampers single-trial analysis of EEG data as for example required for brain-computer interfacing BCI when using features from spontaneous brain rhythms. Spatial filtering techniques are therefore greatly needed to extract meaningful information from EEG. Our goal is to show in online operation that common spatial pattern patches CSPP are valuable to counteract this problem. Ensembles of adaptive spatial filters increase BCI performance: an online evaluation.
