Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety 2.7% moderate anxiety and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover living in urban areas OR\xa0=\xa00.810 95% CI\xa0=\xa00.709 - 0.925 family income stability OR\xa0=\xa00.726 95% CI\xa0=\xa00.645\xa0-\xa00.817 and living with parents OR\xa0=\xa00.752 95% CI\xa0=\xa00.596\xa0-\xa00.950 were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students OR\xa0=\xa03.007 95% CI\xa0=\xa02.377\xa0-\xa03.804. Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects and effects on daily life as well as delays in academic activities were positively associated with anxiety symptoms P\xa0<\xa0.001. However social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety P\xa0<\xa0.001. It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics."
