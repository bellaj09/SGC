An assistive robotic manipulator ARM can provide independence and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from tetraplegia. However to properly control such device to a satisfactory level without any motor functions requires a very high performing brain-computer interface BCI. Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEP based BCI are among the best performing. Thus this study investigates the design of a system for a full workspace control of a 7 degrees of freedom ARM. A SSVEP signal is elicited by observing a visual stimulus flickering at a specific frequency and phase. This study investigates the best combination of unique frequencies and phases to provide a 16-target BCI by testing three different systems off line. Furthermore a fourth system is developed to investigate the impact of the stimulating monitor refresh rate. Experiments conducted on two subjects suggest that a 16-target BCI created by four unique frequencies and 16-unique phases provide the best performance. Subject 1 reaches a maximum estimated ITR of 235 bits/min while subject 2 reaches 140 bits/min. The findings suggest that the optimal SSVEP stimuli to generate 16 targets are a low number of frequencies and a high number of unique phases. Moreover the findings do not suggest any need for considering the monitor refresh rate if stimuli are modulated using a sinusoidal signal sampled at the refresh rate.
