"Artificial intelligence AI is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to an implementation phase in many fields including medicine. The combination of improved availability of large datasets increasing computing power and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5\xa0years AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition caption generation and speech recognition. Radiology in particular is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality value and depth of radiologys contribution to patient care and population health and will revolutionize radiologists workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists CAR is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging lifelong learning and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice policy and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology educational needs of members research and development partnerships potential clinical applications implementation structure and governance role of radiologists and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada."
