Welding is a fundamental process in many industries. It is a fast-changing technology continuously evolving with recent developments in laser and robotic welding virtual reality and machine learning. Focusing on laser welding there is a significant interest in this technology as well as an increasing demand for high-strength lightweight structures replacing metals in some applications. This work presents an experimental study of the mechanical properties of three types of polyamide 6 joints welded by Nd:YAG laser. After welding tensile tests were carried out in order to evaluate the influence of the joint type and weld passes on joint strength and weld stresses. The results showed that fairly high weld stresses could be achieved indicating that good-quality welds were achieved. Mechanical Strength of Thermoplastic Polyamide Welded by Nd:YAG Laser.
