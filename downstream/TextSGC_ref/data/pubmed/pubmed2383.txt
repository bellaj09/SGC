"The topological structure of the wiring of the mammalian brain cortex plays an important role in shaping the functional dynamics of large-scale neural activity. Due to their central embedding in the network high degree hub regions and their connections often referred to as the rich club have been hypothesized to facilitate intermodular neural communication and global integration of information by means of synchronization. Here we examined the theoretical role of anatomical hubs and their wiring in brain dynamics. The Kuramoto model was used to simulate interaction of cortical brain areas by means of coupled phase oscillators-with anatomical connections between regions derived from diffusion weighted imaging and module assignment of brain regions based on empirically determined resting-state data." Kuramoto model simulation of neural hubs and dynamic synchrony in the human cerebral connectome.
