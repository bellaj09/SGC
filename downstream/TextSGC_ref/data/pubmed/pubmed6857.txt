"We present a robust deep learning framework for the automatic localisation of cone photoreceptor cells in Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope AOSLO split-detection images. Monitoring cone photoreceptors with AOSLO imaging grants an excellent view into retinal structure and health provides new perspectives into well known pathologies and allows clinicians to monitor the effectiveness of experimental treatments. The MultiDimensional Recurrent Neural Network MDRNN approach developed in this paper is the first method capable of reliably and automatically identifying cones in both healthy retinas and retinas afflicted with Stargardt disease. Therefore it represents a leap forward in the computational image processing of AOSLO images and can provide clinical support in on-going longitudinal studies of disease progression and therapy. We validate our method using images from healthy subjects and subjects with the inherited retinal pathology Stargardt disease which significantly alters image quality and cone density. We conduct a thorough comparison of our method with current state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that the proposed approach is both more accurate and appreciably faster in localizing cones. As further validation to the methods robustness we demonstrate it can be successfully applied to images of retinas with pathologies not present in the training data: achromatopsia and retinitis pigmentosa."
