The step away from a synchronized or cue-based brain-computer interface BCI and from laboratory conditions towards real world applications is very important and crucial in BCI research. This work shows that ten naive subjects can be trained in a synchronous paradigm within three sessions to navigate freely through a virtual apartment whereby at every junction the subjects could decide by their own how they wanted to explore the virtual environment VE. This virtual apartment was designed similar to a real world application with a goal-oriented task a high mental workload and a variable decision period for the subject. All subjects were able to perform long and stable motor imagery over a minimum time of 2 s. Using only three electroencephalogram EEG channels to analyze these imaginations we were able to convert them into navigation commands. Additionally it could be demonstrated that motivation is a very crucial factor in BCI research; motivated subjects perform much better than unmotivated ones. Brain-computer communication: motivation aim and impact of exploring a virtual apartment.
