"Graph theory applications had spread widely in understanding how human cognitive functions are linked to dynamics of neuronal network structure providing a conceptual frame that can reduce the analytical brain complexity. This review summarizes methodological advances in this field. Electroencephalographic functional network studies in pathophysiological aging will be presented focusing on neurodegenerative disease -such Alzheimers disease-aiming to discuss whether network science is changing the traditional concept of brain disease and how network topology knowledge could help in modeling resilience and vulnerability of diseases. Aim of this work is to open discussion on how network model could better describe brain architecture." Searching for signs of aging and dementia in EEG through network analysis.
