The ability to predict local structural features of a protein from the primary sequence is of paramount importance for unraveling its function in absence of experimental structural information. Two main factors affect the utility of potential prediction tools: their accuracy must enable extraction of reliable structural information on the proteins of interest and their runtime must be low to keep pace with sequencing data being generated at a constantly increasing speed. Here we present NetSurfP-2.0 a novel tool that can predict the most important local structural features with unprecedented accuracy and runtime. NetSurfP-2.0 is sequence-based and uses an architecture composed of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks trained on solved protein structures. Using a single integrated model NetSurfP-2.0 predicts solvent accessibility secondary structure structural disorder and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of the input sequences. We assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output features. We observe a correlation of 80% between predictions and experimental data for solvent accessibility and a precision of 85% on secondary structure 3-class predictions. In addition to improved accuracy the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1000 proteins in less than 2 hours and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.
