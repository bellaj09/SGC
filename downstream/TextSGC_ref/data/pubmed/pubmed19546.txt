Training procedural skills in GI endoscopy once focused on threshold numbers. As threshold numbers poorly reflect individual competence the focus gradually shifts towards a more individual approach. Tools to assess and document individual learning progress are being developed and incorporated in dedicated training curricula. However there is a lack of consensus and training guidelines differ worldwide which reflects uncertainties on optimal set-up of a training programme.
