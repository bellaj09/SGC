Researchers working in the field of global connectivity analysis using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI can count on a wide selection of software packages for processing their data with methods ranging from the reconstruction of the local intra-voxel axonal structure to the estimation of the trajectories of the underlying fibre tracts. However each package is generally task-specific and uses its own conventions and file formats. In this article we present the Connectome Mapper a software pipeline aimed at helping researchers through the tedious process of organising processing and analysing diffusion MRI data to perform global brain connectivity analyses. Our pipeline is written in Python and is freely available as open-source at www.cmtk.org. The connectome mapper: an open-source processing pipeline to map connectomes with MRI.
