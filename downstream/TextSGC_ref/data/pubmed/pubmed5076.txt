The habenula Hb is postulated to play a critical role in reward and aversion processing across species including humans and has been increasingly implicated in depression. However technical constraints have limited in vivo investigation of the human Hb and its function remains poorly characterized. We sought to overcome these challenges by examining the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity of the Hb and its possible relationship to depressive symptomatology using the high-resolution WU-Minn Human Connectome Project HCP dataset.
