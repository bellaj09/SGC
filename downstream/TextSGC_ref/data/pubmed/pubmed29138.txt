Traditional spatial filters used for steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP extraction such as minimum energy combination MEC require the estimation of the background electroencephalogram EEG noise components. Even though this leads to improved performance in low signal to noise ratio SNR conditions it makes such algorithms slow compared to the standard detection methods like canonical correlation analysis CCA due to the additional computational cost.
