This study investigated whether infrared spectroscopy combined with a deep learning algorithm could be a useful tool for determining causes of death by analyzing pulmonary edema fluid from forensic autopsies. A newly designed convolutional neural network-based deep learning framework named DeepIR and eight popular machine learning algorithms were used to construct classifiers. The prediction performances of these classifiers demonstrated that DeepIR outperformed the machine learning algorithms in establishing classifiers to determine the causes of death. Moreover DeepIR was generally less dependent on preprocessing procedures than were the machine learning algorithms; it provided the validation accuracy with a narrow range from 0.9661 to 0.9856 and the test accuracy ranging from 0.8774 to 0.9167 on the raw pulmonary edema fluid spectral dataset and the nine preprocessing protocol-based datasets in our study. In conclusion this study demonstrates that the deep learning-equipped Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique has the potential to be an effective aid for determining causes of death.
