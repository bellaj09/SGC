Medical parasitology education has been facing some difficulties because it is a course of wide range lacking clinical cases and concerned specimens of parasites currently. In addition its relationship with life is not closely enough. All these reasons may impact the effect of class education negatively. Therefore it is important to increase the vitality of parasitology education and diversify the instructional mode by using the resources from Internet. In recent years the Discovery Channel has uploaded a documentary Monsters Inside Me online. This documentary is high professional and closely linked with parasitology. It maintains numbers of clinical cases about parasitic diseases. Each episode is about 3 minutes and shortly enough to be introduced into class teaching. However this resource has not been fully used in domestic temporally. We found that direct introduction of the documentary into class teaching can enrich teaching forms to attract learning interest of students and finally improve the teaching effect of class. Above that another popular documentary A Bite of China involves many related knowledge points of parasitology. The appropriate usage of the knowledge can build up close linkage between book and life which is extremely helpful to give students a deep impression of parasitology. In brief it is our strong recommendation to introduce the documentary Monsters Inside Me into class. A bite of parasite experiences of application of documentaries into parasitology class teaching.
