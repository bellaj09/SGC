"Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the application of Simulation methodologies for training. We have previously developed a Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training VERT which simulates a fully interactive and functional Linac. Patient and plan data can be accessed across a DICOM interface allowing the treatment process to be simulated. Here we present a newly developed range of Physics equipment which allows the user to undertake realistic QC processes. Five devices are available: 1 scanning water phantom 2 solid water QC block/ion chamber 3 light/ radiation field coincidence phantom 4 laser alignment phantom and 5 water based calibration phantom with reference class and departmental ion chamber."
