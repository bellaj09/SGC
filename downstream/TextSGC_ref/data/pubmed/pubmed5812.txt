The combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI of the brain with multivariate pattern analysis MVPA has been proposed as a possible diagnostic tool. Goal of this investigation was to identify potential functional connectivity FC differences in the salience network SN and default mode network DMN between fibromyalgia syndrome FMS rheumatoid arthritis RA and controls HC and to evaluate the diagnostic applicability of derived pattern classification approaches. Diagnostic classification based on functional connectivity in chronic pain: model optimization in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.
