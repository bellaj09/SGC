The present study aims to gain insights into the effects of training with a motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interface BCI on activation patterns of the sensorimotor cortex. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS and electroencephalography EEG to investigate long-term training effects across 10 sessions using a 2-class right hand and feet MI-based BCI in fifteen subjects. In the course of the training a significant enhancement of activation pattern emerges represented by an oxy-Hb increase in fNIRS and a stronger event-related desynchronization in the upper -frequency band in the EEG. These effects were only visible in participants with relatively low BCI performance mean accuracy  70%. We found that training with an MI-based BCI affects cortical activation patterns especially in users with low BCI performance. Our results may serve as a valuable contribution to the field of BCI research and provide information about the effects that training with an MI-based BCI has on cortical activation patterns. This might be useful for clinical applications of BCI which aim at promoting and guiding neuroplasticity.
