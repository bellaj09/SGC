Digital breast tomosynthesis DBT was developed in the field of breast cancer screening as a new tomographic technique to minimize the limitations of conventional digital mammography breast screening methods. A computer-aided detection CAD framework for mass detection in DBT has been developed and is described in this paper. The proposed framework operates on a set of two-dimensional 2D slices. With plane-to-plane analysis on corresponding 2D slices from each DBT it automatically learns complex patterns of 2D slices through a deep convolutional neural network DCNN. It then applies multiple instance learning MIL with a randomized trees approach to classify DBT images based on extracted information from 2D slices. This CAD framework was developed and evaluated using 5040 2D image slices derived from 87 DBT volumes. The empirical results demonstrate that this proposed CAD framework achieves much better performance than CAD systems that use hand-crafted features and deep cardinality-restricted Bolzmann machines to detect masses in DBTs.
