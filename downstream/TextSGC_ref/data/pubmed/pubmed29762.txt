"Mechanisms underlying loss of consciousness following propofol administration remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to compare frontal lobe electroencephalography activity and brainstem reflexes during intravenous induction of general anaesthesia in patients receiving a typical bolus dose fast infusion of propofol compared with a slower infusion rate. We sought to determine whether brainstem suppression bottom-up predominates over loss of cortical function top-down. Sixteen ASA physical status-1 patients were randomly assigned to either a fast or slow propofol infusion group. Loss of consciousness and brainstem reflexes were assessed every 30\xa0s by a neurologist blinded to treatment allocation. We performed a multitaper spectral analysis of all electroencephalography data obtained from each participant. Brainstem reflexes were present in all eight patients in the slow infusion group while being absent in all patients in the fast infusion group at the moment of loss of consciousness p\xa0=\xa00.010. An increase in alpha band power was observed before loss of consciousness only in participants allocated to the slow infusion group. Alpha band power emerged several minutes after the loss of consciousness in participants allocated to the fast infusion group. Our results show a predominance of bottom-up mechanisms during fast infusion rates and top-down mechanisms during slow infusion rates. The underlying mechanisms by which propofol induces loss of consciousness are potentially influenced by the speed of infusion."
