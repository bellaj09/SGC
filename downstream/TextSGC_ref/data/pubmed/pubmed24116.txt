Common camera calibration methods employed in current laparoscopic augmented reality systems require the acquisition of multiple images of an entire checkerboard pattern from various poses. This lengthy procedure prevents performing laparoscope calibration in the operating room OR. The purpose of this work was to develop a fast calibration method for electromagnetically EM tracked laparoscopes such that the calibration can be performed in the OR on demand. On-demand calibration and evaluation for electromagnetically tracked laparoscope in augmented reality visualization.
