Conducting hydrogels CHs are an emerging technology in the field of medical electrodes and brain-machine interfaces. The greatest challenge to the fabrication of CH electrodes is the hybridization of dissimilar polymers conductive polymer and hydrogel to ensure the formation of interpenetrating polymer networks IPN required to achieve both soft and electroactive materials. A new hydrogel system is developed that enables tailored placement of covalently immobilized dopant groups within the hydrogel matrix. The role of immobilized dopant in the formation of CH is investigated through covalent linking of sulfonate doping groups to polyvinyl alcohol PVA macromers. These groups control the electrochemical growth of the conducting polymer poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene PEDOT and subsequent material properties. The effect of dopant density and interdopant spacing on the physical electrochemical and mechanical properties of the resultant CHs is examined. Cytocompatible PVA hydrogels with PEDOT penetration throughout the depth of the electrode are produced. Interdopant spacing is found to be the key factor in the formation of IPNs with smaller interdopant spacing producing CH electrodes with greater charge storage capacity and lower impedance due to increased PEDOT growth throughout the network. This approach facilitates tailorable high-performance CH electrodes for next generation low impedance neuroprosthetic devices.
