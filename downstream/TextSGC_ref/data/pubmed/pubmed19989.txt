Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI is helping us better understand the neurologic pathways involved in posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD. We previously reported that military service members with PTSD after deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan demonstrated significant improvement or normalization in the fMRI-measured activation of the amygdala prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus following exposure therapy for PTSD. However our original study design did not include repeat scans of control participants rendering it difficult to discern how much of the observed normalization in brain activity is attributable to treatment rather than merely a practice effect. Using the same Affective Stroop task paradigm we now report on a larger sample of PTSD-positive combat veterans that we treated with exposure therapy as well as a combat-exposed control group of service members who completed repeat scans at 3-4 month intervals. Findings from the treatment group are similar to our prior report. Combat controls showed no significant change on repeat scanning indicating that the observed differences in the intervention group were in fact due to treatment. We continue to scan additional study participants in order to determine whether virtual reality exposure therapy has a different impact on regional brain activation than other therapies for PTSD. Compelling Evidence that Exposure Therapy for PTSD Normalizes Brain Function.
