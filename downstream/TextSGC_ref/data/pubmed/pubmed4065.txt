Drug addiction is widely linked to the orbitofrontal cortex OFC which is essential for regulating reward-related behaviors emotional responses and anxiety. Over the past two decades neuroimaging has provided significant contributions revealing functional and structural alternations in the brains of drug addicts. However the underlying neural mechanism in the OFC and its correlates with drug addiction and anxiety still require further elucidation. We first presented a pilot investigation to examine local networks in OFC regions through resting-state functional connectivity rsFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS from eight abstinent addicts in a heroin-dependent group HD and seven subjects in a control group CG. We discovered that the HDs manifested enhanced interhemispheric correlation and rsFC. Moreover small-worldness was explored in the brain networks. In addition to the altered rsFC in the OFC networks our examinations demonstrated associations in the functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and other OFC regions related to anxiety in the HDs. The study provides important preliminary evidence of the complex OFC networks in heroin addiction and suggests neural correlates of anxiety. It opens a window in application of fNIRS to predict psychiatric trajectories and may create new insights into neural adaptations resulting from chronic opiate intake.
