"Automated recognition of mouse behaviors is crucial in studying psychiatric and neurologic diseases. To achieve this objective it is very important to analyze the temporal dynamics of mouse behaviors. In particular the change between mouse neighboring actions is swift in a short period. In this paper we develop and implement a novel hidden Markov model HMM algorithm to describe the temporal characteristics of mouse behaviors. In particular we here propose a hybrid deep learning architecture where the first unsupervised layer relies on an advanced spatial-temporal segment Fisher vector encoding both visual and contextual features. Subsequent supervised layers based on our segment aggregate network are trained to estimate the state-dependent observation probabilities of the HMM. The proposed architecture shows the ability to discriminate between visually similar behaviors and results in high recognition rates with the strength of processing imbalanced mouse behavior datasets. Finally we evaluate our approach using JHuangs and our own datasets and the results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches."
