We propose in this work a feature learning approach using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks RNNs with attention mechanism for single-channel automatic sleep stage classification. We firstly decompose an EEG epoch into multiple small frames and subsequently transform them into a sequence of frame-wise feature vectors. Given the training sequences the attention-based RNN is trained in a sequence-to-label fashion for sleep stage classification. Due to discriminative training the network is expected to encode information of an input sequence into a high-level feature vector after the attention layer. We therefore treat the trained network as a feature extractor and extract these feature vectors for classification which is accomplished by a linear SVM classifier. We also propose a discriminative method to learn a filter bank with a DNN for preprocessing purpose. Filtering the frame-wise feature vectors with the learned filter bank beforehand leads to further improvement on the classification performance. The proposed approach demonstrates good performance on the Sleep-EDF dataset.
