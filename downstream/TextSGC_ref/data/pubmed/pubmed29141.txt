The aim of this paper is to provide an efficient parametric general and completely automatic real time classification method of electroencephalography EEG signals obtained from self-induced emotions. The particular characteristics of the considered low-amplitude signals a self-induced emotion produces a signal whose amplitude is about 15% of a really experienced emotion require exploring and adapting strategies like the Wavelet Transform the Principal Component Analysis PCA and the Support Vector Machine SVM for signal processing analysis and classification. Moreover the method is thought to be used in a multi-emotions based Brain Computer Interface BCI and for this reason an ad hoc shrewdness is assumed. A real-time classification algorithm for EEG-based BCI driven by self-induced emotions.
