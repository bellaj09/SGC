In the applications of the graph theory it is unusual that one considers numerous pairwise different graphs on the very same set of vertices. In the case of human braingraphs or connectomes however this is the standard situation: the nodes correspond to anatomically identified cerebral regions and two vertices are connected by an edge if a diffusion MRI-based workflow identifies a fiber of axons running between the two regions corresponding to the two vertices. Therefore if we examine the braingraphs of n subjects then we have n graphs on the very same anatomically identified vertex set. It is a natural idea to describe the k-frequently appearing edges in these graphs: the edges that are present between the same two vertices in at least k out of the n graphs. Based on the NIH-funded large Human Connectome Project\s public data release we have reported the construction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server http://www.connectome.pitgroup.org that generates and visualizes these k-frequently appearing edges. We call the graphs of the k-frequently appearing edges "k-consensus connectomes" since an edge could be included only if it is present in at least k graphs out of n. Considering the whole human brain we have reported a surprising property of these consensus connectomes earlier. In the present work we are focusing on the frontal lobe of the brain and we report here a similarly surprising dynamical property of the consensus connectomes when k is gradually changed from k\u202f=\u202fn to k\u202f=\u202f1: the connections between the nodes of the frontal lobe are seemingly emanating from those nodes that were connected to sub-cortical structures of the dorsal striatum: the caudate nucleus and the putamen. We hypothesize that this dynamic behavior copies the axonal fiber development of the frontal lobe. An animation of the phenomenon is presented at https://youtu.be/wBciB2eW6_8. The dorsal striatum and the dynamics of the consensus connectomes in the frontal lobe of the human brain.
