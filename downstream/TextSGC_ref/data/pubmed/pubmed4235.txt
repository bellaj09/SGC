Brain disconnection model has been proposed as a possible neural mechanism for cognitive aging. However the relationship between structural connectivity degeneration and cognitive decline with normal aging remains unclear. In the present study using diffusion MRI and tractography techniques we report graph theory-based analyses of the brain structural connectome in a cross-sectional community-based cohort of 633 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the elderly subjects was performed. The association between age brain structural connectome and cognition across elderly individuals was examined. We found that the topological efficiency modularity and hub integration of the brain structural connectome exhibited a significant decline with normal aging especially in the frontal parietal and superior temporal regions. Importantly network efficiency was positively correlated with attention and executive function in elderly subjects and had a significant mediation effect on the age-related decline in these cognitive functions. Moreover nodal efficiency of the brain structural connectome showed good performance for the prediction of attention and executive function in elderly individuals. Together our findings revealed topological alterations of the brain structural connectome with normal aging which provides possible structural substrates underlying cognitive aging and sensitive imaging markers for the individual prediction of cognitive functions in elderly subjects.
