Amorphous InGaZnOx a-IGZO thin-film transistors TFTs are currently used in flat-panel displays due to their beneficial properties. However the mobility of 10 cm2/V s for the a-IGZO TFTs used in commercial organic light-emitting diode TVs is not satisfactory for high-resolution display applications such as virtual and augmented reality applications. In general the electrical properties of amorphous oxide semiconductors are strongly dependent on their chemical composition; the indium In-rich IGZO achieves a high mobility of 50 cm2/V s. However the In-rich IGZO TFTs possess another issue of negative threshold voltage owing to intrinsically high carrier density. Therefore the development of an effective way of carrier density suppression in In-rich IGZO will be a key strategy to the realization of practical high-mobility a-IGZO TFTs. In this study we report that In-rich IGZO TFTs with vertically stacked InOx ZnOx and GaOx atomic layers exhibit excellent performances such as saturation mobilities of 74 cm2/V s threshold voltage of -1.3 V on/off ratio of 8.9  108 subthreshold swing of 0.26 V/decade and hysteresis of 0.2 V while keeping a reasonable carrier density of 1017 cm-3. We found that the vertical dimension control of IGZO active layers is critical to TFT performance parameters such as mobility and threshold voltage. This study illustrates the potential advantages of atomic layer deposition processes for fabricating ultrahigh-mobility oxide TFTs.
