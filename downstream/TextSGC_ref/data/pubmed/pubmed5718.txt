Movement performance depends on the synaptic interactions generated by coherent parallel sensorimotor cortical outputs to different downstream targets. The major outputs of the neocortex to subcortical structures are driven by pyramidal tract neurons PTNs located in layer 5B. One of the main targets of PTNs is the spinal cord through the corticospinal CS system which is formed by a complex collection of distinct CS circuits. However little is known about intracortical synaptic interactions that originate CS commands and how different populations of CS neurons are functionally organized. To further understand the functional organization of the CS system we analyzed the activity of unambiguously identified CS neurons projecting to different zones of the same spinal cord segment using two-photon calcium imaging and retrograde neuronal tracers. Mouse corticospinal system comprises different functional neuronal ensembles depending on their hodology.
