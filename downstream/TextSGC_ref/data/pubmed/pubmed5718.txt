A non-intrusive method is presented for measuring different fluidic properties in a microfluidic chip by optically monitoring the flow of droplets. A neural network is used to extract the desired information from the images of the droplets. We demonstrate the method in two applications: measurement of the concentration of each component of a water/alcohol mixture and measurement of the flow rate of the same mixture. A large number of droplet images are recorded and used to train deep neural networks DNN to predict the flow rate or the concentration. It is shown that this method can be used to quantify the concentrations of each component with a 0.5% accuracy and the flow rate with\xa0a resolution of 0.05\u2009ml/h. The proposed method can in principle be used to measure other properties of the fluid such as surface tension and viscosity.
