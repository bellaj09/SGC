Spontaneous brain activity at rest is highly organized even when the brain is not explicitly engaged in a task. Functional connectivity FC in the alpha frequency band  8-12\u202fHz during rest is associated with improved performance on various cognitive and motor tasks. In this study we explored how FC is associated with visuo-motor skill learning and offline consolidation. We tested two hypotheses by which resting-state FC might achieve its impact on behavior: preparing the brain for an upcoming task or consolidating training gains. Twenty-four healthy participants were assigned to one of two groups: The experimental group n\u202f=\u202f12 performed a computerized mirror-drawing task. The control group n\u202f=\u202f12 performed a similar task but with concordant cursor direction. High-density 156-channel resting-state EEG was recorded before and after learning. Subjects were tested for offline consolidation 24h later. The Experimental group improved during training and showed offline consolidation. Increased -FC between the left superior parietal cortex and the rest of the brain before training and decreased -FC in the same region after training predicted learning. Resting-state FC following training did not predict offline consolidation and none of these effects were present in controls. These findings indicate that resting-state alpha-band FC is primarily implicated in providing optimal neural resources for upcoming tasks. Resting-state connectivity predicts visuo-motor skill learning.
