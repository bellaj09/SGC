MicroRNAs miRNAs are small non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression through post-transcriptional silencing. Differential expression observed in miRNAs combined with advancements in deep learning DL have the potential to improve cancer classification by modelling non-linear miRNA-phenotype associations. We propose a novel miRNA-based deep cancer classifier DCC incorporating genomic and hierarchical tissue annotation capable of accurately predicting the presence of cancer in wide range of human tissues.
