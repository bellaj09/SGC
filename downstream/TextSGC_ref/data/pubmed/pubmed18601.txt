Persons with dementia PWD are known to have difficulty with participation and focus during physical activity. Virtual reality VR offers a unique medium for motor learning but has only been used previously for cognitive assessment for PWD. Our study had two objectives: 1 investigate the feasibility and safety of an exercise-based VR training program in PWD and 2 investigate its effects on balance and mobility. The intervention consisted of daily 5 d/wk 1 h each VR training sessions for 2 wk for a single research participant. Clinical balance and mobility measures were assessed 1 wk prior to during 1 wk following and 1 mo after the intervention. Postintervention interviews provided qualitative feedback from the participant and his caregivers. Results indicate that VR training is feasible safe and enjoyable for PWD. However balance and mobility measures were unaffected. VR training is well tolerated in a single research participant with dementia and is an engaging medium for participation in exercise. Two-week virtual reality training for dementia: Single case feasibility study.
