Scientific investigations on the nature of the self have so far focused on high-level mechanisms. Recent evidence however suggests that low-level bottom-up mechanisms of multi-sensory integration play a fundamental role in encoding specific components of bodily self-consciousness such as self-location and first-person perspective Blanke and Metzinger 2009. Self-location and first-person perspective are abnormal in neurological patients suffering from out-of-body experiences Blanke et al. 2004 and can be manipulated experimentally in healthy subjects by imposing multi-sensory conflicts Lenggenhager et al. 2009. Activity of the temporo-parietal junction TPJ reflects experimentally induced changes in self-location and first-person perspective Ionta et al. 2011 and dysfunctions in TPJ are causally associated with out-of-body experiences Blanke et al. 2002. We argue that TPJ is one of the key areas for multi-sensory integration of bodily self-consciousness that its levels of activity reflect the experience of the conscious "I" as embodied and localized within bodily space and that these mechanisms can be systematically investigated using state of the art technologies such as robotics virtual reality and non-invasive neuroimaging. Multi-sensory and sensorimotor foundation of bodily self-consciousness - an interdisciplinary approach.
