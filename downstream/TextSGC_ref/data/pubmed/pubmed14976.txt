A Machine-Learning based Deep Potential DP model for Al clusters is developed through training with an extended database including ab initio data of both bulk and several clusters in only 6 CPU/h. This DP model has good performance in accurately predicting the low-lying candidates of Al clusters in a broad size range. Based on our developed DP model the low-lying structures of 101 different sized Al clusters are extensively searched among which the lowest-energy candidates of 69 sized clusters are updated. Our calculations demonstrate that machine-learning is indeed powerful in generating potentials to describe the interaction of atoms in complex materials. A machine learning based deep potential for seeking the low-lying candidates of Al clusters.
