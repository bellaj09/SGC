"Virtual reality environments presented on tablets and smartphones have potential to aid the early diagnosis of conditions such as Alzheimers dementia by quantifying impairments in navigation performance. However it is unclear whether performance on mobile devices can predict navigation errors in the real world. We compared the performance of 49 participants 25 females 18-35 years old at wayfinding and path integration tasks designed in our mobile app Sea Hero Quest with their performance at similar tasks in a real-world environment. We first performed this experiment in the streets of London UK and replicated it in Paris France. In both cities we found a significant correlation between virtual and real-world wayfinding performance and a male advantage in both environments although smaller in the real world Cohens d in the game = 0.89 in the real world = 0.59. Results in London and Paris were highly similar and controlling for familiarity with video games did not change the results. The strength of the correlation between real world and virtual environment increased with the difficulty of the virtual wayfinding task indicating that Sea Hero Quest does not merely capture video gaming skills. The fact that the Sea Hero Quest wayfinding task has real-world ecological validity constitutes a step toward controllable sensitive safe low-cost and easy to administer digital cognitive assessment of navigation ability." Virtual navigation tested on a mobile app is predictive of real-world wayfinding navigation performance.
