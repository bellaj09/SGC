"In this work we propose a novel brain-controlled wheelchair one of the major applications of brain-machine interfaces BMIs that allows an individual with mobility impairments to perform daily living activities independently. Specifically we propose to use a steady-state somatosensory evoked potential SSSEP paradigm which elicits brain responses to tactile stimulation of specific frequencies for a users intention to control a wheelchair. In our system a user had three possible commands by concentrating on one of three vibration stimuli which were attached to the left-hand right-hand and right-foot to selectively control the wheelchair. The three stimuli were associated with three wheelchair commands: turn-left turn-right and move-forward. From a machine learning perspective we also devise a novel feature representation by combining spatial and spectral characteristics of brain signals. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSSEP-based system we considered two different tasks: 1 a simple obstacle-avoidance task within a limited time and; 2 a driving task along the predefined trajectory of about 40 m length where there were a narrow pathway a door and obstacles. In both experiments we recruited 12 subjects and compared the average time of motor imagery MI and SSSEP-based controls to complete the task. With the SSSEP-based control all subjects successfully completed the task without making any collision while four subjects failed it with MI-based control. It is also noteworthy that in terms of the average time to complete the task the SSSEP-based control outperformed the MI-based control. In the other more challenging task all subjects successfully reached the target location." Commanding a Brain-Controlled Wheelchair Using Steady-State Somatosensory Evoked Potentials.
