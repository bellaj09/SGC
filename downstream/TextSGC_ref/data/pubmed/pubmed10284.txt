Numerical analysis methods including finite element analysis FEA computational fluid dynamics CFD and fluid-structure interaction FSI analysis have been used to study the biomechanics of human tissues and organs as well as tissue-medical device interactions and treatment strategies. However for patient-specific computational analysis complex procedures are usually required to set-up the models and long computing time is needed to perform the simulation preventing fast feedback to clinicians in time-sensitive clinical applications. In this study by using machine learning techniques we developed deep neural networks DNNs to directly estimate the steady-state distributions of pressure and flow velocity inside the thoracic aorta. After training on hemodynamic data from CFD simulations the DNNs take as input a shape of the aorta and directly output the hemodynamic distributions in one second. The trained DNNs are capable of predicting the velocity magnitude field with an average error of 1.9608% and the pressure field with an average error of 1.4269%. This study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using DNNs as a fast and accurate surrogate model for hemodynamic analysis of large blood vessels. A feasibility study of deep learning for predicting hemodynamics of human thoracic aorta.
