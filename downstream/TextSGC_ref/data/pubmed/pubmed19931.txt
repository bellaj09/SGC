Just like simulators are a standard in aviation and aerospace sciences we expect for surgical simulators to soon become a standard in medical applications. These will correctly instruct future doctors in surgical techniques without there being a need for hands on patient instruction. Using virtual reality by digitally transposing surgical procedures changes surgery in are volutionary manner by offering possibilities for implementing new much more efficient learning methods by allowing the practice of new surgical techniques and by improving surgeon abilities and skills. Perfecting haptic devices has opened the door to a series of opportunities in the fields of researchindustry nuclear science and medicine. Concepts purely theoretical at first such as telerobotics telepresence or telerepresentationhave become a practical reality as calculus techniques telecommunications and haptic devices evolvedvirtual reality taking a new leap. In the field of surgery barrier sand controversies still remain regarding implementation and generalization of surgical virtual simulators. These obstacles remain connected to the high costs of this yet fully sufficiently developed technology especially in the domain of haptic devices. Surgical virtual reality - highlights in developing a high performance surgical haptic device.
