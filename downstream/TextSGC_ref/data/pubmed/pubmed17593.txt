Current practice in vascular surgery utilizes only diagnostic and empirical data to plan treatments which does not enable quantitative a priori prediction of the outcomes of interventions. We have previously described simulation-based medical planning methods to model blood flow in arteries and plan medical treatments based on physiologic models. An important consideration for the design of these patient-specific modeling systems is the accessibility to physicians with modest computational resources. We describe a simulation-based medical planning environment developed for the World Wide Web WWW using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML and the Java programming language. Internet-based system for simulation-based medical planning for cardiovascular disease.
