Advances in materials mechanics and manufacturing now allow construction of high-quality electronics and optoelectronics in forms that can readily integrate with the soft curvilinear and time-dynamic surfaces of the human body. The resulting capabilities create new opportunities for studying disease states improving surgical procedures monitoring health/wellness establishing human-machine interfaces and performing other functions. This review summarizes these technologies and illustrates their use in forms integrated with the brain the heart and the skin. Flexible and stretchable electronics for biointegrated devices.
