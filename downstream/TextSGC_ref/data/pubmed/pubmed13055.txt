"The detection of objects concealed under peoples clothing is a very challenging task which has crucial applications for security. When testing the human body for metal contraband the concealed targets are usually small in size and are required to be detected within a few seconds. Focusing on weapon detection this paper proposes using a real-time detection method for detecting concealed metallic weapons on the human body applied to passive millimeter wave PMMW imagery based on the You Only Look Once YOLO algorithm YOLOv3 and a small sample dataset. The experimental results from YOLOv3-13 YOLOv3-53 and Single Shot MultiBox Detector SSD algorithm SSD-VGG16 are compared ultimately using the same PMMW dataset. For the perspective of detection accuracy detection speed and computation resource it shows that the YOLOv3-53 model had a detection speed of 36 frames per second FPS and a mean average precision mAP of 95% on a GPU-1080Ti computer more effective and feasible for the real-time detection of weapon contraband on human body for PMMW images even with small sample data."
