The study of neural correlates of self-paced movement intention helps develop a more natural and practical brain computer interface. In this paper we studied EEG neural correlates of self-paced left- and right-hand movement intention during a reaching task. A slow decreased movement related cortical potential MRCP related to movement intention was found before both the left- and right-hand movements. The temporal start point and decrement of MRCP before the left- and right-hand reaching movements showed differently. Moreover alpha band power increase/decrease was observed before the onset of both left- and right-hand movements. Alpha band powers increase before both movement conditions in the frontal-central area. In the central area alpha band powers decrease consistently at electrodes C3 Cz and C4 before the right-hand reaching movement. While alpha band powers increase at electrodes C3 and Cz before the left-hand reaching movement. EEG Neural Correlates of Self-Paced Left- and Right-Hand Movement Intention during a Reaching Task.
