Chemical and biomedical named entity recognition NER is an essential preprocessing task in natural language processing. The identification and extraction of named entities from scientific articles is also attracting increasing interest in many scientific disciplines. Locating chemical named entities in the literature is an essential step in chemical text mining pipelines for identifying chemical mentions their properties and relations as discussed in the literature. In this work we describe an approach to the BioCreative V.5 challenge regarding the recognition and classification of chemical named entities. For this purpose we transform the task of NER into a sequence labeling problem. We present a series of sequence labeling systems that we used adapted and optimized in our experiments for solving this task. To this end we experiment with hyperparameter optimization. Finally we present LSTMVoter a two-stage application of recurrent neural networks that integrates the optimized sequence labelers from our study into a single ensemble classifier. LSTMVoter: chemical named entity recognition using a conglomerate of sequence labeling tools.
