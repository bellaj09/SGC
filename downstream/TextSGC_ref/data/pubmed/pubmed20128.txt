"This project aims to create a three-dimensional digital model of the human hand and wrist which can be virtually dissected through a haptic interface. Tissue properties will be added to the various anatomical structures to replicate a realistic look and feel. The project will explore the role of the medical artist and investigate cross-discipline collaborations in the field of virtual anatomy. The software will be used to train anatomy students in dissection skills before experience on a real cadaver. The effectiveness of the software will be evaluated and assessed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively." Virtual reality haptic dissection.
