"Commercially-available Virtual Reality VR systems have the potential to be effective tools for simultaneous visual manipulation and kinematic data collection. Previously these systems have been integrated with research-grade motion capture systems to provide both functionalities; however they are yet to be used as stand-alone systems for kinematic data collection. The present study aimed to validate the HTC VIVE VR system for kinematic data collection by evaluating the accuracy of its position and orientation signals. The VIVE controller and tracker were each compared to a Polhemus Liberty magnetic tracking system sensor for angular and translational measurement error and signal drift. A sensor from each system was mounted to opposite ends of a rigid segment which was driven through fifty rotations and fifty translations. Mean angular errors for both the VIVE tracker and controller were below 0.4. Mean translational error for both sensors was below 3\u202fmm. Drift in the Liberty signal components was consistently lower than drift in VIVE components. However all mean rotational drift measures were below 0.1 and all mean translational measures were below 0.35\u202fmm. These data indicate that the HTC VIVE system has the potential to be a valid and reliable means of kinematic data collection. However further investigation is necessary to determine the VIVEs suitability for capturing extremely minute or high-volume movements."
