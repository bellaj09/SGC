There are high attrition rates observed in efficacy studies for social anxiety disorder and research has not identified consistent nor theoretically meaningful predictors of dropout. Pre-treatment symptom severity and demographic factors such as age and gender are sometimes predictive of dropout. The current study examines a theoretically meaningful predictor of attrition based on experiences associated with social group membership rather than differences between social group categories--fear of confirming stereotypes. Stereotype confirmation concerns predict dropout from cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.
