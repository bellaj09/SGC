A high-speed Chinese Brain-computer interface BCI speller was designed and implemented in this paper. A visual stimulation method called the motion checkerboard stimulation was used to elicit steady-state visual evoked potentials SSMVEP. With a 10  8 high-density matrix interface phonetic symbols or Chinese characters sinograms were presented for selection and only two selections per character were required. According to experiment results the ITR of the eighty-target motion checkerboard paradigm achieved 99.1 bits/min the average accuracy of sinogram spelling system scored above 94.1% and the speed was up to one sinogram per 13.6 s. These results suggest that the proposed Chinese speller can input vast number of characters with higher speed and less operations providing a high practicability communication method for people with motor disabilities.
