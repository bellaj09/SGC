Despite mounting evidence regarding the underlying neurobiology in transgender persons information regarding resting-state activity particularly after hormonal treatment is lacking. The present study examined differences between transgender persons on long-term cross-sex hormone therapy and comparisons on two measures of local functional connectivity intensity of spontaneous resting-state activity low frequency fluctuations LFF and local synchronization of specific brain areas regional homogeneity ReHo. Nineteen transgender women TW male-to-female 19 transgender men TM female-to-male 21 non-transgender men NTM and 20 non-transgender women NTW underwent a resting-state MRI scan. The results showed differences between transgender persons and non-transgender comparisons on both LFF and ReHo measures in the frontal cortex medial temporal lobe and cerebellum. More interestingly circulating androgens correlated for TM in the cerebellum and regions of the frontal cortex an effect that was associated with treatment duration in the cerebellum. By comparison no associations were found for TW with estrogens. These data provide first evidence for a potential masculinization of local functional connectivity in hormonally-treated transgender men. Circulating androgens correlate with resting-state MRI in transgender men.
