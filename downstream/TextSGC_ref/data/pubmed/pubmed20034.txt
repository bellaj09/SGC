This article seeks to place children on the autism spectrum at the center of a study examining the potential of virtual reality VR head-mounted displays HMDs used in classrooms. In doing so we provide data that address 3 important and often overlooked research questions in the field of autism and technology working in school-based settings with 31 autistic children from 6 to 16 years of age. First what type of VR HMD device and experiences therein are preferred by children on the autism spectrum using HMDs given possible sensory concerns. Second how do children on the autism spectrum report the physical experience enjoyment and potential of VR HMDs in their classrooms? Finally we were interested in exploring what children on the autism spectrum would like to use VR in schools for? Through a mixed methods approach we found that costly and technologically advanced HMDs were preferred namely: HTC Vive. In addition HMDs were reported as being enjoyable physically and visually comfortable easy to use and exciting and children wanted to use them again. They identified several potential usages for HMDs including relaxing/feeling calm being able to explore somewhere virtually before visiting in the real world and to develop learning opportunities in school. We discuss these findings in the context of VR in classrooms in addition to considering limitations and implication of our findings.
