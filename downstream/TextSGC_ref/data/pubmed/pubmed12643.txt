Attribute-based identification systems are essential for forensic investigations because they help in identifying individuals. An item such as clothing is a visual attribute because it can usually be used to describe people. The method proposed in this article aims to identify people based on the visual information derived from their attire. Deep learning is used to train the computer to classify images based on clothing content. We first demonstrate clothing classification using a large scale dataset where the proposed model performs relatively poorly. Then we use clothing classification on a dataset containing popular logos and famous brand images. The results show that the model correctly classifies most of the test images with a success rate that is higher than 70%. Finally we evaluate clothing classification using footage from surveillance cameras. The system performs well on this dataset labelling 70% of the test images correctly.
