This paper discusses the classification of horse gaits for self-coaching using an ensemble stacked auto-encoder ESAE based on wavelet packets from the motion data of the horse rider. For this purpose we built an ESAE and used probability values at the end of the softmax classifier. First we initialized variables such as hidden nodes weight and max epoch using the options of the auto-encoder AE. Second the ESAE model is trained by feedforward back propagation and gradient calculation. Next the parameters are updated by a gradient descent mechanism as new parameters. Finally once the error value is satisfied the algorithm terminates. The experiments were performed to classify horse gaits for self-coaching. We constructed the motion data of a horse rider. For the experiment an expert horse rider of the national team wore a suit containing 16 inertial sensors based on a wireless network. To improve and quantify the performance of the classification we used three methods wavelet packet statistical value and ensemble model as well as cross entropy with mean squared error. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method showed good performance when compared with conventional algorithms such as the support vector machine SVM.
