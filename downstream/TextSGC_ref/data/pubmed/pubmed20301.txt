Body change illusions have been of great interest in recent years for the understanding of how the brain represents the body. Appropriate multisensory stimulation can induce an illusion of ownership over a rubber or virtual arm simple types of out-of-the-body experiences and even ownership with respect to an alternate whole body. Here we use immersive virtual reality to investigate whether the illusion of a dramatic increase in belly size can be induced in males through a first person perspective position b synchronous visual-motor correlation between real and virtual arm movements and c self-induced synchronous visual-tactile stimulation in the stomach area. Multisensory stimulation can induce an illusion of larger belly size in immersive virtual reality.
