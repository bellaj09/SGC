"This study is aimed at determining whether the simulator sickness SS experienced by some drivers is influenced by psychological factors such as cognitive solicitation affective factors and a feeling of presence. We also wished to determine whether SS is caused by an individual reaction to the virtual environment VE itself or can be attributed to a more general personal predisposition. For this reason we considered three conditions: driving a simulator driving ones own vehicle and driving a school-owned vehicle. Fourteen expert drivers participated in the study. Each drove under a different experimental condition and then responded to various questionnaires SSQ NASA-TLX and QPF. Our results showed that it is possible to identify at least three sources of explanation of why some people are more liable to feel sick in a driving simulator."
