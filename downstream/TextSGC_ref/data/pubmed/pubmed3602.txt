Mental health care is an important issue in areas stricken by a natural disaster. Some people develop stress-related mental disorders while others are resilient to the traumatic events. In this study we evaluated the relationships between resilience and structural neural networks derived from the gray matter MRI scan of the brain by using a novel similarity-based approach. Structural brain network correlated with the resilience to traumatic events in the healthy participants: An MRI study on healthy people in a stricken area of the Great East Japan Earthquake.
