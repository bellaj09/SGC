"Monitoring electricity consumption in the home is an important way to help reduce energy usage. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring NILM is existing technique which helps us monitor electricity consumption effectively and costly. NILM is a promising approach to obtain estimates of the electrical power consumption of individual appliances from aggregate measurements of voltage and/or current in the distribution system. Among the previous studies Hidden Markov Model HMM based models have been studied very much. However increasing appliances multistate of appliances and similar power consumption of appliances are three big issues in NILM recently. In this paper we address these problems through providing our contributions as follows. First we proposed state-of-the-art energy disaggregation based on Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network LSTM-RNN model and additional advanced deep learning. Second we proposed a novel signature to improve classification performance of the proposed model in multistate appliance case. We applied the proposed model on two datasets such as UK-DALE and REDD. Via our experimental results we have confirmed that our model outperforms the advanced model. Thus we show that our combination between advanced deep learning and novel signature can be a robust solution to overcome NILMs issues and improve the performance of load identification."
