What does one feel when one uses virtual reality? How does this experience differ from the experience associated with "real life" activities and situations? To answer these questions we used the Experience Sampling Method ESM a procedure that allows researchers to investigate the daily fluctuations in the quality of experience through on-line self reports that participants fill out during daily life. The investigation consisted in one-week ESM observation N = 42. During this week participants underwent two virtual reality sessions: Immediately after the exposure to virtual environments they were asked to complete a ESM report. For data analysis experiential variables were aggregated into four dimensions: Mood Engagement Confidence and Intrinsic Motivation Intrinsic Motivation. Findings showed that virtual experience is characterized by a specific configuration which comprises significantly positive values for affective and cognitive components. In particular positive scores of Mood suggest that participants perceived VR as an intrinsically pleasurable activity while positive values of Engagement indicate that the use of VR and the experimental task provided valid opportunities for action and high skill investment. Furthermore results showed that virtual experience is associated with Flow a state of consciousness characterized by narrowed focus of attention deep concentration positive affect and intrinsic reward. Implications for VR research and practice are discussed. Quality of experience in real and virtual environments: some suggestions for the development of positive technologies.
