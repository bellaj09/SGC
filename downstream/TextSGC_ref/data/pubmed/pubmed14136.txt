"Melanoma results in the vast majority of skin cancer deaths during the last decades even though this disease accounts for only one percent of all skin cancers instances. The survival rates of melanoma from early to terminal stages is more than fifty percent. Therefore having the right information at the right time by early detection with monitoring skin lesions to find potential problems is essential to surviving this type of cancer."
