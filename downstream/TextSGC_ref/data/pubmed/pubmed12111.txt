Deep sequencing of lymphocyte receptor repertoires has made it possible to comprehensively profile the clonal composition of lymphocyte populations. This opens the door for novel approaches to diagnose and prognosticate diseases with a driving immune component by identifying repertoire sequence patterns associated with clinical phenotypes. Indeed recent studies support the feasibility of this demonstrating an association between repertoire-level summary statistics e.g. diversity and patient outcomes for several diseases. In our own prior work we have shown that six codons in VH4-containing genes in B cells from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis RRMS have higher replacement mutation frequencies than observed in healthy controls or patients with other neurological diseases. However prior methods to date have been limited to focusing on repertoire-level summary statistics ignoring the vast amounts of information in the millions of individual immune receptors comprising a repertoire. We have developed a novel method that addresses this limitation by using innovative approaches for accommodating the extraordinary sequence diversity of immune receptors and widely used machine learning approaches. We applied our method to RRMS an autoimmune disease that is notoriously difficult to diagnose.
