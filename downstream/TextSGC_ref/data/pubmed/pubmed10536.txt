Ubiquitination which is also called "lysine ubiquitination" occurs when an ubiquitin is attached to lysine K residues in targeting proteins. As one of the most important post translational modifications PTMs it plays the significant role not only in protein degradation but also in other cellular functions. Thus systematic anatomy of the ubiquitination proteome is an appealing and challenging research topic. The existing methods for identifying protein ubiquitination sites can be divided into two kinds: mass spectrometry and computational methods. Mass spectrometry-based experimental methods can discover ubiquitination sites from eukaryotes but are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore it is priority to develop computational approaches that can effectively and accurately identify protein ubiquitination sites. Large-scale prediction of protein ubiquitination sites using a multimodal deep architecture.
