This paper presents a new discriminative deep metric learning DDML method for face and kinship verification in wild conditions. While metric learning has achieved reasonably good performance in face and kinship verification most existing metric learning methods aim to learn a single Mahalanobis distance metric to maximize the inter-class variations and minimize the intra-class variations which cannot capture the nonlinear manifold where face images usually lie on. To address this we propose a DDML method to train a deep neural network to learn a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project face pairs into the same latent feature space under which the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged. To better use the commonality of multiple feature descriptors to make all the features more robust for face and kinship verification we develop a discriminative deep multi-metric learning method to jointly learn multiple neural networks under which the correlation of different features of each sample is maximized and the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed methods achieve the acceptable results in both face and kinship verification.
