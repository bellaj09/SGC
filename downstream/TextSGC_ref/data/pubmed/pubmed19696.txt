The main difference between a virtual reality and a generic representation is to be directly involved into the action you are performing. As a matter of fact within the shift from real to virtual world our biological physique does not mutate but is amplified and connected to the virtual world by technological interfaces. Training using a virtual reality simulator is an option to supplement or replace standard training. One of the two main goals of our study is to test at first how much students enrolled to the Faculty of Medicine at "University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome" are familiar with synthetic worlds how long they have been using them and how they would like their Avatar to look like. Moreover the second aim is to collect students\ opinion about the use of virtual interactive environments to enable learning and participation in dynamic problem based clinical virtual simulations. Simulations might be used to allow learners to make mistakes safely in lieu of real life situations learn from those mistakes and ultimately to improve performances by subsequent avoidance of those mistakes. Cognitive research about the use of virtual worlds among the students enrolled to the faculty of medicine and surgery "Campus Bio-Medico University" in Rome.
