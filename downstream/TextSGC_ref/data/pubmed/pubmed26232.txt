Brain computer interfaces BCIs offer individuals suffering from major disabilities an alternative method to interact with their environment. Sensorimotor rhythm SMRs based BCIs can successfully perform control tasks; however the traditional SMR paradigms intuitively disconnect the control and real task making them non-ideal for complex control scenarios. In this study we design a new intuitively connected motor imagery MI paradigm using hierarchical common spatial patterns HCSP and context information to effectively predict intended hand grasps from electroencephalogram EEG data. Experiments with 5 participants yielded an aggregate classification accuracy-intended grasp prediction probability-of 64.5% for 8 different hand gestures more than 5 times the chance level. Decoding complex imagery hand gestures.
