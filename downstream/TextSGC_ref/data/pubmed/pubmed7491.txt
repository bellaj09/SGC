In recent years there have been many studies indicating that multiple cortical features extracted at each surface vertex are promising in the detection of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. However with limited datasets it is challenging to train stable classifiers with such high-dimensional surface data. This necessitates a feature reduction that is commonly accomplished via regional volumetric morphometry from standard brain atlases. However current regional summaries are not specific to the given age or pathology that is studied which runs the risk of losing relevant information that can be critical in the classification process. To solve this issue this paper proposes a novel data-driven approach by extending convolutional neural networks CNN for use on non-Euclidean manifolds such as cortical surfaces. The proposed network learns the most powerful features and brain regions from the extracted large dimensional feature space; thus creating a new feature space in which the dimensionality is reduced and feature distributions are better separated. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed surface-CNN framework in an example study classifying Alzheimers disease patients versus normal controls. The high performance in the cross-validation diagnostic results shows the potential of our proposed prediction system. NON-EUCLIDEAN CONVOLUTIONAL LEARNING ON CORTICAL BRAIN SURFACES.
