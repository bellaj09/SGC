Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution development and function. The pharynx of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self-contained autonomously acting nervous system composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial EM reconstruction we re-evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter- and motor neuron classes we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most if not all pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross-connectivity among pharyngeal neurons which is more widespread than previously realized the sensory-motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared to the somatic nervous system pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral primitive nervous systems. This article is protected by copyright.
