The success of combination antiretroviral therapy cART in transforming the lives of HIV-infected individuals with access to these drugs is tempered by the increasing threat of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders HAND to their overall health and quality of life. Intensive investigations over the past two decades have underscored the role of host immune responses inflammation and monocyte-derived macrophages in HAND but the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying HAND remain only partially delineated. Complicating research efforts and therapeutic drug development are the sheer complexity of HAND phenotypes diagnostic imprecision and the growing intersection of chronic immune activation with aging-related comorbidities. Yet genetic studies still offer a powerful means of advancing individualized care for HIV-infected individuals at risk. There is an urgent need for 1 longitudinal studies using consistent phenotypic definitions of HAND in HIV-infected subpopulations at very high risk of being adversely impacted such as children 2 tissue studies that correlate neuropathological changes in multiple brain regions with genomic markers in affected individuals and with changes at the RNA epigenomic and/or protein levels and 3 genetic association studies using more sensitive subphenotypes of HAND. The NIH Brain Initiative and Human Connectome Project coupled with rapidly evolving systems biology and machine learning approaches for analyzing high-throughput genetic transcriptomic and epigenetic data hold promise for identifying actionable biological processes and gene networks that underlie HAND. This review summarizes the current state of understanding of host genetic factors predisposing to HAND in light of past challenges and suggests some priorities for future research to advance the understanding and clinical management of HAND in the cART era.
