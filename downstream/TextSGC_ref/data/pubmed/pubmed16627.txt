Fears and phobias are common in people on the autism spectrum and can impact on their ability to undertake usual daily activities. Graded exposure to the anxiety-provoking stimulus is a recognized method of treatment for fears/phobias in the nonautistic population but may pose specific difficulties for autistic people. For example real-life exposure can be too anxiety-provoking to allow treatment to take place and imaginal exposure can be problematic. To address this we developed an intervention that combines cognitive behavioral therapy CBT with immersive virtual reality VR exposure to reduce anxiety. Following successful trials of this intervention with young people on the autism spectrum we report a pilot study using the same intervention with autistic adults. Eight adults aged 18-57 years received one psychoeducation session and then four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with a therapist in an immersive VR room known as the Blue Room. Each participant completed all sessions showing that the intervention is feasible and acceptable. Outcomes were monitored at 6 weeks and 6 months postintervention. Five of the eight participants were classified as intervention responders and at 6 months after the end of intervention were experiencing real-life functional improvements. These preliminary findings show that VR-graded exposure alongside CBT may be an effective treatment for autistic people with phobias.
