"Pioneering work with nonhuman primates and recent human studies established intracortical microstimulation ICMS in primary somatosensory cortex S1 as a method of inducing discriminable artificial sensation. However these artificial sensations do not yet provide the breadth of cutaneous and proprioceptive percepts available through natural stimulation. In a tetraplegic human with two microelectrode arrays implanted in S1 we report replicable elicitations of sensations in both the cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities localized to the contralateral arm dependent on both amplitude and frequency of stimulation. Furthermore we found a subset of electrodes that exhibited multimodal properties and that proprioceptive percepts on these electrodes were associated with higher amplitudes irrespective of the frequency. These novel results demonstrate the ability to provide naturalistic percepts through ICMS that can more closely mimic the bodys natural physiological capabilities. Furthermore delivering both cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations through artificial somatosensory feedback could improve performance and embodiment in brain-machine interfaces."
