"The accurate identification of malignant lung nodules on chest CT is critical for the early detection of lung cancer which also offers patients the best chance of cure. Deep learning methods have recently been successfully introduced to computer vision problems although substantial challenges remain in the detection of malignant nodules due to the lack of large training data sets. In this paper we propose a multi-view knowledge-based collaborative MV-KBC deep model to separate malignant from benign nodules using limited chest CT data. Our model learns 3-D lung nodule characteristics by decomposing a 3-D nodule into nine fixed views. For each view we construct a knowledge-based collaborative KBC submodel where three types of image patches are designed to fine-tune three pre-trained ResNet-50 networks that characterize the nodules overall appearance voxel and shape heterogeneity respectively. We jointly use the nine KBC submodels to classify lung nodules with an adaptive weighting scheme learned during the error back propagation which enables the MV-KBC model to be trained in an end-to-end manner. The penalty loss function is used for better reduction of the false negative rate with a minimal effect on the overall performance of the MV-KBC model. We tested our method on the benchmark LIDC-IDRI data set and compared it to the five state-of-the-art classification approaches. Our results show that the MV-KBC model achieved an accuracy of 91.60% for lung nodule classification with an AUC of 95.70%. These results are markedly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches."
