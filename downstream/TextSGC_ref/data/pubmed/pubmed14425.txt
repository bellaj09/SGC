"While computerised tomography CT may have been the first imaging tool to study human brain it has not yet been implemented into clinical decision making process for diagnosis of Alzheimers disease AD. On the other hand with the nature of being prevalent inexpensive and non-invasive CT does present diagnostic features of AD to a great extent. This study explores the significance and impact on the application of the burgeoning deep learning techniques to the task of classification of CT brain images in particular utilising convolutional neural network CNN aiming at providing supplementary information for the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. Towards this end three categories of CT images N\u2009=\u2009285 are clustered into three groups which are AD lesion e.g. tumour and normal ageing. In addition considering the characteristics of this collection with larger thickness along the direction of depth z ~3-5\u2009mm an advanced CNN architecture is established integrating both 2D and 3D CNN networks. The fusion of the two CNN networks is subsequently coordinated based on the average of Softmax scores obtained from both networks consolidating 2D images along spatial axial directions and 3D segmented blocks respectively. As a result the classification accuracy rates rendered by this elaborated CNN architecture are 85.2% 80% and 95.3% for classes of AD lesion and normal respectively with an average of 87.6%. Additionally this improved CNN network appears to outperform the others when in comparison with 2D version only of CNN network as well as a number of state of the art hand-crafted approaches. As a result these approaches deliver accuracy rates in percentage of 86.3 85.6\u2009\u20091.10 86.3\u2009\u20091.04 85.2\u2009\u20091.60 83.1\u2009\u20090.35 for 2D CNN 2D SIFT 2D KAZE 3D SIFT and 3D KAZE respectively. The two major contributions of the paper constitute a new 3-D approach while applying deep learning technique to extract signature information rooted in both 2D slices and 3D blocks of CT images and an elaborated hand-crated approach of 3D KAZE."
