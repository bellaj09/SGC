Deep learning has recently gained more and more popularity because of its high accuracy and wide range of coverage. In particular deep learning is widely used in the medical field. Because in the field of image classification and biological applications the accuracy of deep learning is very high. Unfortunately even under the collaborative deep learning there is still serious risk of information leakage. Moreover the risk of information leakage in the medical field is greater and the harm is even greater. For example medical treatment data may be leaked to third-party organizations. When these important medical data is illegally used by for-profit organizations or obtained by criminals it will not only lead to the disclosure of personal privacy information but also cause serious economic losses to the victims. However the victim cannot delete the leaked information by itself or limit the scope and use of the information that has been leaked. Therefore the adverse effects are unimaginable. This paper mainly studies the information protection methods under GAN model attack in order to find a better way to prevent attacks and effectively protect information. A Method of Information Protection for Collaborative Deep Learning under GAN Model Attack.
