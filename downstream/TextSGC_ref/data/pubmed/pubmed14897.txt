Melanoma is a dangerous form of the skin cancer responsible for thousands of deaths every year. Early detection of melanoma is possible through visual inspection of pigmented lesions over the skin treated with simple excision of the cancerous cells. However due to the limited availability of dermatologists the visual inspection alone has the limited and variable accuracy that leads the patient to undergo a series of biopsies and complicates the treatment. In this work a deep learning method is proposed for automated Melanoma region segmentation using dermoscopic images to overcome the challenges of automated Melanoma region segmentation within dermoscopic images. Melanoma lesion detection and segmentation using deep region based convolutional neural network and fuzzy C-means clustering.
