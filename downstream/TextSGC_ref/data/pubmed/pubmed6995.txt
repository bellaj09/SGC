"Rapid growth in electronic health records EHRs use has led to an unprecedented expansion of available clinical data in electronic formats. However much of the important healthcare information is locked in the narrative documents. Therefore Natural Language Processing NLP technologies e.g. Named Entity Recognition that identifies boundaries and types of entities has been extensively studied to unlock important clinical information in free text. In this study we investigated a novel deep learning method to recognize clinical entities in Chinese clinical documents using the minimal feature engineering approach. We developed a deep neural network DNN to generate word embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus through unsupervised learning and another DNN for the NER task. The experiment results showed that the DNN with word embeddings trained from the large unlabeled corpus outperformed the state-of-the-art CRFs model in the minimal feature engineering setting achieving the highest F1-score of 0.9280. Further analysis showed that word embeddings derived through unsupervised learning from large unlabeled corpus remarkably improved the DNN with randomized embedding denoting the usefulness of unsupervised feature learning."
