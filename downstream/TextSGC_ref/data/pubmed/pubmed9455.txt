Automated vehicles will provide greater transport convenience and interconnectivity increase mobility options to young and elderly people and reduce traffic congestion and emissions. However the largest obstacle towards the deployment of automated vehicles on public roads is their safety evaluation and validation. Undeniably the role of cameras and Artificial Intelligence-based AI vision is vital in the perception of the driving environment and road safety. Although a significant number of studies on the detection and tracking of vehicles have been conducted none of them focused on the role of vertical vehicle dynamics. For the first time this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of road anomalies and vehicle suspension on the performance of detecting and tracking driving objects. To this end we conducted an extensive road field study and validated a computational tool for performing the assessment using simulations. A parametric study revealed the cases where AI-based vision underperforms and may significantly degrade the safety performance of AVs.
