In developmental research to devise a strategy to identify students who may benefit from assistance with learning habits approaches to study were explored in undergraduate nursing students n=122 enrolled in a compulsory first-year course in physiology at a regional Australian university. The course constituted 30 credits 25% of their first year of study. Using the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory ASSIST students were identified as adopting a deep n = 38 31% strategic n = 30 25% or a surface n = 54 44% approach to study. Internal consistency Cronbach\s alpha  for deep strategic and surface was 0.85 0.87 and 0.76 respectively. Subsequently a cluster analysis was done to identify two groupings: a "surface" group n = 53 and a "deep/strategic" group n = 69. The surface group scored lower in deep 33.28  6.42 and strategic 39.36  6.79 approaches and higher in the surface 46.96  9.57 approach. Conversely the deep/strategic group scored 46.10  6.81 57.17  7.81 and 41.87  6.47 in deep strategic and surface styles respectively. This application of the ASSIST questionnaire and cluster analysis thus differentiated students adopting a surface approach to study. This strategy may enable educators to target resources for example additional tutorial opportunities peer-assisted study support and tutor-led seminar sessions aimed at encouraging students to adopt a less superficial approach to study.
