"Emergency Cricothyroidotomy CCT is a surgical procedure performed to secure a patients airway. This high-stakes but seldom-performed procedure is an ideal candidate for a virtual reality simulator to enhance physician training. For the first time this study characterizes the force/torque characteristics of the cricothyroidotomy procedure to guide development of a virtual reality CCT simulator for use in medical training. We analyze the upper force and torque thresholds experienced at the human-scalpel interface. We then group individual surgical cuts based on style of cut and cut medium and perform a regression analysis to create two models that allow us to predict the style of cut performed and the cut medium." 3D force/torque characterization of emergency cricothyroidotomy procedure using an instrumented scalpel.
