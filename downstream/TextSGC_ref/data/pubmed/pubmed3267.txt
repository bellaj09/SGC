As knowledge of the brain has increased clinicians have learned that the cerebrum is composed of complex networks that interact to execute key functions. While neurosurgeons can typically predict and preserve primary cortical function through the primary visual and motor cortices preservation of higher cognitive functions that are less well localized in regions previously deemed "silent" has proven more difficult. This suggests these silent cortical regions are more anatomically complex and redundant than our previous methods of inquiry can explain and that progress in cerebral surgery will be made with an improved understanding of brain connectomics. Newly published parcellated cortex maps provide one avenue to study such connectomics in greater detail and they provide a superior framework and nomenclature for studying cerebral function and anatomy.
