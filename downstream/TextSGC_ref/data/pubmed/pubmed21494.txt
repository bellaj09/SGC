As a spatial selective attention-based brain-computer interface BCI paradigm steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP BCI has the advantages of high information transfer rate high tolerance to artifacts and robust performance across users. However its benefits come at the cost of mental load and fatigue occurring in the concentration on the visual stimuli. Noise as a ubiquitous random perturbation with the power of randomness may be exploited by the human visual system to enhance higher-level brain functions. In this study a novel steady-state motion visual evoked potential SSMVEP i.e. one kind of SSVEP-based BCI paradigm with spatiotemporal visual noise was used to investigate the influence of noise on the compensation of mental load and fatigue deterioration during prolonged attention tasks. Changes in    +  powers / ratio and electroencephalography EEG properties of amplitude signal-to-noise ratio SNR and online accuracy were used to evaluate mental load and fatigue. We showed that presenting a moderate visual noise to participants could reliably alleviate the mental load and fatigue during online operation of visual BCI that places demands on the attentional processes. This demonstrated that noise could provide a superior solution to the implementation of visual attention controlling-based BCI applications.
