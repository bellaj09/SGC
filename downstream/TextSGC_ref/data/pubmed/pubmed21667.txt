Lightweight and portable devices that objectively measure concussion-related impairments could improve injury detection and critical decision-making in contact sports and the military where brain injuries commonly occur but remain underreported. Current standard assessments often rely heavily on subjective methods such as symptom self-reporting. Head-mounted wearables such as smartglasses provide an emerging platform for consideration that could deliver the range of assessments necessary to develop a rapid and objective screen for brain injury. Standing balance assessment one parameter that may inform a concussion diagnosis could theoretically be performed quantitatively using current off-the-shelf smartglasses with an internal accelerometer. However the validity of balance measurement using smartglasses has not been investigated.
