Purpose The present study aimed to determine the effect of virtual reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit on the muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremities of normal adults. Subjects The subjects of the study were 24 normal adults who were divided into a virtual reality exercise group VREG n=12 and a stable surface exercise group SEG n=12. Methods The exercises of the VREG using the Nintendo Wii Fit and the SEG using a stable surface were conducted three times a week for six weeks. Electromyography was used to measure the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior TA medial gastrocnemius MG erector spinae ES and rectus abdominal RA muscles. Results VREG showed significant within group differences in TA and MG muscle activities while the SEG showed a significant difference in the muscle activity of the MG. Conclusion Virtual reality exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit was an effective intervention for the muscle activities of the TA and MG of normal adults. Effect of virtual reality exercise using the nintendo wii fit on muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremities of normal adults.
