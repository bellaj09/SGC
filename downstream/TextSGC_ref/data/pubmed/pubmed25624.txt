Current prosthesis command interfaces only allow for a single degree of freedom to be commanded at a time making coordinated motion difficult to achieve. Thus it becomes crucial to develop methods that complement these interfaces to allow for intuitive coordinated arm motion. Kinematic synergies have been shown as an alternate method where the motion of the prosthetic device is coordinated with that of the residual limb. In this paper the mapping between the parameters of a kinematic synergy model and a measure of task performance is established experimentally in order to test the applicability of online optimization methods for the identification of synergies. To achieve this a cost function that captures the objective of the reaching task and a linear kinematic synergy model were chosen. A human experiment was developed in a Virtual Reality VR platform in order to determine the synergy-performance relationship. The experiments were performed on 10 able-bodied subjects. The relationship observed between the synergy parameter and the reaching task cost function suggests existing online optimization methods may be applicable.
