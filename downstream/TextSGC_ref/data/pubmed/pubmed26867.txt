Common spatial pattern CSP is one of the most popular and effective feature extraction methods for motor imagery-based brain-computer interface BCI but the inherent drawback of CSP is that the estimation of the covariance matrices is sensitive to noise. In this work local temporal correlation LTC information was introduced to further improve the covariance matrices estimation LTCCSP. Compared to the Euclidean distance used in a previous CSP variant named local temporal CSP LTCSP the correlation may be a more reasonable metric to measure the similarity of activated spatial patterns existing in motor imagery period. Numerical comparisons among CSP LTCSP and LTCCSP were quantitatively conducted on the simulated datasets by adding outliers to Dataset IVa of BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV respectively. Results showed that LTCCSP achieves the highest average classification accuracies in all the outliers occurrence frequencies. The application of the three methods to the EEG dataset recorded in our laboratory also demonstrated that LTCCSP achieves the highest average accuracy. The above results consistently indicate that LTCCSP would be a promising method for practical motor imagery BCI application.
