In an era of residency duty-hour restrictions there has been a recent effort to implement simulation-based training methods in neurosurgery teaching institutions. Several surgical simulators have been developed ranging from physical models to sophisticated virtual reality systems. To date there is a paucity of information describing the clinical benefits of existing simulators and the assessment strategies to help implement them into neurosurgical curricula. Here we present a systematic review of the current models of simulation and discuss the state-of-the-art and future directions for simulation in neurosurgery. The role of simulation in neurosurgery.
