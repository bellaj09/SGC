Prognostics is a core process of prognostics and health management PHM discipline that estimates the remaining useful life RUL of a degrading machinery to optimize its service delivery potential. However machinery operates in a dynamic environment and the acquired condition monitoring data are usually noisy and subject to a high level of uncertainty/unpredictability which complicates prognostics. The complexity further increases when there is absence of prior knowledge about ground truth or failure definition. For such issues data-driven prognostics can be a valuable solution without deep understanding of system physics. This paper contributes a new data-driven prognostics approach namely an "enhanced multivariate degradation modeling" which enables modeling degrading states of machinery without assuming a homogeneous pattern. In brief a predictability scheme is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Following that the proposed prognostics model is achieved by integrating two new algorithms namely the summation wavelet-extreme learning machine and subtractive-maximum entropy fuzzy clustering to show evolution of machine degradation by simultaneous predictions and discrete state estimation. The prognostics model is equipped with a dynamic failure threshold assignment procedure to estimate RUL in a realistic manner. To validate the proposition a case study is performed on turbofan engines data from PHM challenge 2008 NASA and results are compared with recent publications.
