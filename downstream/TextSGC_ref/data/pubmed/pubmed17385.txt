"Deep learning using convolutional neural networks CNNs is a distinguished tool for many image classification tasks. Due to its outstanding robustness and generalization it is also expected to play a key role to facilitate advanced computer-aided diagnosis CAD for pathology images. However the shortage of well-annotated pathology image data for training deep neural networks has become a major issue at present because of the high-cost annotation upon pathologists professional observation. Faced with this problem transfer learning techniques are generally used to reinforcing the capacity of deep neural networks. In order to further boost the performance of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks and alleviate insufficiency of well-annotated data this paper presents a novel stepwise fine-tuning-based deep learning scheme for gastric pathology image classification and establishes a new type of target-correlative intermediate datasets. Our proposed scheme is deemed capable of making the deep neural network imitating the pathologists perception manner and of acquiring pathology-related knowledge in advance but with very limited extra cost in data annotation. The experiments are conducted with both well-annotated gastric pathology data and the proposed target-correlative intermediate data on several state-of-the-art deep neural networks. The results congruously demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed scheme for boosting the classification performance."
