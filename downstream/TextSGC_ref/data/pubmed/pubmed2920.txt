"Modern technologies are enabling scientists to collect extraordinary amounts of complex and sophisticated data across a huge range of scales like never before. With this onslaught of data we can allow the focal point to shift from data collection to data analysis. Unfortunately lack of standardized sharing mechanisms and practices often make reproducing or extending scientific results very difficult. With the creation of data organization structures and tools that drastically improve code portability we now have the opportunity to design such a framework for communicating extensible scientific discoveries. Our proposed solution leverages these existing technologies and standards and provides an accessible and extensible model for reproducible research called science in the cloud SIC. Exploiting scientific containers cloud computing and cloud data services we show the capability to compute in the cloud and run a web service that enables intimate interaction with the tools and data presented. We hope this model will inspire the community to produce reproducible and importantly extensible results that will enable us to collectively accelerate the rate at which scientific breakthroughs are discovered replicated and extended."
