"Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs process brain activity in real time and mediate non-muscular interaction between and individual and the environment. The subserving algorithms can be used to provide a quantitative measurement of physiological or pathological cognitive processes - such as Motor Imagery MI - and feed it back the user. In this paper we propose the clinical application of a BCI-based rehabilitation device to promote motor recovery after stroke. The BCI-based device and the therapy exploiting its use follow the same principles that drive classical neuromotor rehabilitation and i provides the physical therapist with a monitoring instrument to assess the patients participation in the rehabilitative cognitive exercise; ii assists the patient in the practice of MI. The device was installed in the ward of a rehabilitation hospital and a group of 29 patients were involved in its testing. Among them eight have already undergone a one-month training with the device as an add-on to the regular therapy. An improved system which includes analysis of Electromyographic EMG patterns and Functional Electrical Stimulation FES of the arm muscles is also under clinical evaluation. We found that the rehabilitation exercise based on BCI-mediated neurofeedback mechanisms enables a better engagement of motor areas with respect to motor imagery alone and thus it can promote neuroplasticity in brain regions affected by a cerebrovascular accident. Preliminary results also suggest that the functional outcome of motor rehabilitation may be improved by the use of the proposed device."
