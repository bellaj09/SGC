Recent years have witnessed the success of deep convolutional neural networks for image classification and many related tasks. It should be pointed out that the existing training strategies assume that there is a clean dataset for model learning. In elaborately constructed benchmark datasets deep network has yielded promising performance under the assumption. However in real-world applications it is burdensome and expensive to collect sufficient clean training samples. On the other hand collecting noisy labeled samples is very economical and practical especially with the rapidly increasing amount of visual data in the web. Unfortunately the accuracy of current deep models may drop dramatically even with 5%-10% label noise. Therefore enabling label noise resistant classification has become a crucial issue in the data driven deep learning approaches. In this paper we propose a DEep COnfiDEnce network DECODE to address this issue. In particular based on the distribution of mislabeled data we adopt a confidence evaluation module that is able to determine the confidence that a sample is mislabeled. With the confidence we further use a weighting strategy to assign different weights to different samples so that the model pays less attention to low confidence data which is more likely to be noise. In this way the deep model is more robust to label noise. DECODE is designed to be general such that it can be easily combined with existing studies. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets and the results validate that DECODE can improve the accuracy of deep models trained with noisy data.
