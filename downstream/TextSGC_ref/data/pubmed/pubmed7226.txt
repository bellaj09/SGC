"Accurate and automatic brain metastases target delineation is a key step for efficient and effective stereotactic radiosurgery SRS treatment planning. In this work we developed a deep learning convolutional neural network CNN algorithm for segmenting brain metastases on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging MRI datasets. We integrated the CNN-based algorithm into an automatic brain metastases segmentation workflow and validated on both Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation challenge BRATS data and clinical patients data. Validation on BRATS data yielded average DICE coefficients DCs of 0.750.07 in the tumor core and 0.810.04 in the enhancing tumor which outperformed most techniques in the 2015 BRATS challenge. Segmentation results of patient cases showed an average of DCs 0.670.03 and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.980.01. The developed automatic segmentation strategy surpasses current benchmark levels and offers a promising tool for SRS treatment planning for multiple brain metastases."
