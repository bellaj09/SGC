In multiphase coronary CT angiography CTA a series of CT images are taken at different levels of radiation dose during the examination. Although this reduces the total radiation dose the image quality during the low-dose phases is significantly degraded. Recently deep neural network approaches based on supervised learning technique have demonstrated impressive performance improvement over conventional model-based iterative methods for low-dose CT. However matched low- and routine-dose CT image pairs are difficult to obtain in multiphase CT. To address this problem we aim at developing a new deep learning framework.
