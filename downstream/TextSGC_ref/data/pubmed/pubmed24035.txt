Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects socio-emotional skills and perspective-taking abilities. Although social stories in a form of virtual reality program can help children with ASD developing them and identifying appropriate responses might be subjective and thus challenging. Using Delphi method and guided by general case training we involved 63 parents and clinicians of individuals with ASD in two rounds of online iteration to refine the stories. Scenarios that reached a 75% agreement level were accepted. This project is the first study to develop and validate a library of 75 short socio-emotional stories that illustrate various types and intensities of emotion in three social contexts of home school and community as the content of a virtual reality program.
