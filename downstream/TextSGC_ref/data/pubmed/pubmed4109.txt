Decision-making is a crucial cognitive function for various animal species surviving in nature and it is also a fundamental ability for intelligent agents. To make a step forward in the understanding of the computational mechanism of human-like decision-making this paper proposes a brain-inspired decision-making spiking neural network BDM-SNN and applies it to decision-making tasks on intelligent agents. This paper makes the following contributions: 1 A spiking neural network SNN is used to model human decision-making neural circuit from both connectome and functional perspectives. 2 The proposed model combines dopamine and spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP mechanisms to modulate the network learning process which indicates more biological inspiration. 3 The model considers the effects of interactions among sub-areas in PFC on accelerating the learning process. 4 The proposed model can be easily applied to decision-making tasks in intelligent agents such as an unmanned aerial vehicle UAV flying through a window and a UAV avoiding an obstacle. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the model. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and existing biologically inspired methods our method contains more biologically-inspired mechanistic principles has greater accuracy and is faster.
