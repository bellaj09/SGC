"The parahippocampal gyrus-orbitofrontal cortex PHG-OFC circuit in humans is homologous to the postrhinal cortex POR-ventral lateral orbitofrontal cortex vlOFC circuit in rodents. Both are associated with visuospatial malfunctions in Alzheimers disease AD. However the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study we explored the relationship between an impaired POR-vlOFC circuit and visuospatial memory deficits through retrograde tracing and in vivo local field potential recordings in 5XFAD mice and investigated alterations of the PHG-OFC circuit by multi-domain magnetic resonance imaging MRI in patients on the AD spectrum. We demonstrated that an impaired glutamatergic POR-vlOFC circuit resulted in deficient visuospatial memory in 5XFAD mice. Moreover MRI measurements of the PHG-OFC circuit had an accuracy of 77.33% for the classification of amnestic mild cognitive impairment converters versus non-converters. Thus the PHG-OFC circuit explains the neuroanatomical basis of visuospatial memory deficits in AD thereby providing a potential predictor for AD progression and a promising interventional approach for AD."
