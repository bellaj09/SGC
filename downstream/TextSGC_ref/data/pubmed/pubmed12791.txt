Despite the superior performance of deep learning in many applications challenges remain in the area of regression on function spaces. In particular neural networks are unable to encode function inputs compactly as each node encodes just a real value. We propose a novel idea to address this shortcoming: to encode an entire function in a single network node. To that end we design a compact network representation that encodes and propagates functions in single nodes for the distribution regression task. Our proposed distribution regression network DRN achieves higher prediction accuracies while using fewer parameters than traditional neural networks. A compact network learning model for distribution regression.
