The convolutional neural network CNN has made great strides in the area of voiceprint recognition; but it needs a huge number of data samples to train a deep neural network. In practice it is too difficult to get a large number of training samples and it cannot achieve a better convergence state due to the limited dataset. In order to solve this question a new method using a deep migration hybrid model is put forward which makes it easier to realize voiceprint recognition for small samples. Firstly it uses Transfer Learning to transfer the trained network from the big sample voiceprint dataset to our limited voiceprint dataset for the further training. Fully-connected layers of a pre-training model are replaced by restricted Boltzmann machine layers. Secondly the approach of Data Augmentation is adopted to increase the number of voiceprint datasets. Finally we introduce fast batch normalization algorithms to improve the speed of the network convergence and shorten the training time. Our new voiceprint recognition approach uses the TLCNN-RBM convolutional neural network mixed restricted Boltzmann machine based on transfer learning model which is the deep migration hybrid model that is used to achieve an average accuracy of over 97% which is higher than that when using either CNN or the TL-CNN network convolutional neural network based on transfer learning. Thus an effective method for a small sample of voiceprint recognition has been provided. Voiceprint Identification for Limited Dataset Using the Deep Migration Hybrid Model Based on Transfer Learning.
