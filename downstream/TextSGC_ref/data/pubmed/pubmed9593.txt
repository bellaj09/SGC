"In Alzheimers research Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI is an important intermediate stage between normal aging and Alzheimers. How to distinguish MCI samples that finally convert to AD from those do not is an essential problem in the prevention and diagnosis of Alzheimers. Traditional methods use various classification models to distinguish MCI converters from non-converters while the performance is usually limited by the small number of available data. Moreover previous methods only use the data at baseline time for training but ignore the longitudinal information at other time points along the disease progression. To tackle with these problems we propose a novel deep learning framework that uncovers the temporal correlation structure between adjacent time points in the disease progression. We also construct a generative framework to learn the inherent data distribution so as to produce more reliable data to strengthen the training process. Extensive experiments on the ADNI cohort validate the superiority of our model." Temporal Correlation Structure Learning for MCI Conversion Prediction.
