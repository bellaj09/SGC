We investigate the utility of radiofrequency RF parallel transmission pTx for whole-brain resting-state functional MRI rfMRI acquisition at 7 Tesla 7T. To this end Human Connectome Project HCP-style data acquisitions were chosen as a showcase example. Five healthy subjects were scanned in pTx and single-channel transmit 1Tx modes. The pTx data were acquired using a prototype 16-channel transmit system and a commercially available Nova 8-channel transmit 32-channel receive RF head coil. Additionally pTx single-spoke multiband MB pulses were designed to image sagittal slices. HCP-style 7T rfMRI data 1.6-mm isotropic resolution 5-fold slice and 2-fold in-plane acceleration 3600\u202fimage\xa0volumes and  1-h scan were acquired with pTx and the results were compared to those acquired with the original 7T HCP rfMRI protocol. The use of pTx significantly improved flip-angle uniformity across the brain with coefficient of variation i.e. std/mean of whole-brain flip-angle distribution reduced on average by 39%. This in turn yielded 17% increase in group temporal SNR tSNR as averaged across the entire brain and 10% increase in group functional contrast-to-noise ratio fCNR as averaged across the grayordinate space including cortical surfaces and subcortical voxels. Furthermore when placing a seed in either the posterior parietal lobe or putamen to estimate seed-based dense connectome the increase in fCNR was observed to translate into stronger correlation of the seed with the rest of the grayordinate space. We have demonstrated the utility of pTx for slice-accelerated high-resolution whole-brain rfMRI at 7T; as compared to current state-of-the-art the use of pTx improves flip-angle uniformity increases tSNR enhances fCNR and strengthens functional connectivity estimation.
