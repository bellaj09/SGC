Studies have shown that enhancers are significant regulatory elements to play crucial roles in gene expression regulation. Since enhancers are unrelated to the orientation and distance to their target genes it is a challenging mission for scholars and researchers to accurately predicting distal enhancers. In the past years with the high-throughout ChiP-seq technologies development several computational techniques emerge to predict enhancers using epigenetic or genomic features. Nevertheless the inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines and the unsatisfactory prediction performance call for further research in this area. A new method for enhancer prediction based on deep belief network.
