Transection of the nonhuman primate fornix has been shown to impair learning of configurations of spatial features and object-in-scene memory. Although damage to the human fornix also results in memory impairment it is not known whether there is a preferential involvement of this white-matter tract in spatial learning as implied by animal studies. Diffusion-weighted MR images were obtained from healthy participants who had completed versions of a task in which they made rapid same/different discriminations to two categories of highly visually similar stimuli: 1 virtual reality scene pairs; and 2 face pairs. Diffusion-MRI measures of white-matter microstructure fractional anisotropy FA and mean diffusivity MD and macrostructure tissue volume fraction f were then extracted from the fornix of each participant which had been reconstructed using a deterministic tractography protocol. Fornix MD and f measures correlated with scene but not face discrimination accuracy in both discrimination tasks. A complementary voxelwise analysis using tract-based spatial statistics suggested the crus of the fornix as a focus for this relationship. These findings extend previous reports of spatial learning impairments after fornix transection in nonhuman primates critically highlighting the fornix as a source of interindividual variation in scene discrimination in humans. Interindividual variation in fornix microstructure and macrostructure is related to visual discrimination accuracy for scenes but not faces.
