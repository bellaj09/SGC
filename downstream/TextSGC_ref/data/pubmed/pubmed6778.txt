We present a method for the automated segmentation of knee bones and cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging\xa0MRI that combines a priori knowledge of anatomical shape with Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs. The proposed approach incorporates 3D Statistical Shape Models SSMs as well as 2D and 3D CNNs to achieve a robust and accurate segmentation of even highly pathological knee structures. The shape models and neural networks employed are trained using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative OAI and the MICCAI grand challenge "Segmentation of Knee Images 2010" SKI10 respectively. We evaluate our method on 40 validation and 50 submission datasets from the SKI10 challenge. For the first time an accuracy equivalent to the inter-observer variability of human readers is achieved in this challenge. Moreover the quality of the proposed method is thoroughly assessed using various measures for data from the OAI i.e. 507 manual segmentations of bone and cartilage and 88 additional manual segmentations of cartilage. Our method yields sub-voxel accuracy for both OAI datasets. We make the 507 manual segmentations as well as our experimental setup publicly available to further aid research in the field of medical image segmentation. In conclusion combining localized classification via CNNs with statistical anatomical knowledge via SSMs results in a state-of-the-art segmentation method for knee bones and cartilage from MRI data.
