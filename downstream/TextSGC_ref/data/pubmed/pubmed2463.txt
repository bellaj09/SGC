The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90000 infections and >3000 deaths. Coronavirus spike S glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2\xa0S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2\xa0S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2 correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2\xa0S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We\xa0determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2\xa0S ectodomain trimer providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry.\xa0Finally we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.
