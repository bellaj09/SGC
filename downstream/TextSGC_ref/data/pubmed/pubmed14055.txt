"Nurses working with people with learning disabilities are sometimes exposed to provoking behaviour such as unpredictable and violent actions spitting and sexual harassment. Eight nurses at a group dwelling in Sweden were interviewed about their experiences when caring for a person who acts provokingly. Narrative interviews were conducted and interpreted using a method inspired by Ricoeur. Three themes were formulated which describe nurses feelings of being tormented disrupted and helpless. Nurses describe themselves as being deeply humiliated by physical violence spittle sexual invective and actions on the part of the patient. They respond more to being spat on and the sexual invective than to the patients physical violence. The frequent humiliations could be seen as a symbolic language connected to defilement and evil and therefore as having a deep symbolic meaning for the nurses. These results were interpreted and reflected on in the light of a theoretical framework from an affliction perspective in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the text. This paper shows that an affliction perspective is important when searching for the meaning of caring for a patient who acts provokingly. The study indicates that the goal in a provoking care situation must be to see the provoking patient as he appears to the nurses in order to glimpse the goodness concealed behind the provoking facade." The meaning of caring as described by nurses caring for a person who acts provokingly: an interview study.
