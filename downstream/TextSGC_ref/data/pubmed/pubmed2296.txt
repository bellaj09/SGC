"Given the dynamic nature of the human brain there has been an increasing interest in investigating short-term temporal changes in functional connectivity also known as dynamic functional connectivity dFC i.e. the time-varying inter-regional statistical dependence of blood oxygenation level-dependent BOLD signal within the constraints of a single scan. Numerous methodologies have been proposed to characterize dFC during rest and task but few studies have compared them in terms of their efficacy to capture behavioral and clinically relevant dynamics. This is mostly due to lack of a well-defined ground truth especially for rest scans. In this study with a multitask dataset rest memory video and math serving as ground truth we investigated the efficacy of several dFC estimation techniques at capturing cognitively relevant dFC modulation induced by external tasks. We evaluated two framewise methods dFC estimates for a single time point: dynamic conditional correlation DCC and jackknife correlation JC; and five window-based methods: sliding window correlation SWC sliding window correlation with L1-regularization SWC_L1 a combination of DCC and SWC called moving average DCC DCC_MA multiplication of temporal derivatives MTD and a variant of jackknife correlation called delete-d jackknife correlation dJC. The efficacy is defined as each dFC metrics ability to successfully subdivide multitask scans into cognitively homogenous segments even if those segments are not temporally continuous. We found that all window-based dFC methods performed well for commonly used window lengths WL\u202f\u202f30sec with sliding window methods SWC SWC_L1 as well as the hybrid DCC_MA approach performing slightly better. For shorter window lengths WL\u202f\u202f15sec DCC_MA and dJC produced the best results. Neither framewise method i.e. DCC and JC led to dFC estimates with high accuracy."
