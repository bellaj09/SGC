The paper presents a study of an inter-stimulus interval ISI influence on a tactile point-pressure stimulus-based brain-computer interface\s tpBCI classification accuracy. A novel tactile pressure generating tpBCI stimulator is also discussed which is based on a three-by-three pins\ matrix prototype. The six pin-linear patterns are presented to the user\s palm during the online tpBCI experiments in an oddball style paradigm allowing for "the aha-responses" elucidation within the event related potential ERP. A subsequent classification accuracies\ comparison is discussed based on two ISI settings in an online tpBCI application. A research hypothesis of classification accuracies\ non-significant differences with various ISIs is confirmed based on the two settings of 120 ms and 300 ms as well as with various numbers of ERP response averaging scenarios. Inter-stimulus interval study for the tactile point-pressure brain-computer interface.
