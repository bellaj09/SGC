When dealing with nano targeted drug delivery process the significant area of virtual reality application can be visualizing real time process and simulating it at nano-scale since the effectiveness of a drug primarily depends on the affected cell and targeted doze. This paper proposes virtual reality VR as a tool to analyze and simulate nanoparticles NPs manipulation in this paper amorphous NPs are analyzed and simulated in virtual environment. Haptic guides virtualizing the atomic force microscope AFM is applied in the virtual environment which allows the operators to sense and touch the NPs when evaluating its structure drug release time and behavioral study. Cisplatin was loaded as a modal drug to the self-assembled amorphous copolymer P3HV-co-4HB-b-mPEG NPs where the efficiency and bioavailability of Cisplatin was further investigated. The prepared NPs when simulated in virtual environment proved to show good biocompatibility. Results showed that amorphous polymeric NPs could be efficient vehicles for the constant and targeted delivery of toxic anticancer drugs. Haptic guided virtual reality simulation for targeted drug delivery using nano-containers manipulation.
