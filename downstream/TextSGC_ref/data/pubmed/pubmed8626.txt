The purpose of this study is to determine whether a convolutional neural network CNN can predict the maximum standardized uptake value SUVmax of lymph nodes in patients with cancer using the unenhanced CT images from a PET/CT examination thus providing a proof of concept for potentially using deep learning to diagnose nodal involvement.
