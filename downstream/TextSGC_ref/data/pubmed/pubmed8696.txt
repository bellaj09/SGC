Compressed sensing CS is a promising method for accelerating cardiac perfusion MRI to achieve clinically acceptable image quality with high spatial resolution 1.6  1.6  8 mm3  and extensive myocardial coverage 6-8 slices per heartbeat. A major disadvantage of CS is its relatively lengthy processing time ~8 min per slice with 64 frames using a graphics processing unit thereby making it impractical for clinical translation. The purpose of this study was to implement and test whether an image reconstruction pipeline including a neural network is capable of reconstructing 6.4-fold accelerated non-Cartesian radial cardiac perfusion k-space data at least 10 times faster than CS without significant loss in image quality. We implemented a 3D 2D + time U-Net and trained it with 132 2D + time datasets coil combined zero filled as input; CS reconstruction as reference with 64 time frames from 28 patients 8448 2D images in total. For testing we used 56 2D + time coil-combined zero-filled datasets 3584 2D images in total from 12 different patients as input to our trained U-Net and compared the resulting images with CS reconstructed images using quantitative metrics of image quality and visual scores conspicuity of wall enhancement noise artifacts; each score ranging from 1 worst to 5 best with 3 defined as clinically acceptable evaluated by readers. Including pre- and post-processing steps compared with CS U-Net significantly reduced the reconstruction time by 14.4-fold 32.1  1.4 s for U-Net versus 461.3  16.9 s for CS p < 0.001 while maintaining high data fidelity structural similarity index = 0.914  0.023 normalized root mean square error = 1.7  0.3% identical mean edge sharpness of 1.2 mm. The median visual summed score was not significantly different p = 0.053 between CS 14; interquartile range IQR = 0.5 and U-Net 12; IQR = 0.5. This study shows that the proposed pipeline with a U-Net is capable of reconstructing 6.4-fold accelerated non-Cartesian cardiac perfusion k-space data 14.4 times faster than CS without significant loss in data fidelity or image quality. Rapid dealiasing of undersampled non-Cartesian cardiac perfusion images using U-net.
