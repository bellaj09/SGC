"We describe the development and preliminary testing of a low cost virtual reality system that patients with stroke or other neurological impairments could use independently in the home on a personal computer to improve upper extremity motor function including hand and finger control. The system would help meet the needs of the rising number of patients with stroke with impaired hand function. We introduce the concept of a Multiple User Virtual Environment for Rehabilitation MUVER. The MUVER has three components: the low cost P5 Glove tracks arm hand and finger movements the open source Panda3D game engine and laboratory created software. A unique aspect of the MUVER design is the systems capability for four types of multiple user interactions: competition cooperation counter-operative and mixed. Such virtual interactions may help to increase patients motivation to improve and possibly alleviate feelings of social isolation for those who remain homebound. Thus far a proof of concept virtual environment that uses competitive interaction has been created and tested with six healthy subjects."
