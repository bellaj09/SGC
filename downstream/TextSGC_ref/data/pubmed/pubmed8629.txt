Rapid detection of illicit opium poppy plants using UAV unmanned aerial vehicle imagery has become an important means to prevent and combat crimes related to drug cultivation. However current methods rely on time-consuming visual image interpretation. Here the You Only Look Once version 3 YOLOv3 network structure was used to assess the influence that different backbone networks have on the average precision and detection speed of an UAV-derived dataset of poppy imagery with MobileNetv2 MN selected as the most suitable backbone network. A Spatial Pyramid Pooling SPP unit was introduced and Generalized Intersection over Union GIoU was used to calculate the coordinate loss. The resulting SPP-GIoU-YOLOv3-MN model improved the average precision by 1.62% from 94.75% to 96.37% without decreasing speed and achieved an average precision of 96.37% with a detection speed of 29 FPS using an RTX 2080Ti platform. The sliding window method was used for detection in complete UAV images which took approximately 2.2 sec/image approximately 10 faster than visual interpretation. The proposed technique significantly improved the efficiency of poppy detection in UAV images while also maintaining a high detection accuracy. The proposed method is thus suitable for the rapid detection of illicit opium poppy cultivation in residential areas and farmland where UAVs with ordinary visible light cameras can be operated at low altitudes relative height < 200 m.
