The preoperative planning of partial nephrectomy can be facilitated by the ability to view the tumor and surrounding tissue in three-dimensional 3D virtual reality VR. A technique to convert Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine computed tomography scan data into a fully 3D VR environment was developed. The model can be transferred to a personal computer allowing the surgeon to view the 3D model in the operating room. Design of functional simulation of renal cancer in virtual reality environments.
