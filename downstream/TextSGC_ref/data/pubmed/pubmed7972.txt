"The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology CinC Challenge 2017 focused on differentiating AF from noise normal or other rhythms in short term from 9-61 s ECG recordings performed by patients. A total of 12186 ECGs were used: 8528 in the public training set and 3658 in the private hidden test set. Due to the high degree of inter-expert disagreement between a significant fraction of the expert labels we implemented a mid-competition bootstrap approach to expert relabeling of the data levering the best performing Challenge entrants algorithms to identify contentious labels. A total of 75 independent teams entered the Challenge using a variety of traditional and novel methods ranging from random forests to a deep learning approach applied to the raw data in the spectral domain. Four teams won the Challenge with an equal high F1 score averaged across all classes of 0.83 although the top 11 algorithms scored within 2% of this. A combination of 45 algorithms identified using LASSO achieved an F1 of 0.87 indicating that a voting approach can boost performance."
