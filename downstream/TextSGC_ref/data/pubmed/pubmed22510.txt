"This study systematically reviewed the research on assistive technology AT access interfaces used for text entry and conducted a quantitative synthesis of text entry rates TER associated with common interfaces. We searched 10 databases and included studies in which: typing speed was reported in words per minute WPM or equivalent; the access interface was available for public use; and individuals with physical impairments were in the study population. For quantitative synthesis we used only the TER reported for individuals with physical impairments. Studies also had to report the sample size and the average and standard deviation for the TER data. Thirty-nine studies met the criteria for quantitative synthesis. Studies involved seven interface types: standard keyboard typing on-screen keyboard OSK with cursor selection OSK with scanning selection automatic speech recognition ASR Morse code brain-computer interface BCI and other. ASR standard keyboard cursor OSK and scanning OSK had at least four studies and 30 subjects with TER averaging 15.4 12.5 4.2 and 1.7 WPM respectively. When combined with measurements of a particular clients text entry performance the TER from this review can be used within an evidence-based decision-making process for selecting control interfaces."
