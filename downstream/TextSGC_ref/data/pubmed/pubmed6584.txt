"Due to the popularity of smart devices traditional one-way teaching methods might not deeply attract school students attention especially for the junior high school students elementary school students or even younger students which is a critical issue for educators. Therefore we develop an intelligent interactive education system which leverages wearable devices smart watches to accurately capture hand gestures of school students and respond instantly to teachers so as to increase the interaction and attraction of school students in class. In addition through multiple physical information of school students from the smart watch it can find out the crux points of the learning process according to the deep data analysis. In this way it can provide teachers to make instant adjustments and suggest school students to achieve multi-learning and innovative thinking. The system is mainly composed of three components: 1 smart interactive watch; 2 teacher-side smart application App; and 3 cloud-based analysis system. Specifically the smart interactive watch is responsible for detecting the physical information and interaction results of school students and then giving feedback to the teachers. The teacher-side app will provide real-time learning suggestions to adjust the teaching pace to avoid learning disability. The cloud-based analysis system provides intelligent learning advices academic performance prediction and anomaly learning detection. Through field trials our system has been verified that can potentially enhance teaching and learning processes for both educators and school students."
