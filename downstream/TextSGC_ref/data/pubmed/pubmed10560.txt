Lung cancer is the most common cancer that cannot be ignored and cause death with late health care. Currently CT can be used to help doctors detect the lung cancer in the early stages. In many cases the diagnosis of identifying the lung cancer depends on the experience of doctors which may ignore some patients and cause some problems. Deep learning has been proved as a popular and powerful method in many medical imaging diagnosis areas. In this paper three types of deep neural networks e.g. CNN DNN and SAE are designed for lung cancer calcification. Those networks are applied to the CT image classification task with some modification for the benign and malignant lung nodules. Those networks were evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI database. The experimental results show that the CNN network archived the best performance with an accuracy of 84.15% sensitivity of 83.96% and specificity of 84.32% which has the best result among the three networks.
