In this study we developed a deep learning DL algorithm that detects errors in retinal never fibre layer RNFL segmentation on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography SDOCT B-scans using human grades as the reference standard. A dataset of 25250 SDOCT B-scans reviewed for segmentation errors by human graders was randomly divided into validation plus training 50% and test 50% sets. The performance of the DL algorithm was evaluated in the test sample by outputting a probability of having a segmentation error for each B-scan. The ability of the algorithm to detect segmentation errors was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve. Mean DL probabilities of segmentation error in the test sample were 0.90\u2009\u20090.17 vs. 0.12\u2009\u20090.22 P\u2009<\u20090.001 for scans with and without segmentation errors respectively. The DL algorithm had an area under the ROC curve of 0.979 95% CI: 0.974 to 0.984 and an overall accuracy of 92.4%. For the B-scans with severe segmentation errors in the test sample the DL algorithm was 98.9% sensitive. This algorithm can help clinicians and researchers review images for artifacts in SDOCT tests in a timely manner and avoid inaccurate diagnostic interpretations.
