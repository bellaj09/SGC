A major unanswered question in the current global COVID-19 outbreak is why a small minority of infected individuals develop severe disease. Here we report that homozygosity for the C allele of rs12252 in the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 IFITM3 gene is associated with more severe disease in an age dependent manner. This supports a role for IFITM3 in disease pathogenesis and the opportunity for early targeted intervention in at risk individuals. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variant\xa0rs12252-C\xa0is associated with disease severity in COVID-19.
