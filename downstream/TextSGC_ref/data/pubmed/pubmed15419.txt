In the unloading task a weight is held in the palm of one hand. When an external agent removes the weight an upward perturbation of the loaded hand is observed. However when a person removes the weight by lifting it with their own hand the perturbation is attenuated due to an anticipatory adjustment of the flexor muscles in the load-bearing arm. An experiment was conducted to examine conditions under which this anticipatory response could be learned. Using a virtual reality system with force-feedback robotic arms normal subjects performed the unloading task under one of four learning conditions: a the participant initiated the unloading by pressing a button b the unloading was cued by a brief visual stimulus c the unloading was performed by a virtual "hand" that moved smoothly towards the object and d the unloading followed three rhythmic force-pulses applied to the finger of the participant. After extended practice 192 trials we found a significant reduction of the upward perturbation only in the button pressing condition. Control conditions indicated that the acquired response was due to an anticipatory feedforward response rather than due to a change in tonic state such as an increase in arm stiffness. These results indicate that a voluntary action is necessary to acquire an anticipatory adjustment in the unloading task. Anticipatory adjustments in the unloading task: is an efference copy necessary for learning?
