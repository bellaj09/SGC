The ability to recognize faces of family members friends and acquaintances plays an important role in our daily interactions. The other-race effect is the reduced ability to recognize other-race faces as compared to own-race faces. Previous studies showed different patterns of event-related potentials ERPs associated with recollection and familiarity during memory encoding i.e. Dm and recognition i.e. parietal old/new effect for own-race and other-race faces in a subjective-recollection task remember-know judgments. The present study investigated the same neural correlates of the other-race effect in an associative-memory task in which Caucasian and East Asian participants learned and recognized own-race and other-race faces along with background colors. Participants made more false alarms for other-race faces indicating lower memory performance. During the study phase subsequently recognized other-race faces with and without correct background information elicited more positive mean amplitudes than own-race faces suggesting increased neural activation during encoding of other-race faces. During the test phase recollection-related old/new effects dissociated between own-race and other-race faces. Old/new effects were significant only for own-race but not for other-race faces indicating that recognition only of own-race faces was supported by recollection and led to more detailed memory retrieval. Most of these results replicated previous studies that used a subjective-recollection task. Our study also showed that the increased demand on memory encoding during an associative-memory task led to Dm patterns that indicated similarly deep memory encoding for own-race and other-race faces.
