The functional architecture of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations has been characterized in detail by numerous studies demonstrating its potential relevance as a biomarker. However the systematic investigation of its consistency is still in its infancy. Here we analyze within- and between-subject variability and test-retest reliability of resting-state functional connectivity FC in a unique data set comprising multiple fMRI scans 42 from 5 subjects and 50 single scans from 50 subjects. We adopt a statistical framework that enables us to identify different sources of variability in FC. We show that the low reliability of single links can be significantly improved by using multiple scans per subject. Moreover in contrast to earlier studies we show that spatial heterogeneity in FC reliability is not significant. Finally we demonstrate that despite the low reliability of individual links the information carried by the whole-brain FC matrix is robust and can be used as a functional fingerprint to identify individual subjects from the population. Resting-state fMRI correlations: From link-wise unreliability to whole brain stability.
