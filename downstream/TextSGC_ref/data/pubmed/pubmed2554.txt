In late December 2019 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing severe pneumonia COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan Hubei Province China. A common finding in most COVID-19 patients is high D-dimer levels which are associated with a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and whole blood thromboelastometry profiles in a group of 22 mean age 67\u2009\u20098 years M:F 20:2 consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Padova University Hospital for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls p\u2009<\u20090.0001 in both comparisons. Interestingly enough markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time CFT in INTEM p\u2009=\u20090.0002 and EXTEM p\u2009=\u20090.01 and higher Maximum Clot Firmness MCF in INTEM EXTEM and FIBTEM p\u2009<\u20090.001 in all comparisons. In conclusion COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy. Fibrin formation and polymerization may predispose to thrombosis and correlate with a worse outcome.
