Antisocial personality disorder ASPD is characterised by a disregard for social obligations and callous unconcern for the feelings of others. Studies have demonstrated that ASPD is associated with abnormalities in brain regions and aberrant functional connectivity. In this paper topological organisation was examined in resting-state fMRI data obtained from 32 ASPD patients and 32 non-ASPD controls. The frequency-dependent functional networks were constructed using wavelet-based correlations over 90 brain regions. The topology of the functional networks of ASPD subjects was analysed via graph theoretical analysis. Furthermore the abnormal functional connectivity was determined with a network-based statistic NBS approach. Our results revealed that compared with the controls the ASPD patients exhibited altered topological configuration of the functional connectome in the frequency interval of 0.016-0.031\u2009Hz as indicated by the increased clustering coefficient and decreased betweenness centrality in the medial superior frontal gyrus precentral gyrus Rolandic operculum superior parietal gyrus angular gyrus and middle temporal pole. In addition the ASPD patients showed increased functional connectivity mainly located in the default-mode network. The present study reveals an aberrant topological organisation of the functional brain network in individuals with ASPD. Our findings provide novel insight into the neuropathological mechanisms of ASPD. Aberrant functional brain connectome in people with antisocial personality disorder.
