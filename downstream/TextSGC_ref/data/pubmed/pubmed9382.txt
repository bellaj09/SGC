"The ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging MRI nowadays has been receiving enormous attention in both biomaterial research and clinical diagnosis. MRI contrast agents are generally comprising of T1-weighted and T2-weighted contrast agent types where T1-weighted contrast agents show positive contrast enhancement with brighter images by decreasing the protons longitudinal relaxation times and T2-weighted contrast agents show negative contrast enhancement with darker images by decreasing the protons transverse relaxation times. To meet the incredible demand of MRI ultra-high-field T2 MRI is gradually attracting the attention of research and medical needs owing to its high resolution and high accuracy for detection. It is anticipated that high field MRI contrast agents can achieve high performance in MRI imaging where parameters of chemical composition molecular structure and size of varied contrast agents show contrasted influence in each specific diagnostic test. This review firstly presents the recent advances of nanoparticle contrast agents for MRI. Moreover multimodal molecular imaging with MRI for better monitoring is discussed during biological process. To fasten the process of developing better contrast agents deep learning of artificial intelligent AI can be well-integrated into optimizing the crucial parameters of nanoparticle contrast agents and achieving high resolution MRI prior to the clinical applications. Finally prospects and challenges are summarized." Recent Advances of Bioresponsive Nano-Sized Contrast Agents for Ultra-High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
