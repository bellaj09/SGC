MRSI has shown great promise in the detection and monitoring of neurologic pathologies such as tumor. A necessary component of data processing includes the quantitation of each metabolite typically done through fitting a model of the spectrum to the data. For high-resolution volumetric MRSI of the brain which may have ~10000 spectra significant processing time is required for spectral analysis and generation of metabolite maps. Incorporation of a spectral model in a convolutional neural network for accelerated spectral fitting.
