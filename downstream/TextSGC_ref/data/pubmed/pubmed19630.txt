The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of medical virtual reality technologies in the investigation of a mummified hand. The Ulster Museum obtained the mummy hand which originated from Thebes without any identifying information. The mummified hand was investigated using conventional X-ray and 3D multi-slice Computed Tomography CT. Imaging revealed a range of fractures of the wrist metacarpals and phalanges whilst 3D CT demonstrated internal structures using volume rendering. The absence of any features of bone healing at the fracture sites would imply that they occurred just prior to death or in the mummified state possibly during excavation. Conventional X-ray imaging indicated that the hand although small was likely to have originated from an adult. Medical imaging and virtual reality display will enable us to produce a rapid prototyped model using fused deposition technology. Therefore further paleopathological research can be performed on the replica without the need to handle the original specimen. "Virtual unwrapping" of a mummified hand.
