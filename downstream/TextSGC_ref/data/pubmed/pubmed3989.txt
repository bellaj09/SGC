The visualization of brain connectivity becomes progressively more challenging as analytic and computational advances begin to facilitate connexel-wise analyses which include all connections between pairs of voxels. Drawing full connectivity graphs can result in depictions that rather than illustrating connectivity patterns in more detail obfuscate patterns owing to the data density. In an effort to expand the possibilities for visualization we describe two approaches for presenting connexels: edge-bundling which clarifies structure by grouping geometrically similar connections; and connectivity glyphs which depict a condensed connectivity map at each point on the cortical surface. These approaches can be applied in the native brain space facilitating interpretation of the relation of connexels to brain anatomy. The tools have been implemented as part of brainGL an extensive open-source software for the interactive exploration of structural and functional brain data.
