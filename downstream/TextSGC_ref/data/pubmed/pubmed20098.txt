"High-intensity aerobic exercise might attenuate the symptoms of Parkinsons disease but high-quality evidence is scarce. Moreover long-term adherence remains challenging. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aerobic exercise-gamified and delivered at home to promote adherence-on relieving motor symptoms in patients with Parkinsons disease with mild disease severity who were on common treatment regimes."
