Outcome expectancy the extent that clients anticipate benefiting from therapy is theorized to be an important predictor of treatment response for cognitive-behavioral therapy. However there is a relatively small body of empirical research on outcome expectancy and the treatment of social anxiety disorder. This literature which has examined the association mostly in group-based interventions has yielded mixed findings. The current study sought to further evaluate the effect of outcome expectancy as a predictor of treatment response for public-speaking fears across both individual virtual reality and group-based cognitive-behavioral therapies. The findings supported outcome expectancy as a predictor of the rate of change in public-speaking anxiety during both individual virtual reality exposure therapy and group cognitive-behavioral therapy. Furthermore there was no evidence to suggest that the impact of outcome expectancy differed across virtual reality or group treatments.
