Immersive virtual reality VR simulation environments facilitate novel ways for users to visualize anatomy and quantify performance relative to expert users. The ability of software to provide positional feedback before a practitioner progresses with subsequent stages of examinations has broad implications for primary and allied healthcare professionals particularly with respect to health and safety eg exposing to x-rays. The effect of training student-radiographers radiology technicians with a VR simulation environment was quantitatively assessed.
