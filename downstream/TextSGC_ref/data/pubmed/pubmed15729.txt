With the rapid development from traditional machine learning ML to deep learning DL and reinforcement learning RL dialog system equipped with learning mechanism has become the most effective solution to address human-machine interaction problems. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey on learning-based human-machine dialog systems with a focus on the various dialog models. More specifically we first introduce the fundamental process of establishing a dialog model. Second we examine the features and classifications of the system dialog model expound some representative models and also compare the advantages and disadvantages of different dialog models. Third we comb the commonly used database and evaluation metrics of the dialog model. Furthermore the evaluation metrics of these dialog models are analyzed in detail. Finally we briefly analyze the existing issues and point out the potential future direction on the human-machine dialog systems. A Survey on Learning-Based Approaches for Modeling and Classification of Human-Machine Dialog Systems.
