The sleeping brain retains some residual information processing capacity. Although direct evidence is scarce a substantial literature suggests the phase of slow oscillations during deep sleep to be an important determinant for stimulus processing. Here we introduce an algorithm for predicting slow oscillations in real-time. Using this approach to present stimuli directed at both oscillatory up and down states we show neural stimulus processing depends importantly on the slow oscillation phase. During ensuing wakefulness however we did not observe differential brain or behavioral responses to these stimulus categories suggesting no enduring memories were formed. We speculate that while simpler forms of learning may occur during sleep neocortically based memories are not readily established during deep sleep. Sound asleep: processing and retention of slow oscillation phase-targeted stimuli.
