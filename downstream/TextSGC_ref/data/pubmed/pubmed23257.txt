Most neuropsychological assessments include at least one measure that is administered scored or interpreted by computers or other technologies. Despite supportive findings for these technology-based assessments there is resistance in the field of neuropsychology to adopt additional measures that incorporate technology components. This literature review addresses the research findings of technology-based neuropsychological assessments including computer- and virtual reality-based measures of cognitive and functional abilities. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of each approach and examine the utility of technology-based assessments to obtain supplemental cognitive and behavioral information that may be otherwise undetected by traditional paper-and-pencil measures. We argue that the potential of technology use in neuropsychological assessment has not yet been realized and continued adoption of new technologies could result in more comprehensive assessment of cognitive dysfunction and in turn better informed diagnosis and treatments. Recommendations for future research are also provided. Applications of technology in neuropsychological assessment.
