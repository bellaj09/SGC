Person identification at airports requires the comparison of a passport photograph with its bearer. In psychology this process is typically studied with static pairs of face photographs that require identity-match same person shown versus mismatch two different people decisions but this approach provides a limited proxy for studying how environment and social interaction factors affect this task. In this study we explore the feasibility of virtual reality VR as a solution to this problem by examining the identity matching of avatars in a VR airport. We show that facial photographs of real people can be rendered into VR avatars in a manner that preserves image and identity information Experiments 1 to 3. We then show that identity matching of avatar pairs reflects similar cognitive processes to the matching of face photographs Experiments 4 and 5. This pattern holds when avatar matching is assessed in a VR airport Experiments 6 and 7. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR as a new method for investigating face matching in complex environments. Facial Identification at a Virtual Reality Airport.
