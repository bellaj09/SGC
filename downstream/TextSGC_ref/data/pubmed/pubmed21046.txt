Using a mixed methods design with 99 students key points of learning were medication administration and respiratory interventions. Qualitative data demonstrated learning of assessment prioritization and emergency management. The top student preferences of how to use virtual simulation were as a clinical makeup or to enhance lecture. The findings support the use of virtual simulation and provide data to guide nurse educators to more strategically integrate virtual simulation exercises."
