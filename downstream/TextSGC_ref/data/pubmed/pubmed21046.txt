Sleep has been implicated in both memory consolidation and forgetting of experiences. However it is unclear what governs the balance between consolidation and forgetting. Here we tested how activity-dependent processing during sleep might differentially regulate these two processes. We specifically examined how neural reactivations during non-rapid eye movement NREM sleep were causally linked to\xa0consolidation versus weakening of the neural correlates of neuroprosthetic skill. Strikingly we found that slow oscillations SOs and delta  waves have dissociable and competing roles in consolidation versus forgetting. By modulating cortical spiking linked to SOs or  waves using closed-loop optogenetic methods we could respectively weaken or strengthen consolidation and thereby bidirectionally modulate sleep-dependent performance gains. We further found that changes in the temporal coupling of spindles to SOs relative to  waves could account for such effects. Thus our results indicate that neural activity driven by SOs and  waves have competing roles in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.
