A key component of CBT treatment is exposure to the anger arousing stimuli. Virtual reality VR environments can elicit potent reactions and may facilitate the treatment of anger. An anger VR environment with six video vignettes was developed by this study to examine the anger arousal potential of VR. Outcome measures included assessment of emotional reactivity state anger and presence. The results showed that significant anger arousal occurred during exposure to the VR environment and arousal was greater when viewed in an immersive HMD than a non-immersive flat screen. In addition presence was found to moderate the effects of VR. Low presence resulted in low reactivity regardless of the display modality." Use of immersive virtual reality for treating anger.
