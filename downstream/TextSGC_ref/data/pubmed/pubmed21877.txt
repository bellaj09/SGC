Multivoxel pattern analysis MVPA methods have been widely applied in recent years to classify human brain states in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data analysis. Voxel selection plays an important role in MVPA studies not only because it can improve decoding accuracy but also because it is useful for understanding brain functions. There are many voxel selection methods that have been proposed in fMRI literature. However most of these methods either overlook the structure information of fMRI data or require additional cross-validation procedures to determine the hyperparameters of the models. In the present work we proposed a voxel selection method for binary brain decoding called group sparse Bayesian logistic regression GSBLR. This method utilizes the group sparse property of fMRI data by using a grouped automatic relevance determination GARD as a prior for model parameters. All the parameters in the GSBLR can be estimated automatically thereby avoiding additional cross-validation. Experimental results based on two publicly available fMRI datasets and simulated datasets demonstrate that GSBLR achieved better classification accuracies and yielded more stable solutions than several state-of-the-art methods.
