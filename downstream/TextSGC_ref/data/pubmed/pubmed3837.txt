"A wealth of neuroscience evidence demonstrates that aerobic fitness enhances structural brain plasticity promoting the development of gray matter volume and maintenance of white matter integrity within networks for executive function attention learning and memory. However the role of aerobic fitness in shaping the functional brain connectome remains to be established. The present work therefore investigated the effects of aerobic fitness as measured by VO2max on individual differences in whole-brain functional connectivity assessed from resting state fMRI data. Using a connectome-wide association study we identified significant brain-fitness relationships within a large sample of healthy young adults N = 242. The results revealed several regions within frontal temporal parietal and cerebellar cortex having significant association with aerobic fitness. We further characterized the influence of these regions on 7 intrinsic connectivity networks demonstrating the greatest association with networks that are known to mediate the beneficial effects of aerobic fitness on executive function frontoparietal network attention and learning dorsal and ventral attention network and memory default mode network. In addition we provide evidence that connectivity strength between these regions and the frontoparietal network is predictive of individuals fluid intelligence."
