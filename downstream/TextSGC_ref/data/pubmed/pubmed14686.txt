Gravitational-wave data analysis is rapidly absorbing techniques from deep learning with a focus on convolutional networks and related methods that treat noisy time series as images. We pursue an alternative approach in which waveforms are first represented as weighted sums over reduced bases reduced-order modeling; we then train artificial neural networks to map gravitational-wave source parameters into basis coefficients. Statistical inference proceeds directly in coefficient space where it is theoretically straightforward and computationally efficient. The neural networks also provide analytic waveform derivatives which are useful for gradient-based sampling schemes. We demonstrate fast and accurate coefficient interpolation for the case of a four-dimensional binary-inspiral waveform family and discuss promising applications of our framework in parameter estimation.
