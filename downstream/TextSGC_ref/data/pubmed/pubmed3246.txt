Sleep is a complex and dynamic process for maintaining homeostasis and a lack of sleep can disrupt whole-body functioning. No organ is as vulnerable to the loss of sleep as the brain. Accordingly we examined a set of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data by using graph theory to assess brain topological changes in subjects in a state of chronic sleep restriction and then identified diurnal variability in the graph-theoretic measures. Task-based fMRI data were collected in a 1.5T MR scanner from the same participants on two days: after a week of fully restorative sleep and after a week with 35% sleep curtailment. Each day included four scanning sessions throughout the day at approximately 10:00 AM 2:00 PM 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM. A modified spatial cueing task was applied to evaluate sustained attention. After sleep restriction the characteristic path length significantly increased at all measurement times and small-worldness significantly decreased. Assortativity a measure of network fault tolerance diminished over the course of the day in both conditions. Local graph measures were altered primarily across the limbic system particularly in the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala default mode network and visual network.
