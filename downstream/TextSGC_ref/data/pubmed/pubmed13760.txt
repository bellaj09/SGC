Comparison of serial organization of infant babbling and early speech with that of 10 languages reveals four movement-related design features reflecting a deep evolutionary heritage: 1 the cyclical consonant-vowel alternation underlying the syllable a "Frame" for speech consisting of mandibular oscillation possibly evolving from ingestive cyclicities e.g. chewing via visuofacial communicative cyclicities e.g. lipsmacks; 2 three intracyclical consonant-vowel co-occurrence preferences reflecting basic biomechanical constraints-coronal consonants-front vowels dorsal consonants-back vowels and labial consonants-central vowels; 3 a developmental progression from above-chance to below-chance levels of intercyclical consonant repetition; 4 an ease-related labial consonant-vowel-coronal consonant sequence preference for word initiation. These design features presumably result from self-organizational responses to selection pressures primarily determined by motor factors. No explanation for these design features is available from Universal Grammar and except for feature 3 perceptual-motor learning seems to have only a limited causal role in acquisition of any design feature.
