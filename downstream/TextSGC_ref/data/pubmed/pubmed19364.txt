Loss of hand function as a result of upper limb paresis after a stroke leads to reduced independence. Robotic-assisted therapy with virtual reality leads to improvements in motor function but there is a need to improve the cost-benefit ratio of these therapies. This case series study investigated augmented reality computer games which provided a rewarded goal-directed task to upper limb rehabilitation via a gravity supported reaching task. An affordable computerised table-based exercise system for stroke survivors.
