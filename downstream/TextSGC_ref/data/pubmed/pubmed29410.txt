Electroencephalogram signals and the states of subjects are nonstationary. To track changing states effectively an adaptive calibration framework is proposed for the brain-computer interface BCI with the motion-onset visual evoked potential mVEP as the control signal. The core of this framework is to update the training set adaptively for classifier training. The updating procedure consists of two operations that is adding new samples to the training set and removing old samples from the training set. In the proposed framework a support vector machine SVM and fuzzy C-mean clustering fCM are combined to select the reliable samples for the training set from the blocks close to the current blocks to be classified. Because of the complementary information provided by SVM and fCM they can guarantee the reliability of information fed into classifier training. The removing procedure will aim to remove those old samples recorded a relatively long time before current new blocks. These two operations could yield a new training set which could be used to calibrate the classifier to track the changing state of the subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive calibration framework is effective and efficient and it could improve the performance of online BCI systems.
