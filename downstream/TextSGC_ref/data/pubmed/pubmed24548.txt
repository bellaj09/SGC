There is no specific point of view on consciousness from psychoanalytic theory. Psychoanalytic investigations are focused on inconscious psychic acts and the ways they can be accessible to consciousness. We successively examine the virtual preconscious the repressed preconscious and the proper unconscious. For each of these types of events stored in memory we specify the modes of access into consciousness specifically the role of co-thinking in the access to consciousness proper and the status of the unconscious psychic reality. Consciousness: a psychoanalytical point of view.
