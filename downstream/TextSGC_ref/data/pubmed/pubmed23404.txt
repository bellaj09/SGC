"In-vehicle technologies may decrease crash risk in drivers with age-related declines. Researchers determined the impact of in-vehicle information systems IVIS or advanced driving assistance systems ADAS on driving. Through a scoping review the effect of IVIS or ADAS on older drivers convenience i.e. meets ones needs comfort i.e. physical or psychological ease or safety i.e. absence of errors or crashes was examined. Researchers synopsized findings from 28 studies including driving simulators and on-road environments. Findings indicated that IVIS or ADAS enhanced safety and mitigated age-related declines. Notably IVIS may reduce cognitive workload but may jeopardize safety if the systems are overly complicated. The ADAS enhanced safety and comfort by increasing speed control lane maintenance and braking responses. However no studies addressed convenience. In-vehicle technologies may enhance safety and comfort while driving if ones cognitive workload is not compromised. Naturalistic studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of IVIS and ADAS for older drivers." Smart In-Vehicle Technologies and Older Drivers: A Scoping Review.
