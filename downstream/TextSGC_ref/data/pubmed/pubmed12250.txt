Histological Gleason grading of tumor patterns is one of the most powerful prognostic predictors in prostate cancer. However manual analysis and grading performed by pathologists are typically subjective and time-consuming. In this paper we present an automatic technique for Gleason grading of prostate cancer from H&E stained whole slide pathology images using a set of novel completed and statistical local binary pattern CSLBP descriptors. First the technique divides the whole slide image WSI into a set of small image tiles where salient tumor tiles with high nuclei densities are selected for analysis. The CSLBP texture features that encode pixel intensity variations from circularly surrounding neighborhoods are extracted from salient image tiles to characterize different Gleason patterns. Finally the CSLBP texture features computed from all tiles are integrated and utilized by the multi-class support vector machine SVM that assigns patient slides with different Gleason scores such as 6 7 or >=8. Experiments have been performed on 312 different patient cases selected from the cancer genome atlas TCGA and have achieved superior performances over state-of-the-art texture descriptors and baseline methods including deep learning models for prostate cancer Gleason grading.
