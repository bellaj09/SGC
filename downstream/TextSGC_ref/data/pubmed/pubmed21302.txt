Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD suffer from attention deficits motor hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour. These impairments are experienced at home at school and with friends. Functional imaging studies show that ADHD behaviour and impairments in executive functions EFs are mirrored by aberrant neurophysiological functioning. Moreover several studies show that ADHD behaviour impairments in EFs and a lack of self-control contribute to poor school performance. Non-pharmacological interventions such as neurofeedback training NFT for instance aim at improving neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning as well as behaviour. Consequently NFT is expected to improve school performance EFs and self-control in children with ADHD. Generalization of acquired self-regulation skills from laboratory to real life is crucial for a transfer to everyday situations and is hypothesized to be facilitated via training using virtual reality VR environments. Consequently experiencing NFT in VR is expected to yield greater effects than training in two dimensions 2D.
