The most consistent finding of creative ideation in the neuroscientific study of creativity is the increment of EEG  power. However the majority of existing studies focused only on ERP experimental paradigms while only a few analyzed time-related changes of EEG  power patterns during the time unlocked creation of ideas. Here we designed an experimental paradigm where the participants were asked to generate alternative uses of everyday objects AU task. For the control task we adopted an Object Characteristics OC task for which participants were asked to list typical characteristics or properties of an object. We estimated relative power spectrum global efficiency from brain networks constructed with the imaginary part of coherence and phase-to-amplitude coupling PAC as potential biomarkers of creativity. Both relative power spectrum and nodal global efficiency failed to reach significant level by comparing AU with OC. In contrast statistically significant differences between AU and OC were detected with PAC estimated within sensors in frequency pairs - and 2-. Our results can be the ground for both detecting and designing a connectomic biomarker of creativity. Phase to amplitude coupling as a potential biomarker for creative ideation: an EEG study.
