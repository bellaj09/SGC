"Applications developed using key multimedia elements are finding their way into a number of training and information exchange environments including the laparoscopy training market. Emerging multimedia-based applications range from procedural information for patients to interactive CD-ROM-based applications used to train highly skilled surgeons. These products are designed with a high level of interactivity that allows the surgeon to plan a surgical procedure review detailed patient information and then merge that information into the surgical planning process. Using this new technology a surgeon now has the ability to review CD-ROM-based course materials and efficiently meet continuing education requirements. The factor found most limiting in the development of multimedia-based applications for laparoscopy training is generally not the technology but the limits placed on the technology because of ones reluctance to think beyond what is accepted as the norm. Properly implemented multimedia applications developed for laparoscopy training reduce the cost and time associated with learning new materials assist a user in retaining more of the information reviewed and in many cases make the learning experience much more enjoyable." CD-ROM multimedia. The step before virtual reality.
