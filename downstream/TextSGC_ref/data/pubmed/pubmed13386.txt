With the increasing development of biotechnology and informatics technology publicly available data in chemistry and biology are undergoing explosive growth. Such wealthy information in these data needs to be extracted and transformed to useful knowledge by various data mining methods. Considering the amazing rate at which data are accumulated in chemistry and biology fields new tools that process and interpret large and complex interaction data are increasingly important. So far there are no suitable toolkits that can effectively link the chemical and biological space in view of molecular representation. To further explore these complex data an integrated toolkit for various molecular representation is urgently needed which could be easily integrated with data mining algorithms to start a full data analysis pipeline. PyBioMed: a python library for various molecular representations of chemicals proteins and DNAs and their interactions.
