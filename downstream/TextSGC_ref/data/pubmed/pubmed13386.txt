Recently research on data-driven bearing fault diagnosis methods has attracted increasing attention due to the availability of massive condition monitoring data. However most existing methods still have difficulties in learning representative features from the raw data. In addition they assume that the feature distribution of training data in source domain is the same as that of testing data in target domain which is invalid in many real-world bearing fault diagnosis problems. Since deep learning has the automatic feature extraction ability and ensemble learning can improve the accuracy and generalization performance of classifiers this paper proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on deep convolutional neural network CNN and random forest RF ensemble learning. Firstly time domain vibration signals are converted into two dimensional 2D gray-scale images containing abundant fault information by continuous wavelet transform CWT. Secondly a CNN model based on LeNet-5 is built to automatically extract multi-level features that are sensitive to the detection of faults from the images. Finally the multi-level features containing both local and global information are utilized to diagnose bearing faults by the ensemble of multiple RF classifiers. In particular low-level features containing local characteristics and accurate details in the hidden layers are combined to improve the diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by two sets of bearing data collected from reliance electric motor and rolling mill respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in bearing fault diagnosis under complex operational conditions and is superior to traditional methods and standard deep learning methods.
