"Cognitive Reserve CR designates the brains capacity to actively cope with insults through a more efficient use of its resources/networks. It was proposed in order to explain the discrepancies between the observed cognitive ability and the expected capacity for an individual. Typical proxies of CR include education and Intelligence Quotient but none totally account for the variability of CR and no study has shown if the brains greater efficiency associated with CR can be measured. We used a validated model to estimate CR from the residual variance in memory and general executive functioning accounting for both brain anatomical i.e. gray matter and white matter signal abnormalities volume and demographic variables i.e. years of formal education and sex. Functional connectivity FC networks and topological properties were explored for associations with CR. Demographic characteristics mainly accounted by years of formal education were associated with higher FC clustering local efficiency and strength in parietal and occipital regions and greater network transitivity. Higher CR was associated with a greater FC local efficiency and clustering of occipital regions strength and centrality of the inferior temporal gyrus and higher global efficiency. Altogether these findings suggest that education may facilitate the brains ability to form segregated functional groups reinforcing the view that higher education level triggers more specialized use of neural processing. Additionally this study demonstrated for the first time that CR is associated with more efficient processing of information in the human brain and reinforces the existence of a fine balance between segregation and integration.
