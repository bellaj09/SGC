External approaches to the frontal sinus such as osteoplastic flaps are challenging because they require blind entry into the sinus posing risks of injury to the brain or orbit. Intraoperative computed tomography CT-based navigation is the current standard for planning the approach but still necessitates blind entry into the sinus. The aim of this work was to describe a novel technique for external approaches to the frontal sinus using a holographic augmented reality AR application. Application of holographic augmented reality for external approaches to the frontal sinus.
