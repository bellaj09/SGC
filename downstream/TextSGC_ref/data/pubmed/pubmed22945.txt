"Aims: To determine the effects of a 5-day virtual reality VR-based intervention on anticipatory and reactive mechanisms of postural control in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy CP. Methods: Eleven youth with CP GMFCS levels I and II ages 7-17 were allocated to intervention N\u2009=\u20095 and control N\u2009=\u20096 groups. Both groups attended balance assessment sessions 1\u2009week apart. Participants in the intervention group received 1-hour one-on-one physiotherapist-supervised VR balance games for 5 consecutive days between assessments. For balance assessments participants stood erect with eyes open on a movable platform that translated progressively through four speeds in the anterior/posterior direction. Participants performed two trials each of experimenter-triggered and self-triggered perturbations. Postural muscle activity and kinematics were recorded. The Anchoring Index and body segment cross-correlations were calculated as an indication of body stabilization and the number of steps taken to regain balance/avoid falling were counted. Mann-Whitney U tests for between group differences in change scores were undertaken with an accepted significance level of 0.01. Results: No consistent differences in change scores were identified between groups. Conclusions: There was no effect of a 5-day VR-based intervention on postural control mechanisms used in response to oscillating platform perturbations. Subsequent studies will further tailor VR interventions to patients functional balance needs."
