Interstitial lung disease ILD refers to a group of various abnormal inflammations of lung tissues and early diagnosis of these disease patterns is crucial for the treatment. Yet it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis due to the similarity among the clinical manifestations of these diseases. In order to assist the radiologists computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. Besides the potential of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs is also expected to exert on the medical image analysis in recent years. In this paper we design a new deep convolutional neural network CNN architecture to achieve the classification task of ILD patterns. Furthermore we also propose a novel two-stage transfer learning TSTL method to deal with the problem of the lack of training data which leverages the knowledge learned from sufficient textural source data and auxiliary unlabeled lung CT data to the target domain. We adopt the unsupervised manner to learn the unlabeled data by which the objective function composed of the prediction confidence and mutual information are optimized. The experimental results show that our proposed CNN architecture achieves desirable performance and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art ones. The comparative analysis demonstrates the promising feasibility and advantages of the proposed two-stage transfer learning strategy as well as the potential of the knowledge learning from lung CT data.
