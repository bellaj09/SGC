Live guidance during needle breast procedures is not currently possible with high-field-strength 1.5-T superconducting magnetic resonance MR imaging. The physician can calculate only the approximate location and extent of a tumor in the compressed patient breast before inserting the needle and the tissue specimen removed at biopsy may not actually belong to the lesion of interest. The authors developed a virtual reality system for guiding breast biopsy with MR imaging which uses a deformable finite element model of the breast. A deformable finite element model of the breast for predicting mechanical deformations under external perturbations.
