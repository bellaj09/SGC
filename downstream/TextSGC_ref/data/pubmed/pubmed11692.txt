"We propose an adaptation of a convolutional neural network CNN scheme proposed for segmenting brain lesions with considerable mass-effect to segment white matter hyperintensities WMH characteristic of brains with none or mild vascular pathology in routine clinical brain magnetic resonance images MRI. This is a rather difficult segmentation problem because of the small area i.e. volume of the WMH and their similarity to non-pathological brain tissue. We investigate the effectiveness of the 2D CNN scheme by comparing its performance against those obtained from another deep learning approach: Deep Boltzmann Machine DBM two conventional machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine SVM and Random Forest RF and a public toolbox: Lesion Segmentation Tool LST all reported to be useful for segmenting WMH in MRI. We also introduce a way to incorporate spatial information in convolution level of CNN for WMH segmentation named global spatial information GSI. Analysis of covariance corroborated known associations between WMH progression as assessed by all methods evaluated and demographic and clinical data. Deep learning algorithms outperform conventional machine learning algorithms by excluding MRI artefacts and pathologies that appear similar to WMH. Our proposed approach of incorporating GSI also successfully helped CNN to achieve better automatic WMH segmentation regardless of networks settings tested. The mean Dice Similarity Coefficient DSC values for LST-LGA SVM RF DBM CNN and CNN-GSI were 0.2963 0.1194 0.1633 0.3264 0.5359 and 5389 respectively."
