The sonogram is currently an effective cancer screening and diagnosis way due to the convenience and harmlessness in humans. Traditionally lesion boundary segmentation is first adopted and then classification is conducted to reach the judgment of benign or malignant tumor. In addition sonograms often contain much speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity. This study proposes a novel benign or malignant tumor classification system which comprises intensity inhomogeneity correction and stacked denoising autoencoder SDAE and it is suitable for small-size dataset. A classifier is established by extracting features in the multilayer training of SDAE; automatic analysis of imaging features by the deep learning algorithm is applied on image classification thus allowing the system to have high efficiency and robust distinguishing. In this study two kinds of dataset private data and public data are used for deep learning models training. For each dataset two groups of test images are compared: the original images and the images after intensity inhomogeneity correction respectively. The results show that when deep learning algorithm is applied on the sonograms after intensity inhomogeneity correction there is a significant increase of the tumor distinguishing accuracy. This study demonstrated that it is important to use preprocessing to highlight the image features and further give these features for deep learning models. In this way the classification accuracy will be better to just use the original images for deep learning.
