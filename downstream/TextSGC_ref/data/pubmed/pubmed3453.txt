Cognitive dysfunction is a poorly understood but potentially devastating complication of cardiac surgery. Clinically meaningful assessment of cognitive changes after surgery is problematic because of the absence of a means to obtain reproducible objective and quantitative measures of the neural disturbances that cause altered brain function. By using both structural and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data to construct a map of the inter-regional connections within the brain connectomics has the potential to increase the specificity and sensitivity of perioperative neurological assessment permitting rational individualized assessment and improvement of surgical techniques. Neural network imaging to characterize brain injury in cardiac procedures: the emerging utility of connectomics.
