P300-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide an additional communication channel for individuals with communication disabilities. In general P300-based BCIs need to be trained offline for a considerable period of time which causes users to become fatigued. This reduces the efficiency and performance of the system. In order to shorten calibration time and improve system performance we introduce the concept of a generic model set. We used ERP data from 116 participants to train the generic model set. The resulting set consists of ten models which are trained by weighted linear discriminant analysis WLDA. Twelve new participants were then invited to test the validity of the generic model set. The results demonstrated that all new participants matched the best generic model. The resulting mean classification accuracy equaled 80% after online training an accuracy that was broadly equivalent to the typical training model method. Moreover the calibration time was shortened by 70.7% of the calibration time of the typical model method. In other words the best matching model method only took 81s to calibrate while the typical model method took 276s. There were also significant differences in both accuracy and raw bit rate between the best and the worst matching model methods. We conclude that the strategy of combining the generic models with online training is easily accepted and achieves higher levels of user satisfaction as measured by subjective reports. Thus we provide a valuable new strategy for improving the performance of P300-based BCI. The Study of Generic Model Set for Reducing Calibration Time in P300-Based Brain-Computer Interface.
