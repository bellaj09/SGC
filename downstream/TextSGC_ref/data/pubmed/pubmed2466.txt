"To represent ones upper limbs for action the brain relies on a combined position estimate based on visual and proprioceptive information. Monkey neurophysiology and human brain imaging suggest that the underlying operations are implemented in a network of fronto-parietal and occipitotemporal cortical areas. Recently a potential hierarchical arrangement of these areas has been proposed emphasizing the posterior parietal cortex PPC in early multisensory comparison and integration. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and a virtual reality-based setup to briefly 0.5\u2009s present healthy human participants photorealistic virtual hands of matching or nonmatching anatomical side or objects at the same or a different location than their real hidden left or right hand. The inferior parietal lobe IPL of the left PPC showed a significant preference for congruent visuoproprioceptive hand position information. Moreover the left body part-selective extrastriate body area EBA; functionally localized significantly increased its coupling with the left IPL during visuoproprioceptive congruence vs. incongruence. Our results suggest that the PPC implements early visuoproprioceptive comparison and integration processes likely relying on information exchange with the EBA." Posterior parietal cortex evaluates visuoproprioceptive congruence based on brief visual information.
