Patients with COVID19 present a broad spectrum of clinical presentation. Whereas hypoxemia is the marker of severity different strategies of management should be customised to five specific individual phenotypes. Many intubated patients present with phenotype 4 characterised by pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction being associated with severe hypoxemia with "normal" >40\u2005mLcm-1 H20 lung compliance and likely represents pulmonary microvascular thrombosis. Phenotype 5 is often associated with high plasma procalcitonin and has low pulmonary compliance being a result of co-infection or acute lung injury after non-invasive ventilation. Identifying these clinical phenotypes and applying a personalised approach would benefit in optimisation of therapies and improving outcomes.
