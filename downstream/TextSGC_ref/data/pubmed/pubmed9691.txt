Postoperative gastrointestinal leak and venous thromboembolism VTE are devastating complications of bariatric surgery. The performance of currently available predictive models for these complications remains wanting while machine learning has shown promise to improve on traditional modeling approaches. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of two machine learning strategies artificial neural networks ANNs and gradient boosting machines XGBs to conventional models using logistic regression LR in predicting leak and VTE after bariatric surgery. Development and validation of machine learning models to predict gastrointestinal leak and venous thromboembolism after weight loss surgery: an analysis of the MBSAQIP database.
