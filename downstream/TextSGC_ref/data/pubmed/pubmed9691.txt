There is a long history of research documenting plasticity in the cerebellum as well as the role of the cerebellum in learning and memory. Recordings in slices of cerebellum have provided evidence of long-term depression and long-term potentiation at several excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Lesions and recordings show the cerebellum is crucial for eyeblink conditioning and it appears changes in both synaptic and membrane plasticity are involved. In addition to its role in fine motor control there is growing consensus that the cerebellum is crucial for perceptual cognitive and emotional functions. In the current review we explore the evidence that eyeblink conditioning results in significant changes in intrinsic membrane excitability as well as synaptic plasticity in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex in rabbits and changes in intrinsic membrane excitability in principal neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei in rats. Changes in cerebellar intrinsic neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity result from eyeblink conditioning.
