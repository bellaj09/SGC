Diabetic retinopathy DR results in vision loss if not treated early. A computer-aided diagnosis CAD system based on retinal fundus images is an efficient and effective method for early DR diagnosis and assisting experts. A computer-aided diagnosis CAD system involves various stages like detection segmentation and classification of lesions in fundus images. Many traditional machine-learning ML techniques based on hand-engineered features have been introduced. The recent emergence of deep learning DL and its decisive victory over traditional ML methods for various applications motivated the researchers to employ it for DR diagnosis and many deep-learning-based methods have been introduced. In this paper we review these methods highlighting their pros and cons. In addition we point out the challenges to be addressed in designing and learning about efficient effective and robust deep-learning algorithms for various problems in DR diagnosis and draw attention to directions for future research.
