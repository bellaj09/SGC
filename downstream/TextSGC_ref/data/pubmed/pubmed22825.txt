Assistive technologies help all persons with disabilities to improve their accessibility in all aspects of their life. The AIDE European project contributes to the improvement of current assistive technologies by developing and testing a modular and adaptive multimodal interface customizable to the individual needs of people with disabilities. This paper describes the computer vision algorithms part of the multimodal interface developed inside the AIDE European project. The main contribution of this computer vision part is the integration with the robotic system and with the other sensory systems electrooculography EOG and electroencephalography EEG. The technical achievements solved herein are the algorithm for the selection of objects using the gaze and especially the state-of-the-art algorithm for the efficient detection and pose estimation of textureless objects. These algorithms were tested in real conditions and were thoroughly evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results of the object selection algorithm were excellent object selection over 90% in less than 12 s. The detection and pose estimation algorithms evaluated using the LINEMOD database were similar to the state-of-the-art method and were the most computationally efficient.
