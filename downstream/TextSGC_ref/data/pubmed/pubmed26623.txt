Using a machine-learning classification algorithm applied to near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS signals we classify a success change detection or a failure change blindness in detecting visual changes for a change-detection task. Five subjects perform a change-detection task and their brain activities are continuously monitored. A support-vector-machine algorithm is applied to classify the change-detection and change-blindness trials and correct classification probability of 70-90% is obtained for four subjects. Two types of temporal shapes in classification probabilities are found: one exhibiting a maximum value after the task is completed postdictive type and another exhibiting a maximum value during the task predictive type. As for the postdictive type the classification probability begins to increase immediately after the task completion and reaches its maximum in about the time scale of neuronal hemodynamic response reflecting a subjective report of change detection. As for the predictive type the classification probability shows an increase at the task initiation and is maximal while subjects are performing the task predicting the task performance in detecting a change. We conclude that decoding change detection and change blindness from NIRS signal is possible and argue some future applications toward brain-machine interfaces.
