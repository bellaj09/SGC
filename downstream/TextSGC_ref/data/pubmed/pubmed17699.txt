"Being able to hear objects in an environment for example using echolocation is a challenging task. The main goal of the current work is to use virtual environments VEs to train novice users to navigate using echolocation. Previous studies have shown that musicians are able to differentiate sound pulses from reflections. This paper presents design patterns for VE simulators for both training and testing procedures while classifying users navigation strategies in the VE. Moreover the paper presents features that increase users performance in VEs. We report the findings of two user studies: a pilot test that helped improve the sonic interaction design and a primary study exposing participants to a spatial orientation task during four conditions which were early reflections RF late reverberation RV early reflections-reverberation RR and visual stimuli V. The latter study allowed us to identify navigation strategies among the users. Some users 10/26 reported an ability to create spatial cognitive maps during the test with auditory echoes which may explain why this group performed better than the remaining participants in the RR condition."
