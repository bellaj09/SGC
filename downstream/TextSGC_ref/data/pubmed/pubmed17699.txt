This paper details the design process and features of a novel upper limb rehabilitation exoskeleton named CLEVER Compact Low-weight Ergonomic Virtual/Augmented Reality Enhanced Rehabilitation ARM. The research effort is focused on designing a lightweight and ergonomic upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeleton capable of producing diverse and perceptually rich training scenarios. To this end the knowledge available in the literature of rehabilitation robotics is used along with formal conceptual design techniques. This paper briefly reviews the systematic approach used for design of the exoskeleton and elaborates on the specific details of the proposed design concept and its advantages over other design possibilities. The kinematic structure of CLEVER ARM has eight degrees of freedom supporting the motion of shoulder girdle glenohumeral joint elbow and wrist. Six degrees of freedom of the exoskeleton are active and the two degrees of freedom supporting the wrist motion are passive. Kinematics of the proposed design is studied analytically and experimentally with the aid of a 3D printed prototype. The paper is concluded by some remarks on the optimization of the design motorization of device and the fabrication challenges. Design and kinematic analysis of a novel upper limb exoskeleton for rehabilitation of stroke patients.
