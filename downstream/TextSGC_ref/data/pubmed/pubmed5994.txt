Radio-frequency dosimetry is an important process in assessments for human exposure safety and for compliance of related products. Recently computational human models generated from medical images have often been used for such assessment especially to consider the inter-subject variability. However a common procedure to develop personalized models is time consuming because it involves excessive segmentation of several components that represent different biological tissues which is a major obstacle in the inter-subject variability assessment of radiation safety. Deep learning methods have been shown to be a powerful approach for pattern recognition and signal analysis. Convolutional neural networks with deep architecture are proven robust for feature extraction and image mapping in several biomedical applications. In this study we develop a learning-based approach for fast and accurate estimation of the dielectric properties and density of tissues directly from magnetic resonance images in a single shot. The smooth distribution of the dielectric properties in head models which is realized using a process without tissue segmentation improves the smoothness of the specific absorption rate SAR distribution compared with that in the commonly used procedure. The estimated SAR distributions as well as that averaged over 10\u2009g of tissue in a cubic shape are found to be highly consistent with those computed using the conventional methods that employ segmentation.
