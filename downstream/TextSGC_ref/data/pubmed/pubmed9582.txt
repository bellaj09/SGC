"Glaucoma is a chronic and widespread eye disease threatening humans irreversible vision loss. The cup-to-disc ratio CDR one of the most important measurements used for glaucoma screening and diagnosis requires accurate segmentation of optic disc and cup from fundus images. However most existing techniques fail to obtain satisfactory segmentation performance because a significant number of pixel-level annotated data are often unavailable during training. To cope with this limitation in this paper we propose an effective joint optic disc and cup segmentation method based on semi-supervised conditional Generative Adversarial Nets GANs. Our architecture consists of a segmentation net a generator and a discriminator to learn a mapping between the fundus images and the corresponding segmentation maps. Additionally we employ both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the segmentation performance. The extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art optic disc and cup segmentation results on both ORIGA and REFUGE datasets."
