Deep learning DL is a representation learning approach ideally suited for image analysis challenges in digital pathology DP. The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of DP includes detection and counting e.g. mitotic events segmentation e.g. nuclei and tissue classification e.g. cancerous vs. non-cancerous. Unfortunately issues with slide preparation variations in staining and scanning across sites and vendor platforms as well as biological variance such as the presentation of different grades of disease make these image analysis tasks particularly challenging. Traditional approaches wherein domain-specific cues are manually identified and developed into task-specific "handcrafted" features can require extensive tuning to accommodate these variances. However DL takes a more domain agnostic approach combining both feature discovery and implementation to maximally discriminate between the classes of interest. While DL approaches have performed well in a few DP related image analysis tasks such as detection and tissue classification the currently available open source tools and tutorials do not provide guidance on challenges such as a selecting appropriate magnification b managing errors in annotations in the training or learning dataset and c identifying a suitable training set containing information rich exemplars. These foundational concepts which are needed to successfully translate the DL paradigm to DP tasks are non-trivial for i DL experts with minimal digital histology experience and ii DP and image processing experts with minimal DL experience to derive on their own thus meriting a dedicated tutorial.
