"Fundus fluorescein angiography FFA imaging is a standard diagnostic tool for many retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. High-resolution FFA images facilitate the detection of small lesions such as microaneurysms and other landmark changes in the early stages; this can help an ophthalmologist improve a patients cure rate. However only low-resolution images are available in most clinical cases. Super-resolution SR which is a method to improve the resolution of an image has been successfully employed for natural and remote sensing images. To the best of our knowledge no one has applied SR techniques to FFA imaging so far." A super-resolution method-based pipeline for fundus fluorescein angiography imaging.
