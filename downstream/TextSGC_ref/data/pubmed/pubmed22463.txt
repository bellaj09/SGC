In this study we propose a new web browser based on a hybrid brain computer interface BCI combining electroencephalographic EEG and electrooculography EOG signals. Specifically the user can control the horizontal movement of the mouse by imagining left/right hand motion and control the vertical movement of the mouse select/reject a target or input text in an edit box by blinking eyes in synchrony with the flashes of the corresponding buttons on the GUI. Based on mouse control target selection and text input the user can open a web page of interest select an intended target in the web and read the page content. An online experiment was conducted involving five healthy subjects. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. A hybrid BCI web browser based on EEG and EOG signals.
