"Various studies suggest the importance of peripheral vision PV in sports. Computer-based test systems provide objective methods to measure PV. Nevertheless the reliability and training effects are not clarified in detail. The purpose of this investigation was to present a short narrative non-systematic review on computer-based PV tests and to determine the reliability and the training effects of peripheral perception sub-test PP of the Vienna test system VTS in a test-retest design. N = 21 male athletes aged between 20 and 30 years M = 26.15; SD = 3.1 were included. The main outcome parameters were peripheral reaction PR PR left PRL PR right PRR field of vision FOV visual angle left VAL and visual angle right VAR. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and Bland-Altman plots. Training effects were determined by students t-test. Good reliability was observed in PR PRL and PRR. Moderate reliability was found in FOV VAL and VAR. Significant improvements between T0 and T1 were found in PRL with a mean difference of 0.04 s 95% CI 0.00-0.07 and in PR with a mean difference of 0.02 s 95% CI 0.00-0.05. For PRR FOV VAL VAR no significant differences were detected. These results indicate that PP can be applied to asses PV abilities in sports. Future research is needed to clarify the influence of test repetitions on visuomotor learning in PP. Moreover PV tests should be cross-validated with sport-specific measurements e.g. on-field and/or virtual reality approaches."
