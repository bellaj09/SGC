"There is increasing interest in the intrinsic activity in the resting brain especially that of ultraslow and slow oscillations. Using near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS electroencephalography EEG blood pressure BP respiration and heart rate recordings during 5 minutes of rest combined with cross spectral and sliding cross correlation calculations we identified a short-lasting coupling duration Formula: see text s between prefrontal oxyhemoglobin HbO2 in the frequency band between 0.07 and 0.13 Hz and central EEG alpha and/or beta power oscillations in 8 of the 9 subjects investigated. The HbO2 peaks preceded the EEG band power peaks by 3.7 s in 6 subjects with moderate or no coupling between BP and HbO2 oscillations. HbO2 and EEG band power oscillations were approximately in phase with BP oscillations in the 2 subjects with an extremely high coupling squared coherence Formula: see text between BP and HbO2 oscillation. No coupling was identified in one subject. These results indicate that slow precentral deoxyhemoglobin concentration oscillations during awake rest can be temporarily coupled with EEG fluctuations in sensorimotor areas and modulate the excitability level in the brains motor areas respectively. Therefore this provides support for the idea that resting state networks fluctuate with frequencies of between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz Mantini et.al. PNAS 2007."
