One potential reason for the suboptimal outcomes of treatments targeting appetitive behavior such as eating and alcohol consumption is that they do not target the implicit cognitive processes that may be driving these behaviors. Two groups of related neurocognitive processes that are robustly associated with dysregulated eating and drinking are attention bias AB; selective attention to specific stimuli and executive function EF; a set of cognitive control processes such as inhibitory control working memory set shifting that govern goal-directed behaviors. An increasing body of work suggests that EF and AB training programs improve regulation of appetitive behaviors especially if trainings are frequent and sustained. However several key challenges such as adherence to the trainings in the long term and overall potency of the training remain. The current manuscript describes five technological innovations that have the potential to address difficulties related to the effectiveness and feasibility of EF and AB trainings: 1 deployment of training in the home 2 training via smartphone 3 gamification 4 virtual reality and 5 personalization. The drawbacks of these innovations as well as areas for future research are also discussed. The above-mentioned innovations are likely to be instrumental in the future empirical work to develop and evaluate effective EF and AB trainings for appetitive behaviors.
