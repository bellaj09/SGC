Embedding techniques for converting high-dimensional sparse data into low-dimensional distributed representations have been gaining popularity in various fields of research. In deep learning models embedding is commonly used and proven to be more effective than naive binary representation. However yet no attempt has been made to embed highly sparse mutation profiles into densely distributed representations. Since binary representation does not capture biological context its use is limited in many applications such as discovering novel driver mutations. Additionally training distributed representations of mutations is challenging due to a relatively small amount of available biological data compared with the large amount of text corpus data in text mining fields.
