Pathology reports are a primary source of information for cancer registries which process high volumes of free-text reports annually. Information extraction and coding is a manual labor-intensive process. In this study we investigated deep learning and a convolutional neural network CNN for extracting ICD-O-3 topographic codes from a corpus of breast and lung cancer pathology reports. We performed two experiments using a CNN and a more conventional term frequency vector approach to assess the effects of class prevalence and inter-class transfer learning. The experiments were based on a set of 942 pathology reports with human expert annotations as the gold standard. CNN performance was compared against a more conventional term frequency vector space approach. We observed that the deep learning models consistently outperformed the conventional approaches in the class prevalence experiment resulting in micro- and macro-F score increases of up to 0.132 and 0.226 respectively when class labels were well populated. Specifically the best performing CNN achieved a micro-F score of 0.722 over 12 ICD-O-3 topography codes. Transfer learning provided a consistent but modest performance boost for the deep learning methods but trends were contingent on the CNN method and cancer site. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for automated abstraction of pathology reports.
