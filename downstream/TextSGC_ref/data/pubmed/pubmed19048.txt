Advancements in virtual reality VR technology have resulted in its expansion into health care. Preliminary studies have found VR to be effective as an adjunct to anesthesia to reduce pain and anxiety for patients during upper gastrointestinal endoscopies dental procedures and joint arthroplasties. Current standard care practice for upper extremity surgery includes a combination of regional anesthesia and intraoperative propofol sedation. Commonly patients receive deep propofol sedation during these cases leading to potentially avoidable risks of over-sedation hypotension upper airway obstruction and apnea. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of VR technology to promote relaxation for patients undergoing upper extremity surgery thereby reducing intraoperative anesthetic requirements and improving the perioperative patient experience.
