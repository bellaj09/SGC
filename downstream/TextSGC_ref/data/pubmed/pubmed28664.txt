This article presents an unsupervised method for movement onset detection from electroencephalography EEG signals recorded during self-paced real hand movement. A Gaussian Mixture Model GMM is used to model the movement and idle-related EEG data. The GMM built along with appropriate classification and post processing methods are used to detect movement onsets using self-paced EEG signals recorded from five subjects achieving True-False rate difference between 63 and 98%. The results show significant performance enhancement using the proposed unsupervised method both in the sample-by-sample classification accuracy and the event-by-event performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method suggests its potential application in self-paced Brain-Computer Interfaces BCI.
