"In this study we utilize a special visual stimulation protocol called motion reversal to present a novel steady-state motion visual evoked potential SSMVEP-based BCI paradigm that relied on human perception of motions oscillated in two opposite directions. Four Newtons rings with the oscillating expansion and contraction motions served as visual stimulators to elicit subjects SSMVEPs. And four motion reversal frequencies of 8.1 9.8 12.25 and 14 Hz were tested. According to Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA the offline accuracy and ITR mean  standard deviation over six healthy subjects were 86.56  9.63% and 15.93  3.83 bits/min respectively. All subjects except one exceeded the level of 80% mean accuracy. Circular Hotellings T-Squared test T2 circ also demonstrated that most subjects exhibited significantly strong stimulus-locked SSMVEP responses. The results of declining exponential fittings exhibited low-adaptation characteristics over the 100-s stimulation sequences in most experimental conditions. Taken together these results suggest that the proposed paradigm can provide comparable performance with low-adaptation characteristic and less visual discomfort for BCI applications."
