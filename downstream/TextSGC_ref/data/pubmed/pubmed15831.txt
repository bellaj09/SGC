Pattern recognition of electromyography EMG signals can potentially improve the performance of myoelectric control for upper limb prostheses with respect to current clinical approaches based on direct control. However the choice of features for classification is challenging and impacts long-term performance. Here we propose the use of EMG raw signals as direct inputs to deep networks with intrinsic feature extraction capabilities recorded over multiple days. Seven able-bodied subjects performed six active motions plus rest and EMG signals were recorded for 15 consecutive days with two sessions per day using the MYO armband MYB a wearable EMG sensor. The classification was performed by a convolutional neural network CNN with raw bipolar EMG samples as the inputs and the performance was compared with linear discriminant analysis LDA and stacked sparse autoencoders with features SSAE-f and raw samples SSAE-r as inputs. CNN outperformed lower classification error both LDA and SSAE-r in the within-session between sessions on same day between the pair of days and leave-out one-day evaluation p < 0.001 analyses. However no significant difference was found between CNN and SSAE-f. These results demonstrated that CNN significantly improved performance and increased robustness over time compared with standard LDA with associated handcrafted features. This data-driven features extraction approach may overcome the problem of the feature calibration and selection in myoelectric control.
