Colonoscopy is the reference method in screening and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasm but its efficacy is closely related to the quality of bowel preparation. Poor patient compliance is a major risk factor for inadequate bowel preparation likely due to poor patient education. Such an education is usually provided via either oral or written instructions by clinicians. However multiple education methods such as smartphone applications have been proved useful in aiding patients through bowel preparation. Also it was reported that a large proportion of patients feel anxious before colonoscopy. Virtual reality VR is a novel method to educate patients and provides them with an immersive experience. Theoretically it can make patients better prepared for bowel preparation and colonoscopy. However no prospective studies have assessed the role of this novel technology in patient education before colonoscopy. We hypothesise that VR videos can improve bowel preparation quality and reduce pre-procedure anxiety. Educational virtual reality videos in improving bowel preparation quality and satisfaction of outpatients undergoing colonoscopy: protocol of a randomised controlled trial.
