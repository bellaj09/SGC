Implantable brain-computer interface BCI research promises improvements in human health and enhancements in quality of life. Informed consent of subjects is a central tenet of this research. Rapid advances in neuroscience and the intimate connection between functioning of the brain and conceptions of the self make informed consent particularly challenging in BCI research. Identification of safety and research-related risks associated with BCI devices is an important step in ensuring meaningful informed consent. Informed consent in implantable BCI research: identification of research risks and recommendations for development of best practices.
