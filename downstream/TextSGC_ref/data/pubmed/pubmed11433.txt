Skin cancer is among the deadliest variants of cancer if not recognized and treated in time. This work focuses on the identification of this disease using an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. More specifically we propose the aggregation of robust convolutional neural networks CNNs into one neural net architecture where the final classification is achieved based on the weighted output of the member CNNs. Since our framework is realized within a single neural net architecture all the parameters of the member CNNs and the weights applied in the fusion can be determined by backpropagation routinely applied for such tasks. The presented ensemble consists of the CNNs AlexNet VGGNet GoogLeNet all of which have been won in subsequent years the most prominent worldwide image classification challenge ImageNet. For an objective evaluation of our approach we have tested its performance on the official test database of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ISBI 2017 challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection dedicated to skin cancer recognition. Our experimental studies show that the proposed approach is competitive in this field. Moreover the ensemble-based approach outperformed all of its member CNNs.
