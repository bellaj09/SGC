Brain-computer interface BCI technologies have been intensely studied to provide alternative communication tools entirely independent of neuromuscular activities. Current BCI technologies use electroencephalogram EEG acquisition methods that require unpleasant gel injections impractical preparations and clean-up procedures. The next generation of BCI technologies requires practical user-friendly nonintrusive EEG platforms in order to facilitate the application of laboratory work in real-world settings. Brain-computer interfaces using capacitive measurement of visual or auditory steady-state responses.
