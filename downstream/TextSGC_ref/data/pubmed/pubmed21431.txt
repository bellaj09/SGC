"We investigated the efficacy of a novel augmented reality AR navigation display called Mirror in the Sky MitS. AR displays can reduce the distance between virtual imagery content and the users view of the environment but may have limited benefit for depicting map-based survey information. MitS presents a simulated mirror in the upper visual field which reflects the topographic layout of the terrain in front of the user. In our experiment 28 participants used MitS and a track-up Map in virtual reality to perform a route confirmation task which required participants to decide whether a route could be successfully navigated. A post-trial threat location recall task examined spatial awareness. On that task accuracy duration and subjective workload measures favoured the Map. However participants with virtual reality experience made more accurate route confirmation decisions with MitS than the Map. Practitioner summary: We compared an augmented reality display called Mirror in the Sky MitS to a conventional electronic map for route confirmation and threat location tasks. Although the electronic map showed advantages over MitS on some measures users with some VR experience performed route confirmation more accurately with MitS than a map."
