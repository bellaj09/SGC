Multiset canonical correlation analysis MsetCCA has been successfully applied to optimize the reference signals by extracting common features from multiple sets of electroencephalogram EEG for steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP recognition in brain-computer interface application. To avoid extracting the possible noise components as common features this study proposes a sophisticated extension of MsetCCA called multilayer correlation maximization MCM model for further improving SSVEP recognition accuracy. MCM combines advantages of both CCA and MsetCCA by carrying out three layers of correlation maximization processes. The first layer is to extract the stimulus frequency-related information in using CCA between EEG samples and sine-cosine reference signals. The second layer is to learn reference signals by extracting the common features with MsetCCA. The third layer is to re-optimize the reference signals set in using CCA with sine-cosine reference signals again. Experimental study is implemented to validate effectiveness of the proposed MCM model in comparison with the standard CCA and MsetCCA algorithms. Superior performance of MCM demonstrates its promising potential for the development of an improved SSVEP-based brain-computer interface.
