"Brain computer interfaces rely on machine learning ML algorithms to decode the brains electrical activity into decisions. For example in rapid serial visual presentation RSVP tasks the subject is presented with a continuous stream of images containing rare target images among standard images while the algorithm has to detect brain activity associated with target images. Here we continue our previous work presenting a deep neural network model for the use of single trial EEG classification in RSVP tasks. Deep neural networks have shown state of the art performance in computer vision and speech recognition and thus have great promise for other learning tasks like classification of EEG samples. In our model we introduce a novel spatio-temporal regularization for EEG data to reduce overfitting. We show improved classification performance compared to our earlier work on a five categories RSVP experiment. In addition we compare performance on data from different sessions and validate the model on a public benchmark data set of a P300 speller task. Finally we discuss the advantages of using neural network models compared to manually designing feature extraction algorithms."
