"In recent studies neuroanatomical volume and shape asymmetries have been seen during the course of Alzheimers Disease AD and could potentially be used as preclinical imaging biomarkers for the prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI and AD dementia. In this study a deep learning framework utilizing Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric features of pre-defined atlas brain structures and a novel non-linear kernel trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and populations. By working with the low-dimensional features Siamese networks were shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR images with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time while preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding the asymmetry in brain volumes compared to traditional prediction methods that do not use the asymmetry on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets."
