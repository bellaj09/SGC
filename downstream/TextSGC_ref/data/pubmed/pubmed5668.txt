Quadratic assignment problems arise in a wide variety of domains spanning operations research graph theory computer vision and neuroscience to name a few. The graph matching problem is a special case of the quadratic assignment problem and graph matching is increasingly important as graph-valued data is becoming more prominent. With the aim of efficiently and accurately matching the large graphs common in big data we present our graph matching algorithm the Fast Approximate Quadratic assignment algorithm. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80% of the QAPLIB benchmark library compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying our algorithm to our motivating example matching C. elegans connectomes brain-graphs we find that it efficiently achieves performance.
