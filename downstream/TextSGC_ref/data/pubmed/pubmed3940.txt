"Primate occipitotemporal cortex OTC is composed of a mosaic of highly specialized brain regions each involved in the high-level visual analysis and recognition of particular stimulus categories e.g. objects faces scenes bodies and tools. Whereas theories attempting to account for this modular organization of category-selective responses in OTC have largely focused on visually driven bottom-up inputs to OTC e.g. dimensions related to the visual structure of the world and how it is experienced other proposals have instead focused on the connectivity of OTCs outputs emphasizing how the information processed by different OTC regions might be used by the rest of the brain. The latter proposals underscore the importance of interpreting the activity and selectivity of individual OTC areas within the greater context of the widely distributed network of areas in which they are embedded and that use OTC information to support behavior. Here using resting-state fMRI we investigated the functional connectivity FC patterns of OTC regions associated with object- face- scene- body- and tool-related processing defined from task-based localizers acquired in the same cohort of participants. We observed notable differences in the whole-brain FC patterns not only across OTC regions but even between areas thought to form part of the same category-selective network. Furthermore we found that the neuroanatomical location of OTC regions e.g. adjacency had little if any bearing on the FC networks observed. FC between certain OTC areas and other regions traditionally implicated in sensory- motor- affective- and/or cognitive-related processing and the associated theoretical implications is discussed." Distinct and distributed functional connectivity patterns across cortex reflect the domain-specific constraints of object face scene body and tool category-selective modules in the ventral visual pathway.
