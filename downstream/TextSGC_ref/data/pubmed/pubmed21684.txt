Although wheelchair ergometers provide a safe and controlled environment for studying or training wheelchair users until recently they had a major disadvantage in only being capable of simulating straight-line wheelchair propulsion. Virtual reality has helped overcome this problem and broaden the usability of wheelchair ergometers. However for a wheelchair ergometer to be validly used in research studies it needs to be able to simulate the biomechanics of real world wheelchair propulsion. In this paper three versions of a wheelchair simulator were developed. They provide a sophisticated wheelchair ergometer in an immersive virtual reality environment. They are intended for manual wheelchair propulsion and all are able to simulate simple translational inertia. In addition each of the systems reported uses a different approach to simulate wheelchair rotation and accommodate rotational inertial effects. The first system does not provide extra resistance against rotation and relies on merely linear inertia hypothesizing that it can provide acceptable replication of biomechanics of wheelchair maneuvers. The second and third systems however are designed to simulate rotational inertia. System II uses mechanical compensation and System III uses visual compensation simulating the influence that rotational inertia has on the visual perception of wheelchair movement in response to rotation at different speeds.
