Brain Computer Interfaces based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials have gained increased attention due to their low training requirements and higher information transfer rates. In this work a method based on sparse kernel machines is proposed for the discrimination of Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials responses. More specifically a new kernel based on Partial Least Squares is introduced to describe the similarities between EEG trials while the estimation of regression weights is performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning framework. The experimental results obtained on two benchmarking datasets have shown that the proposed method provides significantly better performance compared to state of the art approaches of the related literature.
