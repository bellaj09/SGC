Previous studies have shown that the activity of the amygdala is elevated in people experiencing clinical and subclinical levels of anxiety and depression negative affect. It has been proposed that a reduction in inhibitory input to the amygdala from the prefrontal cortex and resultant over-activity of the amygdala underlies this association. Prior studies have found relationships between negative affect and 1 amygdala over-activity and 2 reduced amygdala-prefrontal connectivity. However it is not known whether elevated amygdala activity is associated with decreased amygdala-prefrontal connectivity during negative affect states. Amygdala perfusion is predicted by its functional connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and negative affect.
