Progress in the development of Virtual Reality VR is faster than has been forecast which makes deep reflection on its potential uses and abuses absolutely necessary. The current article focuses on the analysis of some of the applications and implications of VR on psychopathology. It is obvious that they could be many but we are only focusing on: a VR as a model to answer some central questions that traditionally have intrigued psychopathologists; and b VR and possible psychopathological experiences. We believe that VR has the potential of becoming a tool that will allow psychopathology to challenge and modify theoretical positions already established and to pose new ones. This new way of experience can help us to find the answers to old question and at the same time it can make new answers arise on the psychopathological and psychological horizon. Such answers are not only related to empirical and theoretical issues but to moral ones as well. This road of research has just started. Virtual reality and psychopathology.
