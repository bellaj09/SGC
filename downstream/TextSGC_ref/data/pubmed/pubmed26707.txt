"Brain computer interface BCI technique is successfully utilized to bridge the interruption between brain and peripheral nerves and muscles and to establish a new pathway making brain directly output information or command. Up to now a majority of BCI systems are developed to restore communication ability or movement functionality for people with severe disabilities especially for paralyzed patients. To our best knowledge other researchers havent developed a multi-person BCI with competitive mode. Therefore in this paper we introduced a multi-person car racing system which allows more than one person to play game at the same time and they can compete with each other for the aim of first reaching destination. The reason of development of car racing system has two aspects. At one hand we introduced BCI to entertainment industry and provided a prototype for entertainment. At the other hand we proposed a competitive mode for BCI. According to practical evaluation the results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved a good performance."
