Motor imagery can improve motor function and reduce pain. This is relevant to individuals with spinal cord injury SCI in whom motor dysfunction and neuropathic pain are prevalent. However therapy efficacy could be dependent on motor imagery ability and a clear understanding of how motor imagery might be facilitated is currently lacking. Thus the aim of the present study was to assess the immediate effects of interactive virtual feedback on motor imagery performance after SCI. Interactive virtual feedback improves gait motor imagery after spinal cord injury: An exploratory study.
