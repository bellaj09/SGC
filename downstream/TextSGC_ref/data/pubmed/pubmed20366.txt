This pilot study aimed to assess medical students\ appraisals of a "mixed" virtual reality simulation for endoscopic surgery with a virtual patient case in addition to a virtual colonoscopy as well as the impact of this simulation set-up on students\ performance. Findings indicate that virtual patients can enhance contextualization of simulated endoscopy and thus facilitate an authentic learning environment which is important in order to increase motivation. Mixed virtual reality simulation--taking endoscopic simulation one step further.
