"Phantom limb pain is chronic and intractable. Recently virtual reality VR and motion capture technology has replicated the mirror box device of Ramachandran Ramachandran et al. Nature 1995 377 489-490; Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran Proc R Soc Biol Sci 1996 263 377-386 and led to reductions in this pain. We present results from a novel variation on this method which captures motion data directly from a patients stump rather than using the opposite remaining limb and then transforms it into goal directed virtual action enacted by an avatar in a VR environment." Exploratory findings with virtual reality for phantom limb pain; from stump motion to agency and analgesia.
