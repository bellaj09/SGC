This paper refers to a basic study toward the goal of developing a simple and easy-to-use input interface based on P3 components of visual event-related potentials. Because contamination from eye movements and eye blinks is a problem a method for removing eye movement artifacts from electroencephalogram EEG signals by applying an independent component analysis un-mixing matrix was proposed and implemented. Input character decisions were executed using a support vector machine SVM for judging the P3 existence of a single stimulus. The performances were compared while varying the number of channels of EEG signals the types of feature vectors and the ratio of the number of data used for training the SVM. The results indicated that three EEG signal channels Fz Cz Pz were enough to remove artifacts related to eye blinks and vertical eye movements and could be used to make a decision about input characters. The number of trials necessary to decide the input characters was ten on average. The best ratio achieved for the number of training data of targets and non-targets was 12. These results should be confirmed using a larger number of data sets. Input interface using event-related potential P3.
