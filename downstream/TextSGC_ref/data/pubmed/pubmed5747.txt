Unraveling the altered brain-behavior relationships in autism spectrum disorder ASD has been challenging because of the limitations of sample size and methodologies that are still evolving. Recently pediatric neuroimaging has undergone considerable advancement by harnessing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rfMRI1 in which methodologies can be applied to quantify functional connectivity FC from spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity. Benefiting from relatively easy data collection from clinical samples and the ability to harmonize these samples rfMRI has supported the emergence of open pediatric neuroimaging science OPENS through the pooling and sharing of large-scale neuroimaging data by and for the research community eg the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE23. Big data OPENS ASD studies have revealed functional impairments in both sensory and cognitive brain networks. However whether these impairments reflect a miswired connectome of network interplay in ASD remains to be elucidated. Editorial: Mapping the Miswired Connectome in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
