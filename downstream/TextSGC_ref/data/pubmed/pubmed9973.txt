"When learning from text it is important that learners not only comprehend the information provided but also accurately monitor and judge their comprehension which is known as metacomprehension accuracy. To investigate the role of a learners affective state for text comprehension and metacomprehension accuracy we conducted an experiment with N\u2009=\u2009103 university students in whom we induced positive negative or neutral affect. Positive affect resulted in poorer text comprehension than neutral affect. Positive affect also led to overconfident predictions whereas negative and neutral affect were both associated with quite accurate predictions. Independent of affect postdictions were rather underconfident. The results suggest that positive affect bears processing disadvantages for achieving deep comprehension and adequate prediction accuracy. Given that postdictions were more accurate practice tests might represent an effective instructional method to help learners in a positive affective state to accurately judge their text comprehension." Happy but overconfident: positive affect leads to inaccurate metacomprehension.
