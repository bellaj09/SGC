Imaging has a critical impact on surgical decision making and three-dimensional 3D digital models of patient pathology can now be made commercially. We developed a 3D digital model of a cancer of the head of the pancreas by integrating actual CT data with 3D modeling process. After this process the virtual pancreatic model was also produced using a high-quality 3D printer. Usefulness of Three-Dimensional Modeling in Surgical Planning Resident Training and Patient Education.
