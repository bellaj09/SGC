New rehabilitation strategies for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation employing visual stimulation show promising results however cost-efficient and clinically feasible ways to provide these interventions are still lacking. An integral step is to translate recent technological advances such as in virtual and augmented reality into therapeutic practice to improve outcomes for patients. This requires research on the adaptation of the technology for clinical use as well as on the appropriate guidelines and protocols for sustainable integration into therapeutic routines. Here we present and evaluate a novel and affordable augmented reality system Augmented Reflection Technology ART in combination with a validated mirror therapy protocol for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke. Computerised mirror therapy with Augmented Reflection Technology for early stroke rehabilitation: clinical feasibility and integration as an adjunct therapy.
