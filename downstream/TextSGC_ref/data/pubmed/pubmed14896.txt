"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI is a clinical entity with various potential etiologies including but not limited to Alzheimers disease. We examined whether a positive 18FFlorbetapir beta amyloid positron emission tomography scan supporting underlying Alzheimers disease pathophysiology was associated with specific memory deficits in 48 patients with aMCI 33 beta amyloid positive 15 beta amyloid negative. Memory was evaluated using an autobiographical fluency task and a word-list learning task with 2 different encoding types shallow/incidental versus deep/intentional. Compared with 40 beta amyloid-negative controls both aMCI subgroups demonstrated severe deficits in the global memory score and in most subscores of both tasks. Finer-grained analyses of memory tests showed subtle association with beta amyloid status revealing a stronger impairment of the primacy effect in beta amyloid-positive patients. Structural magnetic resonance imaging showed that both aMCI subgroups exhibited comparable atrophy patterns with similar degrees of medial temporal volume loss compared with controls. Specifically assessing the primacy effect might complement global memory scores in identifying beta amyloid-positive patients with aMCI." Is there a specific memory signature associated with A-PET positivity in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment?
