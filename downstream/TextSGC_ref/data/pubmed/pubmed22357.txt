Since centuries scientists clinicians and philosophers have been debating about the interactions between the body and the mind.

More than ever the body and the brain must be considered and treated as a functional entity the distinction between body and soul developed by Platon should no longer be applied. The development of new technologies in particular the virtual reality lends itself perfectly to this global approach.
