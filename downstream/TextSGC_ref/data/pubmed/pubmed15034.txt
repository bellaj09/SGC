The Lichtenstein technique is used worldwide because of its rapid learning curve good results and low recurrence rates. In this approach a lateral tie-shaped incision is made on the mesh involving the spermatic funiculus and thus correcting the deep inguinal ring defect by narrowing it. The lateral tie however does not prevent the wrinkling of the upper portion of the mesh that is caused by the arched shape of the inguinal ligament where the lower edge of the prosthesis is sutured. An easier Lichtenstein hernioplasty.
