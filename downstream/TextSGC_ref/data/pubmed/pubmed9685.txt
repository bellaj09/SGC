Accurate segmentation of the retinal microvasculature is a critical step in the quantitative analysis of the retinal circulation which can be an important marker in evaluating the severity of retinal diseases. As manual segmentation remains the gold standard for segmentation of optical coherence tomography angiography OCT-A images we present a method for automating the segmentation of OCT-A images using deep neural networks DNNs. Eighty OCT-A images of the foveal region in 12 eyes from 6 healthy volunteers were acquired using a prototype OCT-A system and subsequently manually segmented. The automated segmentation of the blood vessels in the OCT-A images was then performed by classifying each pixel into vessel or nonvessel class using deep convolutional neural networks. When the automated results were compared against the manual segmentation results a maximum mean accuracy of 0.83 was obtained. When the automated results were compared with inter and intrarater accuracies the automated results were shown to be comparable to the human raters suggesting that segmentation using DNNs is comparable to a second manual rater. As manually segmenting the retinal microvasculature is a tedious task having a reliable automated output such as automated segmentation by DNNs is an important step in creating an automated output.
