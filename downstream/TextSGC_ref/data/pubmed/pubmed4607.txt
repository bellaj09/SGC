Convergent studies have highlighted the dysfunction of the amygdala prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. However only a few studies have investigated the functional connectivity between brain regions in PTSD patients during the resting state which may improve our understanding of the neuropathophysiology of PTSD. The aim of this study was to investigate patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity in treatment-naive PTSD patients without co-morbid conditions who experienced the 8.0-magnitude earthquake in the Sichuan province of China. Abnormalities in whole-brain functional connectivity observed in treatment-naive post-traumatic stress disorder patients following an earthquake.
