The superior fronto-occipital fasciculus SFOF a long association bundle that connects frontal and occipital lobes is well-documented in monkeys but is controversial in human brain. Its assumed role is in visual processing and spatial awareness. To date anatomical and neuroimaging studies on human and animal brains are not in agreement about the existence course and terminations of SFOF. To clarify the existence of the SFOF in human brains we applied deterministic fiber tractography to a template of 488 healthy subjects and to 80 individual subjects from the Human Connectome Project HCP and validated the results with white matter microdissection of post-mortem human brains. The imaging results showed that previous reconstructions of the SFOF were generated by two false continuations namely between superior thalamic peduncle STP and stria terminalis ST and ST and posterior thalamic peduncle. The anatomical microdissection confirmed this finding. No other fiber tracts in the previously described location of the SFOF were identified. Hence our data suggest that the SFOF does not exist in the human brain.
