Coronary MRI is a non-invasive radiation-free imaging tool for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. One of its limitations is the long scan time due to the need for high resolution imaging in the presence of respiratory and cardiac motions. Machine learning ML methods have been recently utilized to accelerate MRI. In particular a scan-specific ML technique called Robust Artifical-neural-network for k-space Interpolation RAKI has shown promise in cardiac MRI. However it requires uniform undersampling. In this study we sought to extend this approach to arbitrary sampling patterns using coil self-consistency. This technique called SPIRiT-RAKI utilizes scan-specific convolutional neural networks to nonlinearly enforce coil self-consistency. Additionally regularization terms can also be incorporated. SPIRiT-RAKI was used to accelerate right coronary MRI. Reconstructions were compared to SPIRiT for different undersampling patterns and acceleration rates. Results show SPIRiT-RAKI reduces residual aliasing and blurring artifacts compared to SPIRiT. ACCELERATED CORONARY MRI USING 3D SPIRIT-RAKI WITH SPARSITY REGULARIZATION.
