While deep learning has driven recent improvements in audio speaker diarization it often faces performance issues in challenging interaction scenarios and varied acoustic settings such as between a child and adult caregiver/examiner. In this work the role of contextual factors that affect diarization performance in such interactions is analyzed. Factors that affect each type of diarization error are identified. Furthermore a DNN is trained on diarization outputs in conjunction with the factors to improve diarization performance. The results demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating context in improving diarization performance of child-adult interactions in clinical settings. Improving speaker diarization for naturalistic child-adult conversational interactions using contextual information.
