"For visually guided navigation the use of environmental cues is essential. Particularly detecting local boundaries that impose limits to locomotion and estimating their location is crucial. In a series of three fMRI experiments we investigated whether there is a neural coding of navigational distance in the human visual cortex both female and male. We used virtual reality software to systematically manipulate the distance from a viewer perspective to different types of a boundary. Using a multivoxel pattern classification employing a linear support vector machine we found that the occipital place area OPA is sensitive to the navigational distance restricted by the transparent glass wall. Further the OPA was sensitive to a non-crossable boundary only suggesting an importance of the functional constraint of a boundary. Together we propose the OPA as a perceptual source of external environmental features relevant for navigation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT One of major goals in cognitive neuroscience has been to understand the nature of visual scene representation in human ventral visual cortex. An aspect of scene perception that has been overlooked despite its ecological importance is the analysis of space for navigation. One of critical computation necessary for navigation is coding of distance to environmental boundaries that impose limit on navigators movements. This paper reports the first empirical evidence for coding of navigational distance in the human visual cortex and its striking sensitivity to functional constraint of environmental boundaries. Such finding links the paper to previous neurological and behavioral works that emphasized the distance to boundaries as a crucial geometric property for reorientation behavior of children and other animal species."
