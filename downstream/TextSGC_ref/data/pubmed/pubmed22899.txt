Laparoscopic training under simulated settings benefits from high fidelity models of the actual environment. This study was aimed at reducing uncertainty in the displacement and loads experienced by a laparoscopic instrument during surgical training. Infrared tracking of laparoscopic instruments is ineffective when real tissues attenuate the infrared signals. Incorporating the use of strain gauges for tip deflection measurements allows for online motion and load tracking during a procedure. Strain gauge voltages and infrared markers indicating displacement were both linear with respect to loads up to 700 grams. The resultant strain gauge voltage was equated to deflection values with a calibration constant. The results serve two purposes. First it may enable the tracking and analysis of the skill level of novice surgeons using bench models. Second the mechanical model of each instrument can be quantified and incorporated into virtual simulations thus increasing model fidelity effectively leading to better learning. Structural flexibility of laparoscopic instruments: implication for the design of virtual reality simulators.
