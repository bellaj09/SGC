People with addiction will continue to use drugs despite adverse long-term consequences. We hypothesized a that this deficit persists during substitution treatment and b that this deficit might be related not only to a desire for immediate gratification but also to a lower sensitivity for optimal decision making. We investigated how individuals with a history of heroin addiction perform compared to healthy controls in a virtual reality delay discounting task. This novel task adds to established measures of delay discounting an assessment of the optimality of decisions especially in how far decisions are influenced by a general choice bias and/or a reduced sensitivity to the relative value of the two alternative rewards. We used this measure of optimality to apply diffusion model analysis to the behavioral data to analyze the interaction between decision optimality and reaction time. The addiction group consisted of 25 patients with a history of heroin dependency currently participating in a methadone maintenance program; the control group consisted of 25 healthy participants with no history of substance abuse who were recruited from the Western Sydney community.
