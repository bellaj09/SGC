Studies on robot-assisted gait training rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis have reported positive effects on mobility and quality of life. However their effects on cognitive functions are difficult to determine because not all trials have included cognition assessments. Virtual reality-based training provides enhanced opportunity for stimulating cognitive abilities by repetitive practice feedback information and motivation for endurance practice. Effects of robot-assisted gait training combined with virtual reality on motor and cognitive functions in patients with multiple sclerosis: A pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial.
