Inter- and intra-subject variability pose a major challenge to decoding human brain activity in brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on non-invasive electroencephalogram EEG. Conventionally a time-consuming and laborious training procedure is performed on each new user to collect sufficient individualized data hindering the applications of BCIs on monitoring brain states e.g. drowsiness in real-world settings. This study proposes applying hierarchical clustering to assess the inter- and intra-subject variability within a large-scale dataset of EEG collected in a simulated driving task and validates the feasibility of transferring EEG-based drowsiness-detection models across subjects. A subject-transfer framework is thus developed for detecting drowsiness based on a large-scale model pool from other subjects and a small amount of alert baseline calibration data from a new user. The model pool ensures the availability of positive model transferring whereas the alert baseline data serve as a selector of decoding models in the pool. Compared with the conventional within-subject approach the proposed framework remarkably reduced the required calibration time for a new user by 90% 18.00\u202fmin-1.72\u202f\u202f0.36\u202fmin without compromising performance p\u202f=\u202f0.0910 when sufficient existing data are available. These findings suggest a practical pathway toward plug-and-play drowsiness detection and can ignite numerous real-world BCI applications.
