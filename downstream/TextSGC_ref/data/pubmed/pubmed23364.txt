Virtual microscopy used as a method to teach histology has many undeniable advantages. However the usefulness of this method is somewhat limited by the difficulties students face in finding their way through huge amounts of digital data compounded by decreased interaction between students and teachers.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of the presentation of virtual histology slides by students during classes. Are there any differences in approach between dentistry and general medicine students?
