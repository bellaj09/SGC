Filtering measured projections with a particular convolutional kernel is an essential step in analytic reconstruction of computed tomography CT images. A tradeoff between noise and spatial resolution exists for different choices of reconstruction kernel. In a clinical setting this often requires producing multiple images reconstructed with different kernels for a single CT exam which increases the burden of computation networking archival and reading. We address this problem by training a deep convolutional neural network CNN to synthesize multiple input images into a single output image which exhibits low noise while also preserving features in images reconstructed with the sharpest kernels.
