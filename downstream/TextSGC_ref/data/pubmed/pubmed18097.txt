This study analyzes the potential of virtual reality VR to enhance attentional distraction in overweight children as they experience bodily sensations during exercise. It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design a total of 109 children 33 overweight 10-15 years old were asked to walk twice for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: a traditional condition TC-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations or b distraction condition DC-focusing their attention on a virtual environment. Attentional focus during exercise bad-good feeling states pre- and postexperimental perceived exertion 3 minutes and post heart rate and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise and children preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.
