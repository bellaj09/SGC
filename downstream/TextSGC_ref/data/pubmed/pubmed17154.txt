Dissociation is a mental process resulting in the disruption of memory perception and sometimes identity. At a nonclinical level only mild dissociative experiences occur. The nature of nonclinical dissociation is disputed in the literature with some asserting that it is a beneficial information processing style and others positing that it is a psychopathological phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to further the understanding of nonclinical dissociation with respect to memory and attention by including a more ecologically valid virtual reality VR memory task along with standard neuropsychological tasks. Forty-five undergraduate students from a small liberal arts college in the northeast participated for course credit. The participants completed a battery of tasks including two standard memory tasks a standard attention task and an experimental VR memory task; the VR task included immersion in a virtual apartment followed by incidental object-location recall for objects in the virtual apartment. Support for the theoretical model portraying nonclinical dissociation as a beneficial information processing style was found in this study. Dissociation scores were positively correlated with working memory scores and attentional processing scores on the standard neuropsychological tasks. In terms of the VR task dissociation scores were positively correlated with more false positive memories that could be the result of a tendency of nonclinical highly dissociative individuals to create more elaborative schemas. This study also demonstrates that VR paradigms add to the prediction of cognitive functioning in testing protocols using standard neuropsychological tests while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. An evaluation of nonclinical dissociation utilizing a virtual environment shows enhanced working memory and attention.
