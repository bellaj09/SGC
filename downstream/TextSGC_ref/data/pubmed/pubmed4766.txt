Evidence from neuropsychological and imaging studies indicate that action and semantic knowledge about tools draw upon distinct neural substrates but little is known about the underlying interregional effective connectivity. With fMRI and dynamic causal modeling DCM we investigated effective connectivity in the left-hemisphere LH while subjects performed i a function knowledge and ii a value knowledge task both addressing semantic tool knowledge and iii a manipulation action knowledge task. Overall the results indicate crosstalk between action nodes and semantic nodes. Interestingly effective connectivity was weakened between semantic nodes and action nodes during the manipulation task. Furthermore pronounced modulations of effective connectivity within the fronto-parietal action system of the LH comprising lateral occipito-temporal cortex intraparietal sulcus supramarginal gyrus inferior frontal gyrus were observed in a bidirectional manner during the processing of action knowledge. In contrast the function and value knowledge tasks resulted in a significant strengthening of the effective connectivity between visual cortex and fusiform gyrus. Importantly this modulation was present in both semantic tasks indicating that processing different aspects of semantic knowledge about tools evokes similar effective connectivity patterns. Data revealed that interregional effective connectivity during the processing of tool knowledge occurred in a bidirectional manner with a weakening of connectivity between areas engaged in action and semantic knowledge about tools during the processing of action knowledge. Moreover different semantic tool knowledge tasks elicited similar effective connectivity patterns. Action and semantic tool knowledge - Effective connectivity in the underlying neural networks.
