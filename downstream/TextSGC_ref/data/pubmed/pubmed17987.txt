Human behavior modeling is a key component in application domains such as healthcare and social behavior research. In addition to accurate prediction having the capacity to understand the roles of human behavior determinants and to provide explanations for the predicted behaviors is also important. Having this capacity increases trust in the systems and the likelihood that the systems will be actually adopted thus driving engagement and loyalty. However most prediction models do not provide explanations for the behaviors they predict. In this paper we study the research problem human behavior prediction with explanations for healthcare intervention systems in health social networks. In this work we propose a deep learning model named social restricted Boltzmann machine SRBM for human behavior modeling over undirected and nodes-attributed graphs. In the proposed SRBM+ model we naturally incorporate self-motivation implicit and explicit social influences and environmental events together. Our model not only predicts human behaviors accurately but also for each predicted behavior it generates explanations. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic health social networks confirm the accuracy of SRBM+ in human behavior prediction and its quality in human behavior explanation.
