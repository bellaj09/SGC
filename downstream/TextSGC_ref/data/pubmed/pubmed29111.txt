Visual pursuit assessment is extensively applied in the behavioral scale-based clinical examination of patients with disorders of consciousness DOC. However this assessment is challenging because it relies on behavioral markers and these patients severely lack behavioral responses. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs may provide a potential solution to detect brain responses to external stimuli without requiring behavioral expressions. A BCI system was designed to simulate visual pursuit detection in the coma recovery scale-revised CRS-R. The graphical user interface included four buttons one that moved on the screen and three that did not. These buttons flashed in a random order. The patients were prompted to follow the moving button. Based on the collected electroencephalography data the algorithm determined whether the patient focused on the moving target. Among the 14 DOC patients who participated in the assessments based on the BCI system and the CRS-R four patients exhibited visual pursuit and three were nonresponsive in both assessments. More importantly seven patients who did not exhibit visual pursuit in CRS-R were detected to be responsive to the moving target stimuli in the BCI assessment. Furthermore five out of seven recovered consciousness to some degree and showed visual pursuit in the second CRS-R assessment. The proposed BCI system is better able to detect visual pursuit than the behavioral scale-based assessment and thus can assist in clinically evaluating the challenging population of DOC patients.
