Tumor programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 status is useful in determining which patients may benefit from programmed death-1 PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However little is known about the association between PD-L1 status and tumor histopathological patterns. Using deep learning we predicted PD-L1 status from hematoxylin and eosin H and E whole-slide images WSIs of nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC tumor samples. Multi-Field-of-View Deep Learning Model Predicts Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Status from Whole-Slide Hematoxylin and Eosin Images.
