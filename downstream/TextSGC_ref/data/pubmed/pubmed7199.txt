Domain adaptation nowadays attracts increasing interests in pattern recognition and computer vision field since it is an appealing technique in fighting off weakly labeled or even totally unlabeled target data by leveraging knowledge from external well-learned sources. Conventional domain adaptation assumes that target data are still accessible in the training stage. However we would always confront such cases in reality that the target data are totally blind in the training stage. This is extremely challenging since we have no prior knowledge of the target. In this paper we develop a deep domain generalization framework with structured low-rank constraint to facilitate the unseen target domain evaluation by capturing consistent knowledge across multiple related source domains. Specifically multiple domain-specific deep neural networks are built to capture the rich information within multiple sources. Meanwhile a domain-invariant deep neural network is jointly designed to uncover most consistent and common knowledge across multiple sources so that we can generalize it to unseen target domains in the test stage. Moreover structured low-rank constraint is exploited to align multiple domain-specific networks and the domain-invariant one in order to better transfer knowledge from multiple sources to boost the learning problem in unseen target domains. Extensive experiments are conducted on several cross-domain benchmarks and the experimental results show the superiority of our algorithm by comparing it with state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches.
