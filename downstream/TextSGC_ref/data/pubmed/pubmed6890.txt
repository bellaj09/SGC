"In language production humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often we must select a word from among similar acceptable and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years the left inferior frontal gyrus LIFG has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language how the LIFG interacts with the brains complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response cognitive control demands: open-response tasks word generation versus closed response tasks number naming. We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFGs theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFGs theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended but not open-ended response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability cognitive function and TMS effects.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects."
