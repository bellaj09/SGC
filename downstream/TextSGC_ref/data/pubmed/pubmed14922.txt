"In this article a program of research known as Fostering Communities of Learners is described. This program is in place in several schools and classrooms serving inner-city students from 6 to 12 years of age. Based on theoretical advances in cognitive and developmental psychology the program is successful at improving both literacy skills and domain-area subject matter knowledge e.g. environmental science and biology. Building on young childrens emergent strategic and metacognitive knowledge together with their skeletal biological theories the program leads children to discover the deep principles of the domain and to develop flexible learning and inquiry strategies of wide applicability." Transforming schools into communities of thinking and learning about serious matters.
