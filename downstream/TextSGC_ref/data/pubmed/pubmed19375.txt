Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome TTTS is a placental defect occurring in monochorionic twin pregnancies. It is associated with high risks of fetal loss and perinatal death. Fetoscopic elective laser ablation ELA of placental anastomoses has been established as the most effective therapy for TTTS. Current tools and techniques face limitations in case of more complex ELA cases. Visualization of the entire placental surface and vascular equator; maintaining an adequate distance and a close to perpendicular angle between laser fiber and placental surface are central for the effectiveness of laser ablation and procedural success. Robot-assisted technology could address these challenges offer enhanced dexterity and ultimately improve the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic procedures.
