The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-budget virtual reality exposure versus exposure in vivo in a within-group design in 10 individuals suffering from acrophobia. Virtual reality exposure was found to be at least as effective as exposure in vivo on anxiety and avoidance as measured with the Acrophobia Questionnaire AQ and even more effective on the Attitude towards Heights Questionnaire AHQ. The present study shows that virtual reality exposure can be effective with relatively cheap hardware and software on stand-alone computers currently on the market. Further studies are recommended in which virtual reality exposure is compared with in vivo exposure in a between-group design thus enabling investigation of the long-term effects of virtual reality treatment.
