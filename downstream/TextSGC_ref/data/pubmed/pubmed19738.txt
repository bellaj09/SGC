This article explores the efficacy of virtual environments representing situations that are emotionally significant to patients with eating disorders ED to modify depression and anxiety levels both in these patients and in controls. Eighty-five ED patients and 108 students were randomly exposed to five experimental virtual environments a kitchen with low-calorie food a kitchen with high-calorie food a restaurant with high-calorie food a restaurant with low-calorie food and a swimming-pool and to one neutral environment. In the interval between the presentation of each situation anxiety and depressed mood were assessed. Results of several repeated measures analyses demonstrated that patients show higher levels of anxiety and a more depressed mood after eating especially high-calorie food and after visiting the swimming pool than in the neutral room. In contrast controls only show higher levels of anxiety in the swimming pool. In the rest of the situations they presented a similar mood state as in the neutral room. We concluded that virtual reality is a useful vehicle for eliciting similar emotional reactions to those one would expect in real life situations. Thus this technology seems well suited for use in experimental studies as well as in evaluative and therapeutic contexts. The validity of virtual environments for eliciting emotional responses in patients with eating disorders and in controls.
