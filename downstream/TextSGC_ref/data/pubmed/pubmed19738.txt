The use of virtual reality VR for assessment and intervention of neck pain has previously been used and shown reliable for cervical range of motion measures. Neck VR enables analysis of task-oriented neck movement by stimulating responsive movements to external stimuli. Therefore the purpose of this study was to establish inter-tester reliability of neck kinematic measures so that it can be used as a reliable assessment and treatment tool between clinicians. Neck motion kinematics: an inter-tester reliability study using an interactive neck VR assessment in asymptomatic individuals.
