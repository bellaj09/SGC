RNA-binding proteins RBPs have a significant role in various regulatory tasks. However the mechanism by which RBPs identify the subsequence target RNAs is still not clear. In recent years several machine and deep learning-based computational models have been proposed for understanding the binding preferences of RBPs. These methods required integrating multiple features with raw RNA sequences such as secondary structure and their performances can be further improved. In this paper we propose an efficient and simple convolution neural network RBPCNN that relies on the combination of the raw RNA sequence and evolutionary information. We show that conservation scores evolutionary information for the RNA sequences can significantly improve the overall performance of the proposed predictor. In addition the automatic extraction of the binding sequence motifs can enhance our understanding of the binding specificities of RBPs. The experimental results show that RBPCNN outperforms significantly the current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically the average area under the receiver operator curve was improved by 2.67% and the mean average precision was improved by 8.03%.
