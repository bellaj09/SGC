In this pilot study a novel and minimalistic Brain Computer Interface BCI based wheelchair control application was developed. The system was based on pseudorandom code modulated Visual Evoked Potentials c-VEPs. The visual stimuli in the scheme were generated based on the Gold code and the VEPs were recognized and classified using subject-specific algorithms. The system provided the ability of controlling a wheelchair model LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 robot in 4 different directions based on the elicited c-VEPs. Ten healthy subjects were evaluated in testing the system where an average accuracy of 97% was achieved. The promising results illustrate the potential of this approach when considering a real wheelchair application. A brain computer interface for robust wheelchair control application based on pseudorandom code modulated Visual Evoked Potential.
