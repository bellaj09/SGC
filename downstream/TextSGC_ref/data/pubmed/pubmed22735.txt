"BCI Brain-Computer Interface is a system that allows interaction between the human brain and a computer. It is based on analyzing electroencephalographic signals EEG and processing them to generate control commands. The study analyzed the possible influence of psychological variables such as the imaginative kinesthetic capacity and anxiety in relation to performance in a BCI. All participants 4 male and 19 female students completed the questionnaires and carried out a session of BCI to control their EEG signals in a virtual setting of a car along a straight road. The group was divided into two subgroups according to their EEG signals or differential responses obtained in the left-right discrimination. Study results showed no significant differences in cognitive variables of imagination or in anxiety. By comparing the degree of participants BCI control a new quantitative parameter for comparing performances and making decisions in signal processing was found. The findings the ongoing research process to refine the control of a BCI and the interaction of psychological and computer procedures are discussed."
