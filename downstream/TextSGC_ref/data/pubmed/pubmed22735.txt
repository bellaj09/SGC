Endoscopic resection of third-ventricle colloid cysts is technically challenging due to the limited dexterity and visualization provided by neuroendoscopic instruments. Extensive training and experience are required to master the learning curve. To improve the education of neurosurgical trainees in this procedure a synthetic surgical simulator was developed and its realism procedural content and utility as a training instrument were evaluated. Development and evaluation of a patient-specific surgical simulator for endoscopic colloid cyst resection.
