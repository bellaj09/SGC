Many brain-computer interface BCI classification techniques rely on a large number of labeled brain responses to create efficient classifiers. A large database representing all of the possible variability in the signal is impossible to obtain in a short period of time and prolonged calibration times prevent efficient BCI use. We propose to improve BCIs based on the detection of event-related potentials ERPs in two ways. Optimization of Single-Trial Detection of Event-Related Potentials Through Artificial Trials.
