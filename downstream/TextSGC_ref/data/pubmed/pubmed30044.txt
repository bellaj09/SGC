Brain recordings in large animal models and humans typically rely on a tethered connection which has restricted the spectrum of accessible experimental and clinical applications. To overcome this limitation we have engineered a compact lightweight high data rate wireless neurosensor capable of recording the full spectrum of electrophysiological signals from\xa0the cortex of mobile subjects. The wireless communication system exploits a spatially distributed network of synchronized receivers that is scalable to hundreds of channels and vast environments. To demonstrate the versatility of our wireless neurosensor we monitored cortical neuron populations in freely behaving nonhuman primates during natural locomotion and sleep-wake transitions in ecologically equivalent settings. The interface is electrically safe and compatible with the majority of existing neural probes which may support previously inaccessible experimental and clinical research.
