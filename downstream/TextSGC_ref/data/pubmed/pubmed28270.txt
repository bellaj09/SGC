One of the changes seen in electroencephalography EEG data preceding human voluntary movement is a cortical potential called readiness potential RP. Detection of this potential can benefit researchers in clinical neurosciences for rehabilitation of malfunctioning brain and those working on brain-computer interfacing to develop a suitable mechanism to detect the intention of movement. Here a constrained blind source extraction CBSE is attempted for detection of RP. A suitable constraint is defined and applied. The results are also compared with those of the traditional blind source separation in terms of true positive rate false positive rate and computation time. The results show that the CBSE approach in overall has superior performance. Constrained blind source extraction of readiness potentials from EEG.
