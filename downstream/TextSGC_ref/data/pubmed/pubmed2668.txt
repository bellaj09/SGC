"The apolipoprotein E APOE 4 allele is a well-established genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease AD. Recent research has demonstrated an APOE 4-mediated modulation of intrinsic functional brain networks in cognitively normal individuals. However it remains largely unknown whether and how APOE 4 affects the brains functional network architecture in patients with AD. Using resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches we systematically investigated the topological organization of whole-brain functional networks in 16 APOE 4 carriers and 26 matched noncarriers with AD at three levels: global whole-brain intermediate module and regional node/connection. Neuropsychological analysis showed that the APOE 4 carriers performed worse on delayed memory but better on a late item generation of a verbal fluency task associated with executive function than noncarriers. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that APOE 4 significantly disrupted whole-brain topological organization as characterized by i reduced parallel information transformation efficiency; ii decreased intramodular connectivity within the posterior default mode network pDMN and intermodular connectivity of the pDMN and executive control network ECN with other neuroanatomical systems; and iii impaired functional hubs and their rich-club connectivities that primarily involve the pDMN ECN and sensorimotor systems. Further simulation analysis indicated that these altered connectivity profiles of the pDMN and ECN largely accounted for the abnormal global network topology. Finally the changes in network topology exhibited significant correlations with the patients cognitive performances. Together our findings suggest that the APOE genotype modulates large-scale brain networks in AD and shed new light on the gene-connectome interaction in this disease."
