In the present study inhibitory cortical mechanisms have been investigated during execution and inhibition of learned motor programs by means of multi-channel functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. fNIRS is an emerging non-invasive optical technique for the in vivo assessment of cerebral oxygenation concretely changes of oxygenated oxy-Hb and deoxygenated deoxy-Hb hemoglobin. Eleven healthy subjects executed or inhibited previous learned finger and foot movements indicated by a visual cue. The execution of finger/foot movements caused a typical activation pattern namely an increase of oxy-Hb and a decrease of deoxy-Hb whereas the inhibition of finger/foot movements caused a decrease of oxy-Hb and an increase of deoxy-Hb in the hand or foot representation area left or medial somatosensory and primary motor cortex. Additionally an increase of oxy-Hb and a decrease of deoxy-Hb in the medial area of the anterior prefrontal cortex APFC during the inhibition of finger/foot movements were found. The results showed that inhibition/execution of learned motor programs depends on an interplay of focal increases and decreases of neural activity in prefrontal and sensorimotor areas regardless of the effector. As far as we know this is the first study investigating inhibitory processes of finger/foot movements by means of multi-channel fNIRS. The interplay of prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices during inhibitory control of learned motor behavior.
