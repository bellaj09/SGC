"Evidence from functional imaging and clinical studies on patients with Parkinsons disease PD or Huntingtons disease HD suggests that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in learning on the weather prediction task WPT. Using deep brain stimulation DBS on versus off methodology the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of altering the output from the basal ganglia to the prefrontal cortex on implicit probabilistic classification learning on the WPT by patients with PD." "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus selectively improves learning of weakly associated cue combinations during probabilistic classification learning in Parkinsons disease."
