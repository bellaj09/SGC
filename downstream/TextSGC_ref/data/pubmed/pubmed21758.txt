Exaggerated blood pressure BP response to behavioral stress has been recognized as an independent predictor of increased BP levels in human subjects. The coupling of dopamine receptor type 1 DRD1 with stimulatory G-proteins plays an important role in BP regulation. Therefore we investigated whether the A-48G polymorphism of the DRD1 gene and the T393C polymorphism of the Gs protein alpha subunit GNAS gene influenced BP levels at rest and in response to stress. Effects of dopamine receptor type 1 and Gs protein alpha subunit gene polymorphisms on blood pressure at rest and in response to stress.
