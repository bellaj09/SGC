"Augmented reality AR is the fusion of computer-generated and real-time images. AR can be used in surgery as a navigation tool by creating a patient-specific virtual model through 3D software manipulation of DICOM imaging e.g. CT scan. The virtual model can be superimposed to real-time images enabling transparency visualization of internal anatomy and accurate localization of tumors. However the 3D model is rigid and does not take into account inner structures deformations. We present a concept of automated AR registration while the organs undergo deformation during surgical manipulation based on finite element modeling FEM coupled with optical imaging of fluorescent surface fiducials."
