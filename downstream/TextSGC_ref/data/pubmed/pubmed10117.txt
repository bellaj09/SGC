Computed tomography CT is critical for various clinical applications e.g. radiotherapy treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction. However CT exposes radiation during CT imaging which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI is much safer and does not involve any radiation. Therefore recently researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper we propose a 3D deep learning based method to address this challenging problem. Specifically a 3D fully convolutional neural network FCN is adopted to learn an end-to-end nonlinear mapping from MR image to CT image. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network CNN FCN generates structured output and can better preserve the neighborhood information in the predicted CT image. We have validated our method in a real pelvic CT/MRI dataset. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT image from MRI image and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison. In addition the parameters such as network depth and activation function are extensively studied to give an insight for deep learning based regression tasks in our application.
