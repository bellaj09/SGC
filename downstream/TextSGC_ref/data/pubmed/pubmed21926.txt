This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality VR technology in neurosurgical anatomy through a comparison of the virtual 3D microanatomy of the suboccipital vertebral arteries and their bony structures as part of the resection of tumors in the craniovertebral junction CVJ of 20 patients compared to the actual microanatomy of the vertebral arteries of 15 cadaveric headsets. Anatomical study of suboccipital vertebral arteries and surrounding bony structures using virtual reality technology.
