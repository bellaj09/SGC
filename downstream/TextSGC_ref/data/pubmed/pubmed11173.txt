A novel method for person identification based on the fusion of iris and periocular biometrics has been proposed in this paper. The challenges for image acquisition for Near-Infrared or Visual Wavelength lights under constrained and unconstrained environments have been considered here. The proposed system is divided into image preprocessing data augmentation followed by feature learning for classification components. In image preprocessing an annular iris the portion is segmented out from an eyeball image and then transformed into a fixed-sized image region. The parameters of iris localization have been used to extract the local periocular region. Due to different imaging environments the images suffer from various noise artifacts which create data insufficiency and complicate the recognition task. To overcome this situation a novel method for data augmentation technique has been introduced here. For features extraction and classification tasks well-known VGG16 ResNet50 and Inception-v3 CNN architectures have been employed. The performance due to iris and periocular are fused together to increase the performance of the recognition system. The extensive experimental results have been demonstrated in four benchmark iris databases namely: MMU1 UPOL CASIA-Iris-distance and UBIRIS.v2. The comparison with the state-of-the-art methods with respect to these databases shows the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
