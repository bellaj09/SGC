Predicting malignant potential is one of the most critical components of a computer-aided diagnosis system for gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs. These tumors have been studied only on the basis of subjective computed tomography findings. Among various methodologies radiomics and deep learning algorithms specifically convolutional neural networks CNNs have recently been confirmed to achieve significant success by outperforming the state-of-the-art performance in medical image pattern classification and have rapidly become leading methodologies in this field. However the existing methods generally use radiomics or deep convolutional features independently for pattern classification which tend to take into account only global or local features respectively. In this paper we introduce and evaluate a hybrid structure that includes different features selected with radiomics model and CNNs and integrates these features to deal with GISTs classification. The Radiomics model and CNNs are constructed for global radiomics and local convolutional feature selection respectively. Subsequently we utilize distinct radiomics and deep convolutional features to perform pattern classification for GISTs. Specifically we propose a new pooling strategy to assemble the deep convolutional features of 54 three-dimensional patches from the same case and integrate these features with the radiomics features for independent case followed by random forest classifier. Our method can be extensively evaluated using multiple clinical datasets. The classification performance area under the curve AUC: 0.882; 95% confidence interval CI: 0.816-0.947 consistently outperforms those of independent radiomics AUC: 0.807; 95% CI: 0.724-0.892 and CNNs AUC: 0.826; 95% CI: 0.795-0.856 approaches.
