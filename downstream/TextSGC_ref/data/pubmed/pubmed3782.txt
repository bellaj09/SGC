Patients with remitted major depressive disorder MDD were previously found to display abnormal functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity fMRI between the right superior anterior temporal lobe RSATL and the subgenual cingulate cortex and adjacent septal region SCSR when experiencing self-blaming emotions relative to emotions related to blaming others eg "indignation or anger toward others". This finding provided the first neural signature of biases toward overgeneralized self-blaming emotions eg "feeling guilty for everything" known to have a key role in cognitive vulnerability to MDD. It is unknown whether this neural signature predicts risk of recurrence a crucial step in establishing its potential as a prognostic biomarker which is urgently needed for stratification into pathophysiologically more homogeneous subgroups and for novel treatments.
