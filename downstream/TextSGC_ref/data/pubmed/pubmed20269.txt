A VR-based system using a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove was used to rehabilitate four post-stroke patients in the chronic phase. Each patient had to perform a variety of VR exercises to reduce impairments in their finger range of motion speed fractionation and strength. Patients exercised for about two hours per day five days a week for three weeks. Results showed that three of the patients had gains in thumb range 50-140% and finger speed 10-15% over the three weeks trial. All four patients had significant improvement in finger fractionation 40-118%. Gains in finger strength were modest due in part to an unexpected hardware malfunction. Two of the patients were measured against one-month post intervention and showed good retention. Evaluation using the Jebsen Test of Hand Function showed a reduction of 23-28% in time completion for two of the patients the ones with the higher degrees of impairment. A prehension task was performed 9-40% faster for three of the patients after the intervention illustrating transfer of their improvement to a functional task.
