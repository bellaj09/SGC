Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that may emerge following a traumatic event. Neuroimaging studies have shown evidence of functional abnormality in many brain regions and systems affected by PTSD. Exaggerated threat detection associated with abnormalities in the salience network as well as abnormalities in executive functions involved in emotions regulations self-referencing and context evaluation processing are broadly reported in PTSD. Here we aimed to investigate the behavior and dynamic properties of fMRI resting state networks in combat-related PTSD using a novel multimodal imaging approach. Simultaneous electroencephalography EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI was employed to measure neurobiological brain activity among 36 veterans with combat-related PTSD and 20 combat-exposed veterans without PTSD. Based on the recently established method of measuring temporal-independent EEG microstates we developed a novel strategy to integrate EEG and fMRI by quantifying the fast temporal dynamics associated with the resting state networks. We found distinctive occurrence rates of microstates associated with the dorsal default mode network and salience networks in the PTSD group as compared with control. Furthermore the occurrence rate of the microstate for the dorsal default mode network was positively correlated with PTSD severity whereas the occurrence rate of the microstate for the anterior salience network was negatively correlated with hedonic tone reported by participants with PTSD. Our findings reveal a novel aspect of abnormal network dynamics in combat-related PTSD and contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI will be a valuable tool in continuing to study the neurobiology underlying PTSD. Tracking resting state connectivity dynamics in veterans with PTSD.
