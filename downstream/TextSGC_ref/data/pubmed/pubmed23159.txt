Approximately 6 million people in the United States are currently living with paralysis in which 23% of the cases are related to spinal cord injury SCI. Miniaturized closed-loop neural interfaces have the potential for restoring function and mobility lost to debilitating neural injuries such as SCI by leveraging recent advancements in bioelectronics and a better understanding of the processes that underlie functional and anatomical reorganization in an injured nervous system. This paper describes our current progress toward developing a miniaturized brain-machine-spinal cord interface BMSI that converts in real time the neural command signals recorded from the cortical motor regions to electrical stimuli delivered to the spinal cord below the injury level. Using a combination of custom integrated circuit IC technology for corticospinal interfacing and field-programmable gate array FPGA-based technology for embedded signal processing we demonstrate proof-of-concept of distinct muscle pattern activation via intraspinal microstimulation ISMS controlled in real time by intracortical neural spikes in an anesthetized laboratory rat.
