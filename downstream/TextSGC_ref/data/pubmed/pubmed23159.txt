"Albeit exercise is currently advocated as one of the most effective management strategies for fibromyalgia syndrome FMS; the implementation of exercise as a FMS treatment in reality is significantly hampered by patients poor compliance. The inference that pain catastrophizing is a key predictor of poor compliance in FMS patients justifies considering the alteration of pain catastrophizing in improving compliance towards exercises in FMS patients. The aim of this study is to provide proof-of-concept for the development and testing of a novel virtual reality exposure therapy VRET program as treatment for exercise-related pain catastrophizing in FMS patients."
