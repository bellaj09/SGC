The papers that follow stem from a symposium presented at the International Society for Posture and Gait Research ISPGR in Seville Spain in July 2015. Four speakers were charged with presenting their methods of applying virtual reality VR technology to obtain meaningful rehabilitation outcomes. The symposium aims to explore characteristics of VR that modify mechanisms supporting motor relearning. Common impairments in posture and gait that can be modulated within virtual environments by employing motor learning concepts including sensory augmentation and repetition were examined. Critical overviews of VR applications that address different therapeutic objectives for improving posture and gait in individuals with neurological insult or injury were presented. A further goal was to identify approaches and efforts to bridge the gap between knowledge generation from research and knowledge uptake in clinical practice. Specific objectives of this symposium were that participants be able to: 1 identify benefits and limitations of selecting VR as an intervention tool; 2 discuss how VR relates to principles for motor relearning following neurological insult or injury; and 3 identify areas and methods for future translation of VR technology in clinical and home-based settings. Our symposium concluded that the application of VR technology in assessment treatment and research has yielded promising results in transferring learned cognitive and motor skills to more natural environments. VR permits the user to interact with a multidimensional and multisensory environment in real time and offers the opportunity to provide both standardized and individualized interventions while monitoring behavior. The quest to apply VR technology to rehabilitation: tribulations and treasures.
