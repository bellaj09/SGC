A major limitation of RNA sequencing RNA-seq analysis of alternative splicing is its reliance on high sequencing coverage. We report DARTS https://github.com/Xinglab/DARTS a computational framework that integrates deep-learning-based predictions with empirical RNA-seq evidence to infer differential alternative splicing between biological samples. DARTS leverages public RNA-seq big data to provide a knowledge base of splicing regulation via deep learning thereby helping researchers better characterize alternative splicing using RNA-seq datasets even with modest coverage. Deep-learning augmented RNA-seq analysis of transcript splicing.
