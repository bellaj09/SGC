Video surveillance applications have made great strides in making the world a safer place. Extracting visual attributes from a scene such as the type of shoes the type of clothing carrying any object or not or wearing any accessory etc. is a challenging problem and an efficient solution holds the key to a great number of applications. In this paper we present a multi-branch convolutional neural network that uses depthwise separable convolution DSC layers to solve the pedestrian attribute recognition problem. Researchers have proposed various solutions over the years making use of convolutional neural networks CNN however we introduce DSC layers to the CNN for the problem of pedestrian attribute recognition. In addition we make a novel use of the different color spaces and create a 3-branch CNN denoted as 3bCNN that is efficient especially with smaller datasets. We experiment on two benchmark datasets and show results with improvement over the state of the art. A multi-branch separable convolution neural network for pedestrian attribute recognition.
