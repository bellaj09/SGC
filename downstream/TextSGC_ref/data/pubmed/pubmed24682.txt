This article presents a comparative study among people with cerebral palsy and healthy controls of various ages using a Brain-computer Interface BCI device. The research is qualitative in its approach. Researchers worked with Observational Case Studies. People with cerebral palsy and healthy controls were evaluated in Portugal and in Brazil. The study aimed to develop a study for product evaluation in order to perceive whether people with cerebral palsy could interact with the computer and compare whether their performance is similar to that of healthy controls when using the Brain-computer Interface. Ultimately it was found that there are no significant differences between people with cerebral palsy in the two countries as well as between populations without cerebral palsy healthy controls. A comparative study: use of a Brain-computer Interface BCI device by people with cerebral palsy in interaction with computers.
