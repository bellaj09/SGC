To maximize accessibility to evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD the United States Department of Veterans Affairs VA has widely disseminated cognitive processing therapy CPT and prolonged exposure PE therapy to VA clinicians. However there is a lack of research on veteran preferences when presented with a range of psychotherapy and medication options. This study uses a mixed-method approach to explore veteran satisfaction with a VA PTSD specialty clinic pre-treatment orientation group which provides education about available PTSD treatment options. This study also tested differences in treatment preference in response to the group. Participants were 183 US veterans. Most were White male and referred to the clinic by a VA provider. Results indicated high satisfaction with the group in providing an overview of services and helping to inform treatment choice. Most preferred psychotherapy plus medications 63.4% or psychotherapy only 30.1%. Participants endorsed a significantly stronger preference for CPT versus other psychotherapies. PE was significantly preferred over nightmare resolution therapy and present-centered therapy and both PE and cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy were preferred over virtual reality exposure therapy. Results suggest that by informing consumers about evidence-based treatments for PTSD pre-treatment educational approaches may increase consumer demand for these treatment options.
