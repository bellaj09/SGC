Virtual reality VR could enable clinical simulation centers to reach the teaching capacity of traditional hospital practica. This study quantitatively tests VR telepresence against two traditional simulation learning methods using a within-subject design and the Presence Questionnaire. Eight nursing students were randomly assigned and rotated through simulation participation VR observation and television observation conditions completing a questionnaire after each condition. Each condition had a significant effect on presence. Simulation participation yielded the highest perceived presence followed by VR and lastly by television observation. This pilot study probed for effect and feedback that will inform a larger experiment. Comparing Virtual Reality Telepresence and Traditional Simulation Methods: A Pilot Study.
