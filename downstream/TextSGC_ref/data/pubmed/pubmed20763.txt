Objective: To evaluate the effects of 24-week exergame-based intervention on health-related quality of life HRQoL and pain in patients with fibromyalgia as well as to analyze the effectiveness of the intervention in subgroups of patients with different pain intensity levels. Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: University facilities Participants: Fifty-five women with fibromyalgia participated in the study. Intervention: The exercise group EG completed 24 weeks of exergames focused on mobility postural control upper and lower limbs coordination aerobic fitness and strength. A total of 120 minutes per week divided into two sessions of 60 minutes was completed. Main outcome measures: The Euroqol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels EQ-5D-5L was used to assess the HRQoL. In addition pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale VAS. Results: Twenty-five out of 28 women allocated to the EG completed the intervention which means an 89.29% of adherence. They were randomly divided into an exercise age\u2009=\u200954.04 8.45 and a control group 52.72 9.98. Significant effects on the perceived health status and pain intensity P\u2009<\u20090.05 were found. K-means clustering procedure revealed two groups with different response to the intervention. The respond group obtained significant effects of the exergame intervention in EQ-5D-5L pain VAS and VAS-EQ compared with those who did not respond. Conclusions: Exergames could be a useful tool to improve perceived health status and pain intensity level in women with fibromyalgia with a reduced health-related quality of life.
