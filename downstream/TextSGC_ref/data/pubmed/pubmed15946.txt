"The ultimate 3D displays should provide both psychological and physiological cues for depth recognition. However it has been challenging to satisfy the essential features without making sacrifices in the resolution frame rate and eye box. Here we present a tomographic near-eye display that supports a wide depth of field quasi-continuous accommodation omni-directional motion parallax preserved resolution full frame and moderate field of view within a sufficient eye box. The tomographic display consists of focus-tunable optics a display panel and a fast spatially adjustable backlight. The synchronization of the focus-tunable optics and the backlight enables the display panel to express the depth information. We implement a benchtop prototype near-eye display which is the most promising application of tomographic displays. We conclude with a detailed analysis and thorough discussion\xa0of the displays optimal volumetric reconstruction. of tomographic displays." Tomographic near-eye displays.
