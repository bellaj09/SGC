Resting-state functional connectivity FC has proven a powerful approach to understand the neural underpinnings of chronic pain reporting altered connectivity in 3 main networks: the default mode network DMN central executive network and the salience network SN. The interrelation and possible mechanisms of these changes are less well understood in chronic pain. Based on emerging evidence of its role to drive switches between network states the right anterior insula rAI an SN hub may play a dominant role in network connectivity changes underpinning chronic pain. To test this hypothesis we used seed-based resting-state FC analysis including dynamic and effective connectivity metrics in 25 people with chronic osteoarthritis OA pain and 19 matched healthy volunteers. Compared with controls participants with painful knee OA presented with increased anticorrelation between the rAI SN and DMN regions. Also the left dorsal prefrontal cortex central executive network hub showed more negative FC with the right temporal gyrus. Granger causality analysis revealed increased negative influence of the rAI on the posterior cingulate DMN in patients with OA in line with the observed enhanced anticorrelation. Moreover dynamic FC was lower in the DMN of patients and thus more similar to temporal dynamics of the SN. Together these findings evidence a widespread network disruption in patients with persistent OA pain and point toward a driving role of the rAI. Altered connectivity of the right anterior insula drives the pain connectome changes in chronic knee osteoarthritis.
