"So far Brain-Machine Interfaces BMIs have been mainly used to study brain potentials during movement-free conditions. Recently due to the emerging concern of improving rehabilitation therapies these systems are also being used during gait experiments. Under this new condition the evaluation of motion artifacts has become a critical point to assure the validity of the results obtained. Due to the high signal to noise ratio provided the use of wet electrodes is a widely accepted technic to acquire electroencephalographic EEG signals. To perform these recordings it is necessary to apply a conductive gel between the scalp and the electrodes. This work is focused on the study of gel displacements produced during ambulation and how they affect the amplitude of EEG signals. Data recorded during three ambulation conditions gait training and one movement-free condition BMI motor imagery task are compared to perform this study. Two phenomenons manifested as unusual increases of the signals amplitude have been identified and characterized during this work. Results suggest that they are caused by abrupt changes on the conductivity between the electrode and the scalp due to gel displacement produced during ambulation and head movements. These artifacts significantly increase the Power Spectral Density PSD of EEG recordings at all frequencies from 5 to 90 Hz corresponding to the main bandwidth of electrocortical potentials. They should be taken into consideration before performing EEG recordings in order to asses the correct gel allocation and to avoid the use of electrodes on certain scalp areas depending on the experimental conditions."
