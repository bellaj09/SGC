Realistic virtual simulation of gynecologic laparoscopy would permit the surgeon to practice any procedure with any degree of pathology at any time and as many times as necessary to achieve proficiency before attempting it in the operating room. Effective computer simulation requires accurate anatomy realistic three-dimensional computer graphics the ability to cut and deform tissue in response to instruments and an appropriate hardware interface. The Visible Human Project from the National Library of Medicine has made available extremely accurate three-dimensional digital data that computer animation companies have begun to transform to three-dimensional graphic images. The problem of tissue deformation and movement is approached by a software package called TELEOS. Hardware consisting of two scissor-grip laparoscopic handles mounted on a sensor can interface with any simulation program to simulate a multiplicity of laparoscopic instruments. The next step will be to combine TELEOS with the three-dimensional anatomy data and configure it for gynecologic surgery. Virtual Reality Simulation of Gynecologic Laparoscopy
