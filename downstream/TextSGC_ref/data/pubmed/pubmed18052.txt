"Extreme learning machine ELM has recently attracted many researchers interest due to its very fast learning speed good generalization ability and ease of implementation. It provides a unified solution that can be used directly to solve regression binary and multiclass classification problems. In this paper we propose a stacked ELMs S-ELMs that is specially designed for solving large and complex data problems. The S-ELMs divides a single large ELM network into multiple stacked small ELMs which are serially connected. The S-ELMs can approximate a very large ELM network with small memory requirement. To further improve the testing accuracy on big data problems the ELM autoencoder can be implemented during each iteration of the S-ELMs algorithm. The simulation results show that the S-ELMs even with random hidden nodes can achieve similar testing accuracy to support vector machine SVM while having low memory requirements. With the help of ELM autoencoder the S-ELMs can achieve much better testing accuracy than SVM and slightly better accuracy than deep belief network DBN with much faster training speed."
