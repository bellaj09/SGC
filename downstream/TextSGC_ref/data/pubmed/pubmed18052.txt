The exploitation of EEG signatures of cognitive processes can provide valuable information to improve interaction with brain actuated devices. In this work we study these correlates in a realistic situation simulated in a virtual reality environment. We focus on cortical potentials linked to the anticipation of future events i.e. the contingent negative variation CNV and error-related potentials elicited by both visual and tactile feedback. Experiments with 6 subjects show brain activity consistent with previous studies using simpler stimuli both at the level of ERPs and single trial classification. Moreover we observe comparable signals irrespective of whether the subject was required to perform motor actions. Altogether these results support the possibility of using these signals for practical brain machine interaction.
