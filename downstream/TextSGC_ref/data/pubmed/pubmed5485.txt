The Drosophila larva is an attractive model system to study fundamental questions in the field of neuroscience. Like the adult fly the larva offers a seemingly unlimited genetic toolbox which allows one to visualize silence or activate neurons down to the single cell level. This combined with its simplicity in terms of cell numbers offers a useful system to study the neuronal correlates of complex processes including associative odor-taste learning and memory formation. Here we summarize the current knowledge about odor-taste learning and memory at the behavioral level and integrate the recent progress on the larval connectome to shed light on the sub-circuits that allow Drosophila larvae to integrate present sensory input in the context of past experience and to elicit an appropriate behavioral response.
