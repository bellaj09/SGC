Autism spectrum disorder ASD is increasingly being conceptualized as a spectrum disorder of connectome development. We review evidence suggesting that ASD is characterized by a positive feedback loop that amplifies small functional variations in early-developing sensory-processing pathways into structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace. Using vision as an example we discuss how early functional variants in visual processing may be feedback-amplified to produce variant object categories and disrupted top-down expectations atypically large expectation-to-perception mismatches problems re-identifying individual people and objects socially inappropriate generally aversive emotional responses and disrupted sensory-motor coordination. Viewing ASD in terms of feedback amplification of small functional variants allows a number of recent models of ASD to be integrated with neuroanatomical neurofunctional and genetic data. Disrupted development and imbalanced function in the global neuronal workspace: a positive-feedback mechanism for the emergence of ASD in early infancy.
