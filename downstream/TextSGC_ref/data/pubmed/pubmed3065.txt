Infant brain atlases are essential for characterizing structural changes in the developing brain. Volumetric and cortical atlases are typically constructed independently potentially causing discrepancies between tissue boundaries and cortical surfaces. In this paper we present a method for surface-volume consistent construction of longitudinal brain atlases of infants from 2 weeks to 12 months of age. We first construct the 12-month atlas via groupwise surface-constrained volumetric registration. The longitudinal displacements of each subject with respect to different time points are then transported parallelly to the 12-month atlas space. The 12-month cortico-volumetric atlas is finally warped temporally to each month prior to the 12th month using the transported displacements. Experimental results indicate that the longitudinal atlases generated are consistent in terms of tissue boundaries and cortical surfaces hence allowing joint surface-volume analysis to be performed in a common space.
