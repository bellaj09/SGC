The human brain undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. This maturational process is thought to include the refinement of connectivity between putative connectivity hub regions of the brain which collectively form a dense core that enhances the functional integration of anatomically distributed and functionally specialized neural systems. Here we used longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to characterize changes in connectivity between 80 cortical and subcortical anatomical regions over a 2 year period in 31 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 years. Connectome-wide analysis indicated that only a small subset of connections showed evidence of statistically significant developmental change over the study period with 8% and 6% of connections demonstrating decreased and increased structural connectivity respectively. Nonetheless these connections linked 93% and 90% of the 80 regions respectively pointing to a selective yet anatomically distributed pattern of developmental changes that involves most of the brain. Hub regions showed a distinct tendency to be highly connected to each other indicating robust "rich-club" organization. Moreover connectivity between hubs was disproportionately influenced by development such that connectivity between subcortical hubs decreased over time whereas frontal-subcortical and frontal-parietal hub-hub connectivity increased over time. These findings suggest that late adolescence is characterized by selective yet significant remodeling of hub-hub connectivity with the topological organization of hubs shifting emphasis from subcortical hubs in favor of an increasingly prominent role for frontal hub regions.
