The visual system has often been thought of as a parallel processor because distinct regions of the brain process different features of visual information. However increasing evidence for convergence and divergence of circuit connections even at the level of the retina where visual information is first processed chips away at a model of dedicated and distinct pathways for parallel information flow. Instead our current understanding is that parallel channels may emerge not from exclusive microcircuits for each channel but from unique combinations of microcircuits. This review depicts diagrammatically the current knowledge and remaining puzzles about the retinal circuit with a focus on the mouse retina. Advances in techniques for labelling cells and genetic manipulations have popularized the use of transgenic mice. We summarize evidence gained from serial electron microscopy electrophysiology and light microscopy to illustrate the wiring patterns in mouse retina. We emphasize the need to explore proposed retinal connectivity using multiple methods to verify circuits both structurally and functionally. Wiring patterns in the mouse retina: collecting evidence across the connectome physiology and light microscopy.
