A Brain-Computer Interface BCI allows to control a computer by brain activity only without the need for muscle control. In this paper we present an EEG-based BCI system based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials c-VEPs that enables the user to work with arbitrary Windows applications. Other BCI systems like the P300 speller or BCI-based browsers allow control of one dedicated application designed for use with a BCI. In contrast the system presented in this paper does not consist of one dedicated application but enables the user to control mouse cursor and keyboard input on the level of the operating system thereby making it possible to use arbitrary applications. As the c-VEP BCI method was shown to enable very fast communication speeds writing more than 20 error-free characters per minute the presented system is the next step in replacing the traditional mouse and keyboard and enabling complete brain-based control of a computer. A Brain-Computer Interface BCI system to use arbitrary Windows applications by directly controlling mouse and keyboard.
