In vivo exposure is the recommended treatment of choice for specific phobias; however it demonstrates a high attrition rate and is not effective in all instances. The use of virtual reality VR has improved the acceptance of exposure treatments to some individuals. Augmented reality AR is a variation of VR wherein the user sees the real world augmented by virtual elements. The present study tests an AR system in the short posttreatment and long term 3 6 and 12 months for the treatment of cockroach phobia using a multiple baseline design across individuals with 6 participants. The AR exposure therapy was applied using the "one-session treatment" guidelines developed by Ost Salkovskis and Hellstrm 1991. Results showed that AR was effective at treating cockroach phobia. All participants improved significantly in all outcome measures after treatment; furthermore the treatment gains were maintained at 3 6 and 12-month follow-up periods. This study discusses the advantages of AR as well as its potential applications. Treating cockroach phobia with augmented reality.
