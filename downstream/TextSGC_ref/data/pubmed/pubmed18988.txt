Recent studies indicate that competition between conflicting action representations slows down planning of object-directed actions. The present study aims to assess whether similar conflict effects exist during manipulable object perception. Twenty-six young adults performed reach-to-grasp and semantic judgements on conflictual objects with competing structural and functional gestures and non-conflictual objects with similar structural and functional gestures presented at difference distances in a 3D virtual environment. Results highlight a space-dependent conflict between structural and functional affordances. Perceptual judgments on conflictual objects were slower that perceptual judgments on non-conflictual objects but only when objects were presented within reach. Findings demonstrate that competition between structural and functional affordances during object perception induces a processing cost and further show that object position in space can bias affordance competition. Conflict between object structural and functional affordances in peripersonal space.
