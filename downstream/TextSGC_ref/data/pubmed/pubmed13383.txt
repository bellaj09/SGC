Recently several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography CT reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems. Technical Note: PYRO-NN: Python reconstruction operators in neural networks.
