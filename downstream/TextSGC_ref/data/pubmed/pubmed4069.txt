The amygdala plays a pivotal role in processing anxiety and connects to large-scale brain networks. However intrinsic functional connectivity iFC between amygdala and these networks has rarely been examined in relation to anxiety especially across the lifespan. We employed resting-state functional MRI data from 280 healthy adults 18-83.5 yrs to elucidate the relationship between anxiety and amygdala iFC with common cortical networks including the visual network somatomotor network dorsal attention network ventral attention network limbic network frontoparietal network and default network. Global and network-specific iFC were separately computed as mean iFC of amygdala with the entire cerebral cortex and each cortical network. We detected negative correlation between global positive amygdala iFC and trait anxiety. Network-specific associations between amygdala iFC and anxiety were also detectable. Specifically the higher iFC strength between the left amygdala and the limbic network predicted lower state anxiety. For the trait anxiety left amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was observed in both somatomotor and dorsal attention networks whereas the right amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was primarily distributed in the frontoparietal and ventral attention networks. Ventral attention network exhibited significant anxiety-gender interactions on its iFC with amygdala. Together with findings from additional vertex-wise analysis these data clearly indicated that both low-level sensory networks and high-level associative networks could contribute to detectable predictions of anxiety behaviors by their iFC profiles with the amygdala. This set of systems neuroscience findings could lead to novel functional network models on neural correlates of human anxiety and provide targets for novel treatment strategies on anxiety disorders. Lifespan anxiety is reflected in human amygdala cortical connectivity.
