In the indoor location field the quality of received-signal-strength-indicator RSSI fingerprints plays a key role in the performance of indoor location services. However changes in an indoor environment may lead to the decline of location accuracy. This paper presents a localization method employing a Hybrid Wireless fingerprint HW-fingerprint based on a convolutional neural network CNN. In the proposed scheme the Ratio fingerprint was constructed by calculating the ratio of different RSSIs from important contribution access points APs. The HW-fingerprint combined the Ratio fingerprint and the RSSI to enhance the expression of indoor environment characteristics. Moreover a CNN architecture was constructed to learn important features from the complex HW-fingerprint for indoor locations. In the experiment the HW-fingerprint was tested in an actual indoor scene for 15 days. Results showed that the average daily location accuracy of the K-Nearest Neighbor KNN Support Vector Machines SVMs and CNN was improved by 3.39% 8.03% and 9.03% respectively when using the HW-fingerprint. In addition the deep-learning method was 4.19% and 16.37% higher than SVM and KNN in average daily location accuracy respectively.
