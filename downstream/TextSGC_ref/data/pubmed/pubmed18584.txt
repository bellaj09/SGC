Virtual reality is an immersive technology that can provide distraction and anxiolysis during painful procedures. While it has been shown to be effective in less invasive procedures it is underutilized in more invasive procedures. We describe using virtual reality for a morbidly obese patient with leukemia undergoing lumbar puncture. The use of virtual reality reduced the amount of analgesics and anxiolytics and the procedure and recovery times compared with no virtual reality.
