The segmentation of infant brain tissue images into white matter WM gray matter GM and cerebrospinal fluid CSF plays an important role in studying early brain development in health and disease. In the isointense stage approximately 6-8 months of age WM and GM exhibit similar levels of intensity in both T1 and T2 MR images making the tissue segmentation very challenging. Only a small number of existing methods have been designed for tissue segmentation in this isointense stage; however they only used a single T1 or T2 images or the combination of T1 and T2 images. In this paper we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks CNNs for segmenting isointense stage brain tissues using multi-modality MR images. CNNs are a type of deep models in which trainable filters and local neighborhood pooling operations are applied alternatingly on the raw input images resulting in a hierarchy of increasingly complex features. Specifically we used multi-modality information from T1 T2 and fractional anisotropy FA images as inputs and then generated the segmentation maps as outputs. The multiple intermediate layers applied convolution pooling normalization and other operations to capture the highly nonlinear mappings between inputs and outputs. We compared the performance of our approach with that of the commonly used segmentation methods on a set of manually segmented isointense stage brain images. Results showed that our proposed model significantly outperformed prior methods on infant brain tissue segmentation. In addition our results indicated that integration of multi-modality images led to significant performance improvement.
