Objective: To determine whether there is any difference between virtual reality game-based balance training and real-world task-specific balance training in improving sitting balance and functional performance in individuals with paraplegia. Methods: The study was a pre test-post test experimental design. There were 30 participants 28 males 2 females with traumatic spinal cord injury randomly assigned to 2 groups group A and B. The levels of spinal injury of the participants were between T6 and T12. The virtual reality game-based balance training and real-world task-specific balance training were used as interventions in groups A and B respectively. The total duration of the intervention was 4 weeks with a frequency of 5 times a week; each training session lasted 45 minutes. The outcome measures were modified Functional Reach Test mFRT t-shirt test and the self-care component of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure-III SCIM-III. Results: There was a significant difference for time p = .001 and Time  Group effect p = .001 in mFRT scores group effect p = .05 in t-shirt test scores and time effect p = .001 in the self-care component of SCIM-III. Conclusions: Virtual reality game-based training is better in improving balance and functional performance in individuals with paraplegia than real-world task-specific balance training. Study on the Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Game-Based Training on Balance and Functional Performance in Individuals with Paraplegia.
