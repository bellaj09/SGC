Obesity is increasing worldwide and can cause many chronic conditions such as type-2 diabetes heart disease sleep apnea and some cancers. Monitoring dietary intake through food logging is a key method to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent and manage obesity. Computer vision methods have been applied to food logging to automate image classification for monitoring dietary intake. In this work we applied pretrained ResNet-152 and GoogleNet convolutional neural networks CNNs initially trained using ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ILSVRC dataset with MatConvNet package to extract features from food image datasets; Food 5K Food-11 RawFooT-DB and Food-101. Deep features were extracted from CNNs and used to train machine learning classifiers including artificial neural network ANN support vector machine SVM Random Forest and Naive Bayes. Results show that using ResNet-152 deep features with SVM with RBF kernel can accurately detect food items with 99.4% accuracy using Food-5K validation food image dataset and 98.8% with Food-5K evaluation dataset using ANN SVM-RBF and Random Forest classifiers. Trained with ResNet-152 features ANN can achieve 91.34% 99.28% when applied to Food-11 and RawFooT-DB food image datasets respectively and SVM with RBF kernel can achieve 64.98% with Food-101 image dataset. From this research it is clear that using deep CNN features can be used efficiently for diverse food item image classification. The work presented in this research shows that pretrained ResNet-152 features provide sufficient generalisation power when applied to a range of food image classification tasks. Combining deep residual neural network features with supervised machine learning algorithms to classify diverse food image datasets.
