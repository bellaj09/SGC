Cognitive performance is highly heritable. However little is known about common genetic influences on cognitive ability and brain activation when engaged in a cognitive task. The Human Connectome Project HCP offers a unique opportunity to study this shared genetic etiology with an extended pedigree of 785 individuals. To investigate this common genetic origin we took advantage of the HCP dataset which includes both language and mathematics activation tasks. Using the HCP multimodal parcellation we identified areals in which inter-individual functional MRI fMRI activation variance was significantly explained by genetics. Then we performed bivariate genetic analyses between the neural activations and behavioral scores corresponding to the fMRI task accuracies fluid intelligence working memory and language performance. We observed that several parts of the language network along the superior temporal sulcus as well as the angular gyrus belonging to the math processing network are significantly genetically correlated with these indicators of cognitive performance. This shared genetic etiology provides insights into the brain areas where the human-specific genetic repertoire is expressed. Studying the association of polygenic risk scores using variants associated with human cognitive ability and brain activation would provide an opportunity to better understand where these variants are influential.
