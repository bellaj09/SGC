Millions of neurons drive the activity of hundreds of muscles meaning many different neural population activity patterns could generate the same movement. Studies have suggested that these redundant i.e. behaviorally equivalent activity patterns may be beneficial for neural computation. However it is unknown what constraints may limit the selection of different redundant activity patterns. We leveraged a brain-computer interface allowing us to define precisely which neural activity patterns were redundant. Rhesus monkeys made cursor movements by modulating neural activity in primary motor cortex. We attempted to predict the observed distribution of redundant neural activity. Principles inspired by work on muscular redundancy did not accurately predict these distributions. Surprisingly the distributions of redundant neural activity and task-relevant activity were coupled which enabled accurate predictions of the distributions of redundant activity. This suggests limits on the extent to which redundancy may be exploited by the brain for computation. Constraints on neural redundancy.
