Brain monitors tracking quantitative brain activities from electroencephalogram EEG to predict hypnotic levels have been proposed as a labor-saving alternative to behavioral assessments. Expensive clinical trials are required to validate any newly developed processed EEG monitor for every drug and combinations of drugs due to drug-specific EEG patterns. There is a need for an alternative efficient and economical method. Predicting Deep Hypnotic State From Sleep Brain Rhythms Using Deep Learning: A Data-Repurposing Approach.
