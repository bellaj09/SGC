Patient-centered virtual reality VR programs could assist in the functional recovery of people after a stroke. OBJECTIVES To analyze the feasibility of a rehabilitation protocol using client-centered VR and to evaluate changes in occupational performance and social participation. METHODS This was a mixed methods study. Ten subacute and chronic stroke patients participated in the rehabilitation program using games in non-immersive VR for 40 minutes/day three days/week for 12 weeks. Sociodemographic information was collected and the outcome variables included were the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure COPM and the Participation Scale. A field diary was used to record the frequency of attendance and adherence of participants and an interview was conducted at the end of program. RESULTS There were significant and clinically-relevant statistical improvements in the COPM performance score p < 0.001; CI = 1.29 - 4.858 and in the COPM satisfaction score p < 0.001; CI = 1.37 - 5.124 with a difference greater than 4.28 points for performance and 4.58 points for satisfaction. The change in the scores for participation was statistically significant p = 0.046 but there was no clinical improvement dcohen = -0.596 CI = -1.862 - 0.671. The majority of participants reported more than 75% consecutive attendance of sessions and there was 100% adherence to the program. In the interviews the participants described their post-stroke difficulties; how the video game motivated their engagement in rehabilitation; and the improvement of occupational performance and social participation after participating in the program. CONCLUSIONS VR is a viable tool for the rehabilitation of stroke patients with functional gains mainly regarding occupational performance and performance satisfaction. Use of client-centered virtual reality in rehabilitation after stroke: a feasibility study.
