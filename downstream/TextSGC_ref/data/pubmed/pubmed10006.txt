High-quality annotations for medical images are always costly and scarce. Many applications of deep learning in the field of medical image analysis face the problem of insufficient annotated data. In this paper we present a semi-supervised learning method for chronic gastritis classification using gastric X-ray images. The proposed semi-supervised learning method based on tri-training can leverage unannotated data to boost the performance that is achieved with a small amount of annotated data. We utilize a novel learning method named Between-Class learning BC learning that can considerably enhance the performance of our semi-supervised learning method. As a result our method can effectively learn from unannotated data and achieve high diagnostic accuracy for chronic gastritis.
