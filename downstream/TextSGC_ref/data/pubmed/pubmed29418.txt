"Recently spatio-temporal filtering to enhance decoding for Brain-Computer-Interfacing BCI has become increasingly popular. In this work we discuss a novel fully Bayesian-and thereby probabilistic-framework called Bayesian Spatio-Spectral Filter Optimization BSSFO and apply it to a large data set of 80 non-invasive EEG-based BCI experiments. Across the full frequency range the BSSFO framework allows to analyze which spatio-spectral parameters are common and which ones differ across the subject population. As expected large variability of brain rhythms is observed between subjects. We have clustered subjects according to similarities in their corresponding spectral characteristics from the BSSFO model which is found to reflect their BCI performances well. In BCI a considerable percentage of subjects is unable to use a BCI for communication due to their missing ability to modulate their brain rhythms-a phenomenon sometimes denoted as BCI-illiteracy or inability. Predicting individual subjects performance preceding the actual time-consuming BCI-experiment enhances the usage of BCIs e.g. by detecting users with BCI inability. This work additionally contributes by using the novel BSSFO method to predict the BCI-performance using only 2 minutes and 3 channels of resting-state EEG data recorded before the actual BCI-experiment. Specifically by grouping the individual frequency characteristics we have nicely classified them into the subject prototypes like  - or  -rhythm type subjects or users without ability to communicate with a BCI and then by further building a linear regression model based on the grouping we could predict subjects performance with the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.581 with the performance later seen in the actual BCI session."
