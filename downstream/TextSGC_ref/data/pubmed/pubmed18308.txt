"We report the case of a patient M.S. who after a left brain damage in posteromedial areas showed a deficit in determining the direction of any destination with respect to his current position or to external frames heading disorientation. Given that spatial cognition includes a wide range of cooperating abilities we deemed that M.S.s spatial disorientation could be ascribed to specific alterations within this multicomponent system where landmarks and spatial frames of reference contribute to organize information for different purposes." The lost ability to find the way: topographical disorientation after a left brain lesion.
