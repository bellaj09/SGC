"Previous evidence highlighted the multisensory-motor origin of embodiment - that is the experience of having a body and of being in control of it - and the possibility of experimentally manipulating it. For instance an illusory feeling of embodiment towards a fake hand can be triggered by providing synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation to the hand of participants and to a fake hand or by asking participants to move their hand and observe a fake hand moving accordingly rubber hand illusion. Here we tested whether it is possible to manipulate embodiment not through stimulation of the participants hand but by directly tapping into the brains hand representation via non-invasive brain stimulation. To this aim we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS to activate the hand corticospinal representation with virtual reality VR to provide matching as contrasted to non-matching visual feedback mimicking involuntary hand movements evoked by TMS. We show that the illusory embodiment occurred when TMS pulses were temporally matched with VR feedback but not when TMS was administered outside primary motor cortex over the vertex or when stimulating motor cortex at a lower intensity that did not activate peripheral muscles. Behavioural questionnaires and neurophysiological motor-evoked-potentials TMS-evoked-movements measures further indicated that embodiment was not explained by stimulation per se but depended on the temporal coherence between TMS-induced activation of hand corticospinal representation and the virtual bodily feedback. This reveals that non-invasive brain stimulation may replace the application of external tactile hand cues and motor components related to volition planning and anticipation." Non-invasive brain stimulation of motor cortex induces embodiment when integrated with virtual reality feedback.
