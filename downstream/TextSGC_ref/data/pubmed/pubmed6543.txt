"Lab-on-a-disc LOD has emerged as a promising candidate for a point-of-care testing POCT device because it can effectively integrate complex fluid manipulation steps using multiple layers of polymeric substrates. However it is still highly challenging to design and fabricate temperature measurement and heating system in non-contact with the surface of LOD which is a prerequisite to successful realization of DNA amplification especially with a rotatable disc. This study presents a Lab-on-a-disc LOD-based automatic loop-mediated isothermal amplification LAMP system where a thermochromic coating <~420 m was used to distantly measure the chambers temperature and a micro graphite film was integrated into the chamber to remotely absorb laser beam with super high efficiency. We used a deep learning network to more consistently analyze the product of LAMP than we could with the naked eye. Consequently both temperature heating and measurement were carried out without a physical contact with the surface of LOD. The experimental results show that the proposed approach which no previous work has attempted was highly effective in realizing LAMP in LOD."
