"A market research company Nielsen reported that consumers in the Asia-Pacific region have become the most active group in online shopping. Focusing on augmented reality AR which is one of three major techniques used to change the method of shopping in the future this study used a mixed design to discuss the influences of the method of online shopping user gender cognitive style product value and sensory channel on mental workload in virtual reality VR and AR situations. The results showed that males mental workloads were significantly higher than females. For males high-value products mental workload was significantly higher than that of low-value products. In the VR situation the visual mental workload of field-independent and field-dependent consumers showed a significant difference but the difference was reduced under audio-visual conditions. In the AR situation the visual mental workload of field-independent and field-dependent consumers showed a significant difference but the difference increased under audio-visual conditions. This study provided a psychological study of online shopping with AR and VR technology with applications in the future. Based on the perspective of embodied cognition AR online shopping may be potential focus of research and market application. For the future design of online shopping platforms and the updating of user experience this study provides a reference."
