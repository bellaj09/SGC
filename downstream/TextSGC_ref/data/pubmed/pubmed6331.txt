Anatomical connectivity imposes strong constraints on brain function but there is no general agreement about principles that govern its organization. Based on extensive quantitative data we tested the power of three factors to predict connections of the primate cerebral cortex: architectonic similarity structural model spatial proximity distance model and thickness similarity thickness model. Architectonic similarity showed the strongest and most consistent influence on connection features. This parameter was strongly associated with the presence or absence of inter-areal connections and when integrated with spatial distance the factor allowed predicting the existence of projections with very high accuracy. Moreover architectonic similarity was strongly related to the laminar pattern of projection origins and the absolute number of cortical connections of an area. By contrast cortical thickness similarity and distance were not systematically related to connection features. These findings suggest that cortical architecture provides a general organizing principle for connections in the primate brain providing further support for the well-corroborated structural model.
