"Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a constant and unspecific anxiety that interferes with daily-life activities. Its high prevalence in general population and the severe limitations it causes point out the necessity to find new efficient strategies to treat it. Together with the cognitive-behavioural treatments relaxation represents a useful approach for the treatment of GAD but it has the limitation that it is hard to be learned. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of virtual reality VR to facilitate the relaxation process by visually presenting key relaxing images to the subjects. The visual presentation of a virtual calm scenario can facilitate patients practice and mastery of relaxation making the experience more vivid and real than the one that most subjects can create using their own imagination and memory and triggering a broad empowerment process within the experience induced by a high sense of presence. According to these premises the aim of the present study is to investigate the advantages of using a VR-based relaxation protocol in reducing anxiety in patients affected by GAD."
