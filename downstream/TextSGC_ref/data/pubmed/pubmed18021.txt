Mental health nurses have a critical stake in resisting the right-wing ideology of British fascism. Particularly concerning is the contemporary effort of the British National Party BNP to gain credibility and electoral support by the strategic re-packaging of a racist and divisive political manifesto. Evidence that some public sector workers are affiliated with the BNP has relevance for nursing at a series of levels not least the incompatibility of party membership with a requirement of the Professional Code to avoid discrimination. Progressive advances though need to account for deep rooted institutionalized racism in the discourse and practice of healthcare services. The anomalous treatment of black people within mental health services alongside racial abuse experienced by ethnic minority staff is discussed in relation to the concept of race as a powerful social category and construction. The murder of the mentally ill and learning disabled in Nazi Germany as an adjunct of racial genocide is presented as an extreme example where professional ethics was undermined by dominant political ideology. Finally the complicity of medical and nursing staff in the state sanctioned bureaucratic killing that characterized the Holocaust is revisited in the context of ethical repositioning for contemporary practice and praxis.
