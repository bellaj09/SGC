The nutritional status of school-aged children is a growing concern of health care professionals today. In collaboration with a Kellogg Project in the deep south students from a large university school of nursing participated in a project to improve the nutritional status of rural school-aged children. The project goals focused on educating thd children about the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA Food Guide Pyramid reading nutritional labels and recognizing foods with high fat content and the importance of exercise along with diet. The nursing students created a nutritional assessment tool to use with each child to determine their educational needs. The project involved lecture interactive class discussion and hands-on activities. Information from the assessment tool revealed that fast food and foods high in fat were the most popular with the children. After project completion the posttest revealed an increase in cognitive knowledge of nutrition among all the children. In addition to this positive learning experience for the children improving the health status of children in the community was an excellent educational opportunity for the nursing students.
