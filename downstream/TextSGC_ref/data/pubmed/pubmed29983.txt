Being able to control an upper limb prosthesis by means of the signals recorded from the peripheral nerves is not a trivial task. New generations of neural electrodes are able to record this information but the quality of the signal can make difficult the extraction of the useful information. Several techniques have been adopted both for central and peripheral acquisitions in order to remove the noise and/or enhance the electrical activity generated by the brain or carried by the nerves.
