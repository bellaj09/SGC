Recovery from a stroke is a dynamic time-dependent process in which the central nervous system reorganises to accommodate for the impact of the injury. The purpose of this paper is to review recent longitudinal studies of changes in brain connectivity after stroke. A systematic review of research papers reporting functional or effective connectivity at two or more time points in stroke patients was conducted. Stroke leads to an early reduction of connectivity in the motor network. With recovery time the connectivity increases and can reach the same levels as in healthy participants. The increase in connectivity is correlated with functional motor gains. A new more randomised pattern of connectivity may then emerge in the longer term. In some instances a pattern of increased connectivity even higher than in healthy controls can be observed and is related either to a specific time point or to a specific neural structure. Rehabilitation interventions can help improve connectivity between specific regions. Moreover motor network connectivity undergoes reorganisation during recovery from a stroke and can be related to behavioural recovery. A detailed analysis of changes in connectivity pattern may enable a better understanding of adaptation to a stroke and how compensatory mechanisms in the brain may be supported by rehabilitation.
