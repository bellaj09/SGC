Retinal detachment can lead to severe visual loss if not treated timely. The early diagnosis of retinal detachment can improve the rate of successful reattachment and the visual results especially before macular involvement. Manual retinal detachment screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive which is difficult for large-scale clinical applications. In this study we developed a cascaded deep learning system based on the ultra-widefield fundus images for automated retinal detachment detection and macula-on/off retinal detachment discerning. The performance of this system is reliable and comparable to an experienced ophthalmologist. In addition this system can automatically provide guidance to patients regarding appropriate preoperative posturing to reduce retinal detachment progression and the urgency of retinal detachment repair. The implementation of this system on a global scale may drastically reduce the extent of vision impairment resulting from retinal detachment by providing timely identification and referral. Deep learning for detecting retinal detachment and discerning macular status using ultra-widefield fundus images.
