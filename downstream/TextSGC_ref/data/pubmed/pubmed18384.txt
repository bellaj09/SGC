During the last decade we have experienced fast development of virtual reality technology combined with various sensors and applications in different fields. The devices and applications are more easily accessible for the broader public. In this article we describe a feasibility study of an affordable personalized immersive VR motor rehabilitation system with full body tracking. While virtual reality rehabilitation is a relatively new field several applications were already proven more effective than traditional rehabilitation programs. The applied methods utilize VR headset HTC Vive and HTC trackers together witch inverse kinematics algorithms to provide full body tracking. For that we provide a framework for individual body calibration. The main result of the study is a developed virtual environment with guided rehabilitation scenarios based on personalized body calibration. We have proven that this approach can be used in personalized rehabilitation programs. Affordable Personalized Immersive VR Motor Rehabilitation System with Full Body Tracking.
