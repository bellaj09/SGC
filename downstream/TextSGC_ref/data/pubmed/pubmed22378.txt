The hippocampus plays critical roles in both object-based event memory and spatial navigation but it is largely unknown whether the left and right hippocampi play functionally equivalent roles in these cognitive domains. To examine the hemispheric symmetry of human hippocampal functions we used an fMRI scanner to measure BOLD activity while subjects performed tasks requiring both object-based event memory and spatial navigation in a virtual environment. Specifically the subjects were required to form object-place paired associate memory after visiting four buildings containing discrete objects in a virtual plus maze. The four buildings were visually identical and the subjects used distal visual cues i.e. scenes to differentiate the buildings. During testing the subjects were required to identify one of the buildings when cued with a previously associated object and when shifted to a random place the subject was expected to navigate to the previously chosen building. We observed that the BOLD activity foci changed from the left hippocampus to the right hippocampus as task demand changed from identifying a previously seen object object-cueing period to searching for its paired-associate place object-cued place recognition period. Furthermore the efficient retrieval of object-place paired associate memory object-cued place recognition period was correlated with the BOLD response of the left hippocampus whereas the efficient retrieval of relatively pure spatial memory spatial memory period was correlated with the right hippocampal BOLD response. These findings suggest that the left and right hippocampi in humans might process qualitatively different information for remembering episodic events in space.
