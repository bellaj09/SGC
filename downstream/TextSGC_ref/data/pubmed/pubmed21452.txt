"The mammalian gustatory system is acknowledged as one of the most valid chemosensing systems. The sense of taste particularly provides critical information about ingestion of toxic and noxious chemicals. Thus the potential of utilizing rats gustatory system is investigated in detecting sapid substances. By recording electrical activities of neurons in gustatory cortex a novel bioelectronic tongue system is developed in combination with brain-machine interface technology. Features are extracted in both spikes and local field potentials. By visualizing these features classification is performed and the responses to different tastants can be prominently separated from each other. The results suggest that this in vivo bioelectronic tongue is capable of detecting tastants and will provide a promising platform for potential applications in evaluating palatability of food and beverages." Detection and classification of tastants in vivo using a novel bioelectronic tongue in combination with brain-machine interface.
