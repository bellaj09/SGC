Classification of motor imagery electroencephalograph signals is a fundamental problem in brain-computer interface BCI systems. We propose in this paper a classification framework based on long short-term memory LSTM networks. To achieve robust classification a one dimension-aggregate approximation 1d-AX is employed to extract effective signal representation for LSTM networks. Inspired by classical common spatial pattern channel weighting technique is further deployed to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework. Public BCI competition data are used for the evaluation of the proposed feature extraction and classification network whose performance is also compared with that of the state-of-the-arts approaches based on other deep networks.
