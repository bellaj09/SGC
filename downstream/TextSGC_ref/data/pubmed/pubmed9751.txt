MicroRNAs miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs mRNAs. Because the underlying mechanisms associated with miRNA binding to mRNA are not fully understood a major challenge of miRNA studies involves the identification of miRNA-target sites on mRNA. In silico prediction of miRNA-target sites can expedite costly and time-consuming experimental work by providing the most promising miRNA-target-site candidates.
