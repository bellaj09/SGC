Dynamic MR image reconstruction from incomplete k-space data has generated great research interest due to its capability in reducing scan time. Nevertheless the reconstruction problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Most existing methods either suffer from long iterative reconstruction time or explore limited prior knowledge. This paper proposes a dynamic MR imaging method with both k-space and spatial prior knowledge integrated via multi-supervised network training dubbed as DIMENSION. Specifically the DIMENSION architecture consists of a frequential prior network for updating the k-space with its network prediction and a spatial prior network for capturing image structures and details. Furthermore a multi-supervised network training technique is developed to constrain the frequency domain information and the spatial domain information. The comparisons with classical k-t FOCUSS k-t SLR L+S and the state-of-the-art CNN-based method on in vivo datasets show our method can achieve improved reconstruction results in shorter time.
