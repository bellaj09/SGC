NengoDL is a software framework designed to combine the strengths of neuromorphic modelling and deep learning. NengoDL allows users to construct biologically detailed neural models intermix those models with deep learning elements such as convolutional networks and then efficiently simulate those models in an easy-to-use unified framework. In addition NengoDL allows users to apply deep learning training methods to optimize the parameters of biological neural models. In this paper we present basic usage examples benchmarking and details on the key implementation elements of NengoDL. More details can be found at https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl.
