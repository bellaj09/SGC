In recent years virtual reality VR research on psychotic disorders has been initiated. Several studies showed that VR can elicit paranoid thoughts about virtual characters avatars both in patients with psychotic disorders and healthy individuals. Real life symptoms and VR experiences were correlated lending further support to its validity.
