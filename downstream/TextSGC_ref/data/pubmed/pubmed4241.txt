Significance: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD is the most common psychological disease in childhood. Currently widely used neuroimaging techniques require complete body confinement and motionlessness and thus are extremely hard for brain scanning of ADHD children. Aim: We present resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS as an imaging technique to record spontaneous brain activity in children with ADHD. Approach: The brain functional connectivity was calculated and the graph theoretical analysis was further applied to investigate alterations in the global and regional properties of the brain network in the patients. In addition the relationship between brain network features and core symptoms was examined. Results: ADHD patients exhibited significant decreases in both functional connectivity and global network efficiency. Meanwhile the nodal efficiency in children with ADHD was also found to be altered e.g.\xa0increase in the visual and dorsal attention networks and decrease in somatomotor and default mode networks compared to the healthy controls. More importantly the disrupted functional connectivity and nodal efficiency significantly correlated with dimensional ADHD scores. Conclusions: We clearly demonstrate the feasibility and potential of fNIRS-based connectome technique in ADHD or other neurological diseases in the future. Disrupted functional brain connectivity networks in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: evidence from resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
