"Knowledge of science and the scientific method are important in learning about and using evidence-based medicine in practice. Courses in research methodology have been introduced for both medical students and practicing doctors. In Pokhara the basic science subjects are taught in an integrated manner during the first four semesters of the undergraduate medical course. Studies on students attitudes towards and knowledge of science are lacking in medical colleges in Nepal. Hence the study was carried out to obtain information on students attitude towards and knowledge of science and scientific methodology among preclinical medical students and note the association if any of students attitudes and their demographic characteristics. The study was carried out in March 2005 among the students of the first four semesters at the Manipal College of Medical Sciences Pokhara Nepal using a questionnaire developed by Hren and coworkers. Two hundred and twenty students overall response rate 73.3% successfully completed the questionnaire. Seventy-five respondents were Nepalese 115 were Indians 27 were Sri Lankans and 3 belonged to other nationalities. The X +/- SD total attitude score was 147.4 +/- 10.8 neutral score 135. The X +/- SD scores on the subscales value of science to humanity value of scientific methodology and value of science to medicine were 51.3 +/- 5.4 39.6 +/- 3.7 and 58.5 +/- 5.9 neutral scores were 36 51 and 48 respectively. The knowledge score measured using a set of 8 multiple choice questions was 3.3 +/- 1.4. The attitude scores were lower and the knowledge score was comparable to that reported previously in a study in Croatia but higher than that reported from Southeast Europe."
