Stroke is one of the leading causes of permanent disability in adults. The literature suggests that rehabilitation is key to early motor recovery. However conventional therapy is labor and cost intensive. Robotic and functional electrical stimulation FES devices can provide a high dose of repetitions and as such may provide an alternative or an adjunct to conventional rehabilitation therapy. Brain-computer interfaces BCI could augment neuroplasticity by introducing mental training. However mental training alone is not enough; but combining mental with physical training could boost outcomes. In the current case study a portable rehabilitative platform and goal-oriented supporting training protocols were introduced and tested with a chronic stroke participant. A novel training method was introduced with the proposed rehabilitative platform. A 37-year old individual with chronic stroke participated in 6-weeks of training 18 sessions in total 3 sessions a week and 1 h per session. In this case study we show that an individual with chronic stroke can tolerate a 6-week training bout with our system and protocol. The participant was actively engaged throughout the training. Changes in the Wolf Motor Function Test WMFT suggest that the training positively affected arm motor function 12% improvement in WMFT score.
