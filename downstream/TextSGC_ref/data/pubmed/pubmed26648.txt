This paper presents a data-adaptive approach to enhance the discriminative information of event-related potential ERP for the implementation of a brain-computer interface BCI. The use of single-trial ERP in a real-time BCI application is challenging due to its inherent noise contamination. Usually multiple-trial ERPs are averaged to derive discriminative features of different classes by reducing their noise effects. Time-domain filtering is implemented here using an array wavelet transform. Sometimes several channels can carry the signals which are irrelevant to actual EPR information against the respective stimuli. A spatial filtering method based on clustering is introduced to suppress such channels if any. Hence the single-trial ERP is filtered in both the spatial and temporal domains to improve its discriminative features. The spatial-temporal discriminate analysis is employed to derive the features leading to the performance of target and non-target classification by using linear discriminant analysis. The proposed method is validated using a data set recorded from our experiments. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the recently developed algorithms for single-trial ERP classification.
