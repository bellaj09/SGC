Accurate segmentation of the prostate from magnetic resonance MR images provides useful information for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. However automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images faces several challenges. The lack of clear edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size shape and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even further complicated. Recently as deep learning especially convolutional neural networks CNNs emerging as the best performed methods for medical image segmentation the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced than ever. Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of deep learning lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges in this paper we propose a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network BOWDA-Net. To make the network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation a boundary-weighted segmentation loss is proposed. Furthermore an advanced boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the problem of small medical imaging datasets. We evaluate our proposed model on three different MR prostate datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is more sensitive to object boundaries and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.
