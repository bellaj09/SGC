Brain-computer interfaces BCI enable direct communication with a computer using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram EEG signals. For a given BCI paradigm feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks CNNs which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms while simultaneously being as compact as possible.
