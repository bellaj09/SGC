"We propose iW-Net a deep learning model that allows for both automatic and interactive segmentation of lung nodules in computed tomography images. iW-Net is composed of two blocks: the first one provides an automatic segmentation and the second one allows to correct it by analyzing 2 points introduced by the user in the nodules boundary. For this purpose a physics inspired weight map that takes the user input into account is proposed which is used both as a feature map and in the systems loss function. Our approach is extensively evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset where we achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 0.55 intersection over union vs the 0.59 inter-observer agreement. Also we show that iW-Net allows to correct the segmentation of small nodules essential for proper patient referral decision as well as improve the segmentation of the challenging non-solid nodules and thus may be an important tool for increasing the early diagnosis of lung cancer." iW-Net: an automatic and minimalistic interactive lung nodule segmentation deep network.
