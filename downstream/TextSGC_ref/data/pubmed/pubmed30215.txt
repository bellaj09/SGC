Photovoltaic retinal prostheses theoretically offer the possibility of stand-alone high-resolution electrical stimulation of the retina. However achieving focused epiretinal stimulation is particularly challenging because of axonal activation and electrical cell coupling. Recent evidence shows that long electric pulses permit a more focal activation of retinal ganglion cells and non-rectangular waveforms induce higher network-mediated indirect activity. Capacitive-like photovoltaic epiretinal stimulation enhances and narrows the network-mediated activity of retinal ganglion cells by recruiting the lateral inhibitory network.
