The present investigation evaluated the effects of virtual reality VR training on the performance perceived workload and stress response to a live training exercise in a sample of Soldiers. We also examined the relationship between the perceptions of that same VR as measured by engagement immersion presence flow perceived utility and ease of use with the performance workload and stress reported on the live training task. To a degree these latter relationships were moderated by task performance as measured by binary Go/No-Go ratings. Participants who reported positive VR experiences also tended to experience lower stress and lower workload when performing the live version of the task. Thus VR training regimens may be efficacious for mitigating the stress and workload associated with criterion tasks thereby reducing the ultimate likelihood of real-world performance failure. Practitioner Summary: VR provides opportunities for training in artificial worlds comprised of highly realistic features. Our virtual room clearing scenario facilitated the integration of Training and Readiness objectives and satisfied training doctrine obligations in a compelling engaging experience for both novice and experienced trainees. The stress and workload of virtual reality training: the effects of presence immersion and flow.
