Combining information from different sources is a common way to improve classification accuracy in Brain-Computer Interfacing BCI. For instance in small sample settings it is useful to integrate data from other subjects or sessions in order to improve the estimation quality of the spatial filters or the classifier. Since data from different subjects may show large variability it is crucial to weight the contributions according to importance. Many multi-subject learning algorithms determine the optimal weighting in a separate step by using heuristics however without ensuring that the selected weights are optimal with respect to classification. In this work we apply Multiple Kernel Learning MKL to this problem. MKL has been widely used for feature fusion in computer vision and allows to simultaneously learn the classifier and the optimal weighting. We compare the MKL method to two baseline approaches and investigate the reasons for performance improvement. Multiple kernel learning for brain-computer interfacing.
