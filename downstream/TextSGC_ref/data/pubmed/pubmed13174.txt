"This article looks at how games and play contribute to the big data-driven production of knowledge in High-Energy Physics with a\xa0particular focus on the Large Hadron Collider LHC at the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN where the author has been conducting anthropological fieldwork since 2014. The ludic playful aspect of knowledge production is analyzed here in three different dimensions: the Symbolic the Ontological and the Epistemic. The first one points towards CERN as place where a\xa0cosmological game of probability is played with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations. The second one can be seen in the agonistic infrastructures of competing experimental collaborations. The third dimension unfolds in ludic platforms such as online Challenges and citizen science games which contribute to the development of machine learning algorithms whose function is necessary in order to process the huge amount of data gathered from experimental events. Following Clifford Geertz CERN itself is characterized as a\xa0site of deep play a\xa0concept that contributes to understanding wider social and cultural orders through the analysis of ludic collective phenomena. The article also engages with Peter Galisons idea of the trading zone proposing to comprehend it in the age of big data as a\xa0Playground. Thus the author hopes to contribute to a\xa0wider discussion in the historiographical and social study of science and technology as well as in cultural anthropology by recognizing the ludic in science as a\xa0central element of understanding collaborative knowledge production."
