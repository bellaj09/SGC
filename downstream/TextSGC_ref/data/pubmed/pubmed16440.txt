We propose a simple all-in-line single-shot scheme for diagnostics of ultrashort laser pulses consisting of a multi-mode fiber a nonlinear crystal and a camera. The system records a 2D spatial intensity pattern from which the pulse shape amplitude and phase are recovered through a fast Deep Learning algorithm. We explore this scheme in simulations and demonstrate the recovery of ultrashort pulses robustness to noise in measurements and to inaccuracies in the parameters of the system components. Our technique mitigates the need for commonly used iterative optimization reconstruction methods which are usually slow and hampered by the presence of noise. These features make our concept system advantageous for real time probing of ultrafast processes and noisy conditions. Moreover this work exemplifies that using deep learning we can unlock new types of systems for pulse recovery.
