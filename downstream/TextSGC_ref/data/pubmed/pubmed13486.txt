This research illuminates the perceptions of eighteen final year undergraduate pre-registration student nurses to understand what theoretical knowledge was perceived to be useful during their pre-registration nursing education and what was not. The research adopted a qualitative phenomenological approach and utilised a sample size of eighteen final year student nurses as the data source. The data collection method consisted of semi-structured interviews and the study took place at a Higher Education Institution within the North West of England approved to provide pre-registration nurse education. Participants provided their data during their final year of their undergraduate pre-registration nursing programme via semi-structured digitally recorded interviews which were transcribed verbatim. The transcribed interviews were then analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. The findings generated three themes these were; important knowledge to learn for everyday practice irrelevant for my future role and can we have some more? Findings demonstrate what aspects of the taught curriculum student nurses perceive to be of use to their practice and why they perceive this to be the case. This affects how student nurses approach their learning during their nursing education. In addition it was clear what participants perceived was not useful for their practice and why this was the case. Additionally participants offered suggestions of what they would also like adding to their curriculum and provided insights for what they would like adding to the curriculum which can be used for enhancing this. This is useful when developing future curricula to understand which aspects student nurses learn in a deep and superficial way. This can provide a useful insight for to ensure that patient care is not compromised. Final year pre-registration student nurses perceptions of which taught theoretical knowledge is important for practice.
