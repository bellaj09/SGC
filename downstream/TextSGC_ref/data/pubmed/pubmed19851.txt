A few years ago it could take several hours to complete a 3D image using a 3D workstation. Thanks to advances in computer science obtaining results of interest now requires only a few minutes. Many recent 3D workstations or multimedia computers are equipped with onboard 3D virtual patient modeling software which enables patient-specific preoperative assessment and virtual planning navigation and tool positioning. Although medical 3D imaging can now be conducted using various modalities including computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI positron emission tomography PET and ultrasonography US among others the highest quality images are obtained using CT data and CT images are now the most commonly used source of data for 3D simulation and navigation image. If the 2D source image is bad no amount of 3D image manipulation in software will provide a quality 3D image. In this exhibition the recent advances in CT imaging technique and 3D visualization of the hepatobiliary and pancreatic abnormalities are featured including scan and image reconstruction technique contrast-enhanced techniques new application of advanced CT scan techniques and new virtual reality simulation and navigation imaging. Recent advances in 3D computed tomography techniques for simulation and navigation in hepatobiliary pancreatic surgery.
