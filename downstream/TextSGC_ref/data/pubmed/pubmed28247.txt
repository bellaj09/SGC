In this study the feasibility of detecting a P300 via an asynchronous classification mode in a reactive EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI was evaluated. The P300 is one of the most popular BCI control signals and therefore used in many applications mostly for active communication purposes e.g. P300 speller. As the majority of all systems work with a stimulus-locked mode of classification synchronous the field of applications is limited. A new approach needs to be applied in a setting in which a stimulus-locked classification cannot be used due to the fact that the presented stimuli cannot be controlled or predicted by the system.
