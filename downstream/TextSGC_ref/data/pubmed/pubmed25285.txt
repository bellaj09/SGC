Enabling surgeon-educators to themselves create virtual reality VR training units promises greater variety specialization and relevance of the units. This paper describes a software bridge that semi-automates the scene-generation cycle a key bottleneck in authoring modeling and developing VR units. Augmenting an open source modeling environment with physical behavior attachment and collision specifications yields single-click testing of the full force-feedback enabled anatomical scene. Towards surgeon-authored VR training: the scene-development cycle.
