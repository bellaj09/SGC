There is a growing demand for monitors to provide high-quality visualization with more bits representing each rendered pixel. However since most existing images and videos are of low bit-depth LBD transforming LBD images to visually pleasant high bit-depth HBD versions is of significant value. Most existing bit-depth enhancement methods generate unsatisfactory HBD images with annoying false contour artifacts or blurry details and some algorithms are also time-consuming. To overcome these drawbacks we propose a bit-depth enhancement framework via concatenating all level features of deep neural networks DNNs. A novel deep learning network is proposed based on the deep convolutional variational auto-encoders VAEs and skip connections that concatenate every two layers are applied to pass low-level and high-level features to consequent layers easing the gradient vanishing problem. Meanwhile the proposed network is optimized to generate the residual between original images and its quantized ones which performs better than recovering HBD images directly. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can eliminate false contour artifacts of the recovered HBD images with low time consumption and can achieve dramatic restoration performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods both subjectively and objectively.
