Contemporary training in obstetrics and gynecology is aimed at the acquisition of a complex set of skills oriented to both the technical and personal aspects of patient care. The ability to create clinical simulations through virtual reality VR may facilitate the accomplishment of these goals. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold: 1 to review the circumstances and equipment in industry science and education in which VR has been successfully applied and 2 to explore the possible role of VR for training in obstetrics and gynecology and to suggest innovative and unique approaches to enhancing this training. How virtual reality may enhance training in obstetrics and gynecology.
