Molecular recognition features MoRFs usually act as "hub" sites in the interaction networks of intrinsically disordered proteins IDPs. Because an increasing number of serious diseases have been found to be associated with disordered proteins identifying MoRFs has become increasingly important. In this study we propose an ensemble learning strategy named MoRFPred_en to predict MoRFs from protein sequences. This approach combines four submodels that utilize different sequence-derived features for the prediction including a multichannel one-dimensional convolutional neural network CNN_1D multichannel based model two deep two-dimensional convolutional neural network DCNN_2D based models and a support vector machine SVM based model. When compared with other methods on the same datasets the MoRFPred_en approach produced better results than existing state-of-the-art MoRF prediction methods achieving an AUC of 0.762 on the VALIDATION419 dataset 0.795 on the TEST45 dataset and 0.776 on the TEST49 dataset.
