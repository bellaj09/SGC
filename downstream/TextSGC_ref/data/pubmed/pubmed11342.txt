Surgical site infection SSI following a neurosurgical operation is a complication that impacts morbidity mortality and economics. Currently machine learning ML algorithms are used for outcome prediction in various neurosurgical aspects. The implementation of ML algorithms to learn from medical data may help in obtaining prognostic information on diseases especially SSIs. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of various ML models for predicting surgical infection after neurosurgical operations. Machine learning applications for the prediction of surgical site infection in neurological operations.
