Recently developed effective methods for detection commands of steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI that need calibration for visual stimuli which cause more time and fatigue prior to the use as the number of commands increases. This paper develops a novel unsupervised method based on canonical correlation analysis CCA for accurate detection of stimulus frequency. Unsupervised frequency-recognition method of SSVEPs using a filter bank implementation of binary subband CCA.
