"This study investigated the self-regulatory behaviors of arts students namely memory strategy goal-setting self-evaluation seeking assistance environmental structuring learning responsibility and planning and organizing. We also explored approaches to learning including deep approach DA and surface approach SA in a comparison between students professional training and English learning. The participants consisted of 344 arts majors. The Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire and the Revised Learning Process Questionnaire were adopted to examine students self-regulatory behaviors and their approaches to learning. The results show that a positive and significant correlation was found in students self-regulatory behaviors between professional training and English learning. The results indicated that increases in using self-regulatory behaviors in professional training were associated with increases in applying self-regulatory behaviors in learning English. Seeking assistance self-evaluation and planning and organizing were significant predictors for learning English. In addition arts students used the deep approach more often than the surface approach in both their professional training and English learning. A positive correlation was found in DA whereas a negative correlation was shown in SA between students self-regulatory behaviors and their approaches to learning. Students with high self-regulation adopted a deep approach and they applied the surface approach less in professional training and English learning. In addition a SEM model confirmed that DA had a positive influence; however SA had a negative influence on self-regulatory behaviors."
