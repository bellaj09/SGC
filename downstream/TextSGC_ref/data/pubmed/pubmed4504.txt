A major challenge in neuroscience is to accurately decipher in vivo the entire brain circuitry connectome at a microscopic level. Currently the only methodology providing a global noninvasive window into structural brain connectivity is diffusion tractography. The extent to which the reconstructed pathways reflect realistic neuronal networks depends however on data acquisition and postprocessing factors. Through a unique combination of approaches we designed and evaluated herein a framework for reliable fiber tracking and mapping of the living mouse brain connectome. One important wiring scheme connecting gray matter regions and passing fiber-crossing areas was closely examined: the lemniscal thalamocortical TC pathway. We quantitatively validated the TC projections inferred from in vivo tractography with correlative histological axonal tracing in the same wild-type and reeler mutant mice. We demonstrated noninvasively that changes in patterning of the cortical sheet such as highly disorganized cortical lamination in reeler led to spectacular compensatory remodeling of the TC pathway.
