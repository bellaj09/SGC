Most of the current blind stereoscopic image quality assessment SIQA algorithms cannot show reliable accuracy. One reason is that they do not have the deep architectures and the other reason is that they are designed on the relatively weak biological basis compared with findings on human visual system HVS. In this paper we propose a Deep Edge and COlor Signal INtegrity Evaluator DECOSINE based on the whole visual perception route from eyes to the frontal lobe and especially focus on edge and color signal processing in retinal ganglion cells RGC and lateral geniculate nucleus LGN. Furthermore to model the complex and deep structure of the visual cortex Segmented Stacked Auto-encoder S-SAE is used which has not utilized for SIQA before. The utilization of the S-SAE complements weakness of deep learning-based SIQA metrics that require a very long training time. Experiments are conducted on popular SIQA databases and the superiority of DECOSINE in terms of prediction accuracy and monotonicity is proved. The experimental results show that our model about the whole visual perception route and utilization of S-SAE are effective for SIQA.
