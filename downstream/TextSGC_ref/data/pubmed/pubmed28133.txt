Advances in electrophysiological methods such as electrocorticography ECoG have enabled researchers to decode phonemes syllables and words from brain activity. The ultimate aspiration underlying these efforts is the development of a brain-machine interface BMI that will enable speakers to produce real-time naturalistic speech. In the effort to create such a device researchers have typically followed a bottom-up approach whereby low-level units of language e.g. phonemes syllables or letters are decoded from articulation areas e.g. premotor cortex with the aim of assembling these low-level units into words and sentences. Brain-to-speech decoding will require linguistic and pragmatic data.
