The pathogenic factors of the complex epidemic disorder-obesity have expanded from genetic background endocrine factors abnormal feeding behaviors and direct neural control of adipose tissue physiology. As a chronic metabolic disease it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain increased adipocyte size and surprisingly anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced obesity. For a short-term 3-week co-treatment metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet ND HFD and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut microbiota including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut microbiota cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.
