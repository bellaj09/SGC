"In this paper we propose an unsupervised feature learning method called deep binary descriptor with multi-quantization DBD-MQ for visual analysis. Existing learning-based binary descriptors such as compact binary face descriptor CBFD and DeepBit utilize the rigid sign function for binarization despite of data distributions which usually suffer from severe quantization loss. In order to address the limitation we propose a deep multi-quantization network to learn a data-dependent binarization in an unsupervised manner. More specifically we design a K-Autoencoders KAEs network to jointly learn the parameters of feature extractor and the binarization functions under a deep learning framework so that discriminative binary descriptors can be obtained with a fine-grained multi-quantization. As DBD-MQ simply allocates the same number of quantizers to each real-valued feature dimension ignoring the elementwise diversity of informativeness we further propose a deep competitive binary descriptor with multi-quantization DCBD-MQ method to learn optimal allocation of bits with the fixed binary length in a competitive manner where informative dimensions gain more bits for complete representation. Moreover we present a similarity-aware binary encoding strategy based on the earth movers distance of Autoencoders so that elements that are quantized into similar Autoencoders will have smaller Hamming distances. Extensive experimental results on six widely-used datasets show that our DBD-MQ and DCBD-MQ outperform most state-of-the-art unsupervised binary descriptors."
