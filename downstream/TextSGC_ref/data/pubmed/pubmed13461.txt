Automatic and accurate estimation of disease severity is essential for food security disease management and yield loss prediction. Deep learning the latest breakthrough in computer vision is promising for fine-grained disease severity classification as the method avoids the labor-intensive feature engineering and threshold-based segmentation. Using the apple black rot images in the PlantVillage dataset which are further annotated by botanists with four severity stages as ground truth a series of deep convolutional neural networks are trained to diagnose the severity of the disease. The performances of shallow networks trained from scratch and deep models fine-tuned by transfer learning are evaluated systemically in this paper. The best model is the deep VGG16 model trained with transfer learning which yields an overall accuracy of 90.4% on the hold-out test set. The proposed deep learning model may have great potential in disease control for modern agriculture. Automatic Image-Based Plant Disease Severity Estimation Using Deep Learning.
