"Accurate biomechanical characteristics of tissues are essential for developing realistic virtual reality surgical simulators utilizing haptic devices. Surgical simulation technology has progressed rapidly but without a large database of soft tissue mechanical properties with which to incorporate. The device described here is a computer-controlled motorized endoscopic grasper capable of applying surgically relevant levels of force to tissue in vivo and measuring the tissues force-deformation properties." Computer-controlled motorized endoscopic grasper for in vivo measurement of soft tissue biomechanical characteristics.
