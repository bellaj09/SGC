Intentions including their temporal properties and semantic content are receiving increased attention and neuroscientific studies in humans vary with respect to the topography of intention-related neural responses. This may reflect the fact that the kind of intentions investigated in one study may not be exactly the same kind investigated in the other. Fine-grained intention taxonomies developed in the philosophy of mind may be useful to identify the neural correlates of well-defined types of intentions as well as to disentangle them from other related mental states such as mere urges to perform an action. Intention-related neural signals may be exploited by brain-machine interfaces BMIs that are currently being developed to restore speech and motor control in paralyzed patients. Such BMI devices record the brain activity of the agent interpret "decode" the agent\s intended action and send the corresponding execution command to an artificial effector system e.g. a computer cursor or a robotic arm. In the present paper we evaluate the potential of intention concepts from philosophy of mind to improve the performance and safety of BMIs based on higher-order intention-related control signals. To this end we address the distinction between future- present-directed and motor intentions as well as the organization of intentions in time specifically to what extent it is sequential or hierarchical. This has consequences as to whether these different types of intentions can be expected to occur simultaneously or not. We further illustrate how it may be useful or even necessary to distinguish types of intentions exposited in philosophy including yes- vs. no-intentions and oblique vs. direct intentions to accurately decode the agent\s intentions from neural signals in practical BMI applications.
