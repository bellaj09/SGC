Humans need communication. The desire to communicate remains one of the primary issues for people with locked-in syndrome LIS. While many assistive and augmentative communication systems that use various physiological signals are available commercially the need is not satisfactorily met. Brain interfaces in particular those that utilize event related potentials ERP in electroencephalography EEG to detect the intent of a person noninvasively are emerging as a promising communication interface to meet this need where existing options are insufficient. Existing brain interfaces for typing use many repetitions of the visual stimuli in order to increase accuracy at the cost of speed. However speed is also crucial and is an integral portion of peer-to-peer communication; a message that is not delivered timely often looses its importance. Consequently we utilize rapid serial visual presentation RSVP in conjunction with language models in order to assist letter selection during the brain-typing process with the final goal of developing a system that achieves high accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper presents initial results from the RSVP Keyboard system that is under development. These initial results on healthy and locked-in subjects show that single-trial or few-trial accurate letter selection may be possible with the RSVP Keyboard paradigm.
