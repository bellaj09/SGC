Brain atlases have a wide range of use from education to research to clinical applications. Mathematical methods as well as computational methods and tools play a major role in the process of brain atlas building and developing atlas-based applications. Computational methods and tools cover three areas: dedicated editors for brain model creation brain navigators supporting multiple platforms and atlas-assisted specific applications. Mathematical methods in atlas building and developing atlas-aided applications deal with problems in image segmentation geometric body modelling physical modelling atlas-to-scan registration visualisation interaction and virtual reality. Here I overview computational and mathematical methods in atlas building and developing atlas-assisted applications and share my contribution to and experience in this field. Computational and mathematical methods in brain atlasing.
