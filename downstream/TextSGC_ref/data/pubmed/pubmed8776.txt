Pedicle screw fixation is a challenging procedure with a concerning rates of reoperation. After insertion of the screws is completed the most common intraoperative verification approach is to acquire anterior-posterior and lateral radiographic images based on which the surgeons try to visually assess the correctness of insertion. Given the limited accuracy of the existing verification techniques we identified the need for an accurate and automated pedicle screw assessment system that can verify the screw insertion intraoperatively. For doing so this paper offers a framework for automatic segmentation and pose estimation of pedicle screws based on deep learning principles. A deep learning framework for segmentation and pose estimation of pedicle screw implants based on C-arm fluoroscopy.
