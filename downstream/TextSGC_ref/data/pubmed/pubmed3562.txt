The neuroimaging literature provides compelling evidence for functional dysconnectivity in people with psychosis. However it is likely that at least some of the observed alterations represent secondary effects of illness chronicity and/or antipsychotic medication. In addition the extent to which these alterations are specific to psychosis or represent a transdiagnostic feature of psychiatric illness remains unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the diagnostic specificity of functional dysconnectivity in drug-nave first-episode psychosis FEP. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional connectivity analysis to estimate network-level connectivity in 50 patients with FEP 50 patients with major depressive disorder MDD 50 patients with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD and 122 healthy controls HCs. The FEP MDD and PTSD groups showed reductions in intranetwork connectivity of the default mode network relative to the HC group p<0.05 corrected; therefore intranetwork alterations were expressed across the three diagnostic groups. In addition the FEP group showed heightened internetwork connectivity between the default mode network particularly the anterior cingulate cortex and the central executive network relative to the MDD PTSD and HC groups p<0.05 corrected; therefore internetwork alterations were specific to the FEP. These findings suggest that network-level alterations are present in individuals with a first episode of psychosis who have not been exposed to antipsychotic medication. In addition they suggest a dissociation between aberrant internetwork connectivity as a distinctive feature of psychosis and aberrant intranetwork connectivity as a transdiagnostic feature of psychiatric illness.
