The rapid evolution of telecommunication technology has enabled advances to be made in low cost video-conferencing through the improvement of high speed computer communication networks and the enhancement of Internet security protocols. As a result of this progress eHealth education programs are becoming a reality in universities providing the opportunity for students to have greater interaction at live surgery classes by means of virtual participation. Undergraduate students can be introduced to new concepts of medical care remote second opinion and to telecommunication systems whilst virtually experiencing surgical procedures and lectures. The better access this provides to the operating theater environment the patient and the surgeon can improve the learning process for students. An analogical system was used for this experimental pilot project due to the benefits of it being low cost with a comparatively easy setup. The tele-surgery lectures were also transmitted to other universities by means of a Pentium 4 computer using open source software and connected to a portable image acquisition device located in the So Lucas University Hospital. Telemedicine technology has proven to be an important instrument for the improvement of medical education and health care. This study allowed health professionals professors and students to have greater interaction during surgical procedures thus enabling a greater opportunity for knowledge exchange. Tele-surgery: a new virtual tool for medical education.
