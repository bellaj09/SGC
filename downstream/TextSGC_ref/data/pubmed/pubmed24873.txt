"Mastery of lateral skull base LSB surgery requires thorough knowledge of complex 3-dimensional 3D microanatomy and techniques. While supervised operation under binocular microscopy remains the training gold standard concerns over operative time and patient safety often limit novice surgeons stereoscopic exposure. Furthermore most alternative educational resources cannot meet this need. Here we present proof of concept for a tool that combines 3D-operative video with an interactive stereotactic teaching environment. Stereoscopic video was recorded with a microscope during translabyrinthine approaches for vestibular schwannoma. Digital imaging and communications in medicine DICOM temporal bone computed tomography images were segmented using 3D-Slicer. Files were rendered using a game engine software built for desktop virtual reality. The resulting simulation was an interactive immersion combining a 3D operative perspective from the lead surgeons chair with virtual reality temporal bone models capable of hands-on manipulation label toggling and transparency modification. This novel tool may alter LSB training paradigms." Combining Stereoscopic Video and Virtual Reality Simulation to Maximize Education in Lateral Skull Base Surgery.
