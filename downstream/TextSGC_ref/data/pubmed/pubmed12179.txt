Knowledge of protein functions plays an important role in biology and medicine. With the rapid development of highthroughput technologies a huge number of proteins have been discovered. However there are a great number of proteins without functional annotations. A protein usually has multiple functions and some functions or biological processes require interactions of a plurality of proteins. Additionally Gene Ontology provides a useful classification for protein functions and contains more than 40000 terms. We propose a deep learning framework called DeepGOA to predict protein functions with protein sequences and protein-protein interaction PPI networks. For protein sequences we extract two types of information: sequence semantic information and subsequence-based features. We use the word2vec technique to numerically represent protein sequences and utilize a Bi-directional Long and Short Time Memory Bi-LSTM and multi-scale convolutional neural network multi-scale CNN to obtain the global and local semantic features of protein sequences respectively. Additionally we use the InterPro tool to scan protein sequences for extracting subsequence-based information such as domains and motifs. Then the information is plugged into a neural network to generate high-quality features. For the PPI network the Deepwalk algorithm is applied to generate its embedding information of PPI. Then the two types of features are concatenated together to predict protein functions. To evaluate the performance of DeepGOA several different evaluation methods and metrics are utilized. The experimental results show that DeepGOA outperforms DeepGO and BLAST. A deep learning framework for gene ontology annotations with sequence - and network-based information.
