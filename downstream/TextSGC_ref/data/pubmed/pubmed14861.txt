White matter lesions are non-static brain lesions that have a prevalence rate up to 98% in the elderly population. Because they may be associated with several brain diseases it is important that they are detected as soon as possible. Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI provides three-dimensional data with the possibility to detect and emphasize contrast differences in soft tissues providing rich information about the human soft tissue anatomy. However the amount of data provided for these images is far too much for manual analysis/interpretation representing a difficult and time-consuming task for specialists. This work presents a computational methodology capable of detecting regions of white matter lesions of the brain in MRI of FLAIR modality. The techniques highlighted in this methodology are SLIC0 clustering for candidate segmentation and convolutional neural networks for candidate classification. Detection of white matter lesion regions in MRI using SLIC0 and convolutional neural network.
