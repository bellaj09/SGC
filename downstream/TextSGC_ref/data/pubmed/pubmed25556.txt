Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot ToF leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement has become a reality. However predicting a secure atraumatic implantation of a catheter-based device remains a significant challenge due to the complex and dynamic nature of the right ventricular outflow tract RVOT. We sought to quantify the differences in compression and volume for actual implants and those predicted by pre-implant modeling. Toward predictive modeling of catheter-based pulmonary valve replacement into native right ventricular outflow tracts.
