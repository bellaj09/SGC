Phages and plasmids are the major components of mobile genetic elements and fragments from such elements generally co-exist with chromosome-derived fragments in sequenced metagenomic data. However there is a lack of efficient methods that can simultaneously identify phages and plasmids in metagenomic data and the existing tools identifying either phages or plasmids have not yet presented satisfactory performance. PPR-Meta: a tool for identifying phages and plasmids from metagenomic fragments using deep learning.
