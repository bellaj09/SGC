Riven by ideology religion and mistrust the world seems more fragmented than at any time since arguably World War II. But however deep the political divisions business operations continue to span the globe and executives still have to figure out how to run them efficiently and well.

In the volatile world of transnational corporations there is no such thing as a "universal" global manager the authors say. Rather there are three groups of specialists: business managers country managers and functional managers. And there are the top executives at corporate headquarters who manage the complex interactions between the three--and can identify and develop the talented executives a successful transnational requires. This kind of organizational structure characterizes a transnational rather than an old-line multinational international or global company. Transnationals integrate assets resources and diverse people in operating units around the world. Through a flexible management process in which business country and functional managers form a triad of different perspectives that balance one another transnational companies can build three strategic capabilities: global-scale efficiency and competitiveness; national-level responsiveness and flexibility; and cross-market capacity to leverage learning on a worldwide basis. Through a close look at the successful careers of Leif Johansson of Electrolux Howard Gottlieb of NEC and Wahib Zaki of Procter & Gamble the authors illustrate the skills that each managerial specialist requires.
