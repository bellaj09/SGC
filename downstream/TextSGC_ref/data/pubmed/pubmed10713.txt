Diabetes mellitus DM is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal blood glucose BG regulation that might result in short and long-term health complications and even death if not properly managed. Currently there is no cure for diabetes. However self-management of the disease especially keeping BG in the recommended range is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG levels and managing physical activity diet and insulin intake. The recent advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard the development of an artificial pancreas a closed-loop system personalized decision systems and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such as predicting BG modeling of a personalized profile and modeling BG dynamics are central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in diabetes research.
