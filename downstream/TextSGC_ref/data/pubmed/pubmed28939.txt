Learning has been associated with changes in the brain at every level of organization. However it remains difficult to establish a causal link between specific changes in the brain and new behavioral abilities. We establish that new neural activity patterns emerge with learning. We demonstrate that these new neural activity patterns cause the new behavior. Thus the formation of new patterns of neural population activity can underlie the learning of new skills. New neural activity patterns emerge with long-term learning.
