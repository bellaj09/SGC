High-efficiency lung nodule detection dramatically contributes to the risk assessment of lung cancer. It is a significant and challenging task to quickly locate the exact positions of lung nodules. Extensive work has been done by researchers around this domain for approximately two decades. However previous computer-aided detection CADe schemes are mostly intricate and time-consuming since they may require more image processing modules such as the computed tomography image transformation the lung nodule segmentation and the feature extraction to construct a whole CADe system. It is difficult for these schemes to process and analyze enormous data when the medical images continue to increase. Besides some state of the art deep learning schemes may be strict in the standard of database. This study proposes an effective lung nodule detection scheme based on multigroup patches cut out from the lung images which are enhanced by the Frangi filter. Through combining two groups of images a four-channel convolution neural networks model is designed to learn the knowledge of radiologists for detecting nodules of four levels. This CADe scheme can acquire the sensitivity of 80.06% with 4.7 false positives per scan and the sensitivity of 94% with 15.1 false positives per scan. The results demonstrate that the multigroup patch-based learning system is efficient to improve the performance of lung nodule detection and greatly reduce the false positives under a huge amount of image data.
