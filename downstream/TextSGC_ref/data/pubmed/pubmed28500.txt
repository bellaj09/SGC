"Brain computer interfaces are devices that collect signals from a subjects cortical surface and interpret these signals to control a computer Recently much development has been done on these devices with the help of epilepsy patients and the clinical staff who treat these patients. The types of data collected from epilepsy patients particularly the invasive data give a unique opportunity to researchers in this area. The clinical staff has a unique opportunity to use the treatment of one patient population to help another." Brain computer interface BCI tools developed in a clinical environment.
