"Spiritual practice such as prayer or meditation is associated with focusing attention on internal states and self-awareness processes. As these cognitive control mechanisms presumably are also important for neurofeedback NF we investigated whether people who pray frequently N = 20 show a higher ability of self-control over their own brain activity compared to a control group of individuals who rarely pray N = 20. All participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI and one session of sensorimotor rhythm SMR 12-15 Hz based NF training. Individuals who reported a high frequency of prayer showed improved NF performance compared to individuals who reported a low frequency of prayer. The individual ability to control ones own brain activity was related to volumetric aspects of the brain. In the low frequency of prayer group gray matter volumes in the right insula and inferior frontal gyrus were positively associated with NF performance supporting prior findings that more general self-control networks are involved in successful NF learning. In contrast participants who prayed regularly showed a negative association between gray matter volume in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex Brodmanns area BA 10 and NF performance. Due to their regular spiritual practice they might have been more skillful in gating incoming information provided by the NF system and avoiding task-irrelevant thoughts."
