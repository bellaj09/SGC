"The paper starts by analyzing recent advancements in neurotechnological assessment of residual consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness and in neurotechnology-mediated communication with them. Ethical issues arising from these developments are described with particular focus on informed consent. Against this background we argue for the necessity of further scientific efforts and ethical reflection in neurotechnological assessment of consciousness and cerebral communication with verbally non-communicative patients." Externalization of consciousness. Scientific possibilities and clinical implications.
