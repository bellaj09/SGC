Psychotic patients have poorer health behaviours including poor diets and sedentary lifestyles increasing their risk for obesity diabetes hypertension and dyslipidaemia and tend to have a shorter life expectancy as compared to nonpsychiatric populations. Lifestyle intervention programmes that target modifiable risk factors in such patients have produced uneven results. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a package of health promotion strategies to improve diet and physical exercise in psychotic patients. Our hypothesis was that a pre- to post-treatment improvement in physical activity and dietary habits would occur in the group receiving intervention.
