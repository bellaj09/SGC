Severe obesity has been associated with numerous comorbidities and reduced health-related quality of life HRQoL. Although many studies have reported changes in HRQoL after bariatric surgery few were long-term prospective studies. We examined the performance of the convolution neural network CNN for predicting 5-year HRQoL after bariatric surgery based on the available preoperative information from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry SOReg. CNN was used to predict the 5-year HRQoL after bariatric surgery in a training dataset and evaluated in a test dataset. In general performance of the CNN model measured as mean squared error MSE increased with more convolution layer filters computation units and epochs and decreased with a larger batch size. The CNN model showed an overwhelming advantage in predicting all the HRQoL measures. The MSEs of the CNN model for training data were 8% to 80% smaller than those of the linear regression model. When the models were evaluated using the test data the CNN model performed better than the linear regression model. However the issue of overfitting was apparent in the CNN model. We concluded that the performance of the CNN is better than the traditional multivariate linear regression model in predicting long-term HRQoL after bariatric surgery; however the overfitting issue needs to be mitigated using more features or more patients to train the model.
