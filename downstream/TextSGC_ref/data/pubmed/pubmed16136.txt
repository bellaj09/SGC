Since the advent of super-resolution microscopy countless approaches and studies have been published contributing significantly to our understanding of cellular processes. With the aid of chromatin-specific fluorescence labeling techniques we are gaining increasing insight into gene regulation and chromatin organization. Combined with super-resolution imaging and data analysis these labeling techniques enable direct assessment not only of chromatin interactions but also of the function of specific chromatin conformational states.
