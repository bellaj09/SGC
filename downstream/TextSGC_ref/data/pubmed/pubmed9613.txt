Pooling is a key mechanism in deep convolutional neural networks CNNs which helps to achieve translation invariance. Numerous studies both empirically and theoretically show that pooling consistently boosts the performance of the CNNs. The conventional pooling methods are operated on activation values. In this work we alternatively propose rank-based pooling. It is derived from the observations that ranking list is invariant under changes of activation values in a pooling region and thus rank-based pooling operation may achieve more robust performance. In addition the reasonable usage of rank can avoid the scale problems encountered by value-based methods. The novel pooling mechanism can be regarded as an instance of weighted pooling where a weighted sum of activations is used to generate the pooling output. This pooling mechanism can also be realized as rank-based average pooling RAP rank-based weighted pooling RWP and rank-based stochastic pooling RSP according to different weighting strategies. As another major contribution we present a novel criterion to analyze the discriminant ability of various pooling methods which is heavily under-researched in machine learning and computer vision community. Experimental results on several image benchmarks show that rank-based pooling outperforms the existing pooling methods in classification performance. We further demonstrate better performance on CIFAR datasets by integrating RSP into Network-in-Network. Rank-based pooling for deep convolutional neural networks.
