P300 is an event related potential of the brain in response to oddball events. Brain Computer Interface BCI utilizing P300 is known as a P300 BCI system. A conventional P300 BCI system for character spelling is composed of a paradigm that displays flashing characters and a classification scheme which identifies target characters. To type a word a user has to spell each character of the word: this spelling process is slow and it can take several minutes to type a word. In this study we propose a new word typing scheme by integrating a word suggestion mechanism with a dictionary search into the conventional P300-based speller. Our new P300-based word typing system consists of an initial character spelling paradigm a dictionary unit to give suggestions of possible words and the second word selection paradigm to select a word out of the suggestions. Our proposed methodology reduces typing time significantly and makes word typing easy via a P300 BCI system. We have tested our system with ten subjects and our results demonstrate an average word typing time of 1.91 min whereas the conventional took 3.36 min for the same words.
