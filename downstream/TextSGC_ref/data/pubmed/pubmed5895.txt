"Tracking individual-cell/object over time is important in understanding drug treatment effects on cancer cells and video surveillance. A fundamental problem of individual-cell/object tracking is to simultaneously address the cell/object appearance variations caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this paper inspired by the architecture of deep learning we propose a robust feature learning method for constructing discriminative appearance models without large-scale pretraining. Specifically in the initial frames an unsupervised method is firstly used to learn the abstract feature of a target by exploiting both classic principal component analysis PCA algorithms with recent deep learning representation architectures. We use learned PCA eigenvectors as filters and develop a novel algorithm to represent a target by composing of a PCA-based filter bank layer a nonlinear layer and a patch-based pooling layer respectively. Then based on the feature representation a neural network with one hidden layer is trained in a supervised mode to construct a discriminative appearance model. Finally to alleviate the tracker drifting problem a sample update scheme is carefully designed to keep track of the most representative and diverse samples during tracking. We test the proposed tracking method on two standard individual cell/object tracking benchmarks to show our trackers state-of-the-art performance."
