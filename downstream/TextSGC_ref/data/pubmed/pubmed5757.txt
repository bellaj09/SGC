In this paper we address the hyperspectral image HSI classification task with a generative adversarial network and conditional random field GAN-CRF-based framework which integrates a semisupervised deep learning and a probabilistic graphical model and make three contributions. First we design four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second we construct semisupervised generative adversarial networks GANs to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through adversarial training. Third we build dense conditional random fields CRFs on top of the random variables that are initialized to the softmax predictions of the trained GANs and are conditioned on HSIs to refine classification maps. This semisupervised framework leverages the merits of discriminative and generative models through a game-theoretical approach. Moreover even though we used very small numbers of labeled training HSI samples from the two most challenging and extensively studied datasets the experimental results demonstrated that spectral-spatial GAN-CRF SS-GAN-CRF models achieved top-ranking accuracy for semisupervised HSI classification.
