"Connectome-based modeling of large-scale brain network dynamics enables causal in silico interrogation of the brains structure-function relationship necessitating the close integration of diverse neuroinformatics fields. Here we extend the open-source simulation software The Virtual Brain TVB to whole mouse brain network modeling based on individual diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI-based or tracer-based detailed mouse connectomes. We provide practical examples on how to use The Virtual Mouse Brain TVMB to simulate brain activity such as seizure propagation and the switching behavior of the resting state dynamics in health and disease. TVMB enables theoretically driven experimental planning and ways to test predictions in the numerous strains of mice available to study brain function in normal and pathological conditions."
