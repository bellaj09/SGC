"Objective: The progression of chronic kidney disease can directly affect patients health-related quality of life HRQoL. Exercise training is a good option to reverse the impacts caused by the disease. To escape from the monotonous routine and stimulate further practice the therapist should consider making physical activity more playful. Using videogames during exercise training is possible to rehabilitate the patient aiming for fun beyond the organic condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise training combined with Virtual Reality VR in functionality and HRQoL of patients on hemodialysis. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study in which control group n\u2009=\u200920 maintained only hemodialysis without any physical effort or intervention from the researchers and intervention group n\u2009=\u200920 who performed endurance and strength physical exercises in combination with VR during hemodialysis for 12 weeks. All eligible patients underwent a familiarization of games and were evaluated by an investigator-blind for functional capacity quality of life and depressive symptoms. Functional capacity tests included walking speed timed up and go TUG and Duke Activity Status Index DASI. To evaluate a HRQoL Kidney Disease and Quality-of-Life Short-Form KDQOL-SF v. 1.3 was used and to investigate depressive symptoms the Center for Epidemiological Scale-Depression. Paired sample t-tests were conducted to determine differences within each group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance group vs. time was used to assess group differences in our major outcomes. The level of significance was 5%. Results: The exercise improved functional capacity TUG: P\u2009=\u20090.002 DASI: P\u2009<\u20090.001 and HRQoL in physical and specific domains: physical functioning P\u2009=\u20090.047 role physical P\u2009=\u20090.021 as well as in physical composite summary P\u2009<\u20090.001 and effects of kidney disease P\u2009=\u20090.013. There was no influence on depressive symptoms P\u2009=\u20090.154. Conclusion: Physical training combined with VR improved functional capacity and some quality-of-life domains of hemodialysis patients."
