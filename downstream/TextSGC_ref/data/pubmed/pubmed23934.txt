Virtual reality surgical simulators have proven value in the acquisition and assessment of laparoscopic skills. In this study we investigated skill transfer from a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator into the operating room using a blinded randomised controlled trial design. Surgical trainees using the LapSim System performed significantly better at their first real-world attempt at a laparoscopic task than their colleagues who had not received similar training as measured independently by a number of expert surgical observers using four criteria. Skills acquired on virtual reality laparoscopic simulators transfer into the operating room in a blinded randomised controlled trial.
