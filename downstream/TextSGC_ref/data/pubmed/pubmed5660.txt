Semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization is a technique that learns a low-dimensional representation of a dataset that lends itself to a clustering interpretation. It is possible that the mapping between this new representation and our original data matrix contains rather complex hierarchical information with implicit lower-level hidden attributes that classical one level clustering methodologies cannot interpret. In this work we propose a novel model Deep Semi-NMF that is able to learn such hidden representations that allow themselves to an interpretation of clustering according to different unknown attributes of a given dataset. We also present a semi-supervised version of the algorithm named Deep WSF that allows the use of partial prior information for each of the known attributes of a dataset that allows the model to be used on datasets with mixed attribute knowledge. Finally we show that our models are able to learn low-dimensional representations that are better suited for clustering but also classification outperforming Semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization but also other state-of-the-art methodologies variants.
