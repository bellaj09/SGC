Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD has been associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity rs-FC of several brain regions within the salience SN and default-mode DMN networks including the hippocampus. However most rs-FC studies have not focused primarily on the hippocampus nor have they appreciated its structural heterogeneity despite clear evidence for a dissociation between posterior and anterior hippocampal connectivity. Here we examine rs-FC of anterior and posterior hippocampus with key regions in the SN amygdala insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area and DMN ventromedial prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus previously implicated in PTSD using a seed-based approach. Resting-state magnetic resonance images were obtained from 48 PTSD patients and 34 trauma-exposed healthy participants TEHC. Results indicated no group differences when examining the hippocampus as a whole. However examining the anterior and posterior hippocampus revealed a loss of anterior to posterior connectivity differentiation in PTSD patients. The PTSD group also demonstrated lower negative connectivity of the posterior hippocampus-precuneus pathway compared with the TEHC group. Finally as differences in anterior and posterior hippocampus connectivity have been also related to age we performed a secondary analysis exploring the association between age and posterior- and anterior-hippocampus connectivity in both groups. Results showed that among PTSD patients increased age had the effect of normalizing posterior hippocampus-precuneus and hippocampus-posterior cingulate cortex connectivity whereas no such effect was noted for the control group. These findings highlight the need for PTSD connectivity research to consider sub-parts of the hippocampus and to account for age-related connectivity differences.
