"Energy consumption is an important issue in continuous wireless telemonitoring of physiological signals. Compressed sensing CS is a promising framework to address it due to its energy-efficient data compression procedure. However most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to nonsparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse Bayesian learning BSBL is an effective approach to recover such signals with satisfactory recovery quality. However it is time-consuming in recovering multichannel signals since its computational load almost linearly increases with the number of channels. This work proposes a spatiotemporal sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to recover multichannel signals simultaneously. It not only exploits temporal correlation within each channel signal but also exploits inter-channel correlation among different channel signals. Furthermore its computational load is not significantly affected by the number of channels. The proposed algorithm was applied to brain computer interface BCI and EEG-based drivers drowsiness estimation. Results showed that the algorithm had both better recovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL. Particularly the proposed algorithm ensured that the BCI classification and the drowsiness estimation had little degradation even when data were compressed by 80% making it very suitable for continuous wireless telemonitoring of multichannel signals."
