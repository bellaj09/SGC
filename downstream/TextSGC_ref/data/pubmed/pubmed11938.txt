Deep learning-based image compressors are actively being explored in an effort to supersede conventional image compression algorithms such as JPEG. Conventional and deep learning-based compression algorithms focus on minimizing image fidelity errors in the nonlinear standard RGB sRGB color space. However for many computer vision tasks the sensor\s linear raw-RGB image is desirable. Recent work has shown that the original raw-RGB image can be reconstructed using only small amounts of metadata embedded inside the JPEG image 1. However 1 relied on the conventional JPEG encoding that is unaware of the raw-RGB reconstruction task. In this paper we examine the ability of deep image compressors to be "aware" of the additional objective of raw reconstruction. Towards this goal we describe a general framework that enables deep networks targeting image compression to jointly consider both image fidelity errors and raw reconstruction errors. We describe this approach in two scenarios: 1 the network is trained from scratch using our proposed joint loss and 2 a network originally trained only for sRGB fidelity loss is later fine-tuned to incorporate our raw reconstruction loss. When compared to sRGB fidelity-only compression our combined loss leads to appreciable improvements in PSNR of the raw reconstruction with only minor impact on sRGB fidelity as measured by MS-SSIM.
