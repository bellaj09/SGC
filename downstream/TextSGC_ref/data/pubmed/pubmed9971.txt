A workshop on research gaps and opportunities for Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Disease was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases on July 24 2019 in Pittsburgh. The workshop included an overview lecture on precision medicine in cancer and 4 sessions: 1 general considerations for the application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence; 2 omics the combination of risk factors and biomarkers; 3 precision imaging; and 4 gaps barriers and needs to move from precision to personalized medicine for pancreatic disease. Current precision medicine approaches and tools were reviewed and participants identified knowledge gaps and research needs that hinder bringing precision medicine to pancreatic diseases. Most critical were a multicenter efforts to collect large-scale patient data sets from multiple data streams in the context of environmental and social factors; b new information systems that can collect annotate and quantify data to inform disease mechanisms; c novel prospective clinical trial designs to test and improve therapies; and d a framework for measuring and assessing the value of proposed approaches to the health care system. With these advances precision medicine can identify patients early in the course of their pancreatic disease and prevent progression to chronic or fatal illness.
