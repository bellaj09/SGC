The Connectomes Related to Human Diseases CRHD initiative was developed with the Human Connectome Project HCP to provide high-resolution open-access multi-modal MRI data to better understand the neural correlates of human disease. Here we present an introduction to a CRHD project the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety BANDA study which is collecting multimodal neuroimaging clinical and neuropsychological data from 225 adolescents ages 14-17 150 of whom are expected to have a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Our transdiagnostic recruitment approach samples the full spectrum of depressed/anxious symptoms and their comorbidity consistent with NIMH Research Domain Criteria RDoC. We focused on an age range that is critical for brain development and for the onset of mental illness. This project sought to harmonize imaging sequences hardware and functional tasks with other HCP studies although some changes were made to canonical HCP methods to accommodate our study population and questions. We present a thorough overview of our imaging sequences hardware and scanning protocol. We detail similarities and differences between this study and other HCP studies. We evaluate structural- diffusion- and functional-image-quality measures that may be influenced by clinical factors e.g. disorder symptomatology. Signal-to-noise and motion estimates from the first 140 adolescents suggest minimal influence of clinical factors on image quality. We anticipate enrollment of an additional 85 participants most of whom are expected to have a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Clinical and neuropsychological data from the first 140 participants are currently freely available through the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive NDA.
