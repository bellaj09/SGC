The human brain is a complex container of interconnected networks. Network neuroscience is a recent venture aiming to explore the connection matrix built from the human brain or human "Connectome." Network-based algorithms provide parameters that define global organization of the brain; when they are applied to electroencephalographic EEG signals network configuration and excitability can be monitored in millisecond time frames providing remarkable information on their instantaneous efficacy also for a given task\s performance via online evaluation of the underlying instantaneous networks before during and after the task. Here we provide an updated summary on the connectome analysis for the prediction of performance via the study of task-related dynamics of brain network organization from EEG signals.
