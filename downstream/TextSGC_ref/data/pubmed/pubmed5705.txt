Cerebral micro-bleedings CMBs are small chronic brain hemorrhages that have many side effects. For example CMBs can result in long-term disability neurologic dysfunction cognitive impairment and side effects from other medications and treatment. Therefore it is important and essential to detect CMBs timely and in an early stage for prompt treatment. In this research because of the limited labeled samples it is hard to train a classifier to achieve high accuracy. Therefore we proposed employing Densely connected neural network DenseNet as the basic algorithm for transfer learning to detect CMBs. To generate the subsamples for training and test we used a sliding window to cover the whole original images from left to right and from top to bottom. Based on the central pixel of the subsamples we could decide the target value. Considering the data imbalance the cost matrix was also employed. Then based on the new model we tested the classification accuracy and it achieved 97.71% which provided better performance than the state of art methods.
