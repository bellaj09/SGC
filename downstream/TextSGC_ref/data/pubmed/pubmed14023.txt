In Japan endoscopic resection ER is often used to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC when invasion depths are diagnosed as EP-SM1 whereas ESCC cases deeper than SM2 are treated by surgical operation or chemoradiotherapy. Therefore it is crucial to determine the invasion depth of ESCC via preoperative endoscopic examination. Recently rapid progress in the utilization of artificial intelligence AI with deep learning in medical fields has been achieved. In this study we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to measure ESCC invasion depth. Application of artificial intelligence using convolutional neural networks in determining the invasion depth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
