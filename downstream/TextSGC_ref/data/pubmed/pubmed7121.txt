Augmented reality AR is becoming increasingly popular due to its numerous applications. This is especially evident in games medicine education and other areas that support our everyday activities. Moreover this kind of computer system not only improves our vision and our perception of the world that surrounds us but also adds additional elements modifies existing ones and gives additional guidance. In this article we focus on interpreting a reality-based real-time environment evaluation for informing the user about impending obstacles. The proposed solution is based on a hybrid architecture that is capable of estimating as much incoming information as possible. The proposed solution has been tested and discussed with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of different possibilities using this type of vision. Obstacle Detection as a Safety Alert in Augmented Reality Models by the Use of Deep Learning Techniques.
