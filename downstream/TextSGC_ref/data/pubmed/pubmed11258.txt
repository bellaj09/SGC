Despite numerous deep learning methods being developed for automatic sleep stage classification almost all the models need labeled data. However obtaining labeled data is a subjective process. Therefore the labels will be different between two experts. At the same time obtaining labeled data also is a time-consuming task. Even an experienced expert requires hours to annotate the sleep stage patterns. More important as the development of wearable sleep devices it is very difficult to obtain labeled sleep data. Therefore unsupervised training algorithm is very important for sleep stage classification. Hence a new sleep stage classification method named complex-valued unsupervised convolutional neural networks CUCNN is proposed in this study. Complex-valued unsupervised convolutional neural networks for sleep stage classification.
