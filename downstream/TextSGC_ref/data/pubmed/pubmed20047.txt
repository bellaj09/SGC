Modern technologies are increasingly used in the development of cognitive interventions for older adults. Research into possible applications of virtual reality in such interventions has begun only recently. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of 8 sessions of VR-based cognitive training using the GRADYS game in healthy older adults n\u2009=\u200972; aged 60-88 and older adults living with mild dementia n\u2009=\u200927; aged 60-89. Effects of virtual reality-based cognitive training in older adults living without and with mild dementia: a pretest-posttest design pilot study.
