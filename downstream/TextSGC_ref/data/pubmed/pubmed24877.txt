"Despite the prevalence of stroke-induced gait impairment due to foot drop current rehabilitative practices to improve gait function are limited and orthoses can be uncomfortable and do not provide long-lasting benefits. Therefore novel modalities that may facilitate lasting neurological and functional improvements such as brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been explored. In this article we assess the feasibility of BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation FES as a novel physiotherapy for post-stroke foot drop. Three chronic stroke survivors with foot drop received three 1-hour sessions of therapy during 1 week. All subjects were able to purposefully operate the BCI-FES system in real time. Furthermore the salient electroencephalographic EEG features used for classification by the data-driven methodology were determined to be physiologically relevant. Over the course of this short therapy the subjects dorsiflexion active range of motion AROM improved by 3 4 and 8 respectively. These results indicate that chronic stroke survivors can operate the BCI-FES system and that BCI-FES intervention may promote functional improvements."
