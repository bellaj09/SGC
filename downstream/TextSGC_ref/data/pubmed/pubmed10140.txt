Benefiting from big data powerful computation and new algorithmic techniques we have been witnessing the renaissance of deep learning particularly the combination of natural language processing NLP and deep neural networks. The advent of electronic medical records EMRs has not only changed the format of medical records but also helped users to obtain information faster. However there are many challenges regarding researching directly using Chinese EMRs such as low quality huge quantity imbalance semi-structure and non-structure particularly the high density of the Chinese language compared with English. Therefore effective word segmentation word representation and model architecture are the core technologies in the literature on Chinese EMRs. Intelligent diagnosis with Chinese electronic medical records based on convolutional neural networks.
