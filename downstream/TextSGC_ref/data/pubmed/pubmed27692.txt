Stroke is a leading cause of disability significantly impacting the quality of life QOL in survivors and rehabilitation remains the mainstay of treatment in these patients. Recent engineering and technological advances such as brain-machine interfaces BMI and robotic rehabilitative devices are promising to enhance stroke neu-rorehabilitation to accelerate functional recovery and improve QOL. This review discusses the recent applications of BMI and robotic-assisted rehabilitation in stroke patients. We present the framework for integrated BMI and robotic-assisted therapies and discuss their potential therapeutic assistive and diagnostic functions in stroke rehabilitation. Finally we conclude with an outlook on the potential challenges and future directions of these neurotechnologies and their impact on clinical rehabilitation. Applications of Brain-Machine Interface Systems in Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation.
