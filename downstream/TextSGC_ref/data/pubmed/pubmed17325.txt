"We propose a practical system that can effectively mix the depth data of real and virtual objects by using a Z buffer and can quickly generate digital mixed reality video holograms by using multiple graphic processing units GPUs. In an experiment we verify that real objects and virtual objects can be merged naturally in free viewing angles and the occlusion problem is well handled. Furthermore we demonstrate that the proposed system can generate mixed reality video holograms at 7.6 frames per second. Finally the system performance is objectively verified by users subjective evaluations." Practical system for generating digital mixed reality video holograms.
