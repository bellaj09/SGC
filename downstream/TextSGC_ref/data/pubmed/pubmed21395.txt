Brain-computer interfaces BCIs and virtual reality VR are two technologic advances that are changing our way of interacting with the world. BCIs can be used to influence and can serve as a control mechanism in navigation tasks communication or other assistive functions. VR can create ad hoc interactive scenarios that involve all our senses stimulate the brain in a multisensory fashion and increase the motivation and fun with game-like environments. VR and motion tracking enable natural human-computer interaction at cognitive and physical levels. This includes both brain and body in the design of meaningful VR experiences; these cases in which participants feel naturally present could help augment the benefits of BCIs for assistive and neurorehabilitation applications for the relearning of motor and cognitive skills. VR technology is now available at the consumer level thanks to the proliferation of affordable head-mounted displays HMDs. Merging both technologies into simplified practical devices may help democratize these technologies. Brain-computer interfaces and virtual reality for neurorehabilitation.
