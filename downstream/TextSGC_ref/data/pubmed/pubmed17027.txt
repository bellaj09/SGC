Hip fractures contribute to a significant clinical burden globally with over 1.6 million cases per annum and up to 30% mortality rate within the first year. Insertion of a dynamic hip screw DHS is a frequently performed procedure to treat extracapsular neck of femur fractures. Poorly performed DHS fixation of extracapsular neck of femur fractures can result in poor mobilisation chronic pain and increased cut-out rate requiring revision surgery. A realistic affordable and portable fluoroscopic simulation system can improve performance metrics in trainees including the tip-apex distance the only clinically validated outcome and improve outcomes. Augmented reality fluoroscopy simulation of the guide-wire insertion in DHS surgery: A proof of concept study.
