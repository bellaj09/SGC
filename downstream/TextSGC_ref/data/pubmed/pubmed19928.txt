"To overcome the limitation of short-term efficacy of virtual reality VR an enhanced reality ER analgesia combination of the VR real-time motion capture mirror therapy MT involving a high degree of patients presence or embodiment was explored. Patients who underwent unilateral total knee arthroplasty TKA received ER analgesia. The duration was 5 times a week for 2 weeks for one group and 5 times a week for 1 week in the other. Visual Analogue Scale VAS at rest and during movement active knee range of motion ROM for flexion and extension were measured repeatedly. After screening 157 patients 60 were included. Pre-interventional evaluation was performed at 6.7 days and ER was initiated at 12.4 days after surgery. Evaluation was performed at 5 12 33 days after the initiation of ER. Analgesia in the 2 week therapy group was effective until the third evaluation p\u2009=\u20090.000 whereas in the other group it was effective only until the second evaluation p\u2009=\u20090.010. Improvement in ROM in the 2 week group was also maintained until the third evaluation p\u2009=\u20090.037 p\u2009=\u20090.009. It could lay the foundations for the development of safe and long-lasting analgesic tools."
