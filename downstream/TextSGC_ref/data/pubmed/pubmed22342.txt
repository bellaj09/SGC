There is general agreement in the brain-computer interface BCI community that although non-linear classifiers can provide better results in some cases linear classifiers are preferable. Particularly as non-linear classifiers often involve a number of parameters that must be carefully chosen. However new non-linear classifiers were developed over the last decade. One of them is the random forest RF classifier. Although popular in other fields of science RFs are not common in BCI research. In this work we address three open questions regarding RFs in sensorimotor rhythm SMR BCIs: parametrization online applicability and performance compared to regularized linear discriminant analysis LDA. We found that the performance of RF is constant over a large range of parameter values. We demonstrate - for the first time - that RFs are applicable online in SMR-BCIs. Further we show in an offline BCI simulation that RFs statistically significantly outperform regularized LDA by about 3%. These results confirm that RFs are practical and convenient non-linear classifiers for SMR-BCIs. Taking into account further properties of RFs such as independence from feature distributions maximum margin behavior multiclass and advanced data mining capabilities we argue that RFs should be taken into consideration for future BCIs.
