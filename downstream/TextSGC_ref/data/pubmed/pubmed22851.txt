Simulation is a technique for practice and learning that can be applied to many different disciplines and trainees. It is a technique not a technology to replace and amplify real experiences with guided ones often "immersive" in nature that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive fashion. Simulation-based learning can be the way to develop health professionals\ knowledge skills and attitudes whilst protecting patients from unnecessary risks. Simulation-based medical education can be a platform which provides a valuable tool in learning to mitigate ethical tensions and resolve practical dilemmas. Simulation-based training techniques tools and strategies can be applied in designing structured learning experiences as well as be used as a measurement tool linked to targeted teamwork competencies and learning objectives. It has been widely applied in fields such aviation and the military. In medicine simulation offers good scope for training of interdisciplinary medical teams. The realistic scenarios and equipment allows for retraining and practice till one can master the procedure or skill. An increasing number of health care institutions and medical schools are now turning to simulation-based learning. Teamwork training conducted in the simulated environment may offer an additive benefit to the traditional didactic instruction enhance performance and possibly also help reduce errors. Simulation-based learning: Just like the real thing.
