Brain-machine interfaces BMI are an emerging therapeutic option that can allow paralyzed patients to gain control over assistive technology devices ATDs. BMI approaches can be broadly classified into invasive based on intracranially implanted electrodes and noninvasive based on skin electrodes or extracorporeal sensors. Invasive BMIs have a favorable signal-to-noise ratio and thus allow for the extraction of more information than noninvasive BMIs but they are also associated with the risks related to neurosurgical device implantation. Current noninvasive BMI approaches are typically concerned among other issues with long setup times and/or intensive training. Recent studies have investigated the attitudes of paralyzed patients eligible for BMIs particularly patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. These studies indicate that paralyzed patients are indeed interested in BMIs. Little is known however about the degree of knowledge among paralyzed patients concerning BMI approaches or about how patients retrieve information on ATDs. Furthermore it is not yet clear if paralyzed patients would accept intracranial implantation of BMI electrodes with the premise of decoding improvements and what the attitudes of a broader range of patients with diseases such as stroke or spinal cord injury are towards this new kind of treatment.
