Cortical involvement during upright walking is not well-studied in humans. We analyzed non-invasive electroencephalographic EEG recordings from able-bodied volunteers who participated in a robot-assisted gait-training experiment. To enable functional neuroimaging during walking we applied source modeling to high-density 120 channels EEG recordings using individual anatomy reconstructed from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. First we analyzed amplitude differences between the conditions walking and upright standing. Second we investigated amplitude modulations related to the gait phase. During active walking upper  10-12 Hz and  18-30 Hz oscillations were suppressed event-related desynchronization ERD compared to upright standing. Significant  ERD activity was located focally in central sensorimotor areas for 9/10 subjects. Additionally we found that low  24-40 Hz amplitudes were modulated related to the gait phase. Because there is a certain frequency band overlap between sustained  ERD and gait phase related modulations in the low  range these two phenomena are superimposed. Thus we observe gait phase related amplitude modulations at a certain ERD level. We conclude that sustained  and  ERD reflect a movement related state change of cortical excitability while gait phase related modulations in the low  represent the motion sequence timing during gait. Interestingly the center frequencies of sustained  ERD and gait phase modulated amplitudes were identified to be different. They may therefore be caused by different neuronal rhythms which should be taken under consideration in future studies. EEG beta suppression and low gamma modulation are different elements of human upright walking.
