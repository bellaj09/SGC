Virtual Reality VR is increasingly being used in combination with psycho-physiological measures to improve assessment of distress in mental health research and therapy. However the analysis and interpretation of multiple physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills which are not available to most clinicians. To address this issue we designed and developed a Decision Support System DSS for automatic classification of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data ECG breathing rate EEG and behavioral data body gestures correlated with stress following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to the therapist as an aggregated value ranging from 0 to 1 and graphically displayed on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface. A decision support system for real-time stress detection during virtual reality exposure.
