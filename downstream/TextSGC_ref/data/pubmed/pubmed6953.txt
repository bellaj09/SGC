Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting MRF is an imaging technique acquiring unique time signals for different tissues. Although the acquisition is highly accelerated the reconstruction time remains a problem as the state-of-the-art template matching compares every signal with a set of possible signals. To overcome this limitation deep learning based approaches e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs have been proposed. In this work we investigate the applicability of Recurrent Neural Networks RNNs for this reconstruction problem as the signals are correlated in time. Compared to previous methods based on CNNs RNN models yield significantly improved results using in-vivo data. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Reconstruction Using Recurrent Neural Networks.
