An unfavourable yet necessary side-effect of stereotaxic surgery involves the social isolation of post-surgery rats in order to protect their wound site or skull-mounted implant from damage. Social isolation can cause a myriad of behavioural and physiological changes that are detrimental to the well-being of rats with potential negative implications for a range of experimental paradigms. New method. Female Sprague Dawley rats n=40 were implanted onto the skull with a novel 3D-printed headstage socket that surrounded an electrode connector. The socket accommodated a removable stainless-steel headcap for the purposes of protecting the implant. Rats were pair-housed following surgery and their behaviour was monitored for up to several weeks under two experimental conditions that involved EEG recording and deep-brain stimulation as well as behavioural test sessions inside an open-field maze. Rat weights were compared between individually- and pair-housed rats at up to 3 weeks post-surgery. Versatile 3D-printed headstage implant for group housing of rodents.
