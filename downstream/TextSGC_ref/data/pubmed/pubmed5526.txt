Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique with therapeutic applications for the treatment of major depressive disorder MDD. The standard protocol uses high frequency stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC identified in a heuristic manner leading to moderate clinical efficacy. A proposed strategy to increase the anatomical precision in targeting based on resting-state functional MRI rsfMRI identifies the subregion within the DLPFC having the strongest anticorrelated functional connectivity with the subgenual cortex SGC for each individual subject. Limits and reproducibility of resting-state functional MRI definition of DLPFC targets for neuromodulation.
