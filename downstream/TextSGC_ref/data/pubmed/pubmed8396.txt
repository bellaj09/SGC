Detecting early gastric cancer is difficult and it may even be overlooked by experienced endoscopists. Recently artificial intelligence based on deep learning through convolutional neural networks CNNs has enabled significant advancements in the field of gastroenterology. However it remains unclear whether a CNN can outperform endoscopists. In this study we evaluated whether the performance of a CNN in detecting early gastric cancer is better than that of endoscopists. Detecting early gastric cancer: Comparison between the diagnostic ability of convolutional neural networks and endoscopists.
