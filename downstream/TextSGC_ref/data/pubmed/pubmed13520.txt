Artificial intelligence involves a wide range of smart techniques that are applicable to medical services including nuclear medicine. Recent advances in computer power availability of accumulated digital archives containing large amount of patient images and records bring new opportunities for the implementation of artificial techniques in nuclear medicine. As a subset of artificial intelligence machine learning is an emerging tool that possibly perform many clinical tasks. Nuclear medicine community needs to adapt to this fast approaching smart era to exploit the opportunities and tackle the problems associated with artificial intelligence tools. It is aimed in this editorial to outline the potentials and challenges of artificial intelligence applications in nuclear medicine. Artificial intelligence and radiomics in nuclear medicine: potentials and challenges.
