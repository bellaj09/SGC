Non-coding RNAs ncRNAs play crucial roles in many biological processes such as post-transcription of gene regulation. ncRNAs mainly function through interaction with RNA binding proteins RBPs. To understand the function of a ncRNA a fundamental step is to identify which protein is involved into its interaction. Therefore it is promising to computationally predict RBPs where the major challenge is that the interaction pattern or motif is difficult to be found.
