In personality neuroscience the openness-brain association has been a topic of interest. Previous studies usually started from difference in openness trait and used it to infer brain functional activity characteristics but no study has used a "brain-first" research strategy to explore that association based on more objective brain imaging data. In this study we used a fully data-driven approach to discover and validate the association between openness and the resting-state brain network. We collected data of 120 subjects as a discovery sample and 56 subjects as a validation sample. The Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five-Factor Inventory NEO-FFI was used to measure the personality characteristics of all the subjects. Using an exploratory approach based on independent component analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data we identified a parietal network that consisted of the precuneus and inferior parietal lobe. The inter-subject similarity of the parietal memory network exhibited significant associations with openness trait and this association was validated using the 56-subject independent sample. This finding connects the openness trait to the characteristics of a neural network and helps to understand the underlying biology of the openness trait.
