Neuromodulation technologies such as vagus nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation have shown some efficacy in controlling seizures in medically intractable patients. However inherent patient-to-patient variability of seizure disorders leads to a wide range of therapeutic efficacy. A patient specific approach to determining stimulation parameters may lead to increased therapeutic efficacy while minimizing stimulation energy and side effects. This paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes stimulation frequency for controlling seizures with minimum stimulation energy. We apply our method to a computational model called the epileptor. The epileptor model simulates inter-ictal and ictal local field potential data. In order to apply reinforcement learning to the Epileptor we introduce a specialized reward function and state-space discretization. With the reward function and discretization fixed we test the effectiveness of the temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithm TD0. For periodic pulsatile stimulation we derive a relation that describes for any stimulation frequency the minimal pulse amplitude required to suppress seizures. The TD0 algorithm is able to identify parameters that control seizures quickly. Additionally our results show that the TD0 algorithm refines the stimulation frequency to minimize stimulation energy thereby converging to optimal parameters reliably. An advantage of the TD0 algorithm is that it is adaptive so that the parameters necessary to control the seizures can change over time. We show that the algorithm can converge on the optimal solution in simulation with slow and fast inter-seizure intervals.
