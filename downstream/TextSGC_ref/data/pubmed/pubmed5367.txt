We develop a new approach to functional brain connectivity analysis which deals with four fundamental aspects of connectivity not previously jointly treated. These are: temporal correlation spurious spatial correlation sparsity and network construction using trajectory as opposed to marginal Mutual Information. We call the new method Sparse Conditional Trajectory Mutual Information SCoTMI. We demonstrate SCoTMI on simulated and real fMRI data showing that SCoTMI gives more accurate and more repeatable detection of network links than competing network estimation methods. Brain activity: connectivity sparsity and mutual information.
