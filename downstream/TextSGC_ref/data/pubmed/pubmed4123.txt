"Successful memory for an image can be supported by retrieval of ones personal reaction to the image i.e. internal vividness as well as retrieval of the specific details of the image itself i.e. external vividness. Prior research suggests that memory vividness relies on regions within the medial temporal lobe particularly the hippocampus but it is unclear whether internal and external vividness are supported by the hippocampus in a similar way. To address this open question the current study examined hippocampal connectivity associated with enhanced internal and external vividness ratings during retrieval. Participants encoded complex visual images paired with verbal titles. During a scanned retrieval session they were presented with the titles and asked whether each had been seen with an image during encoding. Following retrieval of each image participants were asked to rate internal and external vividness. Increased hippocampal activity was associated with higher vividness ratings for both scales supporting prior evidence implicating the hippocampus in retrieval of memory detail. However different patterns of hippocampal connectivity related to enhanced external and internal vividness. Further hippocampal connectivity with medial prefrontal regions was associated with increased ratings of internal vividness but with decreased ratings of external vividness. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may contribute to increased internal and external vividness via distinct mechanisms and that external and internal vividness of memories should be considered as separable measures."
