Throughout each day the brain displays transient changes in state as evidenced by shifts in behavior and vigilance. While the electrophysiological correlates of brain states have been studied for some time it remains unclear how large-scale cortico-cortical functional connectivity systematically reconfigures across states. Here we investigate state-dependent shifts in cortical functional connectivity by recording local field potentials LFPs during spontaneous behavioral transitions in the ferret using chronically implanted micro-electrocorticographic ECoG arrays positioned over occipital parietal and temporal cortical regions. To objectively classify brain state we describe a data-driven approach that projects time-varying LFP spectral properties into brain state space. Distinct brain states displayed markedly different patterns of cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling and inter-electrode phase synchronization across several LFP frequency bands. The largest across-state differences in functional connectivity were observed between periods of presumed slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement-sleep/active-state which were characterized by the contrasting phenomena of cortical network fragmentation and global synchronization respectively. Collectively our data provide strong evidence that large-scale functional interactions in the brain dynamically reconfigure across behavioral states.
