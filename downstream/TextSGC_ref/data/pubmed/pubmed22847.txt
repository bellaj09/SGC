"Children with Developmental Co-ordination Disorder DCD experience poor motor and psychosocial outcomes. Interventions are often limited within the healthcare system and little is known about how technology might be used within schools or homes to promote the motor skills and/or psychosocial development of these children. This study aimed to evaluate whether short regular school-based sessions of movement experience using a commercially available home video game console Nintendos Wii Fit would lead to benefits in both motor and psychosocial domains in children with DCD." An investigation of the impact of regular use of the Wii Fit to improve motor and psychosocial outcomes in children with movement difficulties: a pilot study.
