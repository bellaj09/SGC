"Recent advances in the field of brain-machine interfaces BMIs have demonstrated enormous potential to shape the future of rehabilitation and prosthetic devices. Here a lower-limb exoskeleton controlled by the intracortical activity of an awake behaving rhesus macaque is presented as a proof-of-concept for a locomotorBMI. A detailed description of the mechanical device including its innovative features and first experimental results is provided. During operation BMI-decoded position and velocity are directly mapped onto the bipedal exoskeletons motions which then move the monkeys legs as the monkey remains physicallypassive. To meet the unique requirements of such an application the exoskeletons features include: high output torque with backdrivable actuation size adjustability and safe user-robot interface. In addition a novel rope transmission is introduced and implemented. To test the performance of the exoskeleton a mechanical assessment was conducted which yielded quantifiable results for transparency efficiency stiffness and tracking performance. Usage under both brain control and automated actuation demonstrates the devices capability to fulfill the demanding needs of this application. These results lay the groundwork for further advancement in BMI-controlled devices for primates including humans." EXiO-A Brain-Controlled Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Rhesus Macaques.
