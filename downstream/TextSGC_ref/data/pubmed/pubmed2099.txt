The recent collection of unprecedented quantities of neuroimaging data with high spatial resolution has led to brain network big data. However a toolkit for fast and scalable computational solutions is still lacking. Here we developed the PArallel Graph-theoretical ANalysIs PAGANI Toolkit based on a hybrid central processing unit-graphics processing unit CPU-GPU framework with a graphical user interface to facilitate the mapping and characterization of high-resolution brain networks. Specifically the toolkit provides flexible parameters for users to customize computations of graph metrics in brain network analyses. As an empirical example the PAGANI Toolkit was applied to individual voxel-based brain networks with 200000 nodes that were derived from a resting-state fMRI dataset of 624 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project. Using a personal computer this toolbox completed all computations in 27 h for one subject which is markedly less than the 118 h required with a single-thread implementation. The voxel-based functional brain networks exhibited prominent small-world characteristics and densely connected hubs which were mainly located in the medial and lateral fronto-parietal cortices. Moreover the female group had significantly higher modularity and nodal betweenness centrality mainly in the medial/lateral fronto-parietal and occipital cortices than the male group. Significant correlations between the intelligence quotient and nodal metrics were also observed in several frontal regions. Collectively the PAGANI Toolkit shows high computational performance and good scalability for analyzing connectome big data and provides a friendly interface without the complicated configuration of computing environments thereby facilitating high-resolution connectomics research in health and disease.
