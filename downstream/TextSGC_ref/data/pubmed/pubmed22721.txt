For surgical fixation of bone fractures of the human hand so-called Kirschner-wires K-wires are drilled through bone fragments. Due to the minimally invasive drilling procedures without a view of risk structures like vessels and nerves a thorough training of young surgeons is necessary. For the development of a virtual reality VR based training system a three-dimensional 3D printed phantom hand is required. To ensure an intuitive operation this phantom hand has to be realistic in both its position relative to the driller as well as in its haptic features. The softest 3D printing material available on the market however is too hard to imitate human soft tissue. Therefore a support-material SUP filled metamaterial is used to soften the raw material. Realistic haptic features are important to palpate protrusions of the bone to determine the drilling starting point and angle. An optical real-time tracking is used to transfer position and rotation to the training system. Optically tracked and 3D printed haptic phantom hand for surgical training system.
