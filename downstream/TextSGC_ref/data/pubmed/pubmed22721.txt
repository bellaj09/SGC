The China Mechanical Virtual Human CMVH is a human musculoskeletal biomechanical simulation platform based on China Visible Human slice images; it has great realistic application significance. In this paper is introduced the construction method of CMVH 3D models. Then a simulation system solution based on Creator/Vega is put forward for the complex and gigantic data characteristics of the 3D models. At last combined with MFC technology the CMVH simulation system is developed and a running simulation scene is given. This paper provides a new way for the virtual reality application of CMVH. The virtual reality simulation research of China Mechanical Virtual Human based on the Creator/Vega.
