Endovascular surgery is performed by placing a catheter through blood vessels. Due to the fragility of arteries and the difficulty in controlling a long elastic wire to reach the target region training plays an extremely important role in helping a surgeon acquire the required complex skills. Virtual reality simulators and augmented reality systems have proven to be effective in minimally invasive surgical training. These systems however often employ pre-captured or computer-generated medical images. We have developed an augmented reality system for ultrasound-guided endovascular surgical training where real ultrasound images captured during the procedure are registered with a pre-scanned phantom model to give the operator a realistic experience. Our goal is to extend the planning and training environment to deliver a system for computer assisted remote endovascular surgery where the navigation of a catheter can be controlled through a robotic device based on the guidance provided by an endovascular surgeon. An augmented reality framework for optimization of computer assisted navigation in endovascular surgery.
