"It is known that moving visual stimuli are perceived to last longer than stationary stimuli with the same physical duration Kanai Paffen Hogendoorn & Verstraten 2006 and that motor actions Tomassini & Morrone 2016 and eye movements Morrone Ross & Burr 2005 can alter perceived duration. In the present work we investigated the contributions of stimulus motion and self-motion to perceived duration while observers stood or walked in a virtual reality environment. Using a visual temporal reproduction task we independently manipulated both the participants motion stationary or walking and the stimulus motion retinal stationary real-world stationary and negative double velocity. When the observers were standing still drifting gratings were perceived as lasting longer than duration-matched static gratings. Interestingly we did not see any time distortion when observers were walking neither when the gratings were kept stationary relative to the observers point of view i.e. no retinal motion nor when they were stationary in the external world i.e. producing the same retinal velocity as the walking condition with stationary grating. Self-motion caused significant dilation in perceived duration only when the gratings were moving at double speed opposite to the observers walking direction. Consistent with previous work Fornaciai Arrighi & Burr 2016 this suggests that the system is able to suppress self-generated motion to enhance external motion which would have ecological benefits for example for threat detection while navigating through the environment." Time dilation effect in an active observer and virtual environment requires apparent motion: No dilation for retinal- or world-motion alone.
