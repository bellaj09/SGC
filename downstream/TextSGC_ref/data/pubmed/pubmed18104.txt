"Video capture virtual reality VR uses a video camera and software to track movement in a single plane without the need to place markers on specific bodily locations. The users image is thereby embedded within a simulated environment such that it is possible to interact with animated graphics in a completely natural manner. Although this technology first became available more than 25 years ago it is only within the past five years that it has been applied in rehabilitation. The objective of this article is to describe the way this technology works to review its assets relative to other VR platforms and to provide an overview of some of the major studies that have evaluated the use of video capture technologies for rehabilitation." Video capture virtual reality as a flexible and effective rehabilitation tool.
