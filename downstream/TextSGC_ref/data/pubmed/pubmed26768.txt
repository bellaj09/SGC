Brain-computer interfaces BCIs represent a technology with the potential to rehabilitate a range of traumatic and degenerative nervous system conditions but require a time-consuming training process to calibrate. An area of BCI research known as transfer learning is aimed at accelerating training by recycling previously recorded training data across sessions or subjects. Training data however is typically transferred from one electrode configuration to another without taking individual head anatomy or electrode positioning into account which may underutilize the recycled data. Leveraging anatomical information to improve transfer learning in brain-computer interfaces.
