P300 spellers have been widely modified to implement nonspelling tasks. In this work we propose a "scenario" stimulation screen that is a P300 speller variation to command a wheelchair. Our approach utilized a stimulation screen with an image background scenario snapshot for a wheelchair and stimulation markers arranged asymmetrically over relevant landmarks such as suitable paths doors windows and wall signs. Other scenario stimulation screen features were green/blue stimulation marker color scheme variable Interstimulus Interval single marker stimulus mode and optimized stimulus sequence generator. Eighteen able-bodied subjects participated in the experiment; 78% had no experience in BCI usage. A waveform feature analysis and a Mann-Whitney U test performed over the pairs of target and nontarget coherent averages confirmed that 94% of the subjects elicit P300 p < .005 on this modified stimulator. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator optimization and Linear Discriminant Analysis were utilized for the automatic detection of P300. For evaluation with unseen data target detection was computed median sensitivity = 1.00 0.78-1.00 together with nontarget discrimination median specificity = 1.00 0.98-1.00. The scenario screen adequately elicits P300 and seems suitable for commanding a wheelchair even when users have no previous experience on the BCI spelling task.
