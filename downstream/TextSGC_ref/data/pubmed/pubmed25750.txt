"Motor imagery base brain-computer interface BCI is an appropriate solution for stroke patient to rehabilitate and communicate with external world. For such applications speculating whether the subjects are doing motor imagery is our primary mission. So the problem turns into how to precisely classify the two tasks motor imagery and idle state by using the subjects electroencephalographic EEG signals. Feature extraction is a factor that significantly affects the classification result. Based on the concept of Continuous Wavelet Transform we proposed a wavelet-liked feature extraction method for motor imagery discrimination. And to compensate the problem that the feature varies between subjects we use the subjects own EEG signals as the mother wavelet. After determining the feature vector we choose Bayes linear discriminant analysis LDA as our classifier. The BCI competition III dataset IVa is used to evaluate the classification performance. Comparing with variance and fast Fourier transform FFT methods in feature extraction 2.02% and 16.96% improvement in classification accuracy are obtained in this work respectively."
