In the study of the brain computer interface BCI system electroencephalogram EEG signals induced by different movements of the same joint are hard to distinguish. This paper proposes a novel scheme that combined amplitude-frequency AF information of intrinsic mode function IMF with common spatial pattern CSP namely AF-CSP to extract motor imagery MI features and to improve classification performance the second generation nondominated sorting evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II is used to tune hyperparameters for linear and nonlinear kernel one versus one twin support vector machine OVO TWSVM. This model is compared with least squares support vector machine LS-SVM back propagation BP extreme learning machine ELM particle swarm optimization support vector machine PSO-SVM and grid search OVO TWSVM GS OVO TWSVM on our dataset; the recognition accuracy increased by 5.92% 22.44% 22.65% 8.69% and 5.75%. The proposed method has helped to achieve higher accuracy in BCI systems. Multiclass Motor Imagery Recognition of Single Joint in Upper Limb Based on NSGA- II OVO TWSVM.
