On the basis of a brief description of grid computing the essence and critical techniques of parallel visualization of extreme large medical datasets are discussed in connection with Intranet and common-configuration computers of hospitals. In this paper are introduced several kernel techniques including the hardware structure software framework load balance and virtual reality visualization. The Maximum Intensity Projection algorithm is realized in parallel using common PC cluster. In virtual reality world three-dimensional models can be rotated zoomed translated and cut interactively and conveniently through the control panel built on virtual reality modeling language VRML. Experimental results demonstrate that this method provides promising and real-time results for playing the role in of a good assistant in making clinical diagnosis. Parallel virtual reality visualization of extreme large medical datasets.
