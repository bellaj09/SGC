Children with developmental coordination disorder DCD experience a range of difficulties that can potentially limit their academic social and physical ability. Recent research has developed interventions that aim to improve motor outcomes in a variety of paediatric cohorts using video gaming equipment. Therefore we aimed to systematically review the literature on virtual reality or video game interventions that aim to improve motor outcomes in children with DCD. Do video game interventions improve motor outcomes in children with developmental coordination disorder? A systematic review using the ICF framework.
