"Compared to other modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging the appearance of ultrasound images is highly dependent on the expertise of the sonographer or clinician making the image acquisition as well as the machine used making it a challenge to analyze due to the frequent presence of artefacts missing boundaries attenuation shadows and speckle. In addition manual contouring of the epicardial and endocardial walls exhibits large inconsistencies and variations as it is strongly dependent on the sonographers training and expertise. Hence in this paper we propose a fully automated image analysis framework to ultimately perform wall motion abnormality classification in 2D+T images. We explore both traditional Random Forests classification with handcrafted features and spatio-temporal hierarchical aggregation of information with a deep learning CNN-based approach. Regarding the later classifier we also investigate the effect of local phase information retrieval through the use of Feature Asymmetry FA and demonstrate that pre-processing videos with FA enables the spatio-temporal CNN to better discover relevant left ventricle endocardial abstractions from low-level features to high-level representations automatically."
