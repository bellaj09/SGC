People with severe disabilities e.g. due to neurodegenerative disease depend on technology that allows for accurate wheelchair control. For those who cannot operate a wheelchair with a joystick brain-computer interfaces BCI may offer a valuable option. Technology depending on visual or auditory input may not be feasible as these modalities are dedicated to processing of environmental stimuli e.g. recognition of obstacles ambient noise. Herein we thus validated the feasibility of a BCI based on tactually-evoked event-related potentials ERP for wheelchair control. Furthermore we investigated use of a dynamic stopping method to improve speed of the tactile BCI system. Toward brain-computer interface based wheelchair control utilizing tactually-evoked event-related potentials.
