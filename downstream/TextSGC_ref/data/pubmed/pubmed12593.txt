This paper presents a Deep Learning DL Cluster Structure for Management Decisions that emulates the way the brain learns and makes choices by combining different learning algorithms. The proposed model is based on the Random Neural Network RNN Reinforcement Learning for fast local decisions and Deep Learning for long-term memory. The Deep Learning Cluster Structure has been applied in the Cognitive Packet Network CPN for routing decisions based on Quality of Service QoS metrics Delay Loss and Bandwidth and Cyber Security keys User Packet and Node which includes a layer of DL management clusters QoS Cyber and CEO that take the final routing decision based on the inputs from the DL QoS clusters and RNN Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The model has been validated under different network sizes and scenarios. The simulation results are promising; the presented DL Cluster management structure as a mechanism to transmit learn and make packet routing decisions is a step closer to emulate the way the brain transmits information learns the environment and takes decisions.
