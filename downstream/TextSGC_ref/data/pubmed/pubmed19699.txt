"The kymograph is device for measuring and presenting pressure-based signals such as human heart beat and artery volume pressure. The Haptic Kymograph is a haptically-enhanced tele-medicine system which is used to acquire human vital signs and then to transform these signs into sensible scalable and ubiquitous media so that a user can easily comprehend subtle and ambiguous signals in a remote place. In an experiment setup a patients artery pressure pulse was captured at 200 Hz of sampling rate transmitted via TCP/IP network and replicated in a remote place using a PHANToM haptic device coupled with a real-time visual interface. In this paper we report our recent progresses in developing a low-cost input system network interfaces and haptic replication of the human artery volume pulse signal."
