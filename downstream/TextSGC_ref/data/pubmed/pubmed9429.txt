With recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies fast acquisition of large-scale genomic data has become commonplace. For cancer studies in particular there is an increasing need for the classification of cancer type based on somatic alterations detected from sequencing analyses. However the ever-increasing size and complexity of the data make the classification task extremely challenging. In this study we evaluate the contributions of various input features such as mutation profiles mutation rates mutation spectra and signatures and somatic copy number alterations that can be derived from genomic data and further utilize them for accurate cancer type classification. We introduce a novel ensemble of machine learning classifiers called CPEM Cancer Predictor using an Ensemble Model which is tested on 7002 samples representing over 31 different cancer types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA database. We first systematically examined the impact of the input features. Features known to be associated with specific cancers had relatively high importance in our initial prediction model. We further investigated various machine learning classifiers and feature selection methods to derive the ensemble-based cancer type prediction model achieving up to 84% classification accuracy in the nested 10-fold cross-validation. Finally we narrowed down the target cancers to the\xa0six most common types and achieved up to 94% accuracy.
