"Brain-computer interface BCI is an assistive technology that conveys users intentions by decoding various brain activities and translating them into control commands without the need of verbal instructions and/or physical interactions. However errors existing in BCI systems affect their performance greatly which in turn confines the development and application of BCI technology. It has been demonstrated viable to extract error potential from electroencephalography recordings." Combining multiple features for error detection and its application in brain-computer interface.
