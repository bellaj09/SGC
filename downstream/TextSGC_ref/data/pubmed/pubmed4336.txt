"We present a framework for along-tract analysis of white matter WM fiber bundles based on diffusion tensor imaging DTI and tractography. We introduce the novel concept of fiber-flux density for modeling fiber tracts geometry and combine it with diffusion-based measures to define vector descriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density FFDD. The proposed model captures informative features of WM tracts at both the microscopic diffusion-related and macroscopic geometry-related scales thus enabling improved sensitivity to subtle structural abnormalities that are not reflected by either diffusion or geometrical properties alone. A key step in this framework is the construction of an FFDD dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles based on the fast marching method FMM. The obtained aligned WM tracts enable meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. Moreover we show that the FMM alignment can be generalized in a straight forward manner to a single-shot co-alignment of multiple fiber bundles. The proposed alignment technique is shown to outperform a well-established commonly used DTI registration algorithm. We demonstrate the FFDD framework on the Human Connectome Project HCP diffusion MRI dataset as well as on two different datasets of contact sports players. We test our method using longitudinal scans of a basketball player diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury showing compatibility with structural MRI findings. We further perform a group study comparing mid- and post-season scans of 13 active football players exposed to repetitive head trauma to 17 non-player control NPC subjects. Results reveal statistically significant FFDD differences p-values<0.05 between the groups as well as increased abnormalities over time at spatially-consistent locations within several major fiber tracts of football players."
