"Ghrelin regulates energy homeostasis in various species and enhances memory in rodent models. In humans the role of ghrelin in cognitive processes has yet to be characterized. Here we show in a double-blind randomized crossover design that acute administration of ghrelin alters encoding-related brain activity however does not enhance memory formation in humans. Twenty-one healthy young male participants had to memorize food- and non-food-related words presented on a background of a virtual navigational route while undergoing fMRI recordings. After acute ghrelin administration we observed decreased post-encoding resting state fMRI connectivity between the caudate nucleus and the insula amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. In addition brain activity related to subsequent memory performance was modulated by ghrelin. On the next day however no differences were found in free word recall or cued location-word association recall between conditions; and ghrelins effects on brain activity or functional connectivity were unrelated to memory performance. Further ghrelin had no effect on a cognitive test battery comprising tests for working memory fluid reasoning creativity mental speed and attention. In conclusion in contrast to studies with animal models we did not find any evidence for the potential of ghrelin acting as a short-term cognitive enhancer in humans." Ghrelin modulates encoding-related brain function without enhancing memory formation in humans.
