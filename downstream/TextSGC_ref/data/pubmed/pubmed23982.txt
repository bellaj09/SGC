Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs are oscillations of the electroencephalogram EEG which are mainly observed over the occipital area that exhibit a frequency corresponding to a repetitively flashing visual stimulus. SSVEPs have proven to be very consistent and reliable signals for rapid EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI control. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether solid or checkerboard-patterned flashing stimuli produce superior BCI performance. Furthermore the spatial frequency of checkerboard stimuli can be varied for optimal performance. The present study performs an empirical evaluation of performance for a 4-class SSVEP-based BCI when the spatial frequency of the individual checkerboard stimuli is varied over a continuum ranging from a solid background to single-pixel checkerboard patterns. The results indicate that a spatial frequency of 2.4 cycles per degree can maximize the information transfer rate with a reduction in subjective visual irritation compared to lower spatial frequencies. This important finding on stimulus design can lead to improved performance and usability of SSVEP-based BCIs.
