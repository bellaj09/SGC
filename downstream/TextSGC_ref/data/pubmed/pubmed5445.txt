The computation of image similarity is important for a wide range of analyses in neuroimaging from decoding to meta-analysis. In many cases the images being compared have empty voxels but the effects of such empty voxels on image similarity metrics are poorly understood. We present a detailed investigation of the influence of different degrees of image thresholding on the outcome of pairwise image comparison. Given a pair of brain maps for which one of the maps is thresholded we show that an analysis using the intersection of non-zero voxels across images at a threshold of Z = 1.0 maximizes accuracy for retrieval of a list of maps of the same contrast and thresholding up to Z = 2.0 can increase accuracy as compared to comparison using unthresholded maps. Finally maps can be thresholded up to to Z = 3.0 corresponding to 25% of voxels non-empty within a standard brain mask and still maintain a lower bound of 90% accuracy. Our results suggest that a small degree of thresholding may improve the accuracy of image similarity computations and that robust meta-analytic image similarity comparisons can be obtained using thresholded images.
