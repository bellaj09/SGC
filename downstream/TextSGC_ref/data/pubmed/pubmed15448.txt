Lung cancer is one of the most malignant tumors causing over 1000000 deaths each year worldwide. Deep learning has brought success in many domains in recent years. DNA methylation an epigenetic factor is used for model training in many studies. There is an opportunity for deep learning methods to analyze the lung cancer epigenetic data to determine their subtypes for appropriate treatment. Extracting a biologically latent space of lung cancer epigenetics with variational autoencoders.
