Traditional robotic work cell design and programming are considered inefficient and outdated in current industrial and market demands. In this research virtual reality VR technology is used to improve human-robot interface whereby complicated commands or programming knowledge is not required. The proposed solution known as VR-based Programming of a Robotic Work Cell VR-Rocell consists of two sub-programmes which are VR-Robotic Work Cell Layout VR-RoWL and VR-based Robot Teaching System VR-RoT. VR-RoWL is developed to assign the layout design for an industrial robotic work cell whereby VR-RoT is developed to overcome safety issues and lack of trained personnel in robot programming. Simple and user-friendly interfaces are designed for inexperienced users to generate robot commands without damaging the robot or interrupting the production line. The user is able to attempt numerous times to attain an optimum solution. A case study is conducted in the Robotics Laboratory to assemble an electronics casing and it is found that the output models are compatible with commercial software without loss of information. Furthermore the generated KUKA commands are workable when loaded into a commercial simulator. The operation of the actual robotic work cell shows that the errors may be due to the dynamics of the KUKA robot rather than the accuracy of the generated programme. Therefore it is concluded that the virtual reality based solution approach can be implemented in an industrial robotic work cell.
