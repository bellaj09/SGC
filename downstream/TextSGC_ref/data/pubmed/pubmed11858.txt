In the current clinical care practice Gleason grading system is one of the most powerful prognostic predictors for prostate cancer PCa. The grading system is based on the architectural pattern of cancerous epithelium in histological images. However the standard procedure of histological examination often involves complicated tissue fixation and staining which are time-consuming and may delay the diagnosis and surgery. In this study label-free multiphoton microscopy MPM was used to acquire subcellular-resolution images of unstained prostate tissues. Then a deep learning architecture U-net was introduced for epithelium segmentation of prostate tissues in MPM images. The obtained segmentation results were then merged with the original MPM images to train a classification network AlexNet for automated Gleason grading. The developed method achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 92.3% with a mean F1 score of 0.839 for epithelium segmentation. By merging the segmentation results with the MPM images the accuracy of Gleason grading was improved from 72.42% to 81.13% in hold-out test set. Our results suggest that MPM in combination with deep learning holds the potential to be used as a fast and powerful clinical tool for PCa diagnosis.
