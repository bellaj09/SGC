As an important reversible lipid modification S-palmitoylation mainly occurs at specific cysteine residues in proteins participates in regulating various biological processes and is associated with human diseases. Besides experimental assays computational prediction of S-palmitoylation sites can efficiently generate helpful candidates for further experimental consideration. Here we reviewed the current progress in the development of S-palmitoylation site predictors as well as training data sets informative features and algorithms used in these tools. Then we compiled a benchmark data set containing 3098 known S-palmitoylation sites identified from small- or large-scale experiments and developed a new method named data quality discrimination DQD to distinguish data quality weights DQWs between the two types of the sites. Besides DQD and our previous methods we encoded sequence similarity values into images constructed a deep learning framework of convolutional neural networks CNNs and developed a novel algorithm of graphic presentation system GPS 6.0. We further integrated nine additional types of sequence-based and structural features implemented parallel CNNs pCNNs and designed a new predictor called GPS-Palm. Compared with other existing tools GPS-Palm showed a\u2009>31.3% improvement of the area under the curve AUC value 0.855 versus 0.651 for general prediction of S-palmitoylation sites. We also produced two species-specific predictors with corresponding AUC values of 0.900 and 0.897 for predicting human- and mouse-specific sites respectively.
