We used a virtual reality setup to let participants grasp discs which differed in luminance chromaticity and size. Current theories on perception and action propose a division of labor in the brain into a color proficient perception pathway and a less color-capable action pathway. In this study we addressed the question whether isoluminant stimuli which provide only a chromatic but no luminance contrast for action planning are harder to grasp than stimuli providing luminance contrast or both kinds of contrast. Although we found that grasps of isoluminant stimuli had a slightly steeper slope relating the maximum grip aperture to disc size all other measures of grip quality were unaffected. Overall our results do not support the view that isoluminance of stimulus and background impedes the planning of a grasping movement. Grasping isoluminant stimuli.
