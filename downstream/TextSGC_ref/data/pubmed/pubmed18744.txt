Theoretical models of episodic memory have proposed that retrieval depends on interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex where hippocampal reinstatement of item-context associations drives neocortical reinstatement of item information. Here we simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG from hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex LTC of epilepsy patients who performed a virtual reality spatial navigation task. We extracted stimulus-specific representations of both item and item-context associations from the time-frequency patterns of activity in hippocampus and LTC. Our results revealed a double dissociation of representational reinstatement across time and space: an early reinstatement of item-context associations in hippocampus preceded a later reinstatement of item information in LTC. Importantly reinstatement levels in hippocampus and LTC were correlated across trials and the quality of LTC reinstatement was predicted by the magnitude of phase synchronization between hippocampus and LTC. These findings confirm that episodic memory retrieval in humans relies on coordinated representational interactions within a hippocampal-neocortical network.
