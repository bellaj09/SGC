According to the increase of data generated from analytical instruments application of artificial intelligenceAItechnology in medical field is indispensable. In particular practical application of AI technology is strongly required in "genomic medicine" and "genomic drug discovery" that conduct medical practice and novel drug development based on individual genomic information. In our laboratory we have been developing a database to integrate genome data and clinical information obtained by clinical genome analysis and a computational support system for clinical interpretation of variants using AI. In addition with the aim of creating new therapeutic targets in genomic drug discovery we have been also working on the development of a binding affinity prediction system for mutated proteins and drugs by molecular dynamics simulation using supercomputer "Kei". We also have tackled for problems in a drug virtual screening. Our developed AI technology has successfully generated virtual compound library and deep learning method has enabled us to predict interaction between compound and target protein.
