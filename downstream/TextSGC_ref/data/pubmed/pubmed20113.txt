"Computer assisted simulation is an important teaching modality in the preclinical training of students. In order to maximize the potential of this learning tool the University of Tennessees College of Dentistry has successfully incorporated DentSim technology into the restorative curriculum and has recently acquired the technology to make image guided implantology available to students residents and faculty. This article describes the universitys history and experience with simulation as a learning tool. The purpose of this article is to provide information to other educational institutions on the use of virtual reality simulation in the classroom."
