Augmented reality AR technology is used to reconstruct three-dimensional 3D images of hepatic and biliary structures from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data and to superimpose the virtual images onto a view of the surgical field. In liver surgery these superimposed virtual images help the surgeon to visualize intrahepatic structures and therefore to operate precisely and to improve clinical outcomes.
