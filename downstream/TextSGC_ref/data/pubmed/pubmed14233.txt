To develop an accurate and fast deformable image registration DIR method for four-dimensional computed tomography 4D-CT lung images. Deep learning-based methods have the potential to quickly predict the deformation vector field DVF in a few forward predictions. We have developed an unsupervised deep learning method for 4D-CT lung DIR with excellent performances in terms of registration accuracies robustness and computational speed.
