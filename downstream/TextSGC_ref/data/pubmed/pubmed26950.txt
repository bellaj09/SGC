Linear discriminant analysis LDA is one of the most popular classification algorithms for brain-computer interfaces BCI. LDA assumes Gaussian distribution of the data with equal covariance matrices for the concerned classes however the assumption is not usually held in actual BCI applications where the heteroscedastic class distributions are usually observed. This paper proposes an enhanced version of LDA namely z-score linear discriminant analysis Z-LDA which introduces a new decision boundary definition strategy to handle with the heteroscedastic class distributions. Z-LDA defines decision boundary through z-score utilizing both mean and standard deviation information of the projected data which can adaptively adjust the decision boundary to fit for heteroscedastic distribution situation. Results derived from both simulation dataset and two actual BCI datasets consistently show that Z-LDA achieves significantly higher average classification accuracies than conventional LDA indicating the superiority of the new proposed decision boundary definition strategy.
