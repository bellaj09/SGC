"Electroencephalography EEG of brain activity can be represented in terms of dynamically changing topographies microstates. Notably spontaneous brain activity recorded at rest can be characterized by four distinctive topographies. Despite their well-established role during resting state their implication in the generation of motor behavior is debated. Evidence of such a functional role of spontaneous brain activity would provide support for the design of novel and sensitive biomarkers in neurological disorders. Here we examined whether and to what extent intrinsic brain activity contributes and plays a functional role during natural motor behaviors. For this we first extracted subject-specific EEG microstates and muscle synergies during reaching-and-grasping movements in healthy volunteers. We show that in every subject well-known resting-state microstates persist during movement execution with similar topographies and temporal characteristics but are supplemented by novel task-related microstates. We then show that the subject-specific microstates dynamical organization correlates with the activation of muscle synergies and can be used to decode individual grasping movements with high accuracy. These findings provide first evidence that spontaneous brain activity encodes detailed information about motor control offering as such the prospect of a novel tool for the definition of subject-specific biomarkers of brain plasticity and recovery in neuro-motor disorders." EEG topographies provide subject-specific correlates of motor control.
