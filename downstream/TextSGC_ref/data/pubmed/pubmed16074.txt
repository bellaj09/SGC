"Lack of courses in emergency medicine for doctors under training is currently a problem in Sweden. Only 10 percent will have these courses early under their internship. The University hospital in Malmoe has therefore decided to create a course for doctors under training and to offer it early in their education. The curriculum is based on a problem-based learning concept using a modified case methodology that has been used since the 1920s at Harvard Business school in Boston. The course integrates doctors from different specialties with experienced nurses from the emergency ward. The five day course comprises; three theoretical days where cases from the emergency room are discussed with the case methodology followed by two days of practical training. Our results from 100 participants over a period of two years is very encouraging over 85 percent of the participants were very satisfied with the course. The multidisciplinary discussion about different cases was much appreciated. Our experience of this problem-based learning concept is very good since it promotes deep rather than surface learning and promotes an in-depth collaboration between disciplines." Multidisciplinary course in emergency medicine gives residents greater confidence.
