Failure to extinguish fear can lead to persevering anxiety and has been postulated as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of human anxiety disorders. In animals it is well documented that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a pivotal role in the successful extinction of fear most importantly through the cannabinoid receptor 1. However no human studies have reported a translation of this preclinical evidence yet. Healthy medication-free human subjects N=150 underwent a fear conditioning and extinction procedure in a virtual reality environment. Fear potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex was measured to assess fear-conditioned responding and subjective fear ratings were collected. Participants were genotyped for two polymorphisms located within the promoter region rs2180619 and the coding region rs1049353 of cannabinoid receptor 1. As predicted from the preclinical literature acquisition and expression of conditioned fear did not differ between genotypes. Crucially whereas both homozygote G/G N=23 and heterozygote A/G N=68 G-allele carriers of rs2180619 displayed robust extinction of fear extinction of fear-potentiated startle was absent in A/A homozygotes N=51. Additionally this resistance to extinguish fear left A/A carriers of rs2180619 with significantly higher levels of fear-potentiated startle at the end of the extinction training. No effects of rs1049353 genotype were observed regarding fear acquisition and extinction. These results suggest for the first time involvement of the human endocannabinoid system in fear extinction. Implications are that genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in anxiety rendering cannabinoid receptor 1 a potential target for novel pharmacological treatments of anxiety disorders. Failure to extinguish fear and genetic variability in the human cannabinoid receptor 1.
