The small-world architecture has gained considerable attention in anatomical brain connectivity studies. However how to adequately quantify small-worldness in diffusion networks has remained a problem. We addressed the limits of small-world measures and defined new metric indices: the small-world efficiency SWE and the small-world angle SWA both based on the tradeoff between high global and local efficiency. To confirm the validity of the new indices we examined the behavior of SWE and SWA of networks based on the Watts-Strogatz model as well as the diffusion tensor imaging DTI data from 75 healthy old subjects aged 50-70. We found that SWE could classify the subjects into different age groups and was correlated with individual performance on the WAIS-IV test. Moreover to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed measures to network two network attack strategies were applied. Our results indicate that the new indices outperform their predecessors in the analysis of DTI data. Small-world indices via network efficiency for brain networks from diffusion MRI.
