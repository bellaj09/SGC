Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of in silico repurposing methods by establishing links between current technological trends data availability and characteristics of the algorithms used in these methods. Using the case of the computational repurposing of fasudil as an alternative autophagy enhancer we suggest a generic modular organization of a repurposing workflow. We also review 3D structure-based similarity-based inference-based and machine learning ML-based methods. We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these methods to emphasize three current technical challenges. We finish by discussing current directions of research including possibilities offered by new methods such as deep learning. Design of efficient computational workflows for in silico drug repurposing.
