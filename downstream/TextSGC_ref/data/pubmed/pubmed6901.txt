Diabetic retinopathy DR which is generally diagnosed by the presence of hemorrhages and hard exudates is one of the most prevalent causes of visual impairment and blindness. Early detection of hard exudates HEs in color fundus photographs can help in preventing such destructive damage. However this is a challenging task due to high intra-class diversity and high similarity with other structures in the fundus images. Most of the existing methods for detecting HEs are based on characterizing HEs using hand crafted features HCFs only which can not characterize HEs accurately. Deep learning methods are scarce in this domain because they require large-scale sample sets for training which are not generally available for most routine medical imaging research. Hard exudate detection based on deep model learned information and multi-feature joint representation for diabetic retinopathy screening.
