This work studies the feasibility of using mental attention to access a computer. Brain activity was measured with an electrode placed at the Fp1 position and the reference on the left ear; seven normally developed people and three subjects with cerebral palsy CP took part in the experimentation. They were asked to keep their attention high and low for as long as possible during several trials. We recorded attention levels and power bands conveyed by the sensor but only the first was used for feedback purposes. All of the information was statistically analyzed to find the most significant parameters and a classifier based on linear discriminant analysis LDA was also set up. In addition 60% of the participants were potential users of this technology with an accuracy of over 70%. Including power bands in the classifier did not improve the accuracy in discriminating between the two attentional states. For most people the best results were obtained by using only the attention indicator in classification. Tiredness was higher in the group with disabilities 2.7 in a scale of 3 than in the other 1.5 in the same scale; and modulating the attention to access a communication board requires that it does not contain many pictograms between 4 and 7 on screen and has a scanning period of a relatively high t s c a n  10 s. The information transfer rate ITR is similar to the one obtained by other brain computer interfaces BCI like those based on sensorimotor rhythms SMR or slow cortical potentials SCP and makes it suitable as an eye-gaze independent BCI.
