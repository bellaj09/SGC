"Smoking has increasingly become a burden on Americas health and economic status. The fact that four out of every five adult smokers begins tobacco use before the age of eighteen indicates a need for teenage smoking cessation programs. The Virtual Reality Medical Center created an internet-based program that addresses the issue by utilizing cue exposure therapy in home and school environments to teach teens which cues trigger nicotine cravings and how to combat those cravings. The effectiveness of the program was measured through questionnaires administered before and after its use. Results indicated that the participants were engaged in the virtual environment and that in every aspect of the program at least 8% more participants were knowledgeable about the subject than prior to the use of the program. Success of such a program could reduce teen smoking rates ultimately leading to reduced smoking mortalities complications and costs overall."
