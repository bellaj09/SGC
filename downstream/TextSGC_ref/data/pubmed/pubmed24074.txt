"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation GVS on path trajectory and body rotation during a triangle completion task. Participants  N = 17 female 18-30 years completed the triangle completion task in virtual reality using two different size triangles. GVS was delivered at three times each participants threshold in either the left or right direction prior to the final leg of the triangle and continued until the participant reached their final position. Whole body kinematics were collected using an NDI Optotrak motion tracking system. Results revealed a significant main effect of GVS on arrival error such that no GVS NGVS had significantly smaller arrival errors than when GVS was administered. There was also a significant main effect of GVS on angular error such that NGVS had significantly smaller error than GVSaway and GVStowards. There was no significant difference between GVS trials in path variability during the final leg on route to the final position. These results demonstrate that vestibular perturbation reduced the accuracy of the triangle completion task affecting path trajectory and body position during a path integration task in the absence of visual cues."
