Movement disorders typically arise from dysfunction of the basal ganglia BG cerebellum or both. The BG-a group of deep subcortical structures-form complex circuits that shape motor control and motor learning as well as limbic and associative functions. In this article we summarize the anatomy and physiology of the BG and cerebellum and briefly highlight the clinical syndromes that may arise in the context of their injury or dysfunction. Anatomy Physiology and Clinical Syndromes of the Basal Ganglia: A Brief Review.
