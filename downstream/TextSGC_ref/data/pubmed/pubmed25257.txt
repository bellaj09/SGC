We investigated the characteristic changes in the physiology of cybersickness when subjects were exposed to virtual reality. Sixty-one participants experienced a virtual navigation for a total of 9.5 min and were required to detect specific virtual objects. Three questionnaires for sickness susceptibility and immersive tendency were obtained before the navigation. Sixteen electrophysiological signals were recorded before during and after the navigation. The severity of cybersickness experienced by participants was reported from a simulator sickness questionnaire after the navigation. The total severity of cybersickness had a significant positive correlation with gastric tachyarrhythmia eyeblink rate heart period and EEG delta wave and a negative correlation with EEG beta wave. These results suggest that cybersickness accompanies the pattern changes in the activities of the central and the autonomic nervous systems. Characteristic changes in the physiological components of cybersickness.
