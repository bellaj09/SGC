"This study sought to investigate whether stimulation to the fovea or the parafovea with different color combinations influenced the temporal and dynamic features of 4 disparity vergence step responses. Twelve unique types of stimuli were displayed within a haploscope presented along the participants midsagittal plane. Vergence eye movement responses from fifteen nave participants were recorded using video-based infrared eye tracking instrumentation. Latency and peak velocity from left and right eye movement responses were quantified. Results show that the type of stimulus projection foveal versus parafoveal significantly p<0.001 influences the vergence response latency but did not impact peak velocity. Vergence responses to eccentric circles with 6 eccentricity targeting the parafovea resulted in a significantly faster response latency compared to vergence responses to a cross with 2 eccentricity stimuli targeting the fovea. Results have implications for the stimulus design of a variety of applications from virtual reality to vision therapy interventions."
