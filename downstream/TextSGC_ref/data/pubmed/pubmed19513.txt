Augmented reality AR technology can superimpose the virtual image generated by computer onto the real operating field to present an integral image to enhance surgical safety. The purpose of our study is to develop a novel AR-based navigation system for craniofacial surgery. We focus on orbital hypertelorism correction because the surgery requires high preciseness and is considered tough even for senior craniofacial surgeon. Effectiveness of a Novel Augmented Reality-Based Navigation System in Treatment of Orbital Hypertelorism.
