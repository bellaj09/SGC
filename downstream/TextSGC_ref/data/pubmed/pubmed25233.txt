Adequate assessment and feedback remains a cornerstone of psychomotor skills acquisition particularly within neurosurgery where the consequence of adverse operative events is significant. However a critical appraisal of the reliability of visual rating scales in neurosurgery is lacking. Therefore we sought to design a study to compare visual rating scales with simulated metrics in a neurosurgical virtual reality task. A Comparison of Visual Rating Scales and Simulated Virtual Reality Metrics in Neurosurgical Training: A Generalizability Theory Study.
