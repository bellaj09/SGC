Precision herbicide application can substantially reduce herbicide input and weed control cost in turfgrass management systems. Intelligent spot-spraying system predominantly relies on machine vision-based detectors for autonomous weed control. In this work several deep convolutional neural networks DCNN were constructed for detection of dandelion Taraxacum officinale Web. ground ivy Glechoma hederacea L. and spotted spurge Euphorbia maculata L. growing in perennial ryegrass. When the networks were trained using a dataset containing a total of 15486 negative images contained perennial ryegrass with no target weeds and 17600 positive images images contained target weeds VGGNet achieved high F1 scores 0.9278 with high recall values 0.9952 for detection of E. maculata G. hederacea and T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. The F1 scores of AlexNet ranged from 0.8437 to 0.9418 and were generally lower than VGGNet at detecting E. maculata G. hederacea and T. officinale. GoogleNet is not an effective DCNN at detecting these weed species mainly due to the low precision values. DetectNet is an effective DCNN and achieved high F1 scores 0.9843 in the testing datasets for detection of T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. Moreover VGGNet had the highest Matthews correlation coefficient MCC values while GoogleNet had the lowest MCC values. Overall the approach of training DCNN particularly VGGNet and DetectNet presents a clear path toward developing a machine vision-based decision system in smart sprayers for precision weed control in perennial ryegrass.
