Background Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis AS is associated with poor prognoses. However early detection of AS is difficult because of the long asymptomatic period experienced by many patients during which screening tools are ineffective. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based algorithm combining a multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network for detecting significant AS using ECGs. Methods and Results This retrospective cohort study included adult patients who had undergone both ECG and echocardiography. A deep learning-based algorithm was developed using 39\xa0371 ECGs. Internal validation of the algorithm was performed with 6453 ECGs from one hospital and external validation was performed with 10\xa0865 ECGs from another hospital. The end point was significant AS beyond moderate. We used demographic information features and 500-Hz 12-lead ECG raw data as predictive variables. In addition we identified which region had the most significant effect on the decision-making of the algorithm using a sensitivity map. During internal and external validation the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the deep learning-based algorithm using 12-lead ECG for detecting significant AS were 0.884 95% CI 0.880-0.887 and 0.861 95% CI 0.858-0.863 respectively; those using a single-lead ECG signal were 0.845 95% CI 0.841-0.848 and 0.821 95% CI 0.816-0.825 respectively. The sensitivity map showed the algorithm focused on the T wave of the precordial lead to determine the presence of significant AS. Conclusions The deep learning-based algorithm demonstrated high accuracy for significant AS detection using both 12-lead and single-lead ECGs.
