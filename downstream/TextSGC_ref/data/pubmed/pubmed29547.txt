Computation in nervous systems operates with different computational primitives and on different hardware than traditional digital computation and is thus subjected to different constraints from its digital counterpart regarding the use of physical resources such as time space and energy. In an effort to better understand neural computation on a physical medium with similar spatiotemporal and energetic constraints the field of neuromorphic engineering aims to design and implement electronic systems that emulate in very large-scale integration VLSI hardware the organization and functions of neural systems at multiple levels of biological organization from individual neurons up to large circuits and networks. Mixed analog/digital neuromorphic VLSI systems are compact consume little power and operate in real time independently of the size and complexity of the model.
