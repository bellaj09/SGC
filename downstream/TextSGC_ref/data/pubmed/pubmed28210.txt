"This work presents a first motor imagery-based adaptive brain-computer interface BCI speller which is able to exploit application-derived context for improved simultaneous classifier adaptation and spelling. Online spelling experiments with ten able-bodied users evaluate the ability of our scheme first to alleviate non-stationarity of brain signals for restoring the subjects performances second to guide naive users into BCI control avoiding initial offline BCI calibration and third to outperform regular unsupervised adaptation."
