The demand for AI to improve patients outcome has been increased; we therefore aim to establish the diagnostic values of AI in diabetic retinopathy by pooling the published studies of deep learning on this subject. A total of eight studies included which evaluated deep learning in a total of 706922 retinal images. The overall pooled area under receiver operating curve AUROC was 98.93% 95%CI:98.37%-99.49%. However the overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy RDR was 74% 95% CI: 73%-74% and 95% 95% CI: 95%-95%. The findings of this study show that deep learning had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy.
