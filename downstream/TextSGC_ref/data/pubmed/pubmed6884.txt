"Mesothelin MSLN is a cell surface glycoprotein present in many cancer types. Its expression is generally associated with an unfavorable prognosis. This study examined the prognostic significance of MSLN expression in different areas of individual colorectal cancers CRCs using tissue microarrays TMAs by enrolling 314 patients with stage II T3-T4 N0 M0 CRCs. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from patients TMA blocks were constructed. Tissue core specimens were obtained from submucosal invasive front Fr-sm subserosal invasive front Fr-ss central area Ce and rolled edge Ro of each tumor. Using these four-point TMA sets MSLN expression was immunohistochemically surveyed. The area-specific prognostic significance of MSLN expression was evaluated. A deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm was used for imaging analysis and evaluating our judgments objectivity. MSLN staining ratio was positively correlated between the manual and machine-learning analyses r\u2009=\u20090.71. The correlation coefficient between Ro and Ce Ro and Fr-sm and Ro and Fr-ss was r\u2009=\u20090.63 r\u2009=\u20090.54 and r\u2009=\u20090.61 respectively. Disease-specific survival curves for the MSLN-positive and MSLN-negative groups in Fr-sm Fr-ss and Ro were significantly different five-year survival rates 88.1% and 95.5% P\u2009=\u20090.024 85.0 and 96.2% P\u2009=\u20090.0087 87.8 and 95.5% P\u2009=\u20090.051 and 77.9 and 95.8% P\u2009=\u20090.046 for Fr-sm Fr-ss Ce and Ro respectively. The analysis performed using area-specific four-point TMAs clearly demonstrated that MSLN expression in stage II CRC was relatively homogeneous within tumors. Additionally high MSLN expression showed or tended to show unfavorable prognostic significance regardless of the tumor area." Prognostic significance of mesothelin expression in colorectal cancer disclosed by area-specific four-point tissue microarrays.
