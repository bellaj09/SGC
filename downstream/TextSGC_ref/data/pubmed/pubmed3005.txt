Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and associated lung disease coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic. In particular the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently there is no proven effective therapy against the virus and the effect on other diseases is also uncertain especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. An arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias either secondary to acquired conditions or comorbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT syndrome Brugada syndrome short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved these patients may be susceptible to proarrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever stress electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs. Here we describe the potential COVID-19-associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations pending local possibilities for their monitoring and management during this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes.
