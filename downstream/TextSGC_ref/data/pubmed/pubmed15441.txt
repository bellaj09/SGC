Image-based computer-aided diagnosis CAD systems have been developed to assist doctors in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using ultrasound thyroid images. However the performance of these systems is strongly dependent on the selection of detection and classification methods. Although there are previous researches on this topic there is still room for enhancement of the classification accuracy of the existing methods. To address this issue we propose an artificial intelligence-based method for enhancing the performance of the thyroid nodule classification system. Thus we extract image features from ultrasound thyroid images in two domains: spatial domain based on deep learning and frequency domain based on Fast Fourier transform FFT. Using the extracted features we perform a cascade classifier scheme for classifying the input thyroid images into either benign negative or malign positive cases. Through expensive experiments using a public dataset the thyroid digital image database TDID dataset we show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and produces up-to-date classification results for the thyroid nodule classification problem.
