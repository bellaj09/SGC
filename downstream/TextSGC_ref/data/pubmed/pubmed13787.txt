The ultrasound imaging is one of the most common schemes to detect diseases in the clinical practice. There are many advantages of ultrasound imaging such as safety convenience and low cost. However reading ultrasound imaging is not easy. To support the diagnosis of clinicians and reduce the load of doctors many ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis CAD systems are proposed. In recent years the success of deep learning in the image classification and segmentation led to more and more scholars realizing the potential of performance improvement brought by utilizing the deep learning in the ultrasound CAD system. This paper summarized the research which focuses on the ultrasound CAD system utilizing machine learning technology in recent years. This study divided the ultrasound CAD system into two categories. One is the traditional ultrasound CAD system which employed the manmade feature and the other is the deep learning ultrasound CAD system. The major feature and the classifier employed by the traditional ultrasound CAD system are introduced. As for the deep learning ultrasound CAD newest applications are summarized. This paper will be useful for researchers who focus on the ultrasound CAD system. Machine Learning in Ultrasound Computer-Aided Diagnostic Systems: A Survey.
