Iris recognition systems have been used in high-security-level applications because of their high recognition rate and the distinctiveness of iris patterns. However as reported by recent studies an iris recognition system can be fooled by the use of artificial iris patterns and lead to a reduction in its security level. The accuracies of previous presentation attack detection research are limited because they used only features extracted from global iris region image. To overcome this problem we propose a new presentation attack detection method for iris recognition by combining features extracted from both local and global iris regions using convolutional neural networks and support vector machines based on a near-infrared NIR light camera sensor. The detection results using each kind of image features are fused based on two fusion methods of feature level and score level to enhance the detection ability of each kind of image features. Through extensive experiments using two popular public datasets LivDet-Iris-2017 Warsaw and Notre Dame Contact Lens Detection 2015 and their fusion we validate the efficiency of our proposed method by providing smaller detection errors than those produced by previous studies.
