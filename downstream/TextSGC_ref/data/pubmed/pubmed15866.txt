A 36-year-old homosexual man with 6 months of visual symptoms and headaches had right homonymous hemianopia mild new learning impairment and alexia with agraphia. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI scan was reported consistent with left occipital infarction. Subsequent MRI demonstrated abnormal demyelination in subcortical white matter and deep parieto-occipital white matter bilaterally but primarily left. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for JC virus DNA were both positive consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML with AIDS. His clinical status steadily deteriorated and MRI white matter abnormalities worsened despite high-dose antiretroviral therapy. After the antiretroviral regimen was intensified by the addition of a protease inhibitor rapid clinical and radiographic improvement occurred with subsequent MRI studies revealing only residual left parieto-occipital encephalomalacia. PML in AIDS patients has been associated with a nearly uniformly poor prognosis until recent reports of improved outcomes after highly active antiretroviral therapy. This patient with PML and AIDS similarly showed a robust clinical and MRI response to intensive antiretroviral combination therapy which has been maintained for more than 3 years. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging regression of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in an AIDS patient after intensive antiretroviral therapy.
