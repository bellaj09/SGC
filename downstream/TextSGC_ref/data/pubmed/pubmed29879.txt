"In brain-computer interfaces BCIs the typical models of the EEG observations usually lead to a poor estimation of the trial covariance matrices given the high non-stationarity of the EEG sources. We propose the application of two techniques that significantly improve the accuracy of these estimations and can be combined with a wide range of motor imagery BCI MI-BCI methods. The first one scales the observations in such a way that implicitly normalizes the common temporal strength of the source activities. When the scaling applies independently to the trials of the observations the procedure justifies and improves the classical preprocessing for the EEG data. In addition when the scaling is instantaneous and independent for each sample the procedure particularizes to Tylers method in statistics for obtaining a distribution-free estimate of scattering. In this case the proposal provides an original interpretation of this existing method as a technique that pursuits an implicit instantaneous power-normalization of the underlying source processes. The second technique applies to the classifier and improves its performance through a convenient regularization of the features covariance matrix. Experimental tests reveal that a combination of the proposed techniques with the state-of-the-art algorithms for motor-imagery classification provides a significant improvement in the classification results."
