When a person recognizes an error during a task an error-related potential ErrP can be measured as response. It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time-discrete feedback which is widely applied in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs for error correction or adaptation. However there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study we wanted to answer three different questions: i Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography EEG recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? ii Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? iii Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error execution error due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error due to not achieving the goal of an action. We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response we show that also a continuous asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG.
