Psychotic disorders are characterized by a deranged immune system including altered number and function of Natural Killer NK and T cells.

Exposure to social adversity during early life is particularly relevant to psychosis risk and is thought to increase reactivity to subsequent minor daily social stressors. Virtual reality allows controlled experimental exposure to virtual social stressors. Th17/T regulator cell balance and NK cell numbers in relation to psychosis liability and social stress reactivity.
