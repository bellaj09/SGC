Laparoscopic surgery has become the standard of care for many surgical diseases. Haptic tactile feedback HFB is considered an important component of laparoscopic surgery. Virtual reality simulation VRS is an alternative method to teach surgical skills to surgeons in training. Newer VRS trainers such as the Simbionix Lap Mentor II provide significantly improved tactile feedback. However VRSs are expensive and adding HFB software adds an estimated cost of $30000 to the commercial price. The HFB provided by the Lap Mentor II has not been validated by an independent party. We used the Simbionix Lap Mentor II in this study to demonstrate the effect of adding an HFB mechanism in the VRS trainer. The role of haptic feedback in laparoscopic training using the LapMentor II.
