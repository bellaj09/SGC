"Since a perception-action coupling type of control Kugler P.N. and Turvey M.T. Information Natural Law and Self-Assembly of Rhythmic Movements Erlbaum Hillsdale 1987 481 pp. continuously operates during locomotor pointing tasks e.g. long jumping Montagne G. Cornus S. Glize D. Quaine F. and Laurent M. A perception-action coupling type of control in long-jumping. J. Motor Behav. 2000 in press the information sources underlying this control have to be dealt with. Under the assumption that subjects use information about the first-order time remaining before they pass the target we identify in the literature four different sources of information that specify this physical property. Only one of these sources is inevitably present under all possible environmental conditions containing at least a continuously visible target on the floor. This study aimed to test its sufficiency to perform a locomotor pointing task. The use of a virtual reality set-up permitted us to compare locomotor pointing executed with all four information sources or only with the aforementioned one. The likeness found between those two conditions as far as the pointing performance and the mode of control are concerned expresses the evoked sufficiency."
