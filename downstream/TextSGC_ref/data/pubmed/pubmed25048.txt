Sensor arrays used to detect electrophysiological signals from the brain are paramount in neuroscience. However the number of sensors that can be interfaced with macroscopic data acquisition systems currently limits their bandwidth. This bottleneck originates in the fact that typically sensors are addressed individually requiring a connection for each of them. Herein we present the concept of frequency-division multiplexing FDM of neural signals by graphene sensors. We demonstrate the high performance of graphene transistors as mixers to perform amplitude modulation AM of neural signals in situ which is used to transmit multiple signals through a shared metal line. This technology eliminates the need for switches remarkably simplifying the technical complexity of state-of-the-art multiplexed neural probes. Besides the scalability of FDM graphene neural probes has been thoroughly evaluated and their sensitivity demonstrated in vivo. Using this technology we envision a new generation of high-count conformal neural probes for high bandwidth brain machine interfaces.
