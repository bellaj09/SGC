"Connectomics has enhanced our understanding of neurocognitive development and decline by the integration of network sciences into studies across different stages of the human life span. However these studies commonly occurred independently missing the opportunity to test integrated models of the dynamical brain organization across the entire life span. In this review article we survey empirical findings in life-span connectomics and propose a generative framework for computationally modeling the connectome over the human life span. This framework highlights initial findings that across the life span the human connectome gradually shifts from an anatomically driven organization to one that is more topological. Finally we consider recent advances that are promising to provide an integrative and systems perspective of human brain plasticity as well as underscore the pitfalls and challenges."
