We propose a new method for breast cancer screening from DCE-MRI based on a post-hoc approach that is trained using weakly annotated data i.e. labels are available only at the image level without any lesion delineation. Our proposed post-hoc method automatically diagnosis the whole volume and for positive cases it localizes the malignant lesions that led to such diagnosis. Conversely traditional approaches follow a pre-hoc approach that initially localises suspicious areas that are subsequently classified to establish the breast malignancy - this approach is trained using strongly annotated data i.e. it needs a delineation and classification of all lesions in an image. We also aim to establish the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches when applied to breast screening from DCE-MRI. Relying on experiments on a breast DCE-MRI dataset that contains scans of 117 patients our results show that the post-hoc method is more accurate for diagnosing the whole volume per patient achieving an AUC of 0.91 while the pre-hoc method achieves an AUC of 0.81. However the performance for localising the malignant lesions remains challenging for the post-hoc method due to the weakly labelled dataset employed during training.
