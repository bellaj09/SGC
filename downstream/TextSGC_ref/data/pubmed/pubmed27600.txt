The P300 speller is intended to restore communication to patients with advanced neuromuscular disorders but clinical implementation may be hindered by several factors including system setup burden and cost. Our goal was to develop a method that can overcome these barriers by optimizing EEG electrode number and placement for P300 studies within a population of subjects. A method for optimizing EEG electrode number and configuration for signal acquisition in P300 speller systems.
