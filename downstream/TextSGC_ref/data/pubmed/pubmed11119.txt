A new method is presented for producing photo collages that preserve content correlation of photos. We use deep learning techniques to find correlation among given photos to facilitate their embedding on the canvas and develop an efficient combinatorial optimization technique to make correlated photos stay close to each other. To make efficient use of canvas space our method first extracts salient regions of photos and packs only these salient regions. We allow the salient regions to have arbitrary shapes therefore yielding informative yet more compact collages than by other similar collage methods based on salient regions. We present extensive experimental results user study results and comparisons against the state-of-the-art methods to show the superiority of our method. Correlation-Preserving Photo Collage.
