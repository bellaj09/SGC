"Health self-efficacy or the beliefs in ones capabilities to perform health behaviors is a significant factor in eliciting health behavior change such as weight loss. Research has demonstrated that virtual embodiment has the potential to alter ones psychology and physicality particularly in health contexts; however little is known about the impacts embodiment in a virtual world has on health self-efficacy. The present research is a randomized controlled trial N\u2009=\u200990 examining the effectiveness of virtual embodiment and play in a social virtual world Second Life SL for increasing health self-efficacy exercise and nutrition efficacy among overweight adults. Participants were randomly assigned to a 3D social virtual world avatar virtual interaction experimental condition 2D social networking site no avatar virtual interaction control condition or no intervention no virtual interaction control condition. The findings of this study provide initial evidence for the use of SL to improve exercise efficacy and to support weight loss. Results also suggest that individuals who have higher self-presence with their avatar reap more benefits. Finally quantitative findings are triangulated with qualitative data to increase confidence in the results and provide richer insight into the perceived effectiveness and limitations of SL for meeting weight loss goals. Themes resulting from the qualitative analysis indicate that participation in SL can improve motivation and efficacy to try new physical activities; however individuals who have a dislike for video games may not be benefitted by avatar-based virtual interventions. Implications for research on the transformative potential of virtual embodiment and self-presence in general are discussed."
