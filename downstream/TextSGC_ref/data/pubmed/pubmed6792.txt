Disease diagnosis is one of the major data mining questions by the clinicians. The current diagnosis models usually have a strong assumption that one patient has only one disease i.e. a single-label data mining problem. But the patients especially when at the late stages may have more than one disease and require a multi-label diagnosis. The multi-label data mining is much more difficult than a single-label one and very few algorithms have been developed for this situation. Deep learning is a data mining algorithm with highly dense inner structure and has achieved many successful applications in the other areas. We propose a hypothesis that rectified-linear-unit-based deep learning algorithm may also be good at the clinical questions by revising the last layer as a multi-label output. The proof-of-concept experimental data support the hypothesis and the community may be interested in trying more applications.
