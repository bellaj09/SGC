Brain-computer interface BCI refers to procedures that link the central nervous system to a device. BCI was historically performed using electroencephalography EEG. In the last years encouraging results were obtained by combining EEG with other neuroimaging technologies such as functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. A crucial step of BCI is brain state classification from recorded signal features. Deep artificial neural networks DNNs recently reached unprecedented complex classification outcomes. These performances were achieved through increased computational power efficient learning algorithms valuable activation functions and restricted or back-fed neurons connections. By expecting significant overall BCI performances we investigated the capabilities of combining EEG and fNIRS recordings with state-of-the-art deep learning procedures.
