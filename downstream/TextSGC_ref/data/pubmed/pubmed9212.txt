Introduction Cone beam computed\xa0tomography CBCT plays an important role in image-guided radiation therapy IGRT while having disadvantages of severe shading artifact caused by the reconstruction using scatter contaminated and truncated projections.\xa0The purpose of this study is to\xa0develop a deep convolutional neural network DCNN method for improving CBCT image quality. Methods CBCT and planning computed tomography pCT image pairs from 20 prostate cancer patients were selected. Subsequently each pCT volume was pre-aligned to the corresponding CBCT volume by image registration thereby leading to registered pCT data pCTr. Next a 39-layer DCNN model was trained to learn a direct mapping from the CBCT to the corresponding pCTr\xa0images. The trained model was applied to a new CBCT data set to obtain improved CBCT i-CBCT images. The resulting i-CBCT images were compared to pCTr\xa0using the spatial non-uniformity SNU the peak-signal-to-noise ratio PSNR and the structural similarity index measure SSIM. Results The image quality of the i-CBCT has shown a substantial improvement on spatial uniformity compared to that of the original CBCT and a significant improvement on the PSNR and the SSIM compared to that of the original CBCT and the enhanced CBCT by the existing pCT-based correction method. Conclusion We have developed a DCNN method for improving CBCT image quality. The proposed method may be directly applicable to CBCT images acquired by any commercial CBCT scanner.
