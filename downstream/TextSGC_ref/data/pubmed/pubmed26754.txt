Since the 1940s electrocorticography ECoG devices and more recently in the last decade micro-electrocorticography ECoG cortical electrode arrays were used for a wide set of experimental and clinical applications such as epilepsy localization and braincomputer interface BCI technologies. Miniaturized implantable ECoG devices have the advantage of providing greater-density neural signal acquisition and stimulation capabilities in a minimally invasive fashion. An increased spatial resolution of the ECoG array will be useful for greater specificity diagnosis and treatment of neuronal diseases and the advancement of basic neuroscience and BCI research. In this review recent achievements of ECoG and ECoG are discussed. The electrode configurations and varying material choices used to design ECoG arrays are discussed including advantages and disadvantages of ECoG technology compared to electroencephalography EEG ECoG and intracortical electrode arrays. Electrode materials that are the primary focus include platinum iridium oxide poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene PEDOT indium tin oxide ITO and graphene. We discuss the biological immune response to ECoG devices compared to other electrode array types the role of ECoG in clinical pathology and braincomputer interface technology. The information presented in this review will be helpful to understand the current status organize available knowledge and guide future clinical and research applications of ECoG technologies. Progress in the Field of Micro-Electrocorticography.
