Temporomandibular joint TMJ arthroscopic procedures require the identification of a skin puncture point. The puncture point is conventionally estimated using the surface anatomy of the canthal-tragus line. However the conventional puncture technique has been reported to fail at the first attempt in 18% of cases. We propose an augmented reality AR system-based method to identify the puncture point on the skin. A three-dimensional virtual model was reconstructed from computed tomography images of a cadaver head and its rendered image was superimposed on the cadaver head before skin puncture. The skin puncture point was marked on the skin under the guidance of the AR system. The TMJ was punctured through the mark and the endoscope was introduced through the puncture point. The outcome of the procedure was classified as successful or unsuccessful based on the visualization of the TMJ. The system was applied on the left and right sides of three cadaver heads. Puncture with the AR method was successful in all six cases. This study presents a system to provide AR visualization during TMJ arthrocentesis to increase the precision of skin puncture. However a comparative study of the AR method with the conventional method is required to evaluate its advantages. Augmented reality for temporomandibular joint arthrocentesis: a cadaver study.
