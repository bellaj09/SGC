Gene Ontology GO has been widely used to annotate functions of proteins and understand their biological roles. Currently only <1% of >70 million proteins in UniProtKB have experimental GO annotations implying the strong necessity of automated function prediction AFP of proteins where AFP is a hard multilabel classification problem due to one protein with a diverse number of GO terms. Most of these proteins have only sequences as input information indicating the importance of sequence-based AFP SAFP: sequences are the only input. Furthermore homology-based SAFP tools are competitive in AFP competitions while they do not necessarily work well for so-called difficult proteins which have <60% sequence identity to proteins with annotations already. Thus the vital and challenging problem now is how to develop a method for SAFP particularly for difficult proteins.
