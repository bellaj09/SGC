Endoscopic piriformis release EPR is among the available treatments for piriformis syndrome. This procedure typically involves dividing the muscle near the sciatic nerve in the sub-gluteal space which contains numerous blood vessels and nerves. The objectives of this prospective cadaver study were: 1 to assess the reproducibility and quality of endoscopic piriformis tenotomy near the greater trochanter; 2 to detect iatrogenic injuries to the lateral hip rotators nerves and vessels; 3 and to define the surgical safety margins relative to the sciatic nerve and inferior gluteal bundle. Does endoscopic piriformis tenotomy provide safe and complete tendon release? A cadaver study.
