Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mentored simulation training ST in coronary angiography and to assess the transferability of acquired skills from virtual reality to the real world. Twenty cardiology residents were randomized to ST or control before performing real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. The control group underwent secondary ST and reperformed real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. Skill metrics were compared between the ST and the control group and within the control group between before and after ST. In real-life cases the procedure time was shorter p\u202f=\u202f0.002 the radiation dose lower p\u202f=\u202f0.001 and the global procedure skill score was higher p\u202f=\u202f0.0001 in the ST group as compared with the control before ST group. During virtual ST procedural time p <0.001 fluoroscopic time p <0.001 training contrast amount p <0.001 and global training score p <0.001 significantly decreased. In the control group all monitoring procedure parameters were significantly improved after ST as well as the global procedure flow score p <0.0001. In conclusion simulator-based training in coronary angiography improved operator skills compared with traditional in catheterization laboratory mentor-based training. ST should be incorporated in the curriculum of the interventionalist to improve learning in coronary angiography.
