This paper discusses how interactive neurorehabilitation systems can increase their effectiveness through systematic integration of media arts principles and practice. Media arts expertise can foster the development of complex yet intuitive extrinsic feedback displays that match the inherent complexity and intuitive nature of motor learning. Abstract arts-based feedback displays can be powerful metaphors that provide re-contextualization engagement and appropriate reward mechanisms for mature adults. Such virtual feedback displays must be seamlessly integrated with physical components to produce mixed reality training environments that promote active generalizable learning. The proposed approaches are illustrated through examples from mixed reality rehabilitation systems developed by our team. Utilizing media arts principles for developing effective interactive neurorehabilitation systems.
