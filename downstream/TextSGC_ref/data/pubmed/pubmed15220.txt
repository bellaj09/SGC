When used in educational settings simulations utilizing virtual reality VR technologies can reduce training costs while providing a safe and effective learning environment. Tasks can be easily modified to maximize learning objectives of different levels of trainees e.g. novice intermediate expert and can be repeated for the development of psychomotor skills. VR offers a multisensory experience providing visual auditory and haptic sensations with varying levels of fidelity. While simulating visual and auditory stimuli is relatively easy and cost-effective similar representations of haptic sensation still require further development. Evidence suggests that mixing high- and low-fidelity realistic sensations e.g. audition and haptic can improve the overall perception of realism however whether this also leads to improved performance has not been examined. The current study examined whether audiohaptic stimuli presented in a virtual drilling task can lead to improved motor performance and subjective realism compared to auditory stimuli alone. Right-handed participants n = 16 completed 100 drilling trials of each stimulus type. Performance measures indicated that participants overshot the target during auditory trials and undershot the target during audiohaptic trials. Undershooting is thought to be indicative of improved performance optimizing both time and energy requirements.
