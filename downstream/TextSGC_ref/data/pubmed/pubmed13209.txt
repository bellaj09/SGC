Metabolomics holds the promise as a new technology to diagnose highly heterogeneous diseases. Conventionally metabolomics data analysis for diagnosis is done using various statistical and machine learning based classification methods. However it remains unknown if deep neural network a class of increasingly popular machine learning methods is suitable to classify metabolomics data. Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues 204 positive estrogen receptor ER+ and 67 negative estrogen receptor ER- to test the accuracies of feed-forward networks a deep learning DL framework as well as six widely used machine learning models namely random forest RF support vector machines SVM recursive partitioning and regression trees RPART linear discriminant analysis LDA prediction analysis for microarrays PAM and generalized boosted models GBM. DL framework has the highest area under the curve AUC of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER- patients compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways adjusted P-value <0.05 that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them protein digestion and absorption and ATP-binding cassette ABC transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification with both the highest prediction accuracy AUC = 0.93 and better revelation of disease biology. We encourage the adoption of feed-forward networks based deep learning method in the metabolomics research community for classification.
