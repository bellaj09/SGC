Multi-label classification of data remains to be a challenging problem. Because of the complexity of the data it is sometimes difficult to infer information about classes that are not mutually exclusive. For medical data patients could have symptoms of multiple different diseases at the same time and it is important to develop tools that help to identify problems early. Intelligent health risk prediction models built with deep learning architectures offer a powerful tool for physicians to identify patterns in patient data that indicate risks associated with certain types of chronic diseases. Deep learning architectures for multi-label classification of intelligent health risk prediction.
