Knee osteoarthritis OA is a common disease that impairs knee function and causes pain. Radiologists usually review knee X-ray images and grade the severity of the impairments according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scheme. However this approach becomes inefficient in hospitals with high throughput as it is time-consuming tedious and also subjective. This paper introduces a model for automatic diagnosis of knee OA based on an end-to-end deep learning method. Toward automatic quantification of knee osteoarthritis severity using improved Faster R-CNN.
