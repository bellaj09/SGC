"The aim of this study was to investigate if a machine learning algorithm utilizing triaxial accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer data from an inertial motion unit IMU could detect surface- and age-related differences in walking. Seventeen older 71.5\u202f\u202f4.2\u202fyears and eighteen young 27.0\u202f\u202f4.7\u202fyears healthy adults walked over flat and uneven brick surfaces wearing an inertial measurement unit IMU over the L5 vertebra. IMU data were binned into smaller data segments using 4-s sliding windows with 1-s step lengths. Ninety percent of the data were used as training inputs and the remaining ten percent were saved for testing. A deep learning network with long short-term memory units was used for training fully supervised prediction and implementation. Four models were trained using the following inputs: all nine channels from every sensor in the IMU fully trained model accelerometer signals alone gyroscope signals alone and magnetometer signals alone. The fully trained models for surface and age outperformed all other models area under the receiver operator curve AUC\u202f=\u202f0.97 and 0.96 respectively; p\u202f\u202f.045. The fully trained models for surface and age had high accuracy 96.3 94.7% precision 96.4 95.2% recall 96.3 94.7% and f1-score 96.3 94.6%. These results demonstrate that processing the signals of a single IMU device with machine-learning algorithms enables the detection of surface conditions and age-group status from an individuals walking behavior which with further learning may be utilized to facilitate identifying and intervening on fall risk." Machine learning algorithms based on signals from a single wearable inertial sensor can detect surface- and age-related differences in walking.
