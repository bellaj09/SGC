The diagnosis of most cancers is made by a board-certified pathologist based on a tissue biopsy under the microscope. Recent research reveals a high discordance between individual pathologists. For melanoma the literature reports 25-26% of discordance for classifying a benign nevus versus malignant melanoma. Deep learning was successfully implemented to enhance the precision of lung\xa0and breast cancer diagnoses. The aim of this study is to illustrate the potential of deep learning to assist human assessment for a histopathologic melanoma diagnosis. Pathologist-level classification of histopathological melanoma images with deep neural networks.
