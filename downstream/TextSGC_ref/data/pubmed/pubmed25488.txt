"The current study examined whether exposure to sexually objectifying images in a potential romantic partners virtual apartment affects discrepancies between peoples perception of their own appearance i.e. self-perceptions and their perception of the body ideal that is considered desirable to a romantic partner i.e. partner-ideals. Participants were 114 heterosexual undergraduate students 57 women and 57 men from a northeastern U.S. university. The study used a 2 Participant Gender x 2 Virtual Environment: Sexualized vs. Non-Sexualized between-subjects design. We predicted that women exposed to sexually objectifying images in a virtual environment would report greater discrepancies between their self-perceptions and partner-ideals than men which in turn would contribute to womens body consciousness. Findings support this hypothesis and show that perceived discrepancies account for the relationship between exposure to sexually objectifying images and body consciousness for women but not men. We also found gender asymmetries in objectification responses when each component of perceived discrepancies i.e. self-perceptions versus perceptions of a romantic partners body ideal were examined separately. For men exposure to muscular sexualized images was significantly associated with their self-perceptions but not their perceptions of the body size that is considered desirable to a romantic partner. For women exposure to thin sexualized images was significantly associated with their perceptions that a romantic partner preferred a woman with a smaller body size. However exposure to these images did not affect womens self-perceptions. Implications for gender asymmetries in objectification responses and perceived discrepancies that include a romantic partners perceptions are discussed."
