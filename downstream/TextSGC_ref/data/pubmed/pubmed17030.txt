For classification tasks it is always desirable to extract features that are most effective for preserving class separability. In this brief we propose a new feature extraction method called regularized deep Fisher mapping RDFM which learns an explicit mapping from the sample space to the feature space using a deep neural network to enhance the separability of features according to the Fisher criterion. Compared to kernel methods the deep neural network is a deep and nonlocal learning architecture and therefore exhibits more powerful ability to learn the nature of highly variable datasets from fewer samples. To eliminate the side effects of overfitting brought about by the large capacity of powerful learners regularizers are applied in the learning procedure of RDFM. RDFM is evaluated in various types of datasets and the results reveal that it is necessary to apply unsupervised regularization in the fine-tuning phase of deep learning. Thus for very flexible models the optimal Fisher feature extractor may be a balance between discriminative ability and descriptive ability. Deep learning regularized Fisher mappings.
