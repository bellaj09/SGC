In recent years the readiness potential RP a type of pre-movement neural activity has been investigated for asynchronous electroencephalogram EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Since the RP is attenuated for involuntary movements a BCI driven by RP alone could facilitate intentional control amid a plethora of unintentional movements. Previous studies have attempted single trial classification of RP via spatial and temporal filtering methods or by combining the RP with event-related desynchronization. However RP feature extraction remains challenging due to the slow non-oscillatory nature of the potential its variability among participants and the inherent noise in EEG signals. Here we propose a participant-specific individually optimized pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering PSTF to improve RP feature extraction for laterality prediction. A pipeline of spatio-temporal filtering for predicting the laterality of self-initiated fine movements from single trial readiness potentials.
