Nurses serve a valuable role in the healthcare industry. Nurses are trained with the skills and knowledge to thrive in a fast-paced evolving environment. In order to meet the complex and diverse needs of patients nurses must be able to assess and prioritize care to produce safe and high-quality outcomes. Simulation is an established method of educating nursing students and preparing nurses to respond appropriately to situations they are likely to encounter in practice. Traditional nursing simulation devices are prohibitively expensive for many nursing education institutions. The development of augmented mixed and virtual reality simulation delivery offers a new platform for simulation known as immersive simulation. Immersive simulation can virtually place nursing students in situations that are difficult to arrange in actual clinical practicums or that occur rarely but for which nurses need to be prepared. Additionally the hardware required to deliver immersive simulation is much cheaper than that of traditional nursing simulation devices. This chapter describes the virtual standardized patient application delivered via mixed reality immersive simulation. This chapter also discusses the research initiative currently underway to assess student perceptions to this modality of health training simulation.
