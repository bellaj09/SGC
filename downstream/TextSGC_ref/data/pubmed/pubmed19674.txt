Interventional Radiology IR is a minimally-invasive surgery technique MIS where guidewires and catheters are steered in the vascular system under X-ray imaging. In order to perform these procedures a radiologist has to be correctly trained to master hand-eye coordination instrument manipulation and procedure protocols. This paper proposes a computer-assisted training environment dedicated to IR. The system is composed of a virtual reality VR simulation of the anatomy of the patient linked to a robotic interface providing haptic force feedback.The paper focuses on the requirements design and prototyping of a specific part of the haptic interface dedicated to catheters. Translational tracking and force feedback on the catheter is provided by two cylinders forming a friction drive arrangement. The whole friction can be set in rotation with an additional motor providing torque feedback. A force and a torque sensor are integrated in the cylinders for direct measurement on the catheter enabling disturbance cancellation with a close-loop force control strategy. A real-time haptic interface for interventional radiology procedures.
