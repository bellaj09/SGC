Coherence and causality measures are often used to analyze the influence of one region on another during analysis of functional brain networks. The analysis methods usually involve a regression problem where the signal of interest is decomposed into a mixture of regressor and a residual signal. In this paper we revisit this basic problem and present solutions that provide the minimal-entropy residuals for different types of regression filters such as causal instantaneously causal and noncausal filters. Using optimal prediction theory we derive several novel frequency-domain expressions for partial coherence causality and conditional causality analysis. In particular our solution provides a more accurate estimation of the frequency-domain causality compared with the classical Geweke causality measure. Using synthetic examples and in vivo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the human connectome project we show that the proposed solution is more accurate at revealing frequency-domain linear dependence among high-dimensional signals.
