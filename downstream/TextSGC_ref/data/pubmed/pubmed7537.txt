Current liver fibrosis scoring by computer-assisted image analytics is not fully automated as it requires manual preprocessing segmentation and feature extraction typically based on domain knowledge in liver pathology. Deep learning-based algorithms can potentially classify these images without the need for preprocessing through learning from a large dataset of images. We investigated the performance of classification models built using a deep learning-based algorithm pre-trained using multiple sources of images to score liver fibrosis and compared them against conventional non-deep learning-based algorithms - artificial neural networks ANN multinomial logistic regression MLR support vector machines SVM and random forests RF. Automated feature classification and fibrosis scoring were achieved by using a transfer learning-based deep learning network AlexNet-Convolutional Neural Networks CNN with balanced area under receiver operating characteristic AUROC values of up to 0.85-0.95 versus ANN AUROC of up to 0.87-1.00 MLR AUROC of up to 0.73-1.00 SVM AUROC of up to 0.69-0.99 and RF AUROC of up to 0.94-0.99. Results indicate that a deep learning-based algorithm with transfer learning enables the construction of a fully automated and accurate prediction model for scoring liver fibrosis stages that is comparable to other conventional non-deep learning-based algorithms that are not fully automated. Deep learning enables automated scoring of liver fibrosis stages.
