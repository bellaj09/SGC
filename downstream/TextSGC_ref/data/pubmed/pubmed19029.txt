Attentional and working memory WM processes undergo significant changes during different stages of development. However currently there are not many continuous performance tools based on virtual reality VR for measuring attentional capacity in adults. The present study aimed to obtain normative data for the Nesplora Aquarium VR test in a Spanish population looking at sex and age variables. In addition this study also aimed to analyze the psychometric properties of the tool such as scale internal consistency and item difficulty and discrimination indices. A total of 1469 participants from different regions of Spain 57.6% female with ages ranging from 16 to 90\u2009years old took part in this normative study. Nesplora Aquarium was developed in order to support clinicians in the assessment of attentional processes and WM in adults over 16\u2009years old. It is an 18-minute individual test performed through a VR system. The system provides better visual and auditory immersion in the task than computerized CPTs. This study revealed that the new VR tool designed to measure adult attention and working memory levels exhibited good psychometric properties related to reliability and internal consistency. In addition item difficulty and discrimination values were also acceptable. New virtual reality tool Nesplora Aquarium for assessing attention and working memory in adults: A normative study.
