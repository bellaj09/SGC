There has been growing interest in the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rsfMRI for the assessment of disease and treatment and a number of studies have reported significant disease-related changes in resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent BOLD signal amplitude and functional connectivity. rsfMRI is particularly suitable for clinical applications because the approach does not require the patient to perform a task and scans can be obtained in a relatively short amount of time. However the mechanisms underlying resting-state BOLD activity are not well understood and thus the interpretation of changes in resting state activity is not always straightforward. The BOLD signal represents the hemodynamic response to neural activity and changes in resting-state activity can reflect a complex combination of neural vascular and metabolic factors. This paper examines the role of neurovascular factors in rsfMRI and reviews approaches for the interpretation and analysis of resting state measures in the presence of confounding factors.
