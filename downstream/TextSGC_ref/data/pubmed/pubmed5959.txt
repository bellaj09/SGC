"Barrett cancer is a treatable disease when detected at an early stage. However current screening protocols are often not effective at finding the disease early. Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy VLE is a promising new imaging tool for finding dysplasia in Barretts esophagus BE at an early stage by acquiring cross-sectional images of the microscopic structure of BE up to 3-mm deep. However interpretation of VLE scans is difficult for medical doctors due to both the size and subtlety of the gray-scale data. Therefore algorithms that can accurately find cancerous regions are very valuable for the interpretation of VLE data. In this study we propose a fully-automatic multi-step Computer-Aided Detection CAD algorithm that optimally leverages the effectiveness of deep learning strategies by encoding the principal dimension in VLE data. Additionally we show that combining the encoded dimensions with conventional machine learning techniques further improves results while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore we train and validate our algorithm on a new histopathologically validated set of in-vivo VLE snapshots. Additionally an independent test set is used to assess the performance of the model. Finally we compare the performance of our algorithm against previous state-of-the-art systems. With the encoded principal dimension we obtain an Area Under the Curve AUC and F1 score of 0.93 and 87.4% on the test set respectively. We show this is a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.89 and 83.1% respectively thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."
