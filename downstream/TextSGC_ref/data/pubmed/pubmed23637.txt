The benefits of multi-detector row CT MDCT relative to single-detector row helical CT are considerable. Multi-detector row CT allows shorter acquisition times greater coverage and superior image resolution. These factors substantially increase the diagnostic accuracy of the examination. Three-dimensional 3D volume data from MDCT provides various unique applications on thoracic diseases. These includes isotropic viewings use of multiplanar reformation MPR maximum and minimum intensity projections MIP and minIP and volume rendering performed from external and internal perspectives allowing the user to "fly around" and "fly through" the structures. Recent advances in 3D volume rendering put real-time interactive virtual reality guidance of the procedures such as bronchoscopy and surgery into practice.
