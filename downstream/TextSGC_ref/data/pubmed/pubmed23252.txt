"A fully implantable brain-computer interface BCI can be a practical tool to restore independence to those affected by spinal cord injury. We envision that such a BCI system will invasively acquire brain signals e.g. electrocorticogram and translate them into control commands for external prostheses. The feasibility of such a system was tested by implementing its benchtop analogue centered around a commercial ultra-low power ULP digital signal processor DSP TMS320C5517 Texas Instruments. A suite of signal processing and BCI algorithms including demultiplexing Fast Fourier Transform power spectral density principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis Bayes rule and finite state machine was implemented and tested in the DSP. The systems signal acquisition fidelity was tested and characterized by acquiring harmonic signals from a function generator. In addition the BCI decoding performance was tested first with signals from a function generator and subsequently using human electroencephalogram EEG during eyes opening and closing task. On average the system spent 322 ms to process and analyze 2 s of data. Crosstalk <;-65 dB and harmonic distortion ~1% were minimal. Timing jitter averaged 49 s per 1000 ms. The online BCI decoding accuracies were 100% for both function generator and EEG data. These results show that a complex BCI algorithm can be executed on an ULP DSP without compromising performance. This suggests that the proposed hardware platform may be used as a basis for future fully implantable BCI systems."
