The successful motor rehabilitation of stroke traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients requires an intensive and task-specific therapy approach. Budget constraints limit a hand-to-hand therapy approach so that intelligent machines may offer a solution to promote motor recovery and obtain a better understanding of motor control. This new field of automated or robot-assisted motor rehabilitation has emerged since the 1990s. Upper and lower extremity robotic devices for rehabilitation and for studying motor control.
