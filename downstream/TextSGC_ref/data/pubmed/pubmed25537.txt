"The significant proportion of severe psychological problems related to intensive stress in recent large peacekeeping operations underscores the importance of effective methods for strengthening the prevention and treatment of stress-related disorders. Adaptive control of virtual reality VR stimulation presented in this work based on estimation of the persons emotional state from physiological signals may enhance existing stress inoculation training SIT. Physiology-driven adaptive VR stimulation can tailor the progress of stressful stimuli delivery to the physiological characteristics of each individual which is indicated for improvement in stress resistance. Following an overview of physiology-driven adaptive VR stimulation its major functional subsystems are described in more detail. A specific algorithm of stimuli delivery applicable to SIT is outlined." Physiology-driven adaptive virtual reality stimulation for prevention and treatment of stress related disorders.
