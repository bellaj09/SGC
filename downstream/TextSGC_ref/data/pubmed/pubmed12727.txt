Bone age assessment plays an important role in the endocrinology and genetic investigation of patients. In this paper we proposed a deep learning-based approach for bone age assessment by integration of the Tanner-Whitehouse TW3 methods and deep convolution networks based on extracted regions of interest ROI-detection and classification using Faster-RCNN and Inception-v4 networks respectively. The proposed method allows exploration of expert knowledge from TW3 and features engineering from deep convolution networks to enhance the accuracy of bone age assessment. The experimental results showed a mean absolute error of about 0.59 years between expert radiologists and the proposed method which is the best performance among state-of-the-art methods. Incorporated region detection and classification using deep convolutional networks for bone age assessment.
