This study examined how encoding and retrieval factors affected directed forgetting costs and benefits in an item-method procedure. Experiment 1 used a typical item-method procedure and revealed a levels-of-processing effect in overall recall. However the deep encoding condition showed a smaller directed forgetting effect than the shallow encoding conditions. More importantly "remember" R words were selectively rehearsed as indicated by greater recall from the primacy portion of the list and more apt to be recalled before "forget" F words. Experiment 2 showed that a deep encoding operation reduced directed forgetting costs and that directed forgetting benefits occurred only when R words were recalled before F words. These findings supported the hypotheses that encoding manipulation affected directed forgetting costs and that directed forgetting benefits were associated with output order bias. Results were discussed in terms of mechanisms that produce item-method directed forgetting. Costs and benefits in item-method directed forgetting: differential effects of encoding and retrieval.
