Even though virtual reality VR is increasingly used in rehabilitation the implementation of walking navigation in VR still poses a technological challenge for current motion tracking systems. Different metaphors simulate locomotion without involving real gait kinematics which can affect presence orientation spatial memory and cognition and even performance. All these factors can dissuade their use in rehabilitation. We hypothesize that a marker-based head tracking solution would allow walking in VR with high sense of presence and without causing sickness. The objectives of this study were to determine the accuracy the jitter and the lag of the tracking system and its elicited sickness and presence in comparison of a CAVE system. Feasibility of a walking virtual reality system for rehabilitation: objective and subjective parameters.
