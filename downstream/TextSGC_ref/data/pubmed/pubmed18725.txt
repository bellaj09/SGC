Recently photo-selective vaporization of the prostate PVP has been a popular alternative to the standard electrocautery - transurethral resection of prostate TURP. Here we introduce a new training system for practicing the laser therapy by using a virtual reality VR simulator. To interactively and realistically simulate PVP on a virtual organ with an order of a quarter million elements a few novel and practical solutions have been applied to handle the challenges in modeling tissue ablation contact/collision and deformation; endoscopic instruments tracking haptic rendering and a web/database curriculum management module are integrated into the system. Over 40 urologists and surgical experts have been invited nationally and participated in the system verification. Laser surgery simulation platform: toward full-procedure training and rehearsal for benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH therapy.
