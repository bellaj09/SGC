Precise assessment of ligand bioactivities including IC50 EC50 Ki Kd etc. is essential for virtual screening and lead compound identification. However not all ligands have experimentally determined activities. In particular many G protein-coupled receptors GPCRs which are the largest integral membrane protein family and represent targets of nearly 40% drugs on the market lack published experimental data about ligand interactions. Computational methods with the ability to accurately predict the bioactivity of ligands can help efficiently address this problem. WDL-RF: predicting bioactivities of ligand molecules acting with G protein-coupled receptors by combining weighted deep learning and random forest.
