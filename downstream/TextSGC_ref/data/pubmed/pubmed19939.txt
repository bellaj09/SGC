Temporal bone simulations are critiqued for poor drill-bone interaction. This project appraises the import of increasing haptic device and manipulandum fidelity on the perceived realism of drilling a virtual temporal bone.Virtual surgical contact forces rely on haptic device fidelity and are transmitted through a manipulandum. With identical software both device hardware and manipulandum may each contribute to realism. We compare the three degrees of freedom DOF 3N Geomagic Touch 3D Systems SC to a 6DOF 5.5N HD2 Quanser ON with the both standard "HD2-Standard" and in-house customized otic drill manipulandum "HD2-Modified". Elements of virtual temporal bone surgery: Manipulandum format may be more important to surgeons than haptic device force capabilities.
