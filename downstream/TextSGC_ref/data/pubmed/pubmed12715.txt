"The differentiation of dementia with Lewy bodies DLB from Alzheimers disease AD using brain perfusion single photon emission tomography is important but is challenging because these conditions exhibit typical features. The cingulate island sign CIS is the most recently identified specific feature of DLB for a differential diagnosis. The current study aimed to examine the usefulness of deep-learning-based imaging classification for the diagnoses of DLB and AD. Furthermore we investigated whether CIS was emphasized by a deep convolutional neural network CNN during differentiation. Brain perfusion single photon emission tomography images from 80 patients each with DLB and AD and 80 individuals with normal cognition NL\xa0were used for training and 20 each for final testing. The CNN was trained on brain surface perfusion images. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping Grad-CAM was applied to the CNN to visualize the features that was emphasized by the trained CNN. The binary classifications between DLB and NL DLB and AD and AD and NL were 93.1% 89.3% and 92.4% accurate respectively. The CIS ratios closely correlated with the output scores before softmax for DLB-AD discrimination DLB/AD scores. The Grad-CAM highlighted CIS in the DLB discrimination. Visualization of learning process by guided Grad-CAM revealed that CIS became more focused by the CNN as the training progressed. The DLB/AD score was significantly associated with the three core features of DLB. Deep-learning-based imaging classification was useful for an objective and accurate differentiation of DLB from AD and for predicting clinical features of DLB. The CIS was identified as a specific feature during DLB classification. The visualization of specific features and learning processes could be critical in deep learning to discover new imaging features."
