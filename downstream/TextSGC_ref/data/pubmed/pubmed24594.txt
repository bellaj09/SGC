Because of high spatial-temporal resolution of neural signals obtained by invasive recording the invasive brain-machine interfaces BMI have achieved great progress in the past two decades. With success in animal research BMI technology is transferring to clinical trials for helping paralyzed people to restore their lost motor functions. This chapter gives a brief review of BMI development from animal experiments to human clinical studies in the following aspects: 1 BMIs based on rodent animals; 2 BMI based on non-human primates; and 3 pilot BMIs studies in clinical trials. In the end the chapter concludes with a summary of potential opportunities and future challenges in BMI technology. Invasive Brain Machine Interface System.
