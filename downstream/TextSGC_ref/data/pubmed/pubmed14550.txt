Changes in society and dissatisfaction with current educational practices have led to changes in undergraduate veterinary curricula. New approaches that are thought to better prepare students for future professional veterinary practice are being introduced. One such change is a transition from conventional teacher-centred curricula to student-centred curricula. In student-centred curricula students are actively involved in learning and teachers not only transmit knowledge but help students to obtain a deep understanding. Furthermore learning within these curricula takes place in a multi-disciplinary context which is more relevant for the future of the profession. Another change is that more emphasis is put on training in academic skills for instance by establishing research internships. Finally a new emphasis is being placed on training in more generic competencies such as communication and business skills. These changes are assumed to better suit the profile of veterinary students today and in the future and to better prepare them for future veterinary practice. Educational approaches aimed at preparing students for professional veterinary practice.
