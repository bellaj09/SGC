"Parkinsons disease PD is a multi-systemic disease in the brain arising from the dysfunction of several neural networks. The diagnosis and treatment of PD have gained more attention for clinical researchers. While there have been many fMRI studies about functional topological changes of PD patients whether the dynamic changes of functional connectivity can predict the drug therapy effect is still unclear. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether large-scale functional efficiency changes of topological network are detectable in PD patients and to explore whether the severity level UPDRS-III after drug treatment can be predicted by the pre-treatment resting-state fMRI rs-fMRI. Here we recruited 62 Parkinsons disease patients and calculated the dynamic nodal efficiency networks based on rs-fMRI. With connectome-based predictive models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator we demonstrated that the dynamic nodal efficiency properties predict drug therapy effect well. The contributed regions for the prediction include hippocampus post-central gyrus cingulate gyrus and orbital gyrus. Specifically the connections between hippocampus and cingulate gyrus hippocampus and insular gyrus insular gyrus and orbital gyrus are positively related to the recovery post-therapy severity level after drug therapy. The analysis of these connection features may provide important information for clinical treatment of PD patients."
