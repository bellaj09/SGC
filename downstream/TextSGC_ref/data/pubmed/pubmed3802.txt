"The existence of abnormal connectivity patterns between resting state networks in neuropsychiatric disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD has been well established. Traditional treatment methods in ASD are limited and do not address the aberrant network structure. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback we directly trained three brain nodes in participants with ASD in which the aberrant connectivity has been shown to correlate with symptom severity. Desired network connectivity patterns were reinforced in real-time without participants awareness of the training taking place. This training regimen produced large significant long-term changes in correlations at the network level and whole brain analysis revealed that the greatest changes were focused on the areas being trained. These changes were not found in the control group. Moreover changes in ASD resting state connectivity following the training were correlated to changes in behavior suggesting that neurofeedback can be used to directly alter complex clinically relevant network connectivity patterns."
