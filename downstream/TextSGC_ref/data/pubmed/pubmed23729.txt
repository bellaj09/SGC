Perceived upright depends on three main factors: vision graviception and the internal representation of the long axis of the body. We assessed the relative contributions of these factors in individuals with sub-acute and chronic stroke and controls using a novel tool; the Oriented Character Recognition Test OCHART. We also considered whether individuals who displayed active pushing or had a history of pushing behaviours had different weightings than those with no signs of pushing.
