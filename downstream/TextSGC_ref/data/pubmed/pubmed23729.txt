Spinal cord injury SCI can leave the affected individuals with paraparesis or paraplegia thus rendering them unable to ambulate. Since there are currently no restorative treatments for this population novel approaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought. Our recent studies show that a brain-computer interface BCI can be used to control ambulation within a virtual reality environment VRE suggesting that a BCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation may be feasible. However the operability of our BCI has not yet been tested in a SCI population. Operation of a brain-computer interface walking simulator for individuals with spinal cord injury.
