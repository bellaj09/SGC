Automated segmentation of object boundaries or surfaces is crucial for quantitative image analysis in numerous biomedical applications. For example retinal surfaces in optical coherence tomography OCT images play a vital role in the diagnosis and management of retinal diseases. Recently graph based surface segmentation and contour modeling have been developed and optimized for various surface segmentation tasks. These methods require expertly designed application specific transforms including cost functions constraints and model parameters. However deep learning based methods are able to directly learn the model and features from training data. In this paper we propose a convolutional neural network CNN based framework to segment multiple surfaces simultaneously. We demonstrate the application of the proposed method by training a single CNN to segment three retinal surfaces in two types of OCT images - normal retinas and retinas affected by intermediate age-related macular degeneration AMD. The trained network directly infers the segmentations for each B-scan in one pass. The proposed method was validated on 50 retinal OCT volumes 3000 B-scans including 25 normal and 25 intermediate AMD subjects. Our experiment demonstrated statistically significant improvement of segmentation accuracy compared to the optimal surface segmentation method with convex priors OSCS and two deep learning based UNET methods for both types of data. The average computation time for segmenting an entire OCT volume consisting of 60 B-scans each for the proposed method was 12.3 seconds demonstrating low computation costs and higher performance compared to the graph based optimal surface segmentation and UNET based methods.
