"Prioritization of variants in personal genomic data is a major challenge. Recently computational methods that rely on comparing phenotype similarity have shown to be useful to identify causative variants. In these methods pathogenicity prediction is combined with a semantic similarity measure to prioritize not only variants that are likely to be dysfunctional but those that are likely involved in the pathogenesis of a patients phenotype." DeepPVP: phenotype-based prioritization of causative variants using deep learning.
