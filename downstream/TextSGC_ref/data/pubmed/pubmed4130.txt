Gradient-echo GE echo-planar imaging EPI is the method of choice in blood-oxygenation level-dependent BOLD functional MRI fMRI studies as it demonstrates substantially higher BOLD sensitivity than its spin-echo SE counterpart. However it is also well known that the GE-EPI signal is prone to signal dropouts and shifts due to susceptibility effects near air-tissue interfaces. SE-EPI in contrast is minimally affected by these artifacts. In this study we quantify for the first time the sensitivity and specificity of SE and GE EPI for resting-state fMRI functional connectivity fcMRI mapping using the 1000-brain fcMRI atlas Yeo et al. 2011  as the pseudoground truth. Moreover we assess the influence of physiological processes on resting-state BOLD measured using both regular and ultrafast GE and SE acquisitions. Our work demonstrates that SE-EPI and GE-EPI are associated with similar sensitivities specificities and intersubject reproducibility in fcMRI for most brain networks generated using both seed-based analysis and independent component analysis. More importantly SE-based fcMRI measurements demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity specificity and intersubject reproducibility in high-susceptibility regions spanning the limbic and frontal networks in the 1000-brain atlas. In addition SE-EPI is significantly less sensitive to prominent sources of physiological noise including low-frequency respiratory volume and heart rate variations. Our work suggests that SE-EPI should be increasingly adopted in the study of networks spanning susceptibility-affected brain regions including those that are important to memory language and emotion.
