"Resting-state functional connectivity RSFC studies have provided strong evidences that visual deprivation influences the brains functional architecture. In particular reduced RSFC coupling between occipital visual and temporal auditory regions has been reliably observed in early blind individuals EB at rest. In contrast task-dependent activation studies have repeatedly demonstrated enhanced co-activation and connectivity of occipital and temporal regions during auditory processing in EB. To investigate this apparent discrepancy the functional coupling between temporal and occipital networks at rest was directly compared to that of an auditory task in both EB and sighted controls SC. Functional brain clusters shared across groups and cognitive states rest and auditory task were defined. In EBs we observed higher occipito-temporal correlations in activity during the task than at rest. The reverse pattern was observed in SC. We also observed higher temporal variability of occipito-temporal RSFC in EB suggesting that occipital regions in this population may play the role of a multiple demand system. Our study reveals how the connectivity profile of sighted and early blind people is differentially influenced by their cognitive state bridging the gap between previous task-dependent and RSFC studies. Our results also highlight how inferring group-differences in functional brain architecture solely based on resting-state acquisition has to be considered with caution."
