Estimating the future course of patients with cancer lesions is invaluable to physicians; however current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer patients. To tackle this problem we constructed a multimodal neural network-based model to predict the survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using clinical data mRNA expression data microRNA expression data and histopathology whole slide images WSIs. We developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four data modalities into a single feature vector for each patient handling missing data through a resilient multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored to each data type-using deep highway networks to extract features from clinical and genomic data and convolutional neural networks to extract features from WSIs. Deep learning with multimodal representation for pancancer prognosis prediction.
