Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft visual features e.g. Gabor wavelets or semantic labels or data-driven features e.g. features extracted from deep neural networks DNN. They also assume a linear mapping between feature representations to brain activity. However it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for maximizing prediction accuracy.
