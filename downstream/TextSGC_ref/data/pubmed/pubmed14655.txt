Automated segmentation of anatomical structures in medical image analysis is a prerequisite for autonomous diagnosis as well as various computer- and robot-aided interventions. Recent methods based on deep convolutional neural networks CNN have outperformed former heuristic methods. However those methods were primarily evaluated on rigid real-world environments. In this study existing segmentation methods were evaluated for their use on a new dataset of transoral endoscopic exploration. A dataset of laryngeal endoscopic images with comparative study on convolution neural network-based semantic segmentation.
