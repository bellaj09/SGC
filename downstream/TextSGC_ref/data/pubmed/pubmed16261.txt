The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography FDG-PET/CT offers an excellent negative predictive value. Consequently it is a reliable tool for excluding an infectious phenomenon in case of negativity. In case of persistent fever of unknown origin after cardiac surgery and in combination with other bacteriological examinations and medical imaging we can rely on FDG-PET/CT to confirm or eliminate deep infections and prosthetic endocarditis. For this reason FDG-PET/CT should be considered among the examinations to be performed in case of suspected infection after cardiac surgery. We have reported the case of a 76-year-old man who presented with a fever of unknown origin and recurrent septic shocks after a biological Bentall procedure combined with left anterior descending LAD coronary artery revascularization by the left internal thoracic artery. We performed a FDG-PET/CT which showed external iliac vein and right common femoral vein hyperfixation with infiltration of adjacent soft tissues highly suspected to be an infectious process.
