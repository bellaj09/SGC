"Alzheimers disease AD is a progressive brain disease. The goal of this study is to provide a new computer-vision based technique to detect it in an efficient way. The brain-imaging data of 98\xa0AD patients and 98 healthy controls was collected using data augmentation method. Then convolutional neural network CNN was used CNN is the most successful tool in deep learning. An 8-layer CNN was created with optimal structure obtained by experiences. Three activation functions AFs: sigmoid rectified linear unit ReLU and leaky ReLU. The three pooling-functions were also tested: average pooling max pooling and stochastic pooling. The numerical experiments demonstrated that leaky ReLU and max pooling gave the greatest result in terms of performance. It achieved a sensitivity of 97.96% a specificity of 97.35% and an accuracy of 97.65% respectively. In addition the proposed approach was compared with eight state-of-the-art approaches. The method increased the classification accuracy by approximately 5% compared to state-of-the-art methods."
