The utilization of surgical simulation continues to grow in medical training. The TouchSurgery application app is a new interactive virtual reality smartphone- or tablet-based app that offers a step-by-step tutorial and simulation for the execution of various operations. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the app versus traditional teaching modalities utilizing the "Carpal Tunnel Surgery" module. We hypothesized that users of the app would score higher than those using the traditional education medium indicating higher understanding of the steps of surgery.
