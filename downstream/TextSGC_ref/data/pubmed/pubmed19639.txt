Advances in computer technology will revolutionize surgical techniques in the next decade. The operating room OR of the future will be connected with a laboratory where clinical specialists and researchers prepare image-guided interventions and explore the possibilities of these techniques. The virtual reality is linked to the actual situation in the OR with the aid of navigation instruments. During complicated operations the images prepared preoperatively will be corrected during the operation on the basis of the information obtained peroperatively. MRI currently offers maximal possibilities for image-guided surgery of soft tissues. Simpler techniques such as fluoroscopy and echography will become increasingly integrated in computer-assisted peroperative navigation. The development of medical robot systems will make possible microsurgical procedures by the endoscopic route. Tele-manipulation systems will also play a part in the training of surgeons. Design and construction of the OR will be adapted to the surgical technology and include an information and control unit where preoperative and peroperative data come together and from where the surgeon operates the instruments. Concepts for the future OR should be regularly adjusted to allow for new surgical technology. The operating room of the future.
