Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are driven essentially by algorithms; however the ethical role of such algorithms has so far been neglected in the ethical assessment of BCIs. The goal of this article is therefore twofold: First it aims to offer insights into whether and how the problems related to the ethics of BCIs e.g. responsibility can be better grasped with the help of already existing work on the ethics of algorithms. As a second goal the article explores what kinds of solutions are available in that body of scholarship and how these solutions relate to some of the ethical questions around BCIs. In short the article asks what lessons can be learned about the ethics of BCIs from looking at the ethics of algorithms. To achieve these goals the article proceeds as follows. First a brief introduction into the algorithmic background of BCIs is given. Second the debate about epistemic concerns and the ethics of algorithms is sketched. Finally this debate is transferred to the ethics of BCIs. Brain-Computer Interfaces: Lessons to Be Learned from the Ethics of Algorithms.
