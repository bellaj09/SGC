In this paper we consider the image super-resolution SR problem. The main challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution LR image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially ill-posed problem we introduce a Deep Edge Guided REcurrent rEsidual DEGREE network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from most of the existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution HR images directly the DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover the difference between a pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability namely the LR image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence rate by-pass connections across the multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In addition we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how the DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over the well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on these data sets. We also present addition experiments for JPEG artifacts reduction to demonstrate the good generality and flexibility of our proposed DEGREE network to handle other image processing tasks.
