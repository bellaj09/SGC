Helical CT has been widely used in clinical diagnosis. In this work we focus on a new prototype of helical CT which equipped with sparsely spaced multidetector and multi-slit collimator MSC in the axis direction. This kind systems can not only lower radiation dose suppress scattering by MSC but also cut down the manufacturing cost of detector. The major problem to overcome for such a system is the insufficient data for reconstruction. Hence we propose a deep learning-based function optimization method for this ill-posed inverse problem. By incorporating Radon inverse operator and disentangling each slice we significantly simplify the complexity of our network for 3D reconstruction. The whole network is composed of three subnetworks. First a convolutional neural network CNN in projection domain is constructed to estimate missing projection data and convert helical projection data to 2D fan-beam projection data. Then an analytical linear operator is followed to transfer the data from projection domain to image domain. Finally an additional CNN in image domain is added for further image refinement. These three steps work as an entirety and can be trained end to end. The overall network is trained on a simulated CT dataset from 8 patients of American Association of Physicists in Medicine AAPM Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge. We evaluate the trained network on both simulated datasets and clinical datasets. From extensive experimental studies very encouraging results are obtained according to both visual examination and quantitative evaluation. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and its potential for clinical usage. The proposed method provides us a new solution for a fully 3D ill-posed problem.
