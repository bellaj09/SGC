"For the functional control of prosthetic hand it is insufficient to obtain only the motion pattern information. As far as practicality is concerned the control of the prosthetic hand force is indispensable. The application value of prosthetic hand will be greatly improved if the stable grip of prosthetic hand can be achieved. To address this problem in this study a bio-signal control method for grasping control of a prosthetic hand is proposed to improve patients sense of using prosthetic hand and the thus improving the quality of life." PCA and deep learning based myoelectric grasping control of a prosthetic hand.
