"The application of deep learning approaches to finance has received a great deal of attention from both investors and researchers. This study presents a novel deep learning framework where wavelet transforms WT stacked autoencoders SAEs and long-short term memory LSTM are combined for stock price forecasting. The SAEs for hierarchically extracted deep features is introduced into stock price forecasting for the first time. The deep learning framework comprises three stages. First the stock price time series is decomposed by WT to eliminate noise. Second SAEs is applied to generate deep high-level features for predicting the stock price. Third high-level denoising features are fed into LSTM to forecast the next days closing price. Six market indices and their corresponding index futures are chosen to examine the performance of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other similar models in both predictive accuracy and profitability performance."
