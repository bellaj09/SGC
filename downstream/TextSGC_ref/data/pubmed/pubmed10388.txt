Accurate and robust tomographic reconstruction from dynamic positron emission tomography PET acquired data is a difficult problem. Conventional methods such as the maximum likelihood expectation maximization MLEM algorithm for reconstructing the activity distribution-based on individual frames may lead to inaccurate results due to the checkerboard effect and limitation of photon counts. In this paper we propose a stacked sparse auto-encoder based reconstruction framework for dynamic PET imaging. The dynamic reconstruction problem is formulated in a deep learning representation where the encoding layers extract the prototype features such as edges so that in the decoding layers the reconstructed results are obtained through a combination of those features. The qualitative and quantitative results of the procedure including the data based on a Monte Carlo simulation and real patient data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
