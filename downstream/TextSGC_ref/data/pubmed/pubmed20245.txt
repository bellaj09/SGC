Advanced medical simulators have been introduced to facilitate surgical and endoscopic training and thereby improve patient safety. Residents trained in the Procedicus Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality MIST-VR laparoscopic simulator perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy safer and faster than a control group. Little has been reported regarding whether factors like gender computer experience and visuospatial tests can predict the performance with a medical simulator. Our aim was to investigate whether such factors influence the performance of simulated gastroscopy. Seventeen medical students were asked about computer gaming experiences. Before virtual endoscopy they performed the visuospatial test PicCOr which discriminates the ability of the tested person to create a three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional presentation. Each student performed one gastroscopy level 1 case 1 in the GI Mentor II Simbionix and several variables related to performance were registered. Percentage of time spent with a clear view in the endoscope correlated well with the performance on the PicSOr test r = 0.56 P < 0.001. Efficiency of screening also correlated with PicSOr r = 0.23 P < 0.05. In students with computer gaming experience the efficiency of screening increased 33.6% +/- 3.1% versus 22.6% +/- 2.8% P < 0.05 and the duration of the examination decreased by 1.5 minutes P < 0.05. A similar trend was seen in men compared with women. The visuospatial test PicSOr predicts the results with the endoscopic simulator GI Mentor II. Two-dimensional image experience as in computer games also seems to affect the outcome. Visuospatial skills and computer game experience influence the performance of virtual endoscopy.
