"Many approaches have been designed to extract brain effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data. However few of them can effectively identify the connectivity network structure due to different defects. In this paper a new algorithm is developed to infer the effective connectivity between different brain regions by combining artificial immune algorithm AIA with the Bayes net method named as AIAEC. In the proposed algorithm a brain effective connectivity network is mapped onto an antibody and four immune operators are employed to perform the optimization process of antibodies including clonal selection operator crossover operator mutation operator and suppression operator and finally gets an antibody with the highest K2 score as the solution. AIAEC is then tested on Smiths simulated datasets and the effect of the different factors on AIAEC is evaluated including the node number session length as well as the other potential confounding factors of the blood oxygen level dependent BOLD signal. It was revealed that as contrast to other existing methods AIAEC got the best performance on the majority of the datasets. It was also found that AIAEC could attain a relative better solution under the influence of many factors although AIAEC was differently affected by the aforementioned factors. AIAEC is thus demonstrated to be an effective method for detecting the brain effective connectivity."
