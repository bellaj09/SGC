"Predictive modeling with longitudinal electronic health record EHR data offers great promise for accelerating personalized medicine and better informs clinical decision-making. Recently deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many healthcare prediction tasks. However deep models lack interpretability which is integral to successful decision-making and can lead to better patient care. In this paper we build upon the contextual decomposition CD method an algorithm for producing importance scores from long short-term memory networks LSTMs. We extend the method to bidirectional LSTMs BiLSTMs and use it in the context of predicting future clinical outcomes using patients EHR historical visits."
