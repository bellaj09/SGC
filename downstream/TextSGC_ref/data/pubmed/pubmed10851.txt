In contrast to lossy plasmonic metasurfaces MSs wideband dielectric MSs comprising subwavelength nanostructures supporting Mie resonances are of great interest in the visible wavelength range. Here for the first time to our knowledge we experimentally demonstrate a reflective MS consisting of a square-lattice array of hafnia HfO2 nanopillars to generate a wide color gamut. To design and optimize these MSs we use a deep-learning algorithm based on a dimensionality reduction technique. Good agreement is observed between simulation and experimental results in yielding vivid and high-quality colors. We envision that these structures not only empower the high-resolution digital displays and sensitive colorimetric biosensors but also can be applied to on-demand applications of beaming in a wide wavelength range down to deep ultraviolet.
