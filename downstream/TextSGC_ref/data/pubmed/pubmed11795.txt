Multiple studies have provided evidence for distributed object representation in the brain with several recent experiments leveraging basis function estimates for partial image reconstruction from fMRI data. Using a novel combination of statistical decomposition generalized linear models and stimulus averaging on previously examined image sets and Bayesian regression of recorded fMRI activity during presentation of these data sets we identify a subset of relevant voxels that appear to code for covarying object features. Using a technique we term "voxel-weighted averaging" we isolate image filters that these voxels appear to implement. The results though very cursory appear to have significant implications for hierarchical and deep-learning-type approaches toward the understanding of neural coding and representation.
