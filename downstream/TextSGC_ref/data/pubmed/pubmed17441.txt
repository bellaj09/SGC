Structure-based virtual screening SBVS methods often rely on docking score. The docking score is an over-simplification of the actual ligand-target binding. Its capability to model and predict the actual binding reality is limited. Recently interaction fingerprinting IFP has come and offered us an alternative way to model reality. IFP provides us an alternate way to examine protein-ligand interactions. The docking score indicates the approximate affinity and IFP shows the interaction specificity. IFP is a method to convert three dimensional 3D protein-ligand interactions into one dimensional 1D bitstrings. The bitstrings are subsequently employed to compare the protein-ligand interaction predicted by the docking tool against the reference ligand. These comparisons produce scores that can be used to enhance the quality of SBVS campaigns. However some IFP tools are either proprietary or using a proprietary library which limits the access to the tools and the development of customized IFP algorithm. Therefore we have developed PyPLIF a Python-based open source tool to analyze IFP. In this article we describe PyPLIF and its application to enhance the quality of SBVS in order to identify antagonists for estrogen  receptor ER.
