"As concreteness correlates very highly with the age-of-acquisition AoA of words we attempted to disentangle the effects of these two variables in the oral reading and comprehension performance of the deep dyslexic patient LW. The results of a multiple regression analysis of LWs reading of 217 words showed that both AoA and concreteness affect reading accuracy with the AoA effect being most apparent for her reading of concrete words. However concreteness and not AoA affected LWs performance in matching spoken definitions to printed words both when the distractors were semantically unrelated and when they were related. These data are interpreted in terms of a model of reading in deep dyslexia in which concreteness affects the ease with which semantics are accessed and can activate lexical representations and AoA affects the ease with which lexical phonology becomes available for spoken word production." Both concreteness and age-of-acquisition affect reading accuracy but only concreteness affects comprehension in a deep dyslexic patient.
