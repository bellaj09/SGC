Cancer is a complex worldwide health problem associated with high mortality. With the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing technology and the application of various machine learning methods that have emerged in recent years progress in cancer prediction has been increasingly made based on gene expression providing insight into effective and accurate treatment decision making. Thus developing machine learning methods which can successfully distinguish cancer patients from healthy persons is of great current interest. However among the classification methods applied to cancer prediction so far no one method outperforms all the others. A deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method for cancer prediction.
