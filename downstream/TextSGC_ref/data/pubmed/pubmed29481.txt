In electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI systems for motor control tasks the conventional practice is to decode motor intentions by using scalp EEG. However scalp EEG only reveals certain limited information about the complex tasks of movement with a higher degree of freedom. Therefore our objective is to investigate the effectiveness of source-space EEG in extracting relevant features that discriminate arm movement in multiple directions. EEG source space analysis of the supervised factor analytic approach for the classification of multi-directional arm movement.
