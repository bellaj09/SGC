For the last decade remarkable progress has been made in the field of cardiovascular disease treatment. However these complex medical procedures require a combination of rich experience and technical skills. In this paper a 3D virtual reality simulator for core skills training in minimally invasive surgery is presented. The system can generate realistic 3D vascular models segmented from patient datasets including a beating heart and provide a real-time computation of force and force feedback module for surgical simulation. Instruments such as a catheter or guide wire are represented by a multi-body mass-spring model. In addition a realistic user interface with multiple windows and real-time 3D views are developed. Moreover the simulator is also provided with a human-machine interaction module that gives doctors the sense of touch during the surgery training enables them to control the motion of a virtual catheter/guide wire inside a complex vascular model. Experimental results show that the simulator is suitable for minimally invasive surgery training. A 3D virtual reality simulator for training of minimally invasive surgery.
