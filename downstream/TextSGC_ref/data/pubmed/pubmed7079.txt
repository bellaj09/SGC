"Tropical cyclone intensity estimation is a challenging task as it required domain knowledge while extracting features significant pre-processing various sets of parameters obtained from satellites and human intervention for analysis. The inconsistency of results significant pre-processing of data complexity of the problem domain and problems on generalizability are some of the issues related to intensity estimation. In this study we design a deep convolutional neural network architecture for categorizing hurricanes based on intensity using graphics processing unit. Our model has achieved better accuracy and lower root-mean-square error by just using satellite images than state-of-the-art techniques. Visualizations of learned features at various layers and their deconvolutions are also presented for understanding the learning process."
