A detailed analysis of the literature on consciousness and cognition mechanisms based on the neural networks theory is presented. The immune and inflammatory response to the anesthetic-surgical procedure induces modulation of neuronal plasticity by influencing higher cognitive functions. Anesthetic drugs can cause unconsciousness producing a functional disruption of cortical and thalamic cortical integration complex. The external and internal perceptions are processed through an intricate network of neural connections involving the higher nervous activity centers especially the cerebral cortex. This requires an integrated model formed by neural networks and their interactions with highly specialized regions through large-scale networks which are distributed throughout the brain collecting information flow of these perceptions. Functional and effective connectivity between large-scale networks are essential for consciousness unconsciousness and cognition. It is what is called the "human connectome" or map neural networks.
