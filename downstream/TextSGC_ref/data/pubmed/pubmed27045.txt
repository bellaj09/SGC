Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS patients whose voluntary muscles are paralyzed commonly communicate with the outside world using eye movement. There have been many efforts to support this method of communication by tracking or detecting eye movement. An electrooculogram EOG an electro-physiological signal is generated by eye movements and can be measured with electrodes placed around the eye. In this study we proposed a new practical electrode position on the forehead to measure EOG signals and we developed a wearable forehead EOG measurement system for use in Human Computer/Machine interfaces HCIs/HMIs. Four electrodes including the ground electrode were placed on the forehead. The two channels were arranged vertically and horizontally sharing a positive electrode. Additionally a real-time eye movement classification algorithm was developed based on the characteristics of the forehead EOG. Three applications were employed to evaluate the proposed system: a virtual keyboard using a modified Bremen BCI speller and an automatic sequential row-column scanner and a drivable power wheelchair. The mean typing speeds of the modified Bremen brain-computer interface BCI speller and automatic row-column scanner were 10.81 and 7.74 letters per minute and the mean classification accuracies were 91.25% and 95.12% respectively. In the power wheelchair demonstration the user drove the wheelchair through an 8-shape course without collision with obstacles.
