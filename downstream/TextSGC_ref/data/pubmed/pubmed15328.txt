Nonlinear multimodal image registration for example the fusion of computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI fundamentally depends on a definition of image similarity. Previous methods that derived modality-invariant representations focused on either global statistical grayscale relations or local structural similarity both of which are prone to local optima. In contrast to most learning-based methods that rely on strong supervision of aligned multimodal image pairs we aim to overcome this limitation for further practical use cases. Multimodal 3D medical image registration guided by shape encoder-decoder networks.
