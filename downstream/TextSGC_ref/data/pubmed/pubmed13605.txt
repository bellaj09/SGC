Transcatheter mitral valve interventions are emerging as a viable alternative for patients at high risk. Two key aspects are crucial during the preoperative planning: left ventricular outflow tract assessment and anatomical analysis. Given that the manual anatomical analysis is time-consuming an automated approach may introduce efficiency during preoperative planning. In this study we present an automatic method to detect the mitral valve annulus and discuss possible implementation of this method in clinical practice. Towards safe and efficient preoperative planning of transcatheter mitral valve interventions.
