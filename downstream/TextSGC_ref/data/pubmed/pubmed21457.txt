Stationary subjects who perceive visually induced illusions of self-motion or vection in virtual reality VR often experience cybersickness the symptoms of which are similar to those experienced during motion sickness. An experiment was conducted to test the effects of single and dual-axis rotation of a virtual environment on cybersickness. It was predicted that VR displays which induced illusory dual-axis as opposed to single-axis self-rotations in stationary subjects would generate more sensory conflict and subsequently more cybersickness. Combined pitch and roll and cybersickness in a virtual environment.
