"Many error sources have been explored in regards to the depth perception problem in augmented reality environments using optical see-through head-mounted displays OST-HMDs. Nonetheless two error sources are commonly neglected: the ray-shift phenomenon and the change in interpupillary distance IPD. The first source of error arises from the difference in refraction for virtual and see-through optical paths caused by an optical combiner which is required of OST-HMDs. The second occurs from the change in the viewers IPD due to eye convergence. In this paper we analyze the effects of these two error sources on near-field depth perception and propose methods to compensate for these two types of errors. Furthermore we investigate their effectiveness through an experiment comparing the conditions with and without our error compensation methods applied. In our experiment participants estimated the egocentric depth of a virtual and a physical object located at seven different near-field distances 40200 cm using a perceptual matching task. Although the experimental results showed different patterns depending on the target distance the results demonstrated that the near-field depth perception error can be effectively reduced to a very small level at most 1 percent error by compensating for the two mentioned error sources."
