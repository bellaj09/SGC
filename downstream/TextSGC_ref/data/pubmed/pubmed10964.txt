"In the underlay cognitive radio networks the main challenge in detecting the idle radio resources is to estimate the power spectrum maps PSMs where the radio propagation characteristics are hard to obtain. For this reason we propose a novel PSMs estimation algorithm based on the generative adversarial networks GANs. First we constructed the PSMs estimation model as a regression model in deep learning. Then we converted the estimation task into an image reconstruction task by image color mapping. We fulfilled the above task by designing an image generator and an image discriminator in the proposed maps estimation GANs MEGANs. The generator is trained to extract the radio propagation characteristics and generate the PSMs images. However the discriminator is trained to identify the generated images and help to improve the generators performance. With the training process of MEGANs the abilities of the generator and the discriminator are enhanced continually until reaching a balance which means a high-accuracy PSMs estimation is achieved. The proposed MEGANs algorithm learns and utilizes accurate radio propagation features from the training process rather than making direct imprecise or biased propagation assumptions as in the traditional methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the MEGANs algorithm provides a more accurate estimation performance than the conventional methods."
