Machine learning has been extensively applied in small molecule analysis to predict a wide range of molecular properties and processes including mass spectrometry fragmentation or chromatographic retention time. However current approaches for retention time prediction lack sufficient accuracy due to limited available experimental data. Here we introduce the METLIN small molecule retention time SMRT dataset an experimentally acquired reverse-phase chromatography retention time dataset covering up to 80038 small molecules. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70Formula: see text of the cases the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the community to apply machine learning or first principles strategies to generate better models for retention time prediction.
