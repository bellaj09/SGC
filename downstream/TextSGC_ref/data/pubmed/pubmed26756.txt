"Natural environments are complex and a single choice can lead to multiple outcomes. Agents should learn which outcomes are due to their choices and therefore relevant for future decisions and which are stochastic in ways common to all choices and therefore irrelevant for future decisions between options. We designed an experiment in which human participants learned the varying reward and effort magnitudes of two options and repeatedly chose between them. The reward associated with a choice was randomly real or hypothetical i.e. participants only sometimes received the reward magnitude associated with the chosen option. The real/hypothetical nature of the reward on any one trial was however irrelevant for learning the longer-term values of the choices and participants ought to have only focused on the informational content of the outcome and disregarded whether it was a real or hypothetical reward. However we found that participants showed an irrational choice bias preferring choices that had previously led by chance to a real reward in the last trial. Amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal activity was related to the way in which participants choices were biased by real reward receipt. By contrast activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex frontal operculum/anterior insula and especially lateral anterior prefrontal cortex was related to the degree to which participants resisted this bias and chose effectively in a manner guided by aspects of outcomes that had real and more sustained relationships with particular choices suppressing irrelevant reward information for more optimal learning and decision making."
