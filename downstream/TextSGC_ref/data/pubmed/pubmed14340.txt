"CellProfiler has enabled the scientific research community to create flexible modular image analysis pipelines since its release in 2005. Here we describe CellProfiler 3.0 a new version of the software supporting both whole-volume and plane-wise analysis of three-dimensional 3D image stacks increasingly common in biomedical research. CellProfilers infrastructure is greatly improved and we provide a protocol for cloud-based large-scale image processing. New plugins enable running pretrained deep learning models on images. Designed by and for biologists CellProfiler equips researchers with powerful computational tools via a well-documented user interface empowering biologists in all fields to create quantitative reproducible image analysis workflows."
