Independent walking is an important goal of clinical and community-based rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy CP. Virtual reality-based rehabilitation therapy is effective in motivating children with CP. This study investigated the effects of treadmill training with virtual reality on gait balance muscular strength and gross motor function in children with CP. Eighteen children with spastic CP were randomly divided into the virtual reality treadmill training VRTT group 9 subjects mean age 10.2 years and treadmill training TT group 9 subjects mean age 9.4 years. The groups performed their respective programs as well as conventional physical therapy 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength was assessed using a digitalized manual muscle tester. Gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Functional Measure GMFM. Balance was assessed using the Pediatric Balance Scale PBS. Gait speed was assessed using the 10-meter walk test 10MWT and gait endurance was assessed using the 2-minute walk test 2MWT. After training gait and balance was improved in the VRTT compared to the TT group P < 0.05. Muscular strength was significantly greater in the VRTT group than the TT group except for right hamstring strength. The improvements in GMFM standing and PBS scores were greater in the VRTT group than the TT group P < 0.05. Furthermore the VRTT group showed the higher values of 10MWT and 2MWT compared to the TT group P < 0.05. In conclusion VRTT programs are effective for improving gait balance muscular strength and gross motor function in children with CP.
