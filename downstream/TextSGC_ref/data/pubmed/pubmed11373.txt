Standard segmentation of high-contrast electron micrographs EM identifies myelin accurately but does not translate easily into measurements of individual axons and their myelin even in cross-sections of parallel fibers. We describe automated segmentation and measurement of each myelinated axon and its sheath in EMs of arbitrarily oriented human white matter from autopsies. Measurement-oriented deep-learning workflow for improved segmentation of myelin and axons in high-resolution images of human cerebral white matter.
