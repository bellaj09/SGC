Limited literature available indicates the neurotoxic effects of excessive iron however a deep understanding of iron neurotoxicity needs to be developed. In this study we evaluated the toxic effects of excessive iron on learning and cognitive function in long-term iron exposure oral 10\u202fmg/L 6 months of mice by behavioral tests including novel object recognition test step-down passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test and further analyzed differential expression of hippocampal proteins. The behavioral tests consistently showed that iron treatment caused cognitive defects of the mice. Proteomic analysis revealed 66 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins 30 increased and 36 decreased in iron-treated mice as compared with the control ones. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins mainly included: synapse-associated proteins i.e. synaptosomal-associated protein 25 SNAP25 complexin-1 CPLX1 vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 VAMP2 neurochondrin NCDN; mitochondria-related proteins i.e. ADP/ATP translocase 1 SLC25A4 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta YWHAZ; cytoskeleton proteins i.e. neurofilament light polypeptide NEFL tubulin beta-2B chain TUBB2B tubulin alpha-4A chain TUBA4A. The findings suggest that the dysregulations of synaptic mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins may be involved in iron-triggered memory impairment. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of iron neurotoxicity. Long-term iron exposure causes widespread molecular alterations associated with memory impairment in mice.
