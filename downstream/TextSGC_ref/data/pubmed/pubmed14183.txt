This study aims to explore the possibility of using a multilayer artificial neural network for the classification between children with autism spectrum disorder ASD and typically developing TD children based on short-time spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations. Spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations were collected by a functional near-infrared spectroscopy setup from bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and temporal cortex in 25 children with ASD and 22 TD children. To perform feature extraction and classification a multilayer neural network called CGRNN was used which combined a convolution neural network CNN and a gate recurrent unit GRU since CGRNN has a strong ability in finding characteristic features and acquiring intrinsic relationship in time series. For the training and predicting short-time 7 s time-series raw functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS signals were used as the input of the network. To avoid the over-fitting problem and effectively extract useful differentiation features from a sample with a very limited size e.g. 25 ASDs and 22 TDs a sliding window approach was utilized in which the initially recorded long-time e.g. 480 s time-series was divided into many partially overlapped short-time 7 s sequences. By using this combined deep-learning network a high accurate classification between ASD and TD could be achieved even with a single optical channel e.g. 92.2% accuracy 85.0% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. This result implies that the multilayer neural network CGRNN can identify characteristic features associated with ASD even in a short-time spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuation from a single optical channel and second the CGRNN can provide highly accurate prediction in ASD.
