"Recently there have been great interests for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimers disease AD and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment MCI. Unlike the previous methods that considered simple low-level features such as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI and mean signal intensities from PET in this paper we propose a deep learning-based latent feature representation with a stacked auto-encoder SAE. We believe that there exist latent non-linear complicated patterns inherent in the low-level features such as relations among features. Combining the latent information with the original features helps build a robust model in AD/MCI classification with high diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore thanks to the unsupervised characteristic of the pre-training in deep learning we can benefit from the target-unrelated samples to initialize parameters of SAE thus finding optimal parameters in fine-tuning with the target-related samples and further enhancing the classification performances across four binary classification problems: AD vs. healthy normal control HC MCI vs. HC AD vs. MCI and MCI converter\xa0MCI-C vs. MCI non-converter\xa0MCI-NC. In our experiments on ADNI dataset we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method showing the accuracies of 98.8 90.7 83.7 and 83.3\u2009% for AD/HC MCI/HC AD/MCI and MCI-C/MCI-NC classification respectively. We believe that deep learning can shed new light on the neuroimaging data analysis and our work presented the applicability of this method to brain disease diagnosis."
