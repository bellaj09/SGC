Inverse synthetic aperture radar ISAR object detection is one of the most important and challenging problems in computer vision tasks. To provide a convenient and high-quality ISAR object detection method a fast and efficient weakly semi-supervised method called deep ISAR object detection DIOD is proposed based on advanced region proposal networks ARPNs and weakly semi-supervised deep joint sparse learning: 1 to generate high-level region proposals and localize potential ISAR objects robustly and accurately in minimal time ARPN is proposed based on a multiscale fully convolutional region proposal network and a region proposal classification and ranking strategy. ARPN shares common convolutional layers with the Inception-ResNet-based system and offers almost cost-free proposal computation with excellent performance; 2 to solve the difficult problem of the lack of sufficient annotated training data especially in the ISAR field a convenient and efficient weakly semi-supervised training method is proposed with the weakly annotated and unannotated ISAR images. Particularly a pairwise-ranking loss handles the weakly annotated images while a triplet-ranking loss is employed to harness the unannotated images; and 3 to further improve the accuracy and speed of the whole system a novel sharable-individual mechanism and a relational-regularized joint sparse learning strategy are introduced to achieve more discriminative and comprehensive representations while learning the shared- and individual-features and their correlations. Extensive experiments are performed on two real-world ISAR datasets showing that DIOD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher accuracy with shorter execution time.
