Landslides that take place in mountain cities tend to cause huge casualties and economic losses and a precise survey of landslide areas is a critical task for disaster emergency. However because of the complicated appearance of the nature it is difficult to find a spatial regularity that only relates to landslides thus landslides detection based on only spatial information or artificial features usually performs poorly. In this paper an automated landslides detection approach that is aiming at mountain cities has been proposed based on pre- and post-event remote sensing images it mainly utilizes the knowledge of landslide-related surface covering changes and makes full use of the temporal and spatial information. A change detection method using Deep Convolution Neural Network DCNN was introduced to extract the areas where drastic alterations have taken place; then focusing on the changed areas the Spatial Temporal Context Learning STCL was conducted to identify the landslides areas; finally we use slope degree which is derived from digital elevation model DEM to make the result more reliable and the change of DEM is used for making the detected areas more complete. The approach was applied to detecting the landslides in Shenzhen Zhouqu County and Beichuan County in China and a quantitative accuracy assessment has been taken. The assessment indicates that this approach can guarantee less commission error of landslide areal extent which is below 17.6% and achieves a quality percentage above 61.1% and for landslide areas the detection percentage is also competitive the experimental results proves the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach for the detection landslides in mountain cities.
