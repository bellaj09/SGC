Comparing estimates of the amount of genetic and environmental variance for different brain structures may elucidate differences in the genetic architecture or developmental constraints of individual brain structures. However most studies compare estimates of relative genetic heritability and environmental variance in brain structure which do not reflect differences in absolute variance between brain regions. Here we used a population sample of young adult twins and singleton siblings of twins n\u2009=\u2009791; M\u2009=\u200923\xa0years Queensland Twin IMaging study to estimate the absolute genetic and environmental variance standardised by the phenotypic mean in the size of cortical subcortical and ventricular brain structures. Mean-standardised genetic variance differed widely across structures 23.5-fold range 0.52% hippocampus to 12.28% lateral ventricles but the range of estimates within cortical subcortical or ventricular structures was more moderate two to fivefold range. There was no association between mean-standardised and relative measures of genetic variance i.e. heritability in brain structure volumes. We found similar results in an independent sample n\u2009=\u20091075 M\u2009=\u200929\xa0years Human Connectome Project. These findings open important new lines of enquiry: namely understanding the bases of these variance patterns and their implications regarding the genetic architecture evolution and development of the human brain. Absolute and relative estimates of genetic and environmental variance in brain structure volumes.
