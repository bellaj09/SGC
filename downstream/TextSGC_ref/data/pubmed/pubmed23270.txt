The present study investigated the use of a VR stereoscopic figure as conditioned stimulus CS. A differential conditioning procedure was applied on 67 participants where a VR stereoscopic figure CS+ was paired with electric shock and other VR stereoscopic figure CS- was presented without shock. Evaluative and expectancy measures were taken. Results showed that after acquisition the CS+ by itself became a more negative stimulus as evidenced by the evaluative ratings. Besides the presentation of the CS+ evoked an active expectancy of the unconditioned stimulus US. The use of VR stereoscopic figures as CSs seems feasible to design innovative experimental paradigms. The use of virtual reality for a human classical conditioning procedure.
