"Augmented Reality uses Head Mounted Displays HMD to overlay the real word with additional virtual information. Virtual Retinal Displays VRD a new display technology no longer requires Liquid Crystal Displays LCD. VRD technology addresses the retina directly with a single laser stream of pixels. There are no studies on the users informational strain in this new VRD technology. Various papers have shown that Heart Rate Variability HRV is a valid indicator for the users informational strain. An empirical test revealed no difference in the users HRV between VRD technology and LCD technology. Consequently there seems to be a comparable user informational strain regarding the display types." Comparison between the strain indicator HRV of a head-based virtual retinal display and LC-head mounted displays for augmented reality.
