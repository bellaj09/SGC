Clinical outcome prediction based on Electronic Health Record EHR helps enable early interventions for high-risk patients and is thus a central task for smart healthcare. Conventional deep sequential models fail to capture the rich temporal patterns encoded in the long and irregular clinical event sequences in EHR. We make the observation that clinical events at a long time scale exhibit strong temporal patterns while events within a short time period tend to be disordered co-occurrence. We thus propose differentiated mechanisms to model clinical events at different time scales. Our model learns hierarchical representations of event sequences to adaptively distinguish between short-range and long-range events and accurately capture their core temporal dependencies. Experimental results on real clinical data show that our model greatly improves over previous state-of-the-art models achieving AUC scores of 0.94 and 0.90 for predicting death and ICU admission respectively. Our model also successfully identifies important events for different clinical outcome prediction tasks.
