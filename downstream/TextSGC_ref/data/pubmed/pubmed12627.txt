An efficient method for identifying subjects at high risk of an intracranial aneurysm IA is warranted to provide adequate radiological screening guidelines and effectively allocate medical resources. We developed a model for pre-diagnosis IA prediction using a national claims database and health examination records. Data from the National Health Screening Program in Korea were utilized as input for several machine learning algorithms: logistic regression LR random forest RF scalable tree boosting system XGB and deep neural networks DNN. Algorithm performance was evaluated through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUROC using different test data from that employed for model training. Five risk groups were classified in ascending order of risk using model prediction probabilities. Incidence rate ratios between the lowest- and highest-risk groups were then compared. The XGB model produced the best IA risk prediction AUROC of 0.765 and predicted the lowest IA incidence 3.20 in the lowest-risk group whereas the RF model predicted the highest IA incidence 161.34 in the highest-risk group. The incidence rate ratios between the lowest- and highest-risk groups were 49.85 35.85 34.90 and 30.26 for the XGB LR DNN and RF models respectively. The developed prediction model can aid future IA screening strategies. Prediction of Intracranial Aneurysm Risk using Machine Learning.
