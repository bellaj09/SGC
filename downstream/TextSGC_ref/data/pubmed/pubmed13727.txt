"Living with a visible difference e.g. disfigurement can compromise a childs psychological wellbeing. Although some children can adjust well others can develop a range of appearance-related issues such as social anxiety low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction. However current research fails to confirm what factors contribute to appearance-related distress and what factors buffer the consequences of living with a visible difference. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 Australian specialist health professionals who care for children with visible differences. Interviews explored the type of appearance-related psychosocial concerns presented to a pediatric hospital perspectives on the impact of appearance-related distress as well as factors and processes that health professionals perceive influence adjustment. Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis. Rich evidence was offered by health professionals which demonstrated deep understanding of the psychological wellbeing of their patients. Three themes were identified: Mind Body and Soul; Stages of Life; and Individual Differences. Findings highlighted the complexity of appearance-related distress with individual differences in adjustment and the powerful impact it can have on a childs short and long-term psychosocial wellbeing. The importance of reaching consensus in the conceptualisation and measurement of psychological wellbeing is stressed and key domains associated with adjustment are proposed."
