Motor imagery MI electroencephalograph EEG signals are widely applied in brain-computer interface BCI. However classified MI states are limited and their classification accuracy rates are low because of the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. This study proposes a novel MI pattern recognition system that is based on complex algorithms for classifying MI EEG signals. In electrooculogram EOG artifact preprocessing band-pass filtering is performed to obtain the frequency band of MI-related signals and then canonical correlation analysis CCA combined with wavelet threshold denoising WTD is used for EOG artifact preprocessing. We propose a regularized common spatial pattern R-CSP algorithm for EEG feature extraction by incorporating the principle of generic learning. A new classifier combining the K-nearest neighbor KNN and support vector machine SVM approaches is used to classify four anisomerous states namely imaginary movements with the left hand right foot and right shoulder and the resting state. The highest classification accuracy rate is 92.5% and the average classification accuracy rate is 87%. The proposed complex algorithm identification method can significantly improve the identification rate of the minority samples and the overall classification performance.
