Due to its high temporal resolution electroencephalography EEG has become a broadly-used technology for real-time brain monitoring applications such as neurofeedback NFB and brain-computer interfaces BCI. However since EEG signals are prone to artifacts denoising is a crucial step that enables adequate subsequent data processing and interpretation. The aim of this study is to compare manual denoising to unsupervised online denoising which is essential to real-time applications. Online denoising of eye-blinks in electroencephalography.
