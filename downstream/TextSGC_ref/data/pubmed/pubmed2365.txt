Schizophrenia SZ is a severe mental illness with high heritability and complex etiology. Mounting evidence from neuroimaging has implicated disrupted brain network connectivity in the pathophysiology. However previous findings are inconsistent likely due to a combination of methodological and clinical variability and relatively small sample sizes. Few studies have used a data-driven approach for characterizing pathological interactions between regions in the whole brain and evaluated the generalizability across independent samples. To overcome this issue we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 3 independent samples 1 from Norway and 2 from Sweden consisting of 182 persons with a SZ spectrum diagnosis and 348 healthy controls. We used a whole-brain data-driven definition of network nodes and regularized partial correlations to evaluate and compare putatively direct brain network node interactions between groups. The clinical utility of the functional connectivity features and the generalizability of effects across samples were evaluated by training and testing multivariate classifiers in the independent samples using machine learning. Univariate analyses revealed 14 network edges with consistent reductions in functional connectivity encompassing frontal somatomotor visual auditory and subcortical brain nodes in patients with SZ. We found a high overall accuracy in classifying patients and controls up to 80% using independent training and test samples strongly supporting the generalizability of connectivity alterations across different scanners and heterogeneous samples. Overall our findings demonstrate robust reductions in functional connectivity in SZ spectrum disorders indicating disrupted information flow in sensory subcortical and frontal brain regions.
