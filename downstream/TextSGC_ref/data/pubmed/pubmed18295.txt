"This study examines how three types of obstacles cylinder virtual human and virtual human with footstep sounds affect circumvention strategies of healthy young adults. Sixteen participants aged 25.2\u202f\u202f2.5\u202fyears mean\u202f\u202f1SD were tested while walking overground and viewing a virtual room through a helmet mounted display. As participants walked towards a stationary target in the far space they avoided an obstacle cylinder or virtual human approaching either from the right +40 left -40 or head-on 0. Obstacle avoidance strategies were characterized using the position and orientation of the head. Repeated mixed model analysis showed smaller minimal distances p\u202f=\u202f0.007 while avoiding virtual humans as compared to cylinders. Footstep sounds added to virtual humans did not modify p\u202f=\u202f0.2 minimal distances compared to when no sound was provided. Onset times of avoidance strategies were similar across conditions p\u202f=\u202f0.06. Results indicate that the nature of the obstacle human-like vs. non-human object matters and can modify avoidance strategies. Smaller obstacle clearances in response to virtual humans may reflect the use of a less conservative avoidance strategy due to a resemblance of obstacles to pedestrians and a recall of strategies used in daily locomotion. The lack of influence of footstep sounds supports the fact that obstacle avoidance primarily relies on visual cues and the principle of inverse effectiveness whereby multisensory neurons response to multimodal stimuli becomes weaker when the unimodal sensory stimulus vision is strong. Present findings should be taken into consideration to optimize the ecological validity of VR-based obstacle avoidance paradigms used in research and rehabilitation." Healthy young adults implement distinctive avoidance strategies while walking and circumventing virtual human vs. non-human obstacles in a virtual environment.
