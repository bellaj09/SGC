Active learning methods have accumulated popularity due to improved results in knowledge acquisition as opposed to passive learning methods. For surgical resident physicians with limited training opportunities outside of the operating room due to time constraints virtual reality VR is a relatively inexpensive and time-efficient active training method for procurement of surgical skills. We conducted a simulated intramedullary nailing IMN of a tibia to demonstrate VR training programs as a more effective modality of learning orthopedic surgical techniques compared to passive learning tools such as a standard guide SG through trained novice medical students performing a SawBones simulation of intramedullary nail fixation. Randomized Trial of a Virtual Reality Tool to Teach Surgical Technique for Tibial Shaft Fracture Intramedullary Nailing.
