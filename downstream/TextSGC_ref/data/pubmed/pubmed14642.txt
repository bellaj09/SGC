Oxford Nanopore sequencing is a rapidly developed sequencing technology in recent years. To keep pace with the explosion of the downstream data analytical tools a versatile Nanopore sequencing simulator is needed to complement the experimental data as well as to benchmark those newly developed tools. However all the currently available simulators are based on simple statistics of the produced reads which have difficulty in capturing the complex nature of the Nanopore sequencing procedure the main task of which is the generation of raw electrical current signals.
