The mouse has emerged as an animal model for many diseases. At IRO we have used this animal to understand the development of many eye diseases and treatment of some of them. Precise evaluation of vision is a prerequisite for both these approaches. In this unit we describe three ways to measure vision: testing the optokinetic response and evaluating the fundus by direct observation and by fluorescent angiography. Curr. Protoc.
