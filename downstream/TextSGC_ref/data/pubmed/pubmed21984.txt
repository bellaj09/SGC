Recent clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of several guided-bronchoscopy technologies for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions PPLs. However introduction of these technologies is expensive. Therefore in clinical practice these are unavailable in many hospitals. In contrast virtual bronchoscopy VB using the computed tomography CT workstation can be made available immediately without additional cost as many hospitals already have the CT scan facility. However the effectiveness of VB alone remains to be shown.
