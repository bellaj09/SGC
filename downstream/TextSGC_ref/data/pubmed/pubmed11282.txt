We describe Orbit Image Analysis an open-source whole slide image analysis tool. The tool consists of a generic tile-processing engine which allows the execution of various image analysis algorithms provided by either Orbit itself or from other open-source platforms using a tile-based map-reduce execution framework. Orbit Image Analysis is capable of sophisticated whole slide imaging analyses due to several key features. First Orbit has machine-learning capabilities. This deep learning segmentation can be integrated with complex object detection for analysis of intricate tissues. In addition Orbit can run locally as standalone or connect to the open-source image server OMERO. Another important characteristic is its scale-out functionality using the Apache Spark framework for distributed computing. In this paper we describe the use of Orbit in three different real-world applications: quantification of idiopathic lung fibrosis nerve fibre density quantification and glomeruli detection in the kidney.
