In cardiac interventions such as cardiac resynchronization therapy CRT image guidance can be enhanced by involving preoperative models. Multimodality 3D/2D registration for image guidance however remains a significant research challenge for fundamentally different image data i.e. MR to X-ray. Registration methods must account for differences in intensity contrast levels resolution dimensionality field of view. Furthermore same anatomical structures may not be visible in both modalities. Current approaches have focused on developing modality-specific solutions for individual clinical use cases by introducing constraints or identifying cross-modality information manually. Machine learning approaches have the potential to create more general registration platforms. However training image to image methods would require large multimodal datasets and ground truth for each target application. 3D/2D model-to-image registration by imitation learning for cardiac procedures.
