Background: Electronic fetal monitoring EFM is widely applied as a routine diagnostic tool by clinicians using fetal heart rate FHR signals to prevent fetal hypoxia. However visual interpretation of the FHR usually leads to significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability and false positives become the main cause of unnecessary cesarean sections. Goal: The main aim of this study was to ensure a novel consistent robust and effective model for fetal hypoxia detection. Methods: In this work we proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis CAD system integrated with an advanced deep learning DL algorithm. For a 1-dimensional preprocessed FHR signal the 2-dimensional image was transformed using recurrence plot RP which is considered to greatly capture the non-linear characteristics. The ultimate image dataset was enriched by changing several parameters of the RP and was then used to feed the convolutional neural network CNN. Compared to conventional machine learning ML methods a CNN can self-learn useful features from the input data and does not perform complex manual feature engineering i.e. feature extraction and selection. Results: Finally according to the optimization experiment the CNN model obtained the average performance using optimal configuration across 10-fold: accuracy = 98.69% sensitivity = 99.29% specificity = 98.10% and area under the curve = 98.70%. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this approached achieved better classification performance in predicting fetal hypoxia using FHR signals compared to the other state-of-the-art works. Significance: In summary the satisfied result proved the effectiveness of our proposed CAD system for assisting obstetricians making objective and accurate medical decisions based on RP and powerful CNN algorithm.
