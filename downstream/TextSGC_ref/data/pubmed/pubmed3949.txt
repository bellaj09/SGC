Human brain functional networks contain a few densely connected hubs that play a vital role in transferring information across regions during resting and task states. However the relationship of these functional hubs to measures of brain physiology such as regional cerebral blood flow rCBF remains incompletely understood. Here we used functional MRI data of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent and arterial-spin-labeling perfusion contrasts to investigate the relationship between functional connectivity strength FCS and rCBF during resting and an N-back working-memory task. During resting state functional brain hubs with higher FCS were identified primarily in the default-mode insula and visual regions. The FCS showed a striking spatial correlation with rCBF and the correlation was stronger in the default-mode network DMN; including medial frontal-parietal cortices and executive control network ECN; including lateral frontal-parietal cortices compared with visual and sensorimotor networks. Moreover the relationship was connection-distance dependent; i.e. rCBF correlated stronger with long-range hubs than short-range ones. It is notable that several DMN and ECN regions exhibited higher rCBF per unit connectivity strength rCBF/FCS ratio; whereas this index was lower in posterior visual areas. During the working-memory experiment both FCS-rCBF coupling and rCBF/FCS ratio were modulated by task load in the ECN and/or DMN regions. Finally task-induced changes of FCS and rCBF in the lateral-parietal lobe positively correlated with behavioral performance. Together our results indicate a tight coupling between blood supply and brain functional topology during rest and its modulation in response to task demands which may shed light on the physiological basis of human brain functional connectome. Coupling of functional connectivity and regional cerebral blood flow reveals a physiological basis for network hubs of the human brain.
