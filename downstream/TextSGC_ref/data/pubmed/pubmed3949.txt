In the vertebrate spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons CSF-cNs are GABAergic neurons whose functions are only beginning to unfold. Recent evidence indicates that CSF-cNs detect local\xa0spinal bending and relay this mechanosensory feedback information to motor circuits yet many CSF-cN targets remain unknown. Using optogenetics patterned illumination and in\xa0vivo electrophysiology we show here that CSF-cNs provide somatic inhibition to fast motor neurons and excitatory sensory interneurons involved in the escape circuit. Ventral CSF-cNs respond to longitudinal spinal contractions and induce large inhibitory postsynaptic currents IPSCs sufficient to\xa0silence spiking of their targets. Upon repetitive stimulation these IPSCs promptly depress enabling the mechanosensory response to the first bend to be the most effective. When CSF-cNs are silenced postural control is compromised resulting in rollovers during escapes. Altogether our data demonstrate how GABAergic sensory neurons provide powerful inhibitory feedback to the escape circuit to maintain balance during active locomotion. Intraspinal Sensory Neurons Provide Powerful Inhibition to Motor Circuits Ensuring Postural Control during Locomotion.
