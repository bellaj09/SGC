Virtual training applications with high levels of immersion or fidelity for example for social phobia treatment produce high levels of presence and therefore belong to the most successful Virtual Reality developments. Whereas display and interaction fidelity as sub-dimensions of immersion and their influence on presence are well researched realism of the displayed simulation depends on the specific application and is therefore difficult to measure. We propose to measure simulation realism by using a self-report questionnaire. The German VR Simulation Realism Scale for VR training applications was developed based on a translation of scene realism items from the Witmer-Singer-Presence Questionnaire. Items for realism of virtual humans for example for social phobia training applications were supplemented. A sample of N = 151 students rated simulation realism of a Fear of Public Speaking application. Four factors were derived by item- and principle component analysis Varimax rotation representing Scene Realism Audience Behavior Audience Appearance and Sound Realism. The scale developed can be used as a starting point for future research and measurement of simulation realism for applications including virtual humans.
