A better understanding of the neural substrates that underlie motor recovery after stroke has led to the development of innovative rehabilitation strategies and tools that incorporate key elements of motor skill relearning that is intensive motor training involving goal-oriented repeated movements. Robotic devices for the upper limb are increasingly used in rehabilitation. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these devices in reducing motor impairments but less so for the improvement of upper limb function. Other studies have begun to investigate the benefits of combined approaches that target muscle function functional electrical stimulation and botulinum toxin injections modulate neural activity noninvasive brain stimulation and enhance motivation virtual reality in an attempt to potentialize the benefits of robot-mediated training. The aim of this paper is to overview the current status of such combined treatments and to analyze the rationale behind them.
