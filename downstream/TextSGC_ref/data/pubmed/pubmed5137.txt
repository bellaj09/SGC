Imaging genetic analyses use heritability calculations to measure the fraction of phenotypic variance attributable to additive genetic factors. We tested the agreement between heritability estimates provided by four methods that are used for heritability estimates in neuroimaging traits. SOLAR-Eclipse and OpenMx use iterative maximum likelihood estimation MLE methods. Accelerated Permutation inference for ACE APACE and fast permutation heritability inference FPHI employ fast non-iterative approximation-based methods. We performed this evaluation in a simulated twin-sibling pedigree and phenotypes and in diffusion tensor imaging DTI data from three twin-sibling cohorts the human connectome project HCP netherlands twin register NTR and BrainSCALE projects provided as a part of the enhancing neuro imaging genetics analysis ENIGMA consortium. We observed that heritability estimate may differ depending on the underlying method and dataset. The heritability estimates from the two MLE approaches provided excellent agreement in both simulated and imaging data. The heritability estimates for two approximation approaches showed reduced heritability estimates in datasets with deviations from data normality. We propose a data homogenization approach implemented in solar-eclipse; www.solar-eclipse-genetics.org to improve the convergence of heritability estimates across different methods. The homogenization steps include consistent regression of any nuisance covariates and enforcing normality on the trait data using inverse Gaussian transformation. Under these conditions the heritability estimates for simulated and DTI phenotypes produced converging heritability estimates regardless of the method. Thus using these simple suggestions may help new heritability studies to provide outcomes that are comparable regardless of software package.
