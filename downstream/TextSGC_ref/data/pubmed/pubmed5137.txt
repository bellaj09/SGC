Recent research has raised concerns about the long-term neurological consequences of repetitive concussive and sub-concussive injuries in professional players of American Football. Despite this interest the neural and psychological status of retired players remains unknown. Here we evaluated the performances and brain activation patterns of retired National Football League players NFL alumni relative to controls using an fMRI-optimised neuropsychological test of executive function. Behaviourally the NFL alumni showed only modest performance deficits on the executive task. By contrast they showed pronounced hyperactivation and hypoconnectivity of the dorsolateral frontal and frontopolar cortices. Critically abnormal frontal-lobe function was correlated with the number of times that NFL alumni reported having been removed from play after head injury and was evident in individual players. These results support the hypothesis that NFL alumni have a heightened probability of developing executive dysfunction and suggest that fMRI provides the most sensitive biomarker of the underlying neural abnormality.
