In applying mental imagery brain-computer interfaces BCIs to end users training is a key part for novice users to get control. In general learning situations it is an established concept that a trainer assists a trainee to improve his/her aptitude in certain skills. In this work we want to evaluate whether we can apply this concept in the context of event-related desynchronization ERD based adaptive hybrid BCIs. Hence in a first session we merged the features of a high aptitude BCI user a trainer and a novice user the trainee in a closed-loop BCI feedback task and automatically adapted the classifier over time. In a second session the trainees operated the system unassisted. Twelve healthy participants ran through this protocol. Along with the trainer the trainees achieved a very high overall peak accuracy of 95.3 %. In the second session where users operated the BCI unassisted they still achieved a high overall peak accuracy of 83.6%. Ten of twelve first time BCI users successfully achieved significantly better than chance accuracy. Concluding we can say that this trainer-trainee approach is very promising. Future research should investigate whether this approach is superior to conventional training approaches. This trainer-trainee concept could have potential for future application of BCIs to end users. Adaptive hybrid brain-computer interaction: ask a trainer for assistance!
