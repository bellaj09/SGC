Effective computational methods for peptide-protein binding prediction can greatly help clinical peptide vaccine search and design. However previous computational methods fail to capture key nonlinear high-order dependencies between different amino acid positions. As a result they often produce low-quality rankings of strong binding peptides. To solve this problem we propose nonlinear high-order machine learning methods including high-order neural networks HONNs with possible deep extensions and high-order kernel support vector machines to predict major histocompatibility complex-peptide binding.
