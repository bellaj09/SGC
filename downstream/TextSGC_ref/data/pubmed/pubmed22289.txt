Virtual Reality VR has emerged as a novel paradigm for immersive applications in training entertainment rehabilitation and other domains. In this paper we investigate the automatic classification of mental workload from brain activity measured through functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS in VR. We present results from a study which implements the established n-back task in an immersive visual scene including physical interaction. Our results show that user workload can be detected from fNIRS signals in immersive VR tasks both person-dependently and -adaptively.
