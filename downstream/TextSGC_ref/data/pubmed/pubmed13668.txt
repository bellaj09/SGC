Skeletal muscle segmentation techniques can help orthopedic interventions in various scenes. In this chapter we describe two methods of skeletal muscle segmentation on 3D CT images. The first method is based on a computational anatomical model and the second method is a deep learning-based method. The computational anatomy-based methods are modeling the muscle shape with its running and use it for segmentation. In the deep learning-based methods the muscle regions are directly acquired automatically. Both approaches can obtain muscle regions including shape area volume and some other image texture features. And it is desirable that the method be selected by the required orthopedic intervention. Here we show each design philosophy and features of a representative method. We discuss the various examples of site-specific segmentation of skeletal muscle in non-contrast images using torso CT and whole-body CT including in cervical thoracoabdominal surface and deep muscles. And we also mention the possibility of application to orthopedic intervention. Muscle Segmentation for Orthopedic Interventions.
