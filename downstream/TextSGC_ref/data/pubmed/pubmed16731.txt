"Misalignments between endogenous circadian rhythms and the built environment i.e. social jet\xa0lag SJL result in learning and attention deficits. Currently there is no way to assess the impact of SJL on learning outcomes of large populations as a response to schedule choices let alone to assess which individuals are most negatively impacted by these choices. We analyzed two years of learning management system login events for 14894 Northeastern Illinois University NEIU students to investigate the capacity of such systems as tools for mapping the impact of SJL over large populations while maintaining the ability to generate insights about individuals. Personal daily activity profiles were validated against known biological timing effects and revealed a majority of students experience more than 30\u2009minutes of SJL on average with greater amplitude correlating strongly with a significant decrease in academic performance especially in people with later apparent chronotypes. Our findings demonstrate that online records can be used to map individual- and population-level SJL allow deep mining for patterns across demographics and could guide schedule choices in an effort to minimize SJLs negative impact on learning outcomes." 3.4\u2009million real-world learning management system logins reveal the majority of students experience social jet\xa0lag correlated with decreased performance.
