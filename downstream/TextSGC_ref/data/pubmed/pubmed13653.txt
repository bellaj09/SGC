"The purpose of this article is to develop knowledge and learning on the best way to automate organisational activities in deep mines that could lead to the creation of harmony between the human technical and the social system towards increased productivity. The findings showed that though the introduction of high-level technological tools in the work environment disrupted the social relations developed over time amongst the employees in most situations the technological tools themselves became substitute social collaborative partners to the employees. It is concluded that in developing a digitised mining production system knowledge of the social collaboration between the humans miners and the technology they use for their work must be developed. By implication knowledge of the humans subject-oriented and object-oriented activities should be considered as an important integral resource for developing a better technological organisational and human interactive subsystem when designing the intelligent automation and digitisation systems for deep mines. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This study focused on understanding the social collaboration between humans and the technologies they use to work in underground mines. The learning provides an added knowledge in designing technologies and work organisations that could better enhance the human-technology interactive and collaborative system in the automation and digitisation of underground mines." Understanding social collaboration between actors and technology in an automated and digitised deep mining environment.
