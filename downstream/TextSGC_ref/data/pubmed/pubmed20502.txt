"The goals of this study were twofold: 1 to investigate nonphobics and phobics physiological response in virtual environments and 2 to analyze the trend of phobics physiology during virtual reality VR treatment. As a measure of physiology heart rate skin resistance and skin temperature were acquired. The data for two groups of participants were analyzed: 22 nonphobic participants mean = 32 +/- 9.4 years and 36 subjects with fear of flying mean = 40 +/- 12.1 years who met the DSM-IV criteria for fear of flying. As a result skin resistance showed significant differences between nonphobics and phobics T56 = 2.978 and p < 0.01 respectively. The physiological response of 33 phobic participants who were able to fly without medicine after VR treatment showed a gradual trend toward the nonphobics physiological responses as therapy sessions progressed. In this study physiological monitoring in particular skin resistance appeared to be useful both in understanding the physiological state of phobic individuals and in evaluating the results of treatment in VR psychotherapy." Physiological monitoring as an objective tool in virtual reality therapy.
