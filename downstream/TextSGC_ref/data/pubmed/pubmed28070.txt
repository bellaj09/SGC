Recently there have been many efforts to develop Brain Computer Interface BCI systems allowing identifying and discriminating brain activity as well as support the control of external devices and to understand cognitive behaviors. In this work a feature relevance analysis approach based on an eigen decomposition method is proposed to support automatic Motor Imagery MI discrimination in electroencephalography signals for BCI systems. We select a set of features representing the best as possible the studied process. For such purpose a variability study is performed based on traditional Principal Component Analysis. EEG signals modelling is carried out by feature estimation of three frequency-based and one time-based. Our approach provides testing over a well-known MI dataset. Attained results show that presented algorithm can be used as tool to support discrimination of MI brain activity obtaining acceptable results in comparison to state of the art approaches.
