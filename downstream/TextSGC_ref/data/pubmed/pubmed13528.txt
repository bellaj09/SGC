Sepsis affects nearly 1 million people in the United States per year has a mortality rate of 28-50% and requires more than $20 billion a year in hospital costs. Over a quarter century of research has not yielded a single reliable diagnostic test or a directed therapeutic agent for sepsis. Central to this insufficiency is the fact that sepsis remains a clinical/physiological diagnosis representing a multitude of molecularly heterogeneous pathological trajectories. Advances in computational capabilities offered by High Performance Computing HPC platforms call for an evolution in the investigation of sepsis to attempt to define the boundaries of traditional research bench clinical and computational through the use of computational proxy models. We present a novel investigatory and analytical approach derived from how HPC resources and simulation are used in the physical sciences to identify the epistemic boundary conditions of the study of clinical sepsis via the use of a proxy agent-based model of systemic inflammation. Sepsis reconsidered: Identifying novel metrics for behavioral landscape characterization with a high-performance computing implementation of an agent-based model.
