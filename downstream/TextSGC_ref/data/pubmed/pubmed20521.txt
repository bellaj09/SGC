"When we examine the event-related potential ERP responses of Donchins brain-computer interface BCI speller a type of quasi-periodic fluctuation FLUC overlapping with the ERP components can be observed; this fluctuation is traditionally treated as interference. However if the FLUC is detectable in a working BCI it can be used for asynchronous control i.e. to indicate whether the BCI is under the control state CS or under the non-control idle state NC. Asynchronous control is an important issue to address to enable BCIs practical use. In this paper we examine the characteristics of the FLUC and explore the possibility of using the FLUC for asynchronous control of the BCI. For detecting the FLUC we propose a method based on the power spectrum and evaluate the detection rates in a simulation. As a result high true positive rates TPRs and low false positive rates FPRs are obtained. Our work reveals that the FLUC is of great value for implementing an asynchronous BCI."
