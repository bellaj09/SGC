Due to the complex visual environment such as lighting variations shadows and limitations of vision the accuracy of vacant parking slot detection for the park assist system PAS with a standalone around view monitor AVM needs to be improved. To address this problem we propose a vacant parking slot detection method based on deep learning namely VPS-Net. VPS-Net converts the vacant parking slot detection into a two-step problem including parking slot detection and occupancy classification. In the parking slot detection stage we propose a parking slot detection method based on YOLOv3 which combines the classification of the parking slot with the localization of marking points so that various parking slots can be directly inferred using geometric cues. In the occupancy classification stage we design a customized network whose size of convolution kernel and number of layers are adjusted according to the characteristics of the parking slot. Experiments show that VPS-Net can detect various vacant parking slots with a precision rate of 99.63% and a recall rate of 99.31% in the ps2.0 dataset and has a satisfying generalizability in the PSV dataset. By introducing a multi-object detection network and a classification network VPS-Net can detect various vacant parking slots robustly.
