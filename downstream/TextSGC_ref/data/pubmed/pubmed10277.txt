Protein hydroxylation is one type of post-translational modifications PTMs playing critical roles in human diseases. It is known that protein sequence contains many uncharacterized residues of proline and lysine. The question that needs to be answered is: which residue can be hydroxylated and which one cannot. The answer will not only help understand the mechanism of hydroxylation but can also benefit the development of new drugs. In this paper we proposed a novel approach for predicting hydroxylation using a hybrid deep learning model integrating the convolutional neural network CNN and long short-term memory network LSTM. We employed a pseudo amino acid composition PseAAC method to construct valid benchmark datasets based on a sliding window strategy and used the position-specific scoring matrix PSSM to represent samples as inputs to the deep learning model. In addition we compared our method with popular predictors including CNN iHyd-PseAAC and iHyd-PseCp. The results for 5-fold cross-validations all demonstrated that our method significantly outperforms the other methods in prediction accuracy.
