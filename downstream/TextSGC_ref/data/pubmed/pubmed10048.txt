Biological pathway is important curated knowledge of biological processes. Thus cancer subtype classification based on pathways will be very useful to understand differences in biological mechanisms among cancer subtypes. However pathways include only a fraction of the entire gene set only 1/3 of human genes in KEGG and pathways are fragmented. For this reason there are few computational methods to use pathways for cancer subtype classification. Cancer subtype classification and modeling by pathway attention and propagation.
