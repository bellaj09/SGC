Living in a multisensory world entails the continuous sensory processing of environmental information in order to enact appropriate motor routines. The interaction between our body and our brain is the crucial factor for achieving such sensorimotor integration ability. Several clinical conditions dramatically affect the constant body-brain exchange but the latest developments in biomedical engineering provide promising solutions for overcoming this communication breakdown. Hand-in-hand advances in biomedical engineering and sensorimotor restoration.
