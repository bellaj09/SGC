"Ventricular contractions in healthy individuals normally follow the contractions of atria to facilitate more efficient pump action and cardiac output. With a ventricular ectopic beat VEB volume within the ventricles are pumped to the bodys vessels before receiving blood from atria thus causing inefficient blood circulation. VEBs tend to cause perturbations in the instantaneous heart rate time series making the analysis of heart rate variability inappropriate around such events or requiring special treatment such as signal averaging. Moreover VEB frequency can be indicative of life-threatening problems. However VEBs can often mimic artifacts both in morphology and timing. Identification of VEBs is therefore an important unsolved problem. The aim of this study is to introduce a method of wavelet transform in combination with deep learning network for the classification of VEBs."
