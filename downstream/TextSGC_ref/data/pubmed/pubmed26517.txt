Decoding motor information directly from brain activity is essential in robot-assisted rehabilitation systems to promote motor relearning. However patients who suffered a stroke in the motor cortex have lost brain activity in the injured area and consequently mobility in contralateral limbs. Such a loss eliminates the possibility of extracting motor information from brain activity while the patient is undergoing therapy for the affected limb. This work proposes to decode motor information from EEG activity of the contralesional hemisphere in patients who suffered a hemiparetic stroke. Four stroke patients participated in this study and the results proved the feasibility of decoding motor information while patients attempted to move the affected limb. Continuous decoding of intention to move from contralesional hemisphere brain oscillations in severely affected chronic stroke patients.
