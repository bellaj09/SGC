"The rapid evolution of information communication and entertainment technologies will transform the lives of citizens and ultimately transform society. This paper focuses on ethical issues associated with the likely convergence of virtual realities VR and social networks SNs hereafter VRSNs. We examine a scenario in which a significant segment of the worlds population has a presence in a VRSN. Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction this scenario is plausible. However it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose threats to both privacy and autonomy. The threats to privacy can be broadly categorized as threats to informational privacy threats to physical privacy and threats to associational privacy. Each of these threats is further subdivided. The threats to autonomy can be broadly categorized as threats to freedom to knowledge and to authenticity. Again these three threats are divided into subcategories. Having categorized the main threats posed by VRSNs a number of recommendations are provided so that policy-makers developers and users can make the best possible use of VRSNs."
