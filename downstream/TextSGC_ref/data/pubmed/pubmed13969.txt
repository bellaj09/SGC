"Animals successfully thrive in noisy environments with finite resources. The necessity to function with resource constraints has led evolution to design animal brains and bodies to be optimal in their use of computational power while being adaptable to their environmental niche. A key process undergirding this ability to adapt is the process of learning. Although a complete characterization of the neural basis of learning remains ongoing scientists for nearly a century have used the brain as inspiration to design artificial neural networks capable of learning a case in point being deep learning. In this viewpoint we advocate that deep learning can be further enhanced by incorporating and tightly integrating five fundamental principles of neural circuit design and function: optimizing the system to environmental need and making it robust to environmental noise customizing learning to context modularizing the system learning without supervision and learning using reinforcement strategies. We illustrate how animals integrate these learning principles using the fruit fly olfactory learning circuit one of natures best-characterized and highly optimized schemes for learning. Incorporating these principles may not just improve deep learning but also expose common computational constraints. With judicious use deep learning can become yet another effective tool to understand how and why brains are designed the way they are." Deeper Learning.
