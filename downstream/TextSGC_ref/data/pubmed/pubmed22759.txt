In an existing brain-computer interface BCI based on code modulated visual evoked potentials c-VEP a method with which to increase the number of targets without increasing code length has not yet been established. In this paper a novel c-VEP BCI paradigm namely grouping modulation with different codes that have good autocorrelation and crosscorrelation properties is presented to increase the number of targets and information transfer rate ITR. All stimulus targets are divided into several groups and each group of targets are modulated by a distinct pseudorandom binary code and its circularly shifting codes. Canonical correlation analysis is applied to each group for yielding a spatial filter and templates for all targets in a group are constructed based on spatially filtered signals. Template matching is applied to each group and the attended target is recognized by finding the maximal correlation coefficients of all groups. Based on the paradigm a BCI with a total of 48 targets divided into three groups was implemented; 12 and 10 subjects participated in an off-line and a simulated online experiments respectively. Data analysis of the offline experiment showed that the paradigm can massively increase the number of targets from 16 to 48 at the cost of slight compromise in accuracy 95.49% vs. 92.85%. Results of the simulated online experiment suggested that although the averaged accuracy across subjects of all three groups of targets was lower than that of a single group of targets 91.67% vs. 94.9% the average ITR of the former was substantially higher than that of the later 181 bits/min vs. 135.6 bit/min due to the large increase of the number of targets. The proposed paradigm significantly improves the performance of the c-VEP BCI and thereby facilitates its practical applications such as high-speed spelling.
