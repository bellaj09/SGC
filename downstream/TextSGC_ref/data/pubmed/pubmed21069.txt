Detachment from external reality distancing from others closure into a sort of virtual hermitage and prevalence of inner fantasies are the descriptive aspects of autism. However from an anthropological-phenomenological point of view in schizophrenia the autistic mode of life can arise from a person\s being confronted with a pathological crisis in the obviousness of the intersubjective world essentially a crisis in the intersubjective foundation of human presence. The "condition of possibility" of the autistic way of being is the deficiency of the operation that phenomenology call empathetic-intuitive constitution of the Other an Other which is the naturalness of evidence of being a subject like me. The theme of the Other of intersubjectivity has become so central in the psychopathological analysis of schizophrenic disorders because the modifications of interhuman encounter cannot be seen as the secondary consequences of symptoms but constitute the fundamental disorder of schizophrenic alienation. Revision of the concept of autism from the original definition centered on the prevalence of inner fantasies leads to the profound change with the vision of autism as "loss" and "void." I call attention to possibility of phenomenological research to understand autistic world starting from this "void." Understanding autism in schizophrenia.
