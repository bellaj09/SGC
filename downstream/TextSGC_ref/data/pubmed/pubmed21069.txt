In the field of brain-machine interface BMI research the development of cognitive BMI is a hot topic because it may lead to more intuitive and goal-directed findings than existing BMI technology. In this study we devised a "visual-imagery method" which enables visual imaging of the operation of a target. We also investigated an "inner-speech method" which comprised internal pronunciation of words without emitting sounds and an "inner-speech + visual-imagery method" which combined the two methods. When only the high $\\gamma$ band 60-120 Hz power in the prefrontal cortex was used the average accuracy of the 15 participants with 20-fold crossvalidation was 81.3% in inner speech 84.6% in visual imagery and 83.2% in inner speech + visual imagery. This study also found that the frontal pole was the most useful region in the prefrontal cortex. Development of a Cognitive Brain-Machine Interface Based on a Visual Imagery Method.
