Steady state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs have been identified as an effective solution for brain computer interface BCI systems as well as for neurocognitive investigations. SSVEPs can be observed in the scalp-based recordings of electroencephalogram signals and are one component buried amongst the normal brain signals and complex noise. We present a novel method for enhancing and improving detection of SSVEPs by leveraging the rich joint blind source separation framework using independent vector analysis IVA. IVA exploits the diversity within each dataset while preserving dependence across all the datasets. This approach is shown to enhance the detection of SSVEP signals across a range of frequencies and subjects for BCI systems. Furthermore we show that IVA enables improved topographic mapping of the SSVEP propagation providing a promising new tool for neuroscience and neurocognitive research.
