The recent success of deep learning techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence has stimulated a great deal of interest among bioinformaticians who now wish to bring the power of deep learning to bare on a host of bioinformatical problems. Deep learning is ideally suited for biological problems that require automatic or hierarchical feature representation for biological data when prior knowledge is limited. In this work we address the sequence-specific bias correction problem for RNA-seq data redusing Recurrent Neural Networks RNNs to model nucleotide sequences without pre-determining sequence structures. The sequence-specific bias of a read is then calculated based on the sequence probabilities estimated by RNNs and used in the estimation of gene abundance. Sequence-specific bias correction for RNA-seq data using recurrent neural networks.
