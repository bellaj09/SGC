Electroencephalograph EEG is a highly nonlinear data and very difficult to be classified. The EEG signal is commonly used in the area of Brain-Computer Interface BCI. The signal can be used as an operative command for directional movements for a powered wheelchair to assist people with disability in performing the daily activity.In this paper we aim to classify Electroencephalograph EEG signals extracted from subjects which had been trained to perform four Motoric Imagery MI tasks for two classes. The classification will be processed via a Convolutional Neural Network CNN utilising all 22 electrodes based on 10-20 system placement. The EEG datasets will be transformed into scaleogram using Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT method.We evaluated two different types of image configuration i.e. layered and stacked input datasets. Our procedure starts from denoising the EEG signals employing Bump CWT from 8-32 Hz brain wave. Our CNN architecture is based on the Visual Geometry Group VGG-16 network. Our results show that layered image dataset yields a high accuracy with an average of 68.33% for two classes classification.
