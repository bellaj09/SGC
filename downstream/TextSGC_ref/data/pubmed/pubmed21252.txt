Immersive head-mounted virtual reality HMD-VR provides a unique opportunity to understand how changes in sensory environments affect motor learning. However potential differences in mechanisms of motor learning and adaptation in HMD-VR versus a conventional training CT environment have not been extensively explored. Here we investigated whether adaptation on a visuomotor rotation task in HMD-VR yields similar adaptation effects in CT and whether these effects are achieved through similar mechanisms. Specifically recent work has shown that visuomotor adaptation may occur via both an implicit error-based internal model and a more cognitive explicit strategic component. We sought to measure both overall adaptation and balance between implicit and explicit mechanisms in HMD-VR versus CT. Twenty-four healthy individuals were placed in either HMD-VR or CT and trained on an identical visuomotor adaptation task that measured both implicit and explicit components. Our results showed that the overall timecourse of adaption was similar in both HMD-VR and CT. However HMD-VR participants utilized a greater cognitive strategy than CT while CT participants engaged in greater implicit learning. These results suggest that while both conditions produce similar results in overall adaptation the mechanisms by which visuomotor adaption occurs in HMD-VR appear to be more reliant on cognitive strategies.
