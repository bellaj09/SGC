Exploiting graph-structured data has many real applications in domains including natural language semantics programming language processing and malware analysis. A variety of methods has been developed to deal with such data. However learning graphs of large-scale varying shapes and sizes is a big challenge for any method. In this paper we propose a multi-view multi-layer convolutional neural network on labeled directed graphs DGCNN in which convolutional filters are designed flexibly to adapt to dynamic structures of local regions inside graphs. The advantages of DGCNN are that we do not need to align vertices between graphs and that DGCNN can process large-scale dynamic graphs with hundred thousands of nodes. To verify the effectiveness of DGCNN we conducted experiments on two tasks: malware analysis and software defect prediction. The results show that DGCNN outperforms the baselines including several deep neural networks. DGCNN: A convolutional neural network over large-scale labeled graphs.
