Artificial intelligence AI will pave the way to a new era in medicine. However currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient e.g. for anamnesis and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in diagnosis or prognosis. However these systems are widely used e.g. in diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study we developed an AI that is able to interact with a patient virtual doctor by using a speech recognition and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the patient which is particularly important for e.g. rural areas where the availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population densities. As a proof-of-concept the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks. Moreover the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI we further analyzed the acceptance of young people for AI in healthcare to estimate the impact of such a system in the future.
