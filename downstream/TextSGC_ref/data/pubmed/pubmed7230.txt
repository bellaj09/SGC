Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in the last two decades. It is either diagnosed malignant or benign - depending upon the severity of the infection and the current stage. The conventional methods require a detailed physical inspection by an expert dermatologist which is time-consuming and imprecise. Therefore several computer vision methods are introduced lately which are cost-effective and somewhat accurate. In this work we propose a new automated approach for skin lesion detection and recognition using a deep convolutional neural network DCNN. The proposed cascaded design incorporates three fundamental steps including; a contrast enhancement through fast local Laplacian filtering FlLpF along HSV color transformation; b lesion boundary extraction using color CNN approach by following XOR operation; c in-depth features extraction by applying transfer learning using Inception V3 model prior to feature fusion using hamming distance HD approach. An entropy controlled feature selection method is also introduced for the selection of the most discriminant features. The proposed method is tested on PH2 and ISIC 2017 datasets whereas the recognition phase is validated on PH2 ISBI 2016 and ISBI 2017 datasets. From the results it is concluded that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods and attained accuracy 98.4% on PH2 dataset 95.1% on ISBI dataset and 94.8% on ISBI 2017 dataset.
