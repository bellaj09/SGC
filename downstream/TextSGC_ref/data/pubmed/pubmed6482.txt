Functional MRI fMRI is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function HRF and an unmeasured latent neural signal. However HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects. This variability is induced by both neural and non-neural factors. Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms which control HRF shape have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ASD. Therefore we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel-specific yet systematic differences in HRF shape between ASD and healthy controls. As a corollary we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in fMRI space compared to latent neural space. To test these hypotheses we performed blind deconvolution of resting-state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE database N\u202f=\u202f1102. Many brain regions previously implicated in autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in ASD. Specifically we found that precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters. Consequently we obtained precuneus-seed-based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls using fMRI as well as using latent neural signals. We found that non-deconvolved fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were instead observed in deconvolved data. Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD as well as have methodological implications for resting-state functional connectivity studies in Autism and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape.
