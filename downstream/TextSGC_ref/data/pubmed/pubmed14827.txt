Segmentation of the chest wall is an important component of methods for automated analysis of breast magnetic resonance imaging MRI. Methods reported to date show promising results but have difficulties delineating the muscle border correctly in breasts with a large proportion of fibroglandular tissue i.e. dense breasts. Knowledge-based methods KBMs as well as methods based on deep learning have been proposed but a systematic comparison of these approaches within one cohort of images is currently lacking. Therefore we developed a KBM and a deep learning method for segmentation of the chest wall in MRI of dense breasts and compared their performances. Knowledge-based and deep learning-based automated chest wall segmentation in magnetic resonance images of extremely dense breasts.
