Recent advances in image acquisition and processing techniques along with the success of novel deep learning architectures have given the opportunity to develop innovative algorithms capable to provide a better characterization of neurological related diseases. In this work we introduce a neural network based approach to classify Multiple Sclerosis MS patients into four clinical profiles. Starting from their structural connectivity information obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and represented as a graph we evaluate the classification performances using unweighted and weighted connectivity matrices. Furthermore we investigate the role of graph-based features for a better characterization and classification of the pathology. Ninety MS patients 12 clinically isolated syndrome 30 relapsing-remitting 28 secondary-progressive and 20 primary-progressive along with 24 healthy controls were considered in this study. This work shows the great performances achieved by neural networks methods in the classification of the clinical profiles. Furthermore it shows local graph metrics do not improve the classification results suggesting that the latent features created by the neural network in its layers have a much important informative content. Finally we observe that graph weights representation of brain connections preserve important information to discriminate between clinical forms.
