Image metrics based on Human Visual System HVS play a remarkable role in the evaluation of complex image processing algorithms. However mimicking the HVS is known to be complex and computationally expensive both in terms of time and memory and its usage is thus limited to a few applications and to small input data. All of this makes such metrics not fully attractive in real-world scenarios. To address these issues we propose Deep Image Quality Metric DIQM a deep-learning approach to learn the global image quality feature mean-opinion-score. DIQM can emulate existing visual metrics efficiently reducing the computational costs by more than an order of magnitude with respect to existing implementations.
