Structured multineuronal activity patterns within local neocortical circuitry are strongly linked to sensory input motor output and behavioral choice. These reliable patterns of pairwise lagged firing are the consequence of connectivity since they are not present in rate-matched but unconnected Poisson nulls. It is important to relate multineuronal patterns to their synaptic underpinnings but it is unclear how effectively statistical dependencies in spiking between neurons identify causal synaptic connections. To assess the feasibility of mapping function onto structure we used a network model that showed a diversity of multineuronal activity patterns and replicated experimental constraints on data acquisition. Using an iterative Bayesian inference algorithm we detected a select subset of monosynaptic connections substantially more precisely than correlation-based inference a common alternative approach. We found that precise inference of synaptic connections improved with increasing numbers of diverse multineuronal activity patterns in contrast to increased observations of a single pattern. Surprisingly neuronal spiking was most effective and precise at revealing causal synaptic connectivity when the lags considered by the iterative Bayesian algorithm encompassed the timescale of synaptic conductance and integration 10 ms rather than synaptic transmission time 2 ms highlighting the importance of synaptic integration in driving postsynaptic spiking. Last strong synaptic connections were detected preferentially underscoring their special importance in cortical computation. Even after simulating experimental constraints top down approaches to cortical connectivity from function to structure identify synaptic connections underlying multineuronal activity. These select connections are closely tied to cortical processing. Multineuronal activity patterns identify selective synaptic connections under realistic experimental constraints.
