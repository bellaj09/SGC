Anticorrelation between the default network DN and dorsal attention network DAN is thought to be an intrinsic aspect of functional brain organization reflecting competing functions. However the effect size of functional connectivity FC between the DN and DAN has yet to be established. Furthermore the stability of anticorrelations across distinct DN subsystems different contexts and time remains unexplored. In study 1 we summarize effect sizes of DN-DAN FC from 20 studies and in study 2 we probe the variability of DN-DAN interactions across six different cognitive states in a new data set. We show that: i the DN and DAN have an independent rather than anticorrelated relationship when global signal regression is not used median effect size across studies: r=-.06; 95% CI: -.15 to .08; ii the DAN exhibits weak negative FC with the DN Core subsystem but is uncorrelated with the dorsomedial prefrontal and medial temporal lobe subsystems; iii DN-DAN interactions vary significantly across different cognitive states; iv DN-DAN FC fluctuates across time between periods of anticorrelation and periods of positive correlation; and v changes across time in the strength of DN-DAN coupling are coordinated with interactions involving the frontoparietal control network FPCN. Overall the observed weak effect sizes related to DN-DAN anticorrelation suggest the need to re-conceptualize the nature of interactions between these networks. Furthermore our findings demonstrate that DN-DAN interactions are not stable but rather exhibit substantial variability across time and context and are coordinated with broader network dynamics involving the FPCN. Interactions between the default network and dorsal attention network vary across default subsystems time and cognitive states.
