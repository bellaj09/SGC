Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging rt-fMRI neurofeedback is a non-invasive non-pharmacological therapeutic tool that may be useful for training behavior and alleviating clinical symptoms. Although previous work has used rt-fMRI to target brain activity in or functional connectivity between a small number of brain regions there is growing evidence that symptoms and behavior emerge from interactions between a number of distinct brain areas. Here we propose a new method for rt-fMRI connectome-based neurofeedback in which intermittent feedback is based on the strength of complex functional networks spanning hundreds of regions and thousands of functional connections. We first demonstrate the technical feasibility of calculating whole-brain functional connectivity in real-time and provide resources for implementing connectome-based neurofeedback. We next show that this approach can be used to provide accurate feedback about the strength of a previously defined connectome-based model of sustained attention the saCPM during task performance. Although in our initial pilot sample neurofeedback based on saCPM strength did not improve performance on out-of-scanner attention tasks future work characterizing effects of network target training duration and amount of feedback on the efficacy of rt-fMRI can inform experimental or clinical trial designs.
