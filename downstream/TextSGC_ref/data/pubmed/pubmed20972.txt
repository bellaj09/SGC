A multitude of simulator systems for endoscopic sinus surgery ESS are available as training tools for residents preparing to enter the operating room. These include human cadavers virtual reality realistic anatomic models and low-fidelity gelatin molds. While these models have been validated and evaluated as independent tools for surgical trainees no study has performed direct comparison of their outcomes. To address this deficiency we aimed to evaluate the utility of high-fidelity and low-fidelity trainers as compared to a traditional control no simulator exposure for novice trainees acquiring basic ESS skills. Thirty-four first-year medical students were randomized to 3 groups and taught basic sinus anatomy and instrumentation. Two groups received training with either the high-fidelity or low-fidelity trainer while 1 group served as control. These groups were then tested with cadaveric specimens. These sessions were recorded and graded by an expert. There was no statistical difference in performance between the 3 study groups with regard to identification of anatomy endoscopic competency or completion of basic tasks. When the high-fidelity and low-fidelity arms were grouped into a single "trained" cohort they demonstrated significantly improved time to completion for basic anatomy P = .043 and total time P = .041. This is the first study to perform a direct comparison of performance between high-fidelity and low-fidelity ESS simulators and controls. Although we found no difference in performance of novice trainees with regard to basic anatomical identification or procedural tasks associated with ESS the use of ESS simulators may improve time to completion.
