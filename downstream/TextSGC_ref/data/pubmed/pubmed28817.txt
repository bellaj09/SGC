"We realized a compact hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system by integrating a portable near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS device with an economical electroencephalography EEG system. The NIRS array was located on the subjects forehead covering the prefrontal area. The EEG electrodes were distributed over the frontal motor/temporal and parietal areas. The experimental paradigm involved a Stroop word-picture matching test in combination with mental arithmetic MA and baseline BL tasks in which the subjects were asked to perform either MA or BL in response to congruent or incongruent conditions respectively. We compared the classification accuracies of each of the modalities NIRS or EEG with that of the hybrid system. We showed that the hybrid system outperforms the unimodal EEG and NIRS systems by 6.2% and 2.5% respectively. Since the proposed hybrid system is based on portable platforms it is not confined to a laboratory environment and has the potential to be used in real-life situations such as in neurorehabilitation."
