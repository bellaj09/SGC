This work presents a table cleaning and inspection method using a Human Support Robot HSR which can operate in a typical food court setting. The HSR is able to perform a cleanliness inspection and also clean the food litter on the table by implementing a deep learning technique and planner framework. A lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network DCNN has been proposed to recognize the food litter on top of the table. In addition the planner framework was proposed to HSR for accomplishing the table cleaning task which generates the cleaning path according to the detection of food litter and then the cleaning action is carried out. The effectiveness of the food litter detection module is verified with the cleanliness inspection task using Toyota HSR and its detection results are verified with standard quality metrics. The experimental results show that the food litter detection module achieves an average of 96 % detection accuracy which is more suitable for deploying the HSR robots for performing the cleanliness inspection and also helps to select the different cleaning modes. Further the planner part has been tested through the table cleaning tasks. The experimental results show that the planner generated the cleaning path in real time and its generated path is optimal which reduces the cleaning time by grouping based cleaning action for removing the food litters from the table.
