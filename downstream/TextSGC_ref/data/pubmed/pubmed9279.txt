We develop a compact imaging system to enable simultaneous acquisition of the spectral and depth information in real time. Our system consists of a spectral camera with low spatial resolution and an RGB camera with high spatial resolution which captures two measurements from two different views of the same scene at the same time. Relying on an elaborate computational reconstruction algorithm with deep learning our system can eventually obtain a spectral cube with a spatial resolution of 1920\u2009\u20091080 and a total of 16 spectral bands in the visible light section as well as the corresponding depth map with the same spatial resolution. Quantitative and qualitative results on benchmark datasets and real-world scenes show that our reconstruction results are accurate and reliable. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to capture 5D information 3D space + 1D spectrum + 1D time with a miniaturized apparatus and without active illumination.
