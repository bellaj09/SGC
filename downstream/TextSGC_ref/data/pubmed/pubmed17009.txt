Two studies suggest that reductions in posttraumatic symptoms Aderka et al. 2013 and cognitions Zalta et al. 2014 precede reductions in depressive symptoms during prolonged exposure PE therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD in female assault survivors. The present study explored the temporal relationship between posttraumatic and depressive symptoms in a randomized trial of D-Cycloserine DCS versus placebo augmented virtual reality exposure VRE therapy for chronic World Trade Center-related PTSD following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks. Twenty-five male and female participants were randomly assigned to receive either 100\u202fmg DCS N\u202f=\u202f13 or placebo N\u202f=\u202f12 90\u202fmin before 12 weekly VRE sessions. Participants contributed a total of 280 weekly PTSD Checklist PCL; Weathers et al. 1993 and Beck Depression Inventory-second edition BDI-II; Beck et al. 1996 symptom scores. Two sets of mediation analyses for longitudinal mixed models assessed the effects of 1 lagged PCL on BDI-II Model 1 and 2 lagged BDI-II on PCL Model 2 in the VRE-DCS and VRE-Placebo treatment groups respectively. Results revealed reciprocal relations between posttraumatic and depressive symptoms during VRE treatment although reductions in posttraumatic symptoms led to subsequent reductions in depressive symptoms to a greater extent than the converse. These effects were stronger in the DCS-enhanced group. Findings suggest that VRE primarily decreases posttraumatic symptoms which in turn leads to decreased depressive symptoms and that DCS may strengthen these effects.
