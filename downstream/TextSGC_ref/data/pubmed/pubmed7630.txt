Scanning acoustic microscopy SAM provides high-resolution images of biological tissues. Since higher transducer frequencies limit penetration depth image resolution enhancement techniques could help in maintaining sufficient lateral resolution without sacrificing penetration depth. Compared with existing SAM research this work introduces two novelties. First deep learning DL is used to improve lateral resolution of 180-MHz SAM images comparing it with two deconvolution-based approaches. Second 316-MHz images are used as ground truth in order to quantitatively evaluate image resolution enhancement. The samples used were mouse and rat brain sections. The results demonstrate that DL can closely approximate ground truth NRMSE = 0.056 and PSNR = 28.4 dB even with a relatively limited training set four images each smaller than 1 mm 1 mm. This study suggests the high potential of using DL as a single image superresolution method in SAM.
