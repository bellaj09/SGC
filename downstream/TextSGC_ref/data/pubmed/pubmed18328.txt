Wireless communications in industrial environments are seriously affected by reliability and performance issues due to the multipath nature of obstacles within such environments. Special attention needs to be given to planning a wireless industrial network so as to find the optimum spatial position for each of the nodes within the network and especially for key nodes such as gateways or cluster heads. The aim of this paper is to present a pervasive radio mapping system which captures senses data regarding the radio spectrum using low-cost wireless sensor nodes. This data is the input of radio mapping algorithms that generate electromagnetic propagation profiles. Such profiles are used for identifying obstacles within the environment and optimum propagation pathways. With the purpose of further optimizing the radio planning process the authors propose a novel human-network interaction HNI paradigm that uses 3D virtual environments in order to display the radio maps in a natural easy-to-perceive manner. The results of this approach illustrate its added value to the field of radio resource planning of industrial communication systems.
