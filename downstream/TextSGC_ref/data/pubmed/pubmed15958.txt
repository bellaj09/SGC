"The vitamin D-modulated transcriptome of highly responsive human cells such as THP-1 monocytes comprises more than 500 genes half of which are primary targets. Recently we proposed a chromatin model of vitamin D signaling demonstrating that nearly all vitamin D target genes are located within vitamin D-modulated topologically associated domains TADs. This model is based on genome-wide binding patterns of the vitamin D receptor VDR the pioneer transcription factor PU.1 the chromatin organizer CTCF and histone markers of active promoter regions H3K4me3 and active chromatin H3K27ac. In addition time-dependent data on accessible chromatin and mRNA expression are implemented. For the interrogation and in deep inspection of these high-dimensional datasets unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms were applied. Unsupervised methods such as the vector quantization tool K-means and the dimensionality reduction algorithm self-organizing map generated descriptions of how attributes such as VDR binding and chromatin accessibility affect each other as a function of time and/or co-localization within the same genomic region. Supervised algorithms such as random forests allowed the data to be classified into pre-existing categories like persistent i.e. constant and time-dependent i.e. transient VDR binding sites. The relative amounts of these VDR categories in TADs showed to be the main discriminator for sorting the latter into five classes carrying vitamin D target genes involved in distinct biological processes. In conclusion via the application of machine learning methods we identified the spatio-temporal VDR binding pattern in TADs as the most critical attribute for specific regulation of vitamin D target genes and the segregation of vitamin Ds physiologic function."
