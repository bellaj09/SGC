"The next generation of VR simulators could take into account a novel input: the users mental state as measured with electrodes and a brain-computer interface. One illustration of this promising path is a project that adapted a guidance systems force feedback to the users mental workload in real time. A first application of this approach is a medical training simulator that provides virtual assistance that adapts to the trainees mental activity. Such results pave the way to VR systems that will automatically reconfigure and adapt to their users mental states and cognitive processes." Toward adaptive VR simulators combining visual haptic and brain-computer interfaces.
