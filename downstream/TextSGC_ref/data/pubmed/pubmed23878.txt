"While sensory and motor systems have attracted most of the research effort in the field neuroprosthetics little attention has been devoted to higher order cortical processes. Here we propose a first step in the direction of applying neural decoding to the study and manipulation of visuospatial attention an endogenous process at the interface between sensory and motor functions. To this aim we investigate whether the offline activity of a population of non-human primate frontal eye field neurons FEF in response to an endogenous cue can be readout on a trial by trial basis to provide a precise description of the cues attributes namely its location and identity but also the allocation of attention following its interpretation. Using a linear decoder we reach up to 86% correct predictions for the different decoded variables including the spatial allocation of endogenous attention. We show that the decoding performance drops on incorrect trials indicating that cue encoding participates to the animals behavioral performance. Last we show that the temporal resolution of the decoding influences readout performance. These results are a strong indication of the feasibility of the readout of endogenous variables by standard decoding algorithms on a suboptimal dataset. However its validity remains to be proved in a real-time situation."
