Noise in electroencephalography data EEG is an ubiquitous problem that limits the performance of brain computer interfaces BCI. While typical EEG artifacts are usually removed by trial rejection or by filtering noise induced in the data by the subject\s failure to produce the required mental state is very harmful. Such "noise" effects are rather common especially for naive subjects in their training phase and thus standard artifact removal methods would inevitably fail. In this paper we present a novel method which aims to detect such defected trials taking into account the intended task by use of Relevant Dimensionality Estimation RDE a new machine learning method for denoising in feature space. In this manner our method effectively "cleans" the training data and thus allows better BCI classification. Preliminary results conducted on a data set of 43 naive subjects show a significant improvement for 74% of the subjects. Improving BCI performance by task-related trial pruning.
