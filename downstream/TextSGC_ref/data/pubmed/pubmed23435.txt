Recognizing a person in a crowded environment is a challenging yet critical visual-search task for both humans and machine-vision algorithms. This paper explores the possibility of combining a residual neural network ResNet brain-computer interfaces BCIs and human participants to create "cyborgs" that improve decision making. Human participants and a ResNet undertook the same face-recognition experiment. BCIs were used to decode the decision confidence of humans from their EEG signals. Different types of cyborg groups were created including either only humans with or without the BCI or groups of humans and the ResNet. Cyborg groups decisions were obtained weighing individual decisions by confidence estimates. Results show that groups of cyborgs are significantly more accurate up to 35% than the ResNet the average participant and equally-sized groups of humans not assisted by technology. These results suggest that melding humans BCI and machine-vision technology could significantly improve decision-making in realistic scenarios. Cyborg groups enhance face recognition in crowded environments.
