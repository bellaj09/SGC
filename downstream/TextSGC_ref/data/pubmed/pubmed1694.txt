Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic. While its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract the general extent of organ involvement as well as microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. Post-mortem examination of COVID19 patients reveals diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings of lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction.
