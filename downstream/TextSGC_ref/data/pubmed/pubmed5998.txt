Connectivity and biophysical processes determine the functionality of neuronal networks. We therefore developed a real-time framework called Neural Interactome to simultaneously visualize and interact with the structure and dynamics of such networks. Neural Interactome is a cross-platform framework which combines graph visualization with the simulation of neural dynamics or experimentally recorded multi neural time series to allow application of stimuli to neurons to examine network responses. In addition Neural Interactome supports structural changes such as disconnection of neurons from the network ablation feature. Neural dynamics can be explored on a single neuron level using a zoom feature back in time using a review feature and recorded using presets feature. The development of the Neural Interactome was guided by generic concepts to be applicable to neuronal networks with different neural connectivity and dynamics. We implement the framework using a model of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans nematode a model organism with resolved connectome and neural dynamics. We show that Neural Interactome assists in studying neural response patterns associated with locomotion and other stimuli. In particular we demonstrate how stimulation and ablation help in identifying neurons that shape particular dynamics. We examine scenarios that were experimentally studied such as touch response circuit and explore new scenarios that did not undergo elaborate experimental studies.
