Depression is a leading cause of disability and is commonly comorbid with obesity. Emotion regulation is impaired in both depression and obesity. In this study we aimed to explicate multi-unit relations among brain connectivity behavior and self-reported trait measures related to emotion regulation in a comorbid depressed and obese sample N\u2009=\u200977. Brain connectivity was quantified as fractional anisotropy FA of the uncinate fasciculi a white matter tract implicated in emotion regulation and in depression. Use of emotion regulation strategies was assessed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ERQ. We additionally measured reaction times to identifying negative emotions a behavioral index of depression-related emotion processing biases. We found that greater right uncinate fasciculus FA was related to greater usage of suppression r\u2009=\u20090.27 p\u2009=\u20090.022 and to faster reaction times to identifying negative emotions particularly sadness r\u2009=\u2009-0.30 p\u2009=\u20090.010 and fear r\u2009=\u2009-0.35 p\u2009=\u20090.003. These findings suggest that FA of the right uncinate fasciculus corresponds to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and emotion processing biases that are relevant to co-occurring depression and obesity. Interventions that consider these multi-unit associations may prove to be useful for subtyping and improving clinical outcomes for comorbid depression and obesity. Multi-unit relations among neural self-report and behavioral correlates of emotion regulation in comorbid depression and obesity.
