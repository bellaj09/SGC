Current training methods in fiberoptic intubation entail a trial and error process in which trainees acquire skills by practicing this technique in mannequins or patients. These training methods are not efficient and may expose patients to unnecessary instrumentation. An interactive software program is described which uses Director a commercially available multimedia authoring tool to 1 familiarize trainees with video images of the upper airway 2 permit operator controlled progress through a normal fiberoptic intubation 3 simultaneously display side by side two-dimensional or three-dimensional computer tomographic images with a fiberscope in place and the corresponding endoscopic video images and 4 demonstrate some of the obstacles which occur in clinical practice e.g. "white-out" and saliva. The intent of this package is to simulate fiberoptic intubation techniques as well as help one create a mental image of the path a fiberscope takes within the lumen of the upper airway. The potential for improving operator immersion virtual reality by using a more sophisticated input device is discussed. The development of a multimedia teaching program for fiberoptic intubation.
