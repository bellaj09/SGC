In 4 category cued recall experiments participants falsely recalled nonlist common members a semantic confusion error. Errors were more likely if critical nonlist words were presented on an incidental task causing source memory failures called episodic confusion errors. Participants could better identify the source of falsely recalled words if they had deeply processed the words on the incidental task. For deep but not shallow processing participants could reliably include or exclude incidentally shown category members in recall. The illusion that critical items actually appeared on categorized lists was diminished but not eradicated when participants identified episodic confusion errors post hoc among their own recalled responses; participants often believed that critical items had been on both the incidental task and the study list. Improved source monitoring can potentially mitigate episodic but not semantic confusion errors. "The use of source memory to identify ones own episodic confusion errors."
