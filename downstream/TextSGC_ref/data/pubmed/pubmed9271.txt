Crack detection on dam surfaces is an important task for safe inspection of hydropower stations. More and more object detection methods based on deep learning are being applied to crack detection. However most of the methods can only achieve the classification and rough location of cracks. Pixel-level crack detection can provide more intuitive and accurate detection results for dam health assessment. To realize pixel-level crack detection a method of crack detection on dam surface CDDS using deep convolution network is proposed. First we use an unmanned aerial vehicle UAV to collect dam surface images along a predetermined trajectory. Second raw images are cropped. Then crack regions are manually labelled on cropped images to create the crack dataset and the architecture of CDDS network is designed. Finally the CDDS network is trained validated and tested using the crack dataset. To validate the performance of the CDDS network the predicted results are compared with ResNet152-based SegNet UNet and fully convolutional network FCN. In terms of crack segmentation the recall precision F-measure and IoU are 80.45% 80.31% 79.16% and 66.76%. The results on test dataset show that the CDDS network has better performance for crack detection of dam surfaces.
