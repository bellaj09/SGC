Access to big data analyzed by supercomputers using advanced mathematical algorithms i.e. deep machine learning has allowed for enhancement of cognitive output i.e. visual imaging interpretation to previously unseen levels and promises to fundamentally change the practice of medicine. This field known as "artificial intelligence" AI is making significant progress in areas such as automated clinical decision making medical imaging analysis and interventional procedures and has the potential to dramatically influence the practice of interventional cardiology. The unique nature of interventional cardiology makes it an ideal target for the development of AI-based technologies designed to improve real-time clinical decision making streamline workflow in the catheterization laboratory and standardize catheter-based procedures through advanced robotics. This review provides an introduction to AI by highlighting its scope potential\xa0applications and limitations in interventional cardiology.
