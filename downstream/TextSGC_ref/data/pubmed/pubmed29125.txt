"How patterns of covariance in motor output and neural activity emerge over the course of learning is a topic of ongoing investigation. Vaidya et al. Vaidya M Balasubramanian K Southerland J Badreldin I Eleryan A Shattuck K Gururangan S Slutzky M Osborne L Fagg A Oweiss K Hatsopoulos NG. J Neurophysiol 119: 1291-1304 2018 investigate the emergence of patterns of covariance in the motor output and neural activity in chronically amputated macaques learning reach-to-grasp movements with a brain-machine interface. The authors findings have implications for uncovering general principles of how neural coordination unfolds while learning a different motor behavior." Emergent coordination with a brain-machine interface: implications for the neural basis of motor learning.
