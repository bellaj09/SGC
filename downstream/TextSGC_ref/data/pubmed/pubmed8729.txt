Admission computed tomography CT is a widely used diagnostic tool for patients with pelvic fractures. In this pilot study we hypothesized that pelvic hematoma volumes derived using a rapid automated deep learning-based quantitative visualization and measurement algorithm predict interventions and outcomes including a need for angioembolization AE pelvic packing PP or massive transfusion MT and b in-hospital mortality. Deep learning-based quantitative visualization and measurement of extraperitoneal hematoma volumes in patients with pelvic fractures: Potential role in personalized forecasting and decision support.
