Porous media are ubiquitous in both nature and engineering applications. Therefore their modeling and understanding is of vital importance. In contrast to direct acquisition of three-dimensional 3D images of this type of medium obtaining its subregion s such as 2D images or several small areas can be feasible. Therefore reconstructing whole images from limited information is a primary technique in these types of cases. Given data in practice cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or only partially informed thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or even ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming in this study we propose a deep-learning-based framework for reconstructing full images from their much smaller subareas. In particular conditional generative adversarial network is utilized to learn the mapping between the input a partial image and output a full image. To ensure the reconstruction accuracy two simple but effective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two functions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Because of the inherent essence of this ill-posed problem a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing reconstruction diversity thus enabling the network to provide multiple candidate outputs. Our method is extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and validated by both visual inspection and quantitative comparison. It is shown to be accurate stable and even fast 0.08 s for a 128128 image reconstruction. The proposed approach can be readily extended by for example incorporating user-defined conditional data and an arbitrary number of object functions into reconstruction while being coupled with other reconstruction methods.
