Fluorescence videography is a promising technique for assessing bowel perfusion. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality FLER is a novel concept in which a dynamic perfusion cartogram generated by computer analysis is superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in a small bowel resection-anastomosis model. Intraoperative fluorescence-based enhanced reality laparoscopic real-time imaging to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site in an experimental model.
