Stroke effects millions of people each year and can have a significant impact on the ability to use the impaired arm and hand. One of the results of stroke is the development of an abnormal shoulder-elbow flexion synergy where lifting the arm can cause the elbow wrist and finger flexors to involuntarily contract reducing the ability to reach with the arm and hand opening. This study explored the effect of using support at the upper arm to improve hand and arm reaching performance. Nine participants were studied while performing a virtual reaching task under three conditions: while the weight of their impaired arm was supported by a robot arm while unsupported and while using their non-impaired arm. Most subjects exhibited faster and more accurate reaching while supported compared to unsupported. For the subjects who could voluntarily open their hand most were able to more swiftly open their hand when using upper arm support. In many cases performance with support was not statistically different than the unaffected arm and hand. Muscle activity of the impaired limb with upper arm support showed decreased effort to lift the arm and reduced biceps activity in most subjects pointing to a reduction in the abnormal flexion synergy while using upper arm support. While arm support can help to reduce the activation of abnormal synergies weakness resulting from hemiparesis remains an issue impacting performance. Future systems will need to address both of these causes of disability to more fully restore function after stroke. A pilot study into reaching performance after severe to moderate stroke using upper arm support.
