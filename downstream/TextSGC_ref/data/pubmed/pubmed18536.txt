Moving or static obstacles often get in the way while walking in daily life. Avoiding obstacles involves both perceptual processing of motion information and controlling appropriate defensive movements. Several higher-level motion areas including the ventral intraparietal area VIP medial superior temporal area parieto-insular vestibular cortex PIVC areas V6 and V6A and cingulate sulcus visual area have been identified in humans by passive viewing of optic flow patterns that simulate egomotion and object motion. However the roles of these areas in the active control of egomotion in the real world remain unclear. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to map the neural substrates underlying the passive observation and active control of translational egomotion in humans. A wide-field virtual reality environment simulated a daily scenario where doors randomly swing outward while walking in a hallway. The stimuli of door-dodging events were essentially the same in two event-related fMRI experiments which compared passive and active dodges in response to swinging doors. Passive dodges were controlled by a computer program while active dodges were controlled by the subject. Passive dodges activated several higher-level areas distributed across three dorsal motion streams in the temporal parietal and cingulate cortex. Active dodges most strongly activated the temporal-vestibular stream with peak activation located in the right PIVC. Other higher-level motion areas including VIP showed weaker to no activation in active dodges. These results suggest that PIVC plays an active role in sensing and guiding translational egomotion that moves an observer aside from impending obstacles.
