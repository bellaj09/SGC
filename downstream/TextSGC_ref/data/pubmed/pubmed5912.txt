Currently the use of artificial intelligence AI in radiology particularly machine learning ML has become a reality in clinical practice. Since the end of the last century several ML algorithms have been introduced for a wide range of common imaging tasks not only for diagnostic purposes but also for image acquisition and postprocessing. AI is now recognized to be a driving initiative in every aspect of radiology. There is growing evidence of the advantages of AI in radiology creating seamless imaging workflows for radiologists or even replacing radiologists. Most of the current AI methods have some internal and external disadvantages that are impeding their ultimate implementation in the clinical arena. As such AI can be considered a portion of a business trying to be introduced in the health care market. For this reason this review analyzes the current status of AI and specifically ML applied to radiology from the scope of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats SWOT analysis. Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats Analysis of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications in Radiology.
