In the present study a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information MI was applied to electro-encephalographic EEG data acquired during three different motor imagery tasks from two dataset: Dataset I from BCI Competition IV including full scalp recordings from four subjects and new data recorded from three subjects using the popular low-cost Emotiv EPOC EEG headset. The aim was to evaluate optimal channels and band-power BP features for motor imagery tasks discrimination in order to assess the feasibility of a portable low-cost motor imagery based Brain-Computer Interface BCI system. The minimal sub set of features most relevant to task description and less redundant to each other was determined and the corresponding classification accuracy was assessed offline employing linear support vector machine SVM in a 10-fold cross validation scheme. The analysis was performed: a on the original full Dataset I from BCI competition IV b on a restricted channels set from Dataset I corresponding to available Emotiv EPOC electrodes locations and c on data recorded with the EPOC system. Results from a showed that an offline classification accuracy above 80% can be reached using only 5 features. Limiting the analysis to EPOC channels caused a decrease of classification accuracy although it still remained above chance level both for data from b and c. A top accuracy of 70% was achieved using 2 optimal features. These results encourage further research towards the development of portable low cost motor imagery-based BCI systems.
