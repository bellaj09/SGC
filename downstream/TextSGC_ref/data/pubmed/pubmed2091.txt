Reliability of subject-level resting-state functional connectivity FC is determined in part by the statistical techniques employed in its estimation. Methods that pool information across subjects to inform estimation of subject-level effects e.g. Bayesian approaches have been shown to enhance reliability of subject-level FC. However fully Bayesian approaches are computationally demanding while empirical Bayesian approaches typically rely on using repeated measures to estimate the variance components in the model. Here we avoid the need for repeated measures by proposing a novel measurement error model for FC describing the different sources of variance and error which we use to perform empirical Bayes shrinkage of subject-level FC towards the group average. In addition since the traditional intra-class correlation coefficient ICC is inappropriate for biased estimates we propose a new reliability measure denoted the mean squared error intra-class correlation coefficient ICCMSE to properly assess the reliability of the resulting biased estimates. We apply the proposed techniques to test-retest resting-state fMRI data on 461 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to estimate connectivity between 100 regions identified through independent components analysis ICA. We consider both correlation and partial correlation as the measure of FC and assess the benefit of shrinkage for each measure as well as the effects of scan duration. We find that shrinkage estimates of subject-level FC exhibit substantially greater reliability than traditional estimates across various scan durations even for the most reliable connections and regardless of connectivity measure. Additionally we find partial correlation reliability to be highly sensitive to the choice of penalty term and to be generally worse than that of full correlations except for certain connections and a narrow range of penalty values. This suggests that the penalty needs to be chosen carefully when using partial correlations.
