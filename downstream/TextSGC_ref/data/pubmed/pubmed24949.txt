Workload estimation from electroencephalographic signals EEG offers a highly sensitive tool to adapt the human-computer interaction to the user state. To create systems that reliably work in the complexity of the real world a robustness against contextual changes e.g. mood has to be achieved. To study the resilience of state-of-the-art EEG-based workload classification against stress we devise a novel experimental protocol in which we manipulated the affective context stressful/non-stressful while the participant solved a task with two workload levels. We recorded self-ratings behavior and physiology from 24 participants to validate the protocol. We test the capability of different subject-specific workload classifiers using either frequency-domain time-domain or both feature varieties to generalize across contexts. We show that the classifiers are able to transfer between affective contexts though performance suffers independent of the used feature domain. However cross-context training is a simple and powerful remedy allowing the extraction of features in all studied feature varieties that are more resilient to task-unrelated variations in signal characteristics. Especially for frequency-domain features across-context training is leading to a performance comparable to within-context training and testing. We discuss the significance of the result for neurophysiology-based workload detection in particular and for the construction of reliable passive brain-computer interfaces in general.
