"Understanding memory formation storage and retrieval requires knowledge of the underlying neuronal circuits. In Drosophila the mushroom body MB is the major site of associative learning. We reconstructed the morphologies and synaptic connections of all 983 neurons within the three functional units or compartments that compose the adult MBs  lobe using a dataset of isotropic 8 nm voxels collected by focused ion-beam milling scanning electron microscopy. We found that Kenyon cells KCs whose sparse activity encodes sensory information each make multiple en passant synapses to MB output neurons MBONs in each compartment. Some MBONs have inputs from all KCs while others differentially sample sensory modalities. Only 6% of KC>MBON synapses receive a direct synapse from a dopaminergic neuron DAN. We identified two unanticipated classes of synapses KC>DAN and DAN>MBON. DAN activation produces a slow depolarization of the MBON in these DAN>MBON synapses and can weaken memory recall."
