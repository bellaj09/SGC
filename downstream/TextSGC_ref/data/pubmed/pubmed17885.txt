The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to assess whether voluntary participation in a proctored proficiency-based virtual reality robotic suturing curriculum using the da Vinci Skills Simulator improves robotic suturing performance. Residents and attending surgeons were randomized to participation or non-participation during a 5\xa0week training curriculum. Robotic suturing skills were evaluated before and after training using an inanimate vaginal cuff model which participants sutured for 10\xa0min using the da Vinci Surgical System. Performances were videotaped anonymized and subsequently graded independently by three robotic surgeons. 27 participants were randomized. 23 of the 27 completed both the pre- and post-test 13 in the training group and 10 in the control group. Mean training time in the intervention group was 238\xa0\xa0136\xa0min SD over the 5\xa0weeks. The primary outcome improvement in GOALS+ score and the secondary outcomes improvement in GEARS total knots satisfactory knots and the virtual reality suture sponge 1 task were significantly greater in the training group than the control group in unadjusted analysis. After adjusting for lower baseline scores in the training group improvement in the suture sponge 1 task remained significantly greater in the training group and a trend was demonstrated to greater improvement in the training group for the GOALS+ score GEARS score total knots and satisfactory knots.
