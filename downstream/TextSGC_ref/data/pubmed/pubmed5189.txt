Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system was considered as one of the factors involved in the pathological mechanisms of premature ejaculation PE. Sympathetic skin response of the penis PSSR was used to evaluate the activity of sympathetic innervations in the penis which was controlled by the central nervous system brain. Shorter PSSR was found in PE patients; however little was known regarding the central neural mechanisms of PE patients with high sympathetic activity. Graph analysis of DTI-based connectome: decreased local efficiency of subcortical regions in PE patients with high sympathetic activity.
