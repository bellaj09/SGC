Acupuncture manipulations on Fengchi GB 20 of famous doctors were taken through force feedback device then the data was input into a digitized virtual human. Virtual Fengchi GB 20 acupuncture force feedback simulation system was built through the virtual reality technology to achieve one-to-one high simulative manipulation effect for acupuncture students. The interaction force of the needle body and human tissues was analyzed during the acupuncture process on the 3D digital human integrated with information of Fengchi GB 20 according to the physical characteristics of the tissues under this point. The mechanical model which is used to imitate the stress received by the body of the needle was established and transmitted truly to the operator by the force feedback device. Thus Fengchi GB 20 virtual acupuncture force feedback simulation was preliminary established and the sense of touch could be reproduced lively on the visualized virtual acupuncture human. It is held that Fengchi GB 20 acupuncture force feedback research is a preliminary exploration for virtual acupuncture that integrated with the information of visual tactile and force feedback. And it also provided a dynamic one-to-one simulation approach for acupuncture teaching. Study on force feedback of acupuncture at Fengchi GB 20.
