"The objective of this pilot study is to identify the level of difficulty in which subjects with left hemisphere damage in the acute phase after stroke can start practicing in a virtual environment. Second to test an application of Virtual Reality technology to existing occupational treatment methods in stroke rehabilitation and develop a platform for home rehabilitation controlled telemedically. The findings indicate that the system shows potential as an assessment and training device. The feasibility study setup is working well likewise the assessment method. Developing and increasing the complexity of the tasks must be based on the patient individual neurology and that the cinematic motion patterns of the patients are the basis for exercise design."
