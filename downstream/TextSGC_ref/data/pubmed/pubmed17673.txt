"To answer the question of whether there is a difference between robotic virtual reality simulator performance assessment and validated human reviewers. Current surgical education relies heavily on simulation. Several assessment tools are available to the trainee including the actual robotic simulator assessment metrics and the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills GEARS metrics both of which have been independently validated. GEARS is a rating scale through which human evaluators can score trainees performances on 6 domains: depth perception bimanual dexterity efficiency force sensitivity autonomy and robotic control. Each domain is scored on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors. We used 2 common robotic simulators the dV-Trainer dVT; Mimic Technologies Inc. Seattle WA and the da Vinci Skills Simulator dVSS; Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvale CA to compare the performance metrics of robotic surgical simulators with the GEARS for a basic robotic task on each simulator."
