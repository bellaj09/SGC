"Neuroengineering is faced with unique challenges in repairing or replacing complex neural systems that are composed of many interacting parts. These interactions form intricate patterns over large spatiotemporal scales and produce emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict from individual elements. Network science provides a particularly appropriate framework in which to study and intervene in such systems by treating neural elements cells volumes as nodes in a graph and neural interactions synapses white matter tracts as edges in that graph. Here we review the emerging discipline of network neuroscience which uses and develops tools from graph theory to better understand and manipulate neural systems from micro- to macroscales. We present examples of how human brain imaging data are being modeled with network analysis and underscore potential pitfalls. We then highlight current computational and theoretical frontiers and emphasize their utility in informing diagnosis and monitoring brain-machine interfaces and brain stimulation. A flexible and rapidly evolving enterprise network neuroscience provides a set of powerful approaches and fundamental insights that are critical for the neuroengineers tool kit."
