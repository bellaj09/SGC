"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs that are based on event-related potentials ERPs can estimate to which stimulus a user pays particular attention. In typical BCIs the user silently counts the selected stimulus which is repeatedly presented among other stimuli in order to focus the attention. The stimulus of interest is then inferred from the electroencephalogram EEG. Detecting attention allocation implicitly could be also beneficial for human-computer interaction HCI because it would allow software to adapt to the users interest. However a counting task would be inappropriate for the envisaged implicit application in HCI. Therefore the question was addressed if the detectable neural activity is specific for silent counting or if it can be evoked also by other tasks that direct the attention to certain stimuli." Is Neural Activity Detected by ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces Task Specific?
