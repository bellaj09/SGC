In this paper an improved Computer Aided Design system can offer a second opinion to radiologists on early diagnosis of pulmonary nodules on CT Computer Tomography images. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network DCNN method is used for feature extraction and hybridize as combination of Convolutional Neural Network CNN Histogram of Oriented Gradient HOG Extended Histogram of Oriented Gradients ExHOG and Local Binary Pattern LBP. A combination of shape texture scaling rotation translation features extracted using HOG LBP and CNN. The Homogeneous descriptors used to extract the feature of lung images from Lung Image Database Consortium LIDC are given to classifiers Support Vector Machine SVM K-Nearest Neighbour KNN Decision Tree and Random Forest to classify nodules and non-nodules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of accuracy which gives best result than the competing methods. A Novel Hybrid Feature Extraction Model for Classification on Pulmonary Nodules
