The effects of deep brain stimulation on motor functions cognitive abilities and mood were assessed in an 80-year-old right-handed male with a chronic history of essential tremor. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus during a single operation. Upon evaluation at 3 months postsurgery bilateral stimulation was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tremor ratings and improvement in manual dexterity. At that time a battery of neuropsychological measures was administered with and without bilateral stimulation. The patient demonstrated comparable performances on measures of visuospatial perception attention mental tracking verbal learning and verbal recognition memory in both the "on" and "off" conditions. Without stimulation the patient demonstrated declines of greater than 1 SD on measures of verbal fluency and verbal recall compared to when the stimulators were active. Responses to mood rating scales also indicated greater subjective distress without stimulation. Results are discussed in the context of previous studies of the effects of thalamic stimulation on neurocognitive functioning. Neuropsychological functioning in a patient with essential tremor with and without bilateral VIM stimulation.
