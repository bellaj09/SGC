"This paper illustrates a new architecture for a human-humanoid interaction based on EEG-brain computer interface EEG-BCI for patients affected by locked-in syndrome caused by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS. The proposed architecture is able to recognise users mental state accordingly to the biofeedback factor  based on users attention intention and focus that is used to elicit a robot to perform customised behaviours. Experiments have been conducted with a population of eight subjects: four ALS patients in a near locked-in status with normal ocular movement and four healthy control subjects enrolled for age education and computer expertise. The results showed as three ALS patients have completed the task with 96.67% success; the healthy controls with 100% success; the fourth ALS has been excluded from the results for his low general attention during the task; the analysis of factor highlights as ALS subjects have shown stronger 81.20% than healthy controls 76.77%. Finally a post-hoc analysis is provided to show how robotic feedback helps in maintaining focus on expected task. These preliminary data suggest that ALS patients could successfully control a humanoid robot through a BCI architecture potentially enabling them to conduct some everyday tasks and extend their presence in the environment."
