"In order to predict the risks of Alzheimers Disease AD based on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG positron emission tomography PET a total of 350 mild cognitive impairment MCI participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI database were selected as the research objects; in addition the Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding CAFFE was selected as the framework of the deep learning platform; the FDG PET image features of each participant were extracted by a deep convolution network model to construct the prediction and classification models; therefore the MCI stage features were classified and the transformation was predicted. The results showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction the sensitivity and specificity of conv3 classification were respectively 91.02% and 77.63%; in terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment LMCI and Early Mild Cognitive Impairment EMCI classification the accuracy of conv5 classification was 72.19% and the sensitivity and specificity of conv5 were all 73% approximately. Thus it was seen that the model constructed in the research could be used to solve the problems of MCI transformation prediction which also had certain effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of AD based on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research matched the expected results. It provided a relatively accurate reference model for the prediction of AD. Despite the deficiencies of the research process the research results have provided certain references and guidance for the future exploration of accurate AD prediction model; therefore the research is of great significance."
