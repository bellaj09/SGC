Despite much dynamical cellular behaviour being achieved by accurate regulation of protein concentrations messenger RNA abundances measured by microarray technology and more recently by deep sequencing techniques are widely used as proxies for protein measurements. Although for some species and under some conditions there is good correlation between transcriptome and proteome level measurements such correlation is by no means universal due to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation both of which are highly prevalent in cells. Here we seek to develop a data-driven machine learning approach to bridging the gap between these two levels of high-throughput omic measurements on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and deploy the model in a novel way to uncover mRNA-protein pairs that are candidates for post-translational regulation. Bridging the gap between transcriptome and proteome measurements identifies post-translationally regulated genes.
