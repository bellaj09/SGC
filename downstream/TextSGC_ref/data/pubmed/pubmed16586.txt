Virtual reality VR technology along with treadmill training TT can effectively provide goal-oriented practice and promote improved motor learning in patients with neurological disorders. Moreover the VR\u2009+\u2009TT scheme may enhance cognitive engagement for more effective gait rehabilitation and greater transfer to over ground walking. For this purpose we developed an individualized treadmill controller with a novel speed estimation scheme using swing foot velocity which can enable user-driven treadmill walking UDW to more closely simulate over ground walking OGW during treadmill training. OGW involves a cyclic acceleration-deceleration profile of pelvic velocity that contrasts with typical treadmill-driven walking TDW which constrains a person to walk at a preset constant speed. In this study we investigated the effects of the proposed speed adaptation controller by analyzing the gait kinematics of UDW and TDW which were compared to those of OGW at three pre-determined velocities. A novel walking speed estimation scheme and its application to treadmill control for gait rehabilitation.
