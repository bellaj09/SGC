Identifying functional effects of noncoding variants is a major challenge in human genetics. To predict the noncoding-variant effects de novo from sequence we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework DeepSEA http://deepsea.princeton.edu/ that directly learns a regulatory sequence code from large-scale chromatin-profiling data enabling prediction of chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single-nucleotide sensitivity. We further used this capability to improve prioritization of functional variants including expression quantitative trait loci eQTLs and disease-associated variants.
