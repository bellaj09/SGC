This paper proposes the hybrid BCI modalities for wheelchair control by taking into account weakness of the current BCI systems. The idea is to combine two hybrid BCI systems with the intelligent wheelchair for three states i.e. normal fatigue and emergency states. First system is the hybrid steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP and alpha rhythm BCI which is designed to use in the normal state. Second system is the hybrid motion visual stimulus and alpha rhythm which can be employed during the fatigue state after using the first system. For the experiment subjects are asked to perform SSVEP system for 30 minutes until the fatigue states occur. Then the subjects will be asked to perform the hybrid motion visual stimulus and alpha rhythm testing. The accuracy of the proposed system during fatigue state is approximately 85.62%. With this idea BCI controlled wheelchair can be efficiently employed in reality. Hybrid SSVEP-motion visual stimulus based BCI system for intelligent wheelchair.
