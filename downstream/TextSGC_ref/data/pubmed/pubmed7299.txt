Data science has emerged from the proliferation of digital data coupled with advances in algorithms software and hardware e.g. GPU computing. Innovations in structural biology have been driven by similar factors spurring us to ask: can these two fields impact one another in deep and hitherto unforeseen ways? We posit that the answer is yes. New biological knowledge lies in the relationships between sequence structure function and disease all of which play out on the stage of evolution and data science enables us to elucidate these relationships at scale. Here we consider the above question from the five key pillars of data science: acquisition engineering analytics visualization and policy with an emphasis on machine learning as the premier analytics approach. Structural biology meets data science: does anything change?
