Introduction: Third-generation antiepileptic drugs have seemingly failed to improve the global figures of seizure control and can still be regarded as symptomatic treatments. Quantitative structure-activity relationships QSAR can be used to guide hit-to-lead and lead optimization projects and applied to the large-scale virtual screening of chemical libraries. Areas covered: In this review the authors cover reports on QSAR models related to antiepileptic drugs and drug targets in epilepsy analyzing whether they refer to classic or non-classic QSAR and if they apply QSAR as a descriptive or predictive approach among other considerations. The article finally focuses on a more detailed discussion of those predictive studies which include some sort of experimental validation i.e. papers in which the reported models have been used to identify novel active compounds which have been tested in vitro and/or in vivo. Expert opinion: There are significant opportunities to apply the QSAR methodology to assist the discovery of more efficacious antiepileptic drugs. Considering the intrinsic complexity of the disorder such applications should focus on state-of-the-art approximations e.g. systemic multi-target and multi-scale QSAR as well as ensemble and deep learning and modeling the effects on novel drug targets and modern screening tools.
