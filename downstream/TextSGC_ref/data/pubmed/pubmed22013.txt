We studied the dynamics of motor function recovery in a patient with severe brain damage in the course of neurorehabilitation using hand exoskeleton controlled by brain-computer interface. For estimating the motor function of paretic arm we used the biomechanical analysis of movements registered during the course of rehabilitation. After 15 weekly sessions of hand exoskeleton control the following results were obtained: a the velocity profile of goal-directed movements of paretic hand became bell-shaped b the patient began to extend and abduct the hand which was flexed and adducted in the beginning of rehabilitation and c the patient began to supinate the forearm which was pronated in the beginning of rehabilitation. The first result is an evidence of the general improvement of the quality of motor control while the second and third results prove that the spasticity of paretic arm has decreased.
