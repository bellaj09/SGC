Although Virtual Reality VR applications have been shown to reduce many forms of acute pain such research of VR applications and their effects on chronic pain is still at its infancy. In this study we designed a VR game Cryoslide and examined its analgesic effect on chronic pain patients its end users in a clinical setting. In this randomized controlled crossover clinical study of 20 chronic pain patients Cryoslide significantly reduced perceived pain compared to the baseline and the control group. The results demonstrate that Cryoslide can be effectively used as an analgesic intervention for chronic pain management to lessen pain intensity during short-term symptom spikes.
