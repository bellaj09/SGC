With an ever increasing need for assessment of neurophysiological activity in connection with injury and basic research the demand for an efficient and reliable data acquisition system rises. Brain-machine interfaces is one class of such systems that targets the central nervous system. A necessary step in the development of a brain-machine interface is to design and implement a reliable and efficient measurement system for neurophysiological signals. The use of telemetric devices increases the flexibility of the devices in terms of subject mobility and unobtrusiveness of the equipment. In this paper we present a complete system architecture for a wearable telemetry system for the acquisition of neurophysiological data. The system has been miniaturized and implemented using surface-mount technology. System performance has been successfully verified and bottlenecks in the architecture have been identified. Implementation of a telemetry system for neurophysiological signals.
