An important task of macromolecular structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-EM is the identification of single particles in micrographs particle picking. Due to the necessity of human involvement in the process current particle picking techniques are time consuming and often result in many false positives and negatives. Adjusting the parameters to eliminate false positives often excludes true particles in certain orientations. The supervised machine learning e.g. deep learning methods for particle picking often need a large training dataset which requires extensive manual annotation. Other reference-dependent methods rely on low-resolution templates for particle detection matching and picking and therefore are not fully automated. These issues motivate us to develop a fully automated unbiased framework for particle picking.
