From the theory of compensatory Internet use escapism through videogames may constitute a coping strategy that is sometimes helpful but in some cases maladaptive. To date however evidence supporting this view has been gathered only through the use of explicit self-reported questionnaires which are known to be biased. Accordingly the aim of the current study was to test whether the escapism motive is related to a preference for the virtual environment. Escaping reality through videogames is linked to an implicit preference for virtual over real-life stimuli.
