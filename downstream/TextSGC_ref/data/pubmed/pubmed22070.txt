"With the fast development of the fifth-generation cellular network technology 5G the future sensors and microelectromechanical systems MEMS/nanoelectromechanical systems NEMS are presenting a more and more critical role to provide information in our daily life. This review paper introduces the development trends and perspectives of the future sensors and MEMS/NEMS. Starting from the issues of the MEMS fabrication we introduced typical MEMS sensors for their applications in the Internet of Things IoTs such as MEMS physical sensor MEMS acoustic sensor and MEMS gas sensor. Toward the trends in intelligence and less power consumption MEMS components including MEMS/NEMS switch piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer PMUT and MEMS energy harvesting were investigated to assist the future sensors such as event-based or almost zero-power. Furthermore MEMS rigid substrate toward NEMS flexible-based for flexibility and interface was discussed as another important development trend for next-generation wearable or multi-functional sensors. Around the issues about the big data and human-machine realization for human beings manipulation artificial intelligence AI and virtual reality VR technologies were finally realized using sensor nodes and its wave identification as future trends for various scenarios."
