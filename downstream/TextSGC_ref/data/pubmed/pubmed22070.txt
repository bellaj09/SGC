One of the key problems of brain-computer interfacesBCIis low signal-to-noise ratioSNRof electroencephalogramEEGsignals.It affects recognition performance.To remove the artifact and noiseblock under-determined blind source separation method based on the small number of channels is proposed in this paper.The nonstationary EEG signals are turned into block stationary signals by piecewise.The mixing matrix is estimated by the second-order under-determined blind mixing matrix identification.Thenthe beamformer based on minimum mean square error separates the original sources of signals.Eventuallythe reconstructed EEG for mixed signals removes the unwanted components of source signals to achieve suppressing artifact.The experiment results on the real motor imagery BCI indicated that the block under-determined blind source separation method could reconstruct signals and remove artifact effectively.The accuracy of motor imagery task of BCI has been greatly improved.
