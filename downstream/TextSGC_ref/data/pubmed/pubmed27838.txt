"To be correctly mastered brain-computer interfaces BCIs need an uninterrupted flow of feedback to the user. This feedback is usually delivered through the visual channel. Our aim was to explore the benefits of vibrotactile feedback during users training and control of EEG-based BCI applications. A protocol for delivering vibrotactile feedback including specific hardware and software arrangements was specified. In three studies with 33 subjects including 3 with spinal cord injury we compared vibrotactile and visual feedback addressing: I the feasibility of subjects training to master their EEG rhythms using tactile feedback; II the compatibility of this form of feedback in presence of a visual distracter; III the performance in presence of a complex visual task on the same visual or different tactile sensory channel. The stimulation protocol we developed supports a general usage of the tactors; preliminary experimentations. All studies indicated that the vibrotactile channel can function as a valuable feedback modality with reliability comparable to the classical visual feedback. Advantages of using a vibrotactile feedback emerged when the visual channel was highly loaded by a complex task. In all experiments vibrotactile feedback felt after some training more natural for both controls and SCI users." Vibrotactile feedback for brain-computer interface operation.
