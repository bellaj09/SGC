"The aim of this study was to investigate if teaching patients about positioning before radiotherapy treatment would a reduce the residual rotational set-up errors b reduce the number of repositionings and c improve patients sense of control by increasing self-efficacy and reducing distress. Patients were randomized to either standard care control group or standard care and a teaching session combining visual aids and practical exercises intervention group. Daily images from the treatment sessions were evaluated off-line. Both groups filled in a questionnaire before and at the end of the treatment course on various aspects of cooperation with the staff regarding positioning. Comparisons of residual rotational set-up errors showed an improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. No significant differences were found in number of repositionings self-efficacy or distress. Results show that it is possible to teach patients about positioning and thereby improve precision in positioning. Teaching patients about positioning did not seem to affect self-efficacy or distress scores at baseline and at the end of the treatment course."
