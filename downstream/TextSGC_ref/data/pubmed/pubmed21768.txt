The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of an augmented reality AR visualization prototype for virtual computed tomography CT-guided interventional procedures in a multimodality abdominal phantom. With the aid of AR guidance three radiologists performed 30 attempts at targeting simulated liver lesions of different sizes range 5-15 mm with a biopsy needle. The position of the needle tip relative to the lesion was verified by using ultrasonography and CT. With AR guidance lesions were successfully targeted with the first needle pass in all cases. On the basis of these results AR visualization for CT-guided intervention appears feasible and allows intuitive and accurate lesion targeting in a phantom. Augmented reality visualization for CT-guided interventions: system description feasibility and initial evaluation in an abdominal phantom.
