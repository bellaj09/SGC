"Common spatial pattern CSP is a very popular method for spatial filtering to extract the features from electroencephalogram EEG signals but it may cause serious over-fitting issue. In this paper after the extraction and recognition of feature we present a new way in which the recognition results are fused to overcome the over-fitting and improve recognition accuracy. And then a new framework for EEG recognition is proposed by using CSP to extract features from EEG signals using linear discriminant analysis LDA classifiers to identify the users mental state from such features and using Choquet fuzzy integral to fuse classifiers results. Brain-computer interface BCI competition 2005 data sets IVa was used to validate the framework. The results demonstrated that it effective ly improved recognition and to some extent overcome the over-fitting problem of CSP. It showed the effectiveness of this framework for dealing with EEG."
