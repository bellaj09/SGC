"Significant resources are now being devoted to large-scale international studies attempting to map the connectome - the brains wiring diagram. This review will focus on the use of human neuroimaging approaches to map the connectome at a macroscopic level. This emerging field of human connectomics brings both opportunities and challenges. Opportunities arise from the ability to apply a powerful toolkit of mathematical and computational approaches to interrogate these rich datasets many of which are being freely shared with the scientific community. Challenges arise in methodology interpretability and biological or clinical validity. This review discusses these challenges and opportunities and highlights potential future directions." Human connectomics - what will the future demand?
