Antireflective surfaces with their great potential applications have attracted tremendous attention and have been the subject of extensive research in recent years. However due to the significant optical impedance mismatch between a metal surface and free space it is still a challenging issue to realize ultralow reflectance on a metal surface. To address this issue we propose a two-step strategy for constructing antireflective structures on a Ti-6Al-4V TC4 surface using nanosecond and femtosecond pulsed lasers in combination. By controlling the parameters of the nanosecond laser microgrooves are first scratched on the TC4 surface to reduce the interface reflection. Then the femtosecond laser is focused onto the sample surface with orthogonal scanning to induce deep air holes and nanoscale structures which effectively enhances the broadband absorption. The antireflection mechanism of the dual-scale structures is discussed regarding morphological characterization and hemispherical reflectance measurements. Finally the modified sample surface covered with micro-nano hybrid structures is characterized by an average reflectance of 3.1% over the wavelengths ranging from 250 nm to 2250 nm.
