The diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of carcinoembryonic antigen CEA cytology and artificial intelligence AI by deep learning using cyst fluid in differentiating malignant from benign cystic lesions. We retrospectively reviewed 85 patients who underwent pancreatic cyst fluid analysis of surgical specimens or endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration specimens. AI using deep learning was used to construct a diagnostic algorithm. CEA carbohydrate antigen 19-9 carbohydrate antigen 125 amylase in the cyst fluid sex cyst location connection of the pancreatic duct and cyst type of cyst and cytology were keyed into the AI algorithm and the malignant predictive value of the output was calculated. Area under receiver-operating characteristics curves for the diagnostic ability of malignant cystic lesions were 0.719 CEA 0.739 cytology and 0.966 AI. In the diagnostic ability of malignant cystic lesions sensitivity specificity and accuracy of AI were 95.7% 91.9% and 92.9% respectively. AI sensitivity was higher than that of CEA 60.9% p\u2009=\u20090.021 and cytology 47.8% p\u2009=\u20090.001. AI accuracy was also higher than CEA 71.8% p\u2009<\u20090.001 and cytology 85.9% p\u2009=\u20090.210. AI may improve the diagnostic ability in differentiating malignant from benign pancreatic cystic lesions.
