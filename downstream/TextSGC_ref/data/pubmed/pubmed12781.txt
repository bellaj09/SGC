Clinical treatment planning systems for proton therapy currently do not calculate monitor units MUs in passive scatter proton therapy due to the complexity of the beam delivery systems. Physical phantom measurements are commonly employed to determine the field-specific output factors OFs but are often subject to limited machine time measurement uncertainties and intensive labor. In this study a machine learning-based approach was developed to predict output cGy/MU and derive MUs incorporating the dependencies on gantry angle and field size for a single-room proton therapy system. The goal of this study was to develop a secondary check tool for OF measurements and eventually eliminate patient-specific OF measurements. A machine learning approach to the accurate prediction of monitor units for a compact proton machine.
