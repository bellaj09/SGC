Acquired Brain Injury whether resulting from Traumatic brain injury TBI or Cerebral Vascular Accident CVA represent major health concerns for the Department of Defense and the nation. TBI has been referred to as the "signature" injury of recent U.S. military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan - affecting approximately 380000 service members from 2000 to 2017; whereas CVA has been estimated to effect 795000 individuals each year in the United States. TBI and CVA often present with similar motor cognitive and emotional deficits; therefore the treatment interventions for both often overlap. The Defense Health Agency and Veterans Health Administration would benefit from enhanced rehabilitation solutions to treat deficits resulting from acquired brain injuries ABI including both TBI and CVA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a novel integrative and intensive virtual rehabilitation system for treating symptoms of ABI in an outpatient clinic. The secondary aim was to evaluate the system\s clinical effectiveness. A Randomized Feasibility Trial of a Novel Integrative and Intensive Virtual Rehabilitation Program for Service Members Post-Acquired Brain Injury.
