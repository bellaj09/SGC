In 1998 we proposed deep brain stimulation as a last-resort treatment option for patients suffering from severe treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. Here 24 OCD patients were included in a long-term follow-up study to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation in the anterior limbs of the internal capsule ALIC and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BST. We find that electrical stimulation in the ALIC/BST area is safe and significantly decreases obsessions compulsions and associated anxiety and depressive symptoms and improves global functioning in a blinded crossover trial n=17 after 4 years n=18 and at last follow-up up to 171 months n=24. Moreover our data indicate that BST may be a better stimulation target compared with ALIC to alleviate OCD symptoms. We conclude that electrical stimulation in BST is a promising therapeutic option for otherwise treatment-resistant OCD patients. Electrical stimulation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis alleviates severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.
