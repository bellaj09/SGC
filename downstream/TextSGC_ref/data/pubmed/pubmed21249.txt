"Virtual reality can be used to provide phobic clients with therapeutic exposure to phobogenic stimuli. However purpose-built therapeutic VR hardware and software can be expensive and difficult to adapt to individual client needs. In this study inexpensive and readily adaptable PC computer games were used to provide exposure therapy to 13 phobic participants and 13 non-phobic control participants. It was found that anxiety could be induced in phobic participants by exposing them to phobogenic stimuli in therapeutic virtual environments derived from computer games TVEDG. Assessments were made of the impact of simulator sickness and of sense of presence on the phobogenic effectiveness of TVEDGs. Participants reported low levels of simulator sickness and the results indicate that simulator sickness had no significant impact on either anxiety or sense of presence. Group differences correlations and regression analyses indicate a synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety. These results do not support Slaters contention that presence and emotion are orthogonal."
