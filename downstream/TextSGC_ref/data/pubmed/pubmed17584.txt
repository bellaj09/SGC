This paper explores the application of evaluation of high fidelity human patient mannequin simulation emerging in nursing education. The ramifications for use in mental health nursing are examined. A question is posed: Is high fidelity human patient mannequin simulation limited to being a "simulation of learning"? Explicit research that traces learning outcomes from mannequin to clinical practice and hence consumer outcomes is absent in mental health. Piecing together research from psychology addressing cognitive load theory and considering the capacity for learners to imitate desired behaviour without experiencing deep learning the possibility is real that simulation of learning is the outcome of high fidelity human patient mannequin simulation applications to mental health nursing. Is high fidelity human patient mannequin simulation simulation of learning?
