"In this three-year study test scores for students taught veterinary obstetrics in a classroom setting with either traditional media photographs text and two-dimensional graphical presentations were compared with those for students taught by incorporating three-dimensional 3D media linear animations and interactive QuickTime Virtual Reality models into the classroom lectures. Incorporation of the 3D animations and interactive models significantly increased students scores on essay questions designed to assess their comprehension of the subject matter. This approach to education may help to better prepare students for dealing with obstetrical cases during their final clinical year and after graduation."
