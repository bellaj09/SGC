Many patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury have deficits in social cognition. Social cognition refers to the ability to perceive interpret and act upon social information. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of treatment for impairments of social cognition in patients with traumatic brain injury. Moreover these studies have targeted only a single aspect of the problem. They all reported improvements but evidence for transfer of learned skills to daily life was scarce. We evaluated a multifaceted treatment protocol for poor social cognition and emotion regulation impairments called T-ScEmo in patients with traumatic brain injury and found evidence for transfer to participation and quality of life. Social cognition and emotion regulation: a multifaceted treatment T-ScEmo for patients with traumatic brain injury.
