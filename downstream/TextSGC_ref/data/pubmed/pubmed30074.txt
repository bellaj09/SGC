Compensating for the effect of gravity by providing arm-weight support WS is a technique often utilized in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological conditions such as stroke to facilitate the performance of arm movements during therapy. Although it has been shown that in healthy subjects as well as in stroke survivors the use of arm WS during the performance of reaching movements leads to a general reduction as expected in the level of activation of upper limb muscles the effects of different levels of WS on the characteristics of the kinematics of motion and of the activity of upper limb muscles have not been thoroughly investigated before. The effect of arm weight support on upper limb muscle synergies during reaching movements.
