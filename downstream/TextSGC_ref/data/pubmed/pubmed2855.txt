Recent advances in functional connectivity suggest that shared neuronal activation patterns define brain networks linking anatomically separate brain regions. We sought to investigate how cortical stroke disrupts multiple brain regions in processing spatial information. We conducted a connectome investigation at the mesoscale-level using the neuroVIISAS-framework enabling the analysis of directed and weighted connectivity in bilateral hemispheres of cortical and subcortical brain regions. We found that spatial-exploration induced brain activation mapped by Fos a proxy of neuronal activity was differentially affected by stroke in a region-specific manner. The extent of hypoactivation following spatial exploration is inversely correlated with the spatial distance between the region of interest and region damaged by stroke in particular within the parietal association and the primary somatosensory cortex suggesting that the closer a region is to a stroke lesion the more it would be affected during functional activation. Connectome modelling with 43 network parameters failed to reliably predict regions of hypoactivation in stroke rats exploring a novel environment despite a modest correlation found for the centrality and hubness parameters in the home-caged animals. Further investigation in the inhibitory versus excitatory neuronal networks and microcircuit connectivity is warranted to improve the accuracy of predictability in post-stroke functional impairment.
