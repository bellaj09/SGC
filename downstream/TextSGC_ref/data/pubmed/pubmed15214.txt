Learning interpretable data representation has been an active research topic in deep learning and computer vision. While representation disentanglement is an effective technique for addressing this task existing works cannot easily handle the problems in which manipulating and recognizing data across multiple domains are desirable. In this paper we present a unified network architecture of Multi-domain and Multi-modal Representation Disentangler M2RD with the goal of learning domain-invariant content representation with the associated domain-specific representation observed. By advancing adversarial learning and disentanglement techniques the proposed model is able to perform continuous image manipulation across data domains with multiple modalities. More importantly the resulting domain-invariant feature representation can be applied for unsupervised domain adaptation. Finally our quantitative and qualitative results would confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods on the above tasks.
