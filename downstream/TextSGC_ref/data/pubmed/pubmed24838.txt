A brain-computer interface BCI can help to overcome movement deficits in persons with spinal-cord injury. Ideally such a BCI detects detailed movement imaginations i.e. trajectories and transforms them into a control signal for a neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm restoring movement. Robotic arms have already been controlled successfully by means of invasive recording techniques and executed movements have been reconstructed using noninvasive decoding techniques. However it is unclear if detailed imagined movements can be decoded noninvasively using electroencephalography EEG. We made progress toward imagined movement decoding and successfully classified horizontal and vertical imagined rhythmic movements of the right arm in healthy subjects using EEG. Notably we used an experimental design which avoided muscle and eye movements to prevent classification results being affected. To classify imagined movements of the same limb we decoded the movement trajectories and correlated them with assumed movement trajectories horizontal and vertical. We then assigned the decoded movements to the assumed movements with the higher correlation. To train the decoder we applied partial least squares which allowed us to interpret the classifier weights although channels were highly correlated. To conclude we showed the classification of imagined movements of one limb in two different movement planes in seven out of nine subjects. Furthermore we found a strong involvement of the supplementary motor area. Finally as our classifier was based on the decoding approach we indirectly showed the decoding of imagined movements. Using a noninvasive decoding method to classify rhythmic movement imaginations of the arm in two planes.
