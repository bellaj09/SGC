Neuropsychological patients often suffer from impairments in visual selective attention and processing capacity components. Their assessment demands a high standardization of testing conditions which is difficult to achieve across institutions. Head-mounted displays HMDs provide a solution. These virtual reality devices cover the entire visual field in a shielded way and thus keep visual stimulation constant. For neuropsychological assessment with HMDs sufficient reliability is required. We have previously demonstrated that an early developer version of an HMD can be used to reliably measure components of visual processing capacity. However it is unclear whether this also holds for the assessment of components of visual selective attention. Moreover it has yet to be established whether now commercially available HMDs are capable of reliable neuropsychological assessment.
