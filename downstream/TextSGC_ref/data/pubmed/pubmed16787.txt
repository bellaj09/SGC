Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Its early diagnosis is extremely important to prevent avoidable deaths. However malignancy assessment of tissue biopsies is complex and dependent on observer subjectivity. Moreover hematoxylin and eosin H&E-stained histological images exhibit a highly variable appearance even within the same malignancy level. In this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis CAD tool for automated malignancy assessment of breast tissue samples based on the processing of histological images. We provide four malignancy levels as the output of the system: normal benign in situ and invasive. The method is based on the calculation of three sets of features related to nuclei colour regions and textures considering local characteristics and global image properties. By taking advantage of well-established image processing techniques we build a feature vector for each image that serves as an input to an SVM Support Vector Machine classifier with a quadratic kernel. The method has been rigorously evaluated first with a 5-fold cross-validation within an initial set of 120 images second with an external set of 30 different images and third with images with artefacts included. Accuracy levels range from 75.8% when the 5-fold cross-validation was performed to 75% with the external set of new images and 61.11% when the extremely difficult images were added to the classification experiment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable of distinguishing between four malignancy levels with high accuracy. Our results are close to those obtained with recent deep learning-based methods. Moreover it performs better than other state-of-the-art methods based on feature extraction and it can help improve the CAD of breast cancer. Automatic classification of tissue malignancy for breast carcinoma diagnosis.
