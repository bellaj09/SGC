Roads are vital components of infrastructure the extraction of which has become a topic of significant interest in the field of remote sensing. Because deep learning has been a popular method in image processing and information extraction researchers have paid more attention to extracting road using neural networks. This article proposes the improvement of neural networks to extract roads from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV remote sensing images. D-Linknet was first considered for its high performance; however the huge scale of the net reduced computational efficiency. With a focus on the low computational efficiency problem of the popular D-LinkNet this article made some improvements: 1 Replace the initial block with a stem block. 2 Rebuild the entire network based on ResNet units with a new structure allowing for the construction of an improved neural network D-Linknetplus. 3 Add a 1  1 convolution layer before DBlock to reduce the input feature maps reducing parameters and improving computational efficiency. Add another 1  1 convolution layer after DBlock to recover the required number of output channels. Accordingly another improved neural network B-D-LinknetPlus was built. Comparisons were performed between the neural nets and the verification were made with the Massachusetts Roads Dataset. The results show improved neural networks are helpful in reducing the network size and developing the precision needed for road extraction.
