Although extensive studies have shown improvement in spelling accuracy the conventional P300 speller often exhibits errors which occur in almost the same row or column relative to the target. To address this issue we propose a novel hybrid brain-computer interface BCI approach by incorporating the steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP into the conventional P300 paradigm. A novel hybrid BCI speller based on the incorporation of SSVEP into the P300 paradigm.
