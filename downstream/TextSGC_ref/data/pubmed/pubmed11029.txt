Robotic manipulators have to constantly deal with the complex task of detecting whether a grasp is stable or in contrast whether the grasped object is slipping. Recognising the type of slippage-translational rotational-and its direction is more challenging than detecting only stability but is simultaneously of greater use as regards correcting the aforementioned grasping issues. In this work we propose a learning methodology for detecting the direction of a slip seven categories using spatio-temporal tactile features learnt from one tactile sensor. Tactile readings are therefore pre-processed and fed to a ConvLSTM that learns to detect these directions with just 50 ms of data. We have extensively evaluated the performance of the system and have achieved relatively high results at the detection of the direction of slip on unseen objects with familiar properties 82.56% accuracy.
