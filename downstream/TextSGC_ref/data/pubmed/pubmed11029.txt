Artificial intelligence AI specifically deep learning offers the potential to enhance the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy in areas ranging from lesion detection and classification to quality metrics and documentation. Progress in this field will be measured by whether AI implementation can lead to improved patient outcomes and more-efficient clinical workflow for GI endoscopists. The aims of this article are to report the findings of a multidisciplinary group of experts focusing on issues in artificial intelligence research and applications related to gastroenterology and endoscopy to review the current status of the field and to produce recommendations for investigators developing and studying new AI technologies for gastroenterology.
