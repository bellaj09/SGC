"Independent component analysis ICA is widely used in resting state functional connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method which uses no a priori anatomical or functional assumptions. However as a result it still relies on the user to distinguish the independent components ICs corresponding to neuronal activation peripherally originating signals without directly attributable neuronal origin such as respiration cardiac pulsation and Mayer wave and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy NIRS/functional MRI fMRI resting state study we developed a method to systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA MELODIC from FSL to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low frequency oscillation LFO detected simultaneously at each participants fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described sensorimotor visual and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals. The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic low frequency oscillations in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns identified in ICA analyses which complicates the detection and interpretation of connectivity in these regions of the brain."
