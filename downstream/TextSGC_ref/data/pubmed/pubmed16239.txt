"We conducted this prospective cohort study to standardize our laparoscopic technique of excision of posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis DIE nodules according to their size location and geometry including 36 patients who were grouped according to principal pelvic expansion of the nodule into groups with central group 1 and lateral group 2 lesions and according to nodule size into 2\u2009cm group A and >2\u2009cm group B lesions respectively. In cases of group 1 the following operative steps were more frequently performed compared to those of group 2: suspension of the rectosigmoid colpectomy and placement of bowel wall reinforcement sutures. The opposite was true regarding suspension of the adnexa systematic ureteric dissection and removal of the diseased pelvic peritoneum. When grouping patients according to nodule size almost all of the examined parameters were more frequently applied to patients of group B: adnexal suspension suspension of the rectosigmoid systematic ureteric dissection division of uterine vein colpectomy and placement of bowel wall reinforcement sutures. Nodule size was the single most important determinant of duration of surgery. In conclusion during the building-up of ones learning curve of laparoscopic excision of posterior DIE nodules technique standardization is very important to avoid complications."
