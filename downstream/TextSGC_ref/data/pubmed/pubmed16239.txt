Converging lines of evidence from rabbits rats and humans argue for the crucial involvement of the cerebellum in classical conditioning of the eyeblink/nictitating membrane response in mammals. For example selective lesions permanent or reversible of the cerebellum block both acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning. Correspondingly electrophysiological and brain-imaging studies indicate learning-related plasticity in the cerebellum. The involvement of the cerebellum in eyeblink conditioning is also supported by stimulation studies showing that direct stimulation of the two major afferents to the cerebellum the mossy fibers emanating from the pontine nucleus and climbing fibers originating from the inferior olive can substitute for the peripheral conditioned stimulus CS and unconditioned stimulus US respectively to yield normal behavioral learning. In the present study we examined the relative contribution of the cerebellar cortex versus deep nuclei specifically the interpositus nucleus in eyeblink learning by using mutant mice deficient of Purkinje cells the exclusive output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. We report that Purkinje cell degeneration pcd mice exhibit a profound impairment in the acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning in comparison with their wild-type littermates. Nevertheless the pcd animals did acquire a subnormal level of conditioned eyeblink responses. In contrast wild-type mice with lesions of the interpositus nucleus were completely unable to learn the conditioned eyeblink response. These results suggest that both cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei are important for normal eyeblink conditioning.
