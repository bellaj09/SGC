"Spiking neural networks SNNs offer a bio-plausible and potentially power-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning. Although there has been progress towards implementing SNN functionalities in custom CMOS-based hardware using beyond Von Neumann architectures the power-efficiency of the human brain has remained elusive. This has necessitated investigations of novel material systems which can efficiently mimic the functional units of SNNs such as neurons and synapses. In this paper we present a magnetoelectric-magnetic tunnel junction ME-MTJ device as a synapse. We arrange these synapses in a crossbar fashion and perform in situ unsupervised learning. We leverage the capacitive nature of write-ports in ME-MTJs wherein by applying appropriately shaped voltage pulses across the write-port the ME-MTJ can be switched in a probabilistic manner. We further exploit the sigmoidal switching characteristics of ME-MTJ to tune the synapses to follow the well-known spike timing-dependent plasticity STDP rule in a stochastic fashion. Finally we use the stochastic STDP rule in ME-MTJ synapses to simulate a two-layered SNN to perform image classification tasks on a handwritten digit dataset. Thus the capacitive write-port and the decoupled-nature of read-write path of ME-MTJs allow us to construct a transistor-less crossbar suitable for energy-efficient implementation of in situ learning in SNNs.
