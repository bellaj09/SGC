"Electroencephalography EEG analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience neural engineering e.g. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: 1 Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? 2 What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? 3 Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks?"
