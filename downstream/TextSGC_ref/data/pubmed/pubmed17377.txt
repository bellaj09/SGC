"Electrovestibulography EVestG a technology purported to measure vestibular activity at the vestibular periphery was used to compare the vestibular responses to two sensory inputs: 1 back-forward physical tilt with eyes-open and eyes-closed and 2 virtual reality replica of the back-forward tilt eyes-open physically static. Twenty-seven healthy participants 10 females were tested. From each of the EVestG recordings two feature curves: 1 average field potential FP and 2 distribution of time intervals between the detected FPs were extracted. For the eyes-closed physical tilt except for the background segment the FP response curve was generally wider compared to that evoked during the virtual replica tilt p\u2009<\u20090.05. Moreover the eyes-closed physical tilt produced longer time intervals between FPs compared to the virtual stimulus. For this measure for the background segment the eyes closed and open physical tilt responses were significantly different p\u2009<\u20090.05 in both ears repeated measure experimental design. The results support: 1 both vestibular and visual inputs evoking a measurably different EVestG response 2 the differences between physical and virtual vestibular responses are dependent on the eyes being either open or closed and 3 for the stimuli used the modulation of vestibular afferent activity was measurably smaller for virtual than physical stimulation." Differences Between Physical vs. Virtual Evoked Vestibular Responses.
