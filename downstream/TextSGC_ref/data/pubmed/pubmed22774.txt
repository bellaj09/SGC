Visual fixation is an item in the visual function subscale of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised CRS-R. Sometimes clinicians using the behavioral scales find it difficult to detect because of the motor impairment in patients with disorders of consciousness DOCs. Brain-computer interface BCI can be used to improve clinical assessment because it directly detects the brain response to an external stimulus in the absence of behavioral expression. In this study we designed a BCI system to assist the visual fixation assessment of DOC patients. The results from 15 patients indicated that three showed visual fixation in both CRS-R and BCI assessments and one did not show such behavior in the CRS-R assessment but achieved significant online accuracy in the BCI assessment. The results revealed that electroencephalography-based BCI can detect the brain response for visual fixation. Therefore the proposed BCI may provide a promising method for assisting behavioral assessment using the CRS-R.
