"Children with autism spectrum disorder ASD demonstrate potent impairments in social communication skills including atypical viewing patterns during social interactions. Recently several assistive technologies particularly virtual reality VR have been investigated to address specific social deficits in this population. Some studies have coupled eye-gaze monitoring mechanisms to design intervention strategies. However presently available systems are designed to primarily chain learning via aspects of ones performance only which affords restricted range of individualization. The presented work seeks to bridge this gap by developing a novel VR-based interactive system with Gaze-sensitive adaptive response technology that can seamlessly integrate VR-based tasks with eye-tracking techniques to intelligently facilitate engagement in tasks relevant to advancing social communication skills. Specifically such a system is capable of objectively identifying and quantifying ones engagement level by measuring real-time viewing patterns subtle changes in eye physiological responses as well as performance metrics in order to adaptively respond in an individualized manner to foster improved social communication skills among the participants. The developed system was tested through a usability study with eight adolescents with ASD. The results indicate the potential of the system to promote improved social task performance along with socially-appropriate mechanisms during VR-based social conversation tasks."
