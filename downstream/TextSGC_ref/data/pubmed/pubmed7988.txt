The conventional subspace clustering method obtains explicit data representation that captures the global structure of data and clusters via the associated subspace. However due to the limitation of intrinsic linearity and fixed structure the advantages of prior structure are limited. To address this problem in this brief we embed the structured graph learning with adaptive neighbors into the deep autoencoder networks such that an adaptive deep clustering approach namely autoencoder constrained clustering with adaptive neighbors ACC_AN is developed. The proposed method not only can adaptively investigate the nonlinear structure of data via a parameter-free graph built upon deep features but also can iteratively strengthen the correlations among the deep representations in the learning process. In addition the local structure of raw data is preserved by minimizing the reconstruction error. Compared to the state-of-the-art works ACC_AN is the first deep clustering method embedded with the adaptive structured graph learning to update the latent representation of data and structured deep graph simultaneously.
