Synchronization and distributed functional networks have been used with success in different areas of engineering. In this paper we use the synchronization information from electroencephalogram EEG channels through the Phase Locking Value PLV as a potential classification method for a Brain Computer Interface BCI; this achieved using emotional schematic faces as stimuli in a motor imagery MI task. Based on the variations of the PLV values for each proposed task and for each participant the principal channel pairs are identified. Selected channel pairs corresponding with the accomplished task present PLV patterns similarly to Evoked Potentials ERS/ERD which are widely used as classification features for MI based BCI. Classification in emotional BCI using phase information from the EEG.
