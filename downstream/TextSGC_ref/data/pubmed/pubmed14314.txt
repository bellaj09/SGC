We assess the ability of our convolutional neural network CNN-based scoring functions to perform several common tasks in the domain of drug discovery. These include correctly identifying ligand poses near and far from the true binding mode when given a set of reference receptors and classifying ligands as active or inactive using structural information. We use the CNN to re-score or refine poses generated using a conventional scoring function Autodock Vina and compare the performance of each of these methods to using the conventional scoring function alone. Furthermore we assess several ways of choosing appropriate reference receptors in the context of the D3R 2017 community benchmarking challenge. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms Vina on most tasks without requiring manual inspection by a knowledgeable operator but that the pose prediction target chosen for the challenge Cathepsin S was particularly challenging for de novo docking. However the CNN provided best-in-class performance on several virtual screening tasks underscoring the relevance of deep learning to the field of drug discovery.
