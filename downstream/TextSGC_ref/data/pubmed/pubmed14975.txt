Seven subjects who were neurologically impaired following encephalitis n = 2 head injury n = 3 and stroke n = 2 were referred several years previously because of acquired dyslexia. Two were almost totally alexic 2 were surface dyslexic 2 were deep dyslexic and 1 was a letter-by-letter reader. Following a period of rehabilitation the 2 with alexia became surface dyslexic and letter-by-letter readers; 1 of the deep dyslexics showed some improvements but remained a deep dyslexic; and the letter-by-letter reader learned to read more quickly. At follow-up 6 to 10 years later there had been little significant change. The 2 subjects whose alexia resolved into surface dyslexia with letter-by-letter reading had increased their reading ages but remained surface dyslexic and letter-by-letter readers. The subject who had been a letter-by-letter reader was faster at easier and more frequently used words but slower at harder less frequently used words. Changes in the other 4 subjects were negligible. Implications for rehabilitation are discussed. Syndromes of acquired dyslexia and patterns of recovery: a 6- to 10-year follow-up study of seven brain-injured people.
