For brain-computer interfaces BCIs that utilize visual cues to direct the user the neural signals extracted by the computer are representative of ongoing processes visual evoked responses and voluntary modulation. We proposed to use three brain signatures for predicting success on a single trial of a BCI task. The first two features the amplitude and phase of the pre-trial mu amplitude were chosen as a correlate for cortical excitability. The remaining feature related to the visually evoked response to the cue served as a possible measure of fixation and attention to the task. Of these three features mu rhythm amplitude over the central electrodes at the time of cue presentation and to a lesser extent the single trial visual evoked response were correlated with the success on the subsequent imagery task. Despite the potential for gating trials using these features an offline gating simulation was limited in its ability to produce an increase in device throughput. This discrepancy highlights a distinction between the identification of predictive features and the use of this knowledge in an online BCI. Using such a system we cannot assume that the user will respond similarly when faced with a scenario where feedback is altered by trials that are gated on a regular basis. The results of this study suggest the possibility of using individualized pre-task neural signatures for personalized and asynchronous self-paced BCI applications although these effects need to be quantified in a real-time adaptive scenario in a future study.
