Explainable artificial intelligence AI is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning applications became increasingly successful but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods particularly deep learning DL. We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction. Causability and explainability of artificial intelligence in medicine.
