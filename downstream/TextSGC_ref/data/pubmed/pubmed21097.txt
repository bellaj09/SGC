Many Brain Computer Interface BCI and neurofeedback studies have investigated the impact of sensorimotor rhythm SMR self-regulation training procedures on motor skills enhancement in healthy subjects and patients with motor disabilities. This critical review aims first to introduce the different definitions of SMR EEG target in BCI/Neurofeedback studies and to summarize the background from neurophysiological and neuroplasticity studies that led to SMR being considered as reliable and valid EEG targets to improve motor skills through BCI/neurofeedback procedures. The second objective of this review is to introduce the main findings regarding SMR BCI/neurofeedback in healthy subjects. Third the main findings regarding BCI/neurofeedback efficiency in patients with hypokinetic activities in particular motor deficit following stroke as well as in patients with hyperkinetic activities in particular Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD will be introduced. Due to a range of limitations a clear association between SMR BCI/neurofeedback training and enhanced motor skills has yet to be established. However SMR BCI/neurofeedback appears promising and highlights many important challenges for clinical neurophysiology with regards to therapeutic approaches using BCI/neurofeedback. Using EEG-based brain computer interface and neurofeedback targeting sensorimotor rhythms to improve motor skills: Theoretical background applications and prospects.
