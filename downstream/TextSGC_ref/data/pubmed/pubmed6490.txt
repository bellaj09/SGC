We aimed to establish a high-performing and robust classification strategy using magnetic resonance imaging MRI along with combinations of feature extraction and selection in human and machine learning using radiomics or deep features by employing a small dataset. Using diffusion and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images obtained from patients with glioblastomas and primary central nervous system lymphomas classification task was assigned to a combination of radiomic features and 1 supervised machine learning after feature selection or 2 multilayer perceptron MLP network; or MR image input without radiomic feature extraction to 3 two neuro-radiologists or 4 an end-to-end convolutional neural network CNN. The results showed similar high performance in generalized linear model GLM classifier and MLP using radiomics features in the internal validation set but MLP network remained robust in the external validation set obtained using different MRI protocols. CNN showed the lowest performance in both validation sets. Our results reveal that a combination of radiomic features and MLP network classifier serves a high-performing and generalizable model for classification task for a small dataset with heterogeneous MRI protocols.
