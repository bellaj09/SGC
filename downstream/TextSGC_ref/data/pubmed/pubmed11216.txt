Videocapsule endoscopy VCE is a relatively new technique for evaluating the presence of villous atrophy in celiac disease patients. The diagnostic analysis of video frames is currently time-consuming and tedious. Recently computer-aided diagnosis CAD systems have become an attractive research area for diagnosing celiac disease. However the images captured from VCE are susceptible to alterations in light illumination rotation direction and intestinal secretions. Moreover textural features of the mucosal villi obtained by VCE are difficult to characterize and extract. This work aims to find a novel deep learning feature learning module to assist in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Celiac disease diagnosis from videocapsule endoscopy images with residual learning and deep feature extraction.
