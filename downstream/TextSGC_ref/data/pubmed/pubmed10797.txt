"Beautiful outdoor locations are protected by governments and have recently been shown to be associated with better health. But what makes an outdoor space beautiful? Does a beautiful outdoor location differ from an outdoor location that is simply natural? Here we explore whether ratings of over 200\u2009000 images of Great Britain from the online game Scenic-Or-Not combined with hundreds of image features extracted using the Places Convolutional Neural Network might help us understand what beautiful outdoor spaces are composed of. We discover that as well as natural features such as Coast Mountain and Canal Natural man-made structures such as Tower Castle and Viaduct lead to places being considered more scenic. Importantly while scenes containing Trees tend to rate highly places containing more bland natural green features such as Grass and Athletic Fields are considered less scenic. We also find that a neural network can be trained to automatically identify scenic places and that this network highlights both natural and built locations. Our findings demonstrate how online data combined with neural networks can provide a deeper understanding of what environments we might find beautiful and offer quantitative insights for policymakers charged with design and protection of our built and natural environments."
