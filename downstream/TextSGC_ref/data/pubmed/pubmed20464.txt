Virtual reality VR is usually described in biology and in medicine as a collection of technologies that allow people to interact efficiently with three-dimensional 3-D computerized databases in real time using their natural senses. This definition lacks any reference to head-mounted displays HMDs and instrumented clothing such as gloves or suits. In fact less than 10% of VR healthcare applications in medicine are actually using any immersive equipment. However if we focus our attention on behavioral sciences where immersion is used by more than 50% of the applications VR is described as an advanced form of human- computer interface that allows the user to interact with and become immersed in a computer-generated environment. This difference outlines a different vision of VR shared by psychologists psychotherapists and neuropsychologists: VR provides a new human-computer interaction paradigm in which users are no longer simply external observers of images on a computer screen but are active participants within a computer-generated 3-D virtual world. This special issue investigates this vision presenting some of the most interesting applications actually developed in the area. Moreover it discusses the clinical principles human factors and technological issues associated with the use of VR in the behavioral sciences. Introduction to the special issue on virtual reality environments in behavioral sciences.
