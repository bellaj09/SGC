"The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of a 6-week game-based in-home telerehabilitation exercise program using the Microsoft Kinect for individuals with chronic stroke. Four participants with chronic stroke completed the intervention based on games designed with the customized Mystic Isle software. The games were tailored to each participants specific rehabilitation needs to facilitate the attainment of individualized goals determined through the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Likert scale questionnaires assessed the feasibility and utility of the game-based intervention. Supplementary clinical outcome data were collected. All participants played the games with moderately high enjoyment. Participant feedback helped identify barriers to use especially limited free time and possible improvements. An in-home customized virtual reality game intervention to provide rehabilitative exercises for persons with chronic stroke is practicable. However future studies are necessary to determine the interventions impact on participant function activity and involvement."
