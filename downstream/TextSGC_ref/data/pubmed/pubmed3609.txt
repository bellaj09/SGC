Real-time fMRI neurofeedback rtfMRI-nf is a promising tool for enhancing emotion regulation capability of subjects and for the potential alleviation of neuropsychiatric disorders. The amygdala is composed of structurally and functionally distinct nuclei such as the basolateral amygdala BLA and centromedial amygdala CMA both of which are involved in emotion processing generation and regulation. However the effect of rtfMRI-nf on the resting-state functional connectivity rsFC of BLA and CMA remains to be elucidated. In our study participants were provided with ongoing information on their emotion states by using real-time multivariate voxel pattern analysis. Results showed that participants presented significantly increased rsFC of BLA and CMA with prefrontal cortex rostral anterior cingulate cortex and some others related to emotion after rtfMRI-nf training. The findings provide important evidence for the emotion regulation effectiveness of rtfMRI-nf training and indicate its usefulness as a tool for the self-regulation of emotion.
