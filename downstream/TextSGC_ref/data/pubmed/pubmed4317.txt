Gliomas are widely considered to be related to the altered topological organization of functional networks before operations. Tumors are usually thought to cause multimodal cognitive impairments. The structure is thought to form the basics of function and the aim of this study was to reveal the rich-club organization and topological patterns of white matter WM structural networks associated with cognitive impairments in patients with frontal and temporal gliomas. Altered Rich-Club Organization and Regional Topology Are Associated With Cognitive Decline in Patients With Frontal and Temporal Gliomas.
