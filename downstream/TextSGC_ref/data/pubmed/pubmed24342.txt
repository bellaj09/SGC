Brain-computer interfaces BCIs offer a potential means to replace or restore lost motor function. However BCI performance varies considerably between users the reasons for which are poorly understood. Here we investigated the relationship between sensorimotor rhythm SMR-based BCI performance and brain structure. Participants were instructed to control a computer cursor using right- and left-hand motor imagery which primarily modulated their left- and right-hemispheric SMR powers respectively. Although most participants were able to control the BCI with success rates significantly above chance level even at the first encounter they also showed substantial inter-individual variability in BCI success rate. Participants also underwent T1-weighted three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The MRI data were subjected to voxel-based morphometry using BCI success rate as an independent variable. We found that BCI performance correlated with gray matter volume of the supplementary motor area supplementary somatosensory area and dorsal premotor cortex. We suggest that SMR-based BCI performance is associated with development of non-primary somatosensory and motor areas. Advancing our understanding of BCI performance in relation to its neuroanatomical correlates may lead to better customization of BCIs based on individual brain structure.
