While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can probe intrinsic network connectivity in both human and rodent brain behavioral modulation of these connectivity patterns has not yet been demonstrated in the rodent due to the requirements of immobilization or anesthesia for MRI scanning. To enable the effects of behavioral tasks on functional connectivity to be measured in freely moving awake rats implanted carbon paste electrodes CPEs were used to monitor low-frequency fluctuations of tissue oxygenation. Rats were implanted with CPEs in two nodes of the default mode network DMN and two nodes in a lateral cortical network revealing amperometric oxygen correlation patterns consistent with imaging studies. Using a block design study where rats alternated between sustained periods of instrumental response and unscheduled spontaneous behavior task-induced decreases in functional connectivity were observed between the DMN node pair but not in the distinct lateral cortical network demonstrating network-specific modulation of functional connectivity. Task-induced modulation of intrinsic functional connectivity networks in the behaving rat.
