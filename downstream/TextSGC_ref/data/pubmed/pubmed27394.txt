Adapting classifiers for the purpose of brain signal decoding is a major challenge in brain-computer-interface BCI research. In a previous study we showed in principle that hidden Markov models HMM are a suitable alternative to the well-studied static classifiers. However since we investigated a rather straightforward task advantages from modeling of the signal could not be assessed.
