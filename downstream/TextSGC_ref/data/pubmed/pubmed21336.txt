Gaze-contingent multiresolutional displays GCMRDs center high-resolution information on the user\s gaze position matching the user\s area of interest AOI. Image resolution and details outside the AOI are reduced lowering the requirements for processing resources and transmission bandwidth in demanding display and imaging applications. This review provides a general framework within which GCMRD research can be integrated evaluated and guided. GCMRDs or "moving windows" are analyzed in terms of a the nature of their images i.e. "multiresolution" "variable resolution" "space variant" or "level of detail" and b the movement of the AOI i.e. "gaze contingent" "foveated" or "eye slaved". We also synthesize the known human factors research on GCMRDs and point out important questions for future research and development. Actual or potential applications of this research include flight medical and driving simulators; virtual reality; remote piloting and teleoperation; infrared and indirect vision; image transmission and retrieval; telemedicine; video teleconferencing; and artificial vision systems.
