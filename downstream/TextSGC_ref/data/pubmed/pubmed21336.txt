Brain-computer interfaces BCI have started to be used with the development of computer technology in order to enable individuals who are in this situation to communicate with their environment or move. This study focused on the spelling system that transforms the brain activities obtained with EEG signals into writing. In BCI systems working with P300 obtained from 64 electrodes data recording and processing cause high cost and high processing load. By reducing the number of electrodes used the physical dimensions costs and processing loads of the systems can be reduced. The main problem at this stage is to determine which electrodes are more effective. Randomness-based optimization methods perform their experiments within the framework of a specific fitness function resulting in near-best results rather than the best result. The electrodes chosen as a result of the study are expected to contribute positively to the classifier performance. At the same time an unbalanced data set is balanced and an increase in system performance is expected.
