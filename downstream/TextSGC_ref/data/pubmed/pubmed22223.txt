Spinal cages are used to create a suitable mechanical environment for interbody fusion in cases of degenerative spinal instability. Due to individual variations in bone structures and pathological conditions patient-specific cages can provide optimal\xa0biomechanical conditions for fusion strengthening patient recovery. Finite element analysis FEA is a valuable tool in the biomechanical evaluation of patient-specific cage designs but the time- and labor-intensive process of modeling limits its clinical application. In an effort to facilitate the design and analysis of patient-specific spinal cages an integrated CAD-FEA system CASCaDeS comprehensive analytical spinal cage design system was developed. This system produces a biomechanical-based patient-specific design of spinal cages and is capable of rapid implementation of finite element modeling. By comparison with commercial software this system was validated and proven to be both accurate and efficient. CASCaDeS can be used to design patient-specific cages with a superior biomechanical performance to commercial spinal cages. Development of an integrated CAD-FEA system for patient-specific design of spinal cages.
