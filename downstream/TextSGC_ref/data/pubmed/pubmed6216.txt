A brain clock constituted of 20000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN. While many peptidergic cell types have been identified little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry ICC. To this end contacts among vasoactive intestinal polypeptide VIP gastrin-releasing peptide GRP and calretinin CALR cells of the core and arginine vasopressin AVP and met-enkephalin ENK cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type WT mice AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type-specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication we next explored the SCN in VIP-deficient mice VIP-KO. In these animals AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN but it is not altered in the paraventricular nucleus PVN and supraoptic nucleus SON. Surprisingly in VIP-KO mice the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration which blocks AVP transport restored the numbers of AVP neurons in VIP-KO to that of WT littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.
