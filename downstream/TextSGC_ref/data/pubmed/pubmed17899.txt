"This study aimed to investigate the effect of a VR-based stress management program on people with mood disorders. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Singapore and a convenience sample of 22 was recruited. The program comprised three daily 1-hour sessions incorporating psychoeducation and VR-based relaxation practice. Participants who completed the program had significantly lowered subjective stress t=6.91 p<0.001 depression t=5.62 p<0.001 and anxiety t=5.54 p<0.001; and increased skin temperature F=17.71 p<0.001 perceived relaxation F=26.20 p<0.001 and knowledge F=13.77 p<0.001. Participants feedback on the program was positive. Findings from this study contribute to improving clinical practice and serve as preliminary data to conduct more rigorous research in the future."
