"Gaze is strongly attracted to visual objects that have been associated with rewards. Key to this function is a basal ganglia circuit originating from the caudate nucleus CD mediated by the substantia nigra pars reticulata SNr and aiming at the superior colliculus SC. Notably subregions of CD encode values of visual objects differently: stably by CD tail CDT vs. flexibly by CD head CDH. Are the stable and flexible value signals processed separately throughout the CD-SNr-SC circuit? To answer this question we identified SNr neurons by their inputs from CD and outputs to SC and examined their sensitivity to object values. The direct input from CD was identified by SNr neurons inhibitory response to electrical stimulation of CD. We found that SNr neurons were separated into two groups: 1 neurons inhibited by CDT stimulation located in the caudal-dorsal-lateral SNr cdlSNr and 2 neurons inhibited by CDH stimulation located in the rostral-ventral-medial SNr rvmSNr. Most of CDT-recipient SNr neurons encoded stable values whereas CDH-recipient SNr neurons tended to encode flexible values. The output to SC was identified by SNr neurons antidromic response to SC stimulation. Among the antidromically activated neurons many encoded only stable values while some encoded only flexible values. These results suggest that CDT-cdlSNr-SC circuit and CDH-rvmSNr-SC circuit transmit stable and flexible value signals largely separately to SC. The speed of signal transmission was faster through CDT-cdlSNr-SC circuit than through CDH-rvmSNr-SC circuit which may reflect automatic and controlled gaze orienting guided by these circuits."
