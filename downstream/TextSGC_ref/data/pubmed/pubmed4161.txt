The incidence of pain disorders in women is higher than in men making gender differences in pain a research focus. The human insular cortex is an important brain hub structure for pain processing and is divided into several subdivisions serving different functions in pain perception. Here we aimed to examine the gender differences of the functional connectivities FCs between the twelve insular subdivisions and selected pain-related brain structures in healthy adults. Gender differences in functional connectivities between insular subdivisions and selective pain-related brain structures.
