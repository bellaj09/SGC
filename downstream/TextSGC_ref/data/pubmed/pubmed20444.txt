"The interoptic triangle IOT offers a key access to the contralateral carotid arterys ophthalmic segment oICA and its perforating branches PB the ophthalmic artery OA and the superior hypophyseal artery SHA. It has been previously reported that the assessment of IOTs size is relevant when attempting approaches to the contralateral oICA. However previous studies have overseen that since the oICA is a paramedian structure and a lateralized contralateral approach trajectory is then required the real access to the oICA is further limited by the approach angle adopted by the surgeon with respect to the IOTs plane. For this reason we determined the surgical accessibility to the contralateral oICA and its branches though the IOT by characterizing the morphometry of this triangle relative to the optimal contralateral approach angle." The approach angle to the interoptic triangle limits surgical workspace when targeting the contralateral internal carotid artery.
