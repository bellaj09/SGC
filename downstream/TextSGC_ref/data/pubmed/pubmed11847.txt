An ultrasound US examination is a common noninvasive technique widely applied for diagnosis of a variety of diseases. Based on the rapid development of US equipment many US images have been accumulated and are now available and ready for the preparation of a database for the development of computer-aided US diagnosis with deep learning technology. On the contrary because of the unique characteristics of the US image there could be some issues that need to be resolved for the establishment of computer-aided diagnosis CAD system in this field. For example compared to the other modalities the quality of a US image is currently highly operator dependent; the conditions of examination should also directly affect the quality of US images. So far these factors have hampered the application of deep learning-based technology in the field of US diagnosis. However the development of CAD and US technologies will contribute to an increase in diagnostic quality facilitate the development of remote medicine and reduce the costs in the national health care through the early diagnosis of diseases. From this point of view it may have a large enough potential to induce a paradigm shift in the field of US imaging and diagnosis of liver diseases. Current status and perspectives for computer-aided ultrasonic diagnosis of liver lesions using deep learning technology.
