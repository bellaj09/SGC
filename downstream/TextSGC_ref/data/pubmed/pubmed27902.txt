We have developed a novel type of neural electrode array for future brain-machine interfaces BMI and neural implants requiring high resolution recording and stimulation on the surface of brain lesions or on the cortex. The devices differ on two points from commonly used thin film electrode arrays: first the thin film backbone of the implant is exceptionally thin down to 5 microns and finely patterned into spring-like structures. This increases the flexibility of the electrode array and allows stretching and conforming better to a quasi spherical cavity surface. Second the thin film backbone of the device is reinforced with a porous layer of resorbable chitosan. This design aims at minimal invasiveness and low mechanical irritation during prolonged use while the chitosan matrix ensures the implant is stiff enough for practical handling during the implantation procedure and dissolves afterwards. Furthermore the chitosan adds haemostatic and antiseptic properties to the implant and improves adhesion. In the article the design and fabrication process are presented. In vitro and long term in vivo test results over a 12 month period are shown. By adopting the use of a resorbable scaffold-like material as main constituent of neural implants the presented work opens up the possibility of applying tissue engineering techniques to further improve neural implant technology.
