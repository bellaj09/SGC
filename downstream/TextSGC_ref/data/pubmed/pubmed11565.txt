A fine particulate matter less than 2.5\u202fm PM2.5 in the underground subway system are the cause of many diseases. The iron containing PMs frequently confront in underground stations which ultimately have an impact on the health of living beings especially in children. Hence it is necessary to conduct toxicity assessment of chemical species and regularized the indoor air pollutants to ensure the good health of children. Therefore in this study a new indoor air quality IAQ index is proposed based on toxicity assessment by quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR model. The new indices called comprehensive indoor air toxicity CIAT and cumulative comprehensive indoor air toxicity CCIAT suggests the new standards based on toxicity assessment of PM2.5. QSAR based deep neural network DNN exhibited the best model in predicting the toxicity assessment of chemical species in particulate matters which yield lowest RMSE and QF32 values of 0.6821 and 0.8346 respectively in the test phase. After integration with a standard concentration of PM2.5 two health risk indices of CIAT and CCIAT are introduced based on toxicity assessment results which can be use as the toxicity standard of PM2.5 for detail IAQ management in a subway station. These new health risk indices suggest more sensitive air pollutant level of iron containing fine particulate matters or molecular level contaminants in underground spaces alerting the health risk of adults and children in "unhealthy for sensitive group". A real time QSAR-driven toxicity evaluation and monitoring of iron containing fine particulate matters in indoor subway stations.
