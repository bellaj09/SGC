Restoring natural speech in paralyzed and aphasic people could be achieved using a Brain-Computer Interface BCI controlling a speech synthesizer in real-time. To reach this goal a prerequisite is to develop a speech synthesizer producing intelligible speech in real-time with a reasonable number of control parameters. We present here an articulatory-based speech synthesizer that can be controlled in real-time for future BCI applications. This synthesizer converts movements of the main speech articulators tongue jaw velum and lips into intelligible speech. The articulatory-to-acoustic mapping is performed using a deep neural network DNN trained on electromagnetic articulography EMA data recorded on a reference speaker synchronously with the produced speech signal. This DNN is then used in both offline and online modes to map the position of sensors glued on different speech articulators into acoustic parameters that are further converted into an audio signal using a vocoder. In offline mode highly intelligible speech could be obtained as assessed by perceptual evaluation performed by 12 listeners. Then to anticipate future BCI applications we further assessed the real-time control of the synthesizer by both the reference speaker and new speakers in a closed-loop paradigm using EMA data recorded in real time. A short calibration period was used to compensate for differences in sensor positions and articulatory differences between new speakers and the reference speaker. We found that real-time synthesis of vowels and consonants was possible with good intelligibility. In conclusion these results open to future speech BCI applications using such articulatory-based speech synthesizer.
