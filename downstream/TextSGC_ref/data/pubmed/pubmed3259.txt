This study investigated characteristic large-scale brain changes in schizophrenia. Numerous imaging studies have demonstrated brain changes in schizophrenia particularly aberrant intrinsic functional connectivity iFC of ongoing brain activity measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and aberrant gray matter volume GMV of distributed brain regions measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging. It is unclear however which iFC changes are specific to schizophrenia compared with those of other disorders and whether such specific iFC changes converge with GMV changes. To address this question of specific substantial dysconnectivity in schizophrenia we performed a transdiagnostic multimodal meta-analysis of resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.
