"A deep learning-based image analysis could improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pathology work. Recently we proposed a deep learning-based detection algorithm for C4d immunostaining in renal allografts. The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of the algorithm by comparing pathologists diagnoses and analyzing the associations of the algorithm with clinical data. C4d immunostaining slides of renal allografts were obtained from two different institutions 100 slides from the Asan Medical Center and 86 slides from the Seoul National University Hospital and scanned using two different slide scanners. Three pathologists and the algorithm independently evaluated each slide according to the Banff 2017 criteria. Subsequently they jointly reviewed the results for consensus scoring. The result of the algorithm was compared with that of each pathologist and the consensus diagnosis. Clinicopathological associations of the results of the algorithm with allograft survival histologic evidence of microvascular inflammation and serologic results for donor-specific antibodies were also analyzed. As a result the reproducibility between the pathologists was fair to moderate kappa 0.36-0.54 which is comparable to that between the algorithm and each pathologist kappa 0.34-0.51. The C4d scores predicted by the algorithm achieved substantial concordance with the consensus diagnosis kappa\u2009=\u20090.61 and they were significantly associated with remarkable microvascular inflammation P\u2009=\u20090.001 higher detection rate of donor-specific antibody P\u2009=\u20090.003 and shorter graft survival P\u2009<\u20090.001. In conclusion the deep learning-based C4d detection algorithm showed a diagnostic performance similar to that of the pathologists." Automated detection algorithm for C4d immunostaining showed comparable diagnostic performance to pathologists in renal allograft biopsy.
