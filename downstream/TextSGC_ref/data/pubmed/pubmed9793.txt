Emotions important for survival and social interaction have received wide and deep investigations. The application of the fMRI technique into emotion processing has obtained overwhelming achievements with respect to the localization of emotion processes. The ERP method which possesses highly temporal resolution compared to fMRI can be employed to investigate the time course of emotion processing. The emotional modulation of the ERP component has been verified across numerous researches. Emotions described as dynamically developing along with the growing age have the possibility to be enhanced through learning or training or to be damaged due to disturbances in growth which is underlain by the neural plasticity of emotion-relevant nervous systems. And mood disorders with typical symptoms of emotion discordance probably have been caused by the dysfunctional neural plasticity. Emotion Processing by ERP Combined with Development and Plasticity.
