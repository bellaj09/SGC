For tracking the primo vascular system we observed the primo vessels in\xa0vivo in situ using the lipopolysaccharide LPS response in the lymphatic vessels of a rabbit. Injection of LPS 200\xa0g/kg into the lymph nodes resulted in greatly stained primo vessels which were swollen in some cases. We were able to obtain comparative images through alcian blue and diaminobenzidine staining which clearly showed different morphologies of the primo vessels. The mechanism causing the response of the primo vessels to the injected LPS is still unclear; however these results might be a first attempt at giving an explanation of the function of the primo vascular system and identifying the changes in the structure and function of the primo vascular system in response to an external stimulus such as an injection of LPS.
