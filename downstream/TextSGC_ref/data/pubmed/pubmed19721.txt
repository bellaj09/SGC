"Technological advance in human-computer interaction has attracted increasing research attention especially in the field of virtual reality VR. Prior research has focused on examining the effects of VR on various outcomes for example learning and health. However which factors affect the final outcomes? That is what kind of VR system design will achieve higher usability? This question remains largely. Furthermore when we look at VR system deployment from a human-computer interaction HCI lens does users attitude play a role in achieving the final outcome? This study aims to understand the effect of immersion and involvement as well as users regulatory focus on usability for a somatosensory VR learning system. This study hypothesized that regulatory focus and presence can effectively enhance users perceived usability. Survey data from 78 students in Taiwan indicated that promotion focus is positively related to users perceived efficiency whereas involvement and promotion focus are positively related to users perceived effectiveness. Promotion focus also predicts user satisfaction and overall usability perception." "The effect of users perceived presence and promotion focus on usability for interacting in virtual environments."
