There is often a need to more precisely identify the extent of pathology and the fine elements of intracranial anatomic features during the diagnostic process and during many operations in the nose sinus orbit and skull base region. In two case reports we describe the methods used in the diagnostic workup and surgical therapy in the nose and paranasal sinus region. Besides baseline x-ray multislice computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging operative field imaging was performed via a rapid prototyping model virtual endoscopy and 3-D imaging. Different head tissues were visualized in different colors showing their anatomic interrelations and the extent of pathologic tissue within the operative field. This approach has not yet been used as a standard preoperative or intraoperative procedure in otorhinolaryngology. In this way we tried to understand the new visualized "world of anatomic relations within the patient\s head" by creating an impression of perception virtual perception of the given position of all elements in a particular anatomic region of the head which does not exist in the real world virtual world. This approach was aimed at upgrading the diagnostic workup and surgical therapy by ensuring a faster safer and above all simpler operative procedure. In conclusion any ENT specialist can provide virtual reality support in implementing surgical procedures with additional control of risks and within the limits of normal tissue without additional trauma to the surrounding tissue in the anatomic region. At the same time the virtual reality support provides an impression of the virtual world as the specialist navigates through it and manipulates virtual objects. Virtual reality in rhinology-a new dimension of clinical experience.
