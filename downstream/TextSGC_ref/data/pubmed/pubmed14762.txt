To determine the feasibility of employing the prior knowledge of well-separated chemical exchange saturation transfer CEST signals in the 9.4 T Z-spectrum to separate overlapping CEST signals acquired at 3 T using a deep learning approach trained with 3 T and 9.4 T CEST spectral data from brains of the same subjects. DeepCEST: 9.4 T Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI contrast predicted from 3\xa0T data - a proof of concept study.
