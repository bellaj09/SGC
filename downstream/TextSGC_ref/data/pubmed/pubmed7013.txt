Evidence from behavioral studies has suggested a capacity existed in working memory. As the concept of functional connectivity has been introduced into neuroscience research in the recent years the aim of this study is to investigate the functional connectivity in the brain when working memory load reaches the capacity. 32-channel electroencephalographs EEGs were recorded for 16 healthy subjects while they performed a visual working memory task with load 1-6. Individual working memory capacity was calculated according to behavioral results. Short-time Fourier transform was used to determine the principal frequency band theta band related to working memory. The functional connectivity among EEGs was measured by the directed transform function DTF via spectral Granger causal analysis. The capacity was 4 calculated from the behavioral results. The power was focused in the frontal midline region. The strongest connectivity strengths of EEG theta components from load 1 to 6 distributed in the frontal midline region. The curve of DTF values vs load numbers showed that DTF increased from load 1 to 4 peaked at load 4 then decreased after load 4. This study finds that the functional connectivity between EEGs described quantitatively by DTF became less strong when working memory load exceeded the capacity. Functional connectivity among multi-channel EEGs when working memory load reaches the capacity.
