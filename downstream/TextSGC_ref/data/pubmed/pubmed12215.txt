In this manuscript we develop a deep learning algorithm to improve estimation of rates of progression and prediction of future patterns of visual field loss in glaucoma. A generalized variational auto-encoder VAE was trained to learn a low-dimensional representation of standard automated perimetry SAP visual fields using 29161 fields from 3832 patients. The VAE was trained on a 90% sample of the data with randomization at the patient level. Using the remaining 10% rates of progression and predictions were generated with comparisons to SAP mean deviation MD rates and point-wise PW regression predictions respectively. The longitudinal rate of change through the VAE latent space e.g. with eight dimensions detected a significantly higher proportion of progression than MD at two 25% vs. 9% and four 35% vs 15% years from baseline. Early on VAE improved prediction over PW with significantly smaller mean absolute error in predicting the 4th 6th and 8th visits from the first three e.g. visit eight: VAE8: 5.14\u2009dB vs. PW: 8.07\u2009dB; P\u2009<\u20090.001. A deep VAE can be used for assessing both rates and trajectories of progression in glaucoma with the additional benefit of being a generative technique capable of predicting future patterns of visual field damage.
