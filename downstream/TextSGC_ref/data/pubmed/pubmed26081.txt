Methods from the area of virtual reality are used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the planning and three-dimensional individual simulation of surgeries. SIMULATION: In order to simulate complex surgeries with the aid of a computer the diagnostic image data and especially various imaging modalities CT MRT US must be arranged in relation to each other thus enabling rapid switching between the various modalities as well as the viewing of mixed images. Segmenting techniques for the reconstruction of three-dimensional representations of soft-tissue and osseous areas are required. We must develop ergonomic and intuitively useable interaction methods for the surgeon thus allowing for precise and fast entry of the planned surgical intervention in the planning and simulation phase. Computer-assisted oral maxillary and facial surgery.
