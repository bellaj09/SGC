"Immersive virtual reality can be used to visually substitute a persons real body by a life-sized virtual body VB that is seen from first person perspective. Using real-time motion capture the VB can be programmed to move synchronously with the real body visuomotor synchrony and also virtual objects seen to strike the VB can be felt through corresponding vibrotactile stimulation on the actual body visuotactile synchrony. This setup typically gives rise to a strong perceptual illusion of ownership over the VB. When the viewpoint is lifted up and out of the VB so that it is seen below this may result in an out-of-body experience OBE. In a two-factor between-groups experiment with 16 female participants per group we tested how fear of death might be influenced by two different methods for producing an OBE. In an initial embodiment phase where both groups experienced the same multisensory stimuli there was a strong feeling of body ownership. Then the viewpoint was lifted up and behind the VB. In the experimental group once the viewpoint was out of the VB there was no further connection with it no visuomotor or visuotactile synchrony. In a control condition although the viewpoint was in the identical place as in the experimental group visuomotor and visuotactile synchrony continued. While both groups reported high scores on a question about their OBE illusion the experimental group had a greater feeling of disownership towards the VB below compared to the control group in line with previous findings. Fear of death in the experimental group was found to be lower than in the control group. This is in line with previous reports that naturally occurring OBEs are often associated with enhanced belief in life after death." A Virtual Out-of-Body Experience Reduces Fear of Death.
