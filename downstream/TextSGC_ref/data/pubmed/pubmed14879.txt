Automated prostate segmentation in MRI is highly demanded for computer-assisted diagnosis. Recently a variety of deep learning methods have achieved remarkable progress in this task usually relying on large amounts of training data. Due to the nature of scarcity for medical images it is important to effectively aggregate data from multiple sites for robust model training to alleviate the insufficiency of single-site samples. However the prostate MRIs from different sites present heterogeneity due to the differences in scanners and imaging protocols raising challenges for effective ways of aggregating multi-site data for network training. In this paper we propose a novel multisite network MS-Net for improving prostate segmentation by learning robust representations leveraging multiple sources of data. To compensate for the inter-site heterogeneity of different MRI datasets we develop Domain-Specific Batch Normalization layers in the network backbone enabling the network to estimate statistics and perform feature normalization for each site separately. Considering the difficulty of capturing the shared knowledge from multiple datasets a novel learning paradigm i.e. Multi-site-guided Knowledge Transfer is proposed to enhance the kernels to extract more generic representations from multi-site data. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous prostate MRI datasets demonstrate that our MS-Net improves the performance across all datasets consistently and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-site learning.
