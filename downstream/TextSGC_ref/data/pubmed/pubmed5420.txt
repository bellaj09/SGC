Functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI has emerged as an important research tool for understanding normal brain function as well as changes occurring during brain development and in various brain disorders. Most prior work has examined changes in pairwise functional connectivity values using a multi-variate classification approach such as Support Vector Machines SVM. While it is powerful SVMs produce a dense set of high-dimensional weight vectors as output which are difficult to interpret and require additional post-processing to relate to known functional networks. In this paper we propose a joint framework that combines network identification and classification resulting in a set of networks or Sparse Connectivity Patterns SCPs which are functionally interpretable as well as highly discriminative of the two groups. Applied to a study of normal development classifying children vs. adults the proposed method provided accuracy of 76%AUC= 0.85 comparable to SVM 79%AUC=0.87 but with dramatically fewer number of features 50 features vs. 34716 for the SVM. More importantly this leads to a tremendous improvement in neuro-scientific interpretability which is specially advantageous in such a study where the group differences are wide-spread throughout the brain. Highest-ranked discriminative SCPs reflect increases in long-range connectivity in adults between the frontal areas and posterior cingulate regions. In contrast connectivity between the bilateral parahippocampal gyri was decreased in adults compared to children. Discriminative sparse connectivity patterns for classification of fMRI Data.
