The aim of multislice helical computed tomography venography CTV is to provide a precise global and three-dimensional 3D anatomical depiction of the venous network of the lower limbs. A multislice and multidetector spiral CT acquisition of the lower limbs with contrast injection of the dorsal foot produces about 1000 slices in 30 seconds. Dedicated volume-rendering software can compute a realistic and interactive 3D model of the venous system in realtime. This new tool furnishes an accurate 3D representation of the whole venous system of the lower limb with a realistic 3D model of the limbs providing a road map of the varicose networks complementary to the duplex ultrasound DUS. CTV allows a complete morphological study of the deep veins including the detection of anatomical variations and proximal venous obstruction not easily detectable by DUS. In the case of deep vein thrombosis it has been shown to be a good diagnostic tool well correlated with sonography. It also demonstrates in some cases haemodynamic patterns which are not available by DUS particularly for perforator veins and congenital vascular malformations. The use of virtual reality techniques enables a complete anatomical study of both deep and superficial veins including a virtual dissection of the limbs. CTV is also a great educational tool to learn anatomy of the venous system and a powerful research tool to improve our knowledge of venous anatomy.
