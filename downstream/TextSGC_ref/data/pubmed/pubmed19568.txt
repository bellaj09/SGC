"The study was designed to investigate the effect of virtual reality-supported training on manual skills and grip strength in the non-dominant hand in healthy participants. Thirty participants were randomized into two groups: ErgoActive group n=15 and control group n=15. The ErgoActive study group received 8 weeks of training with leap motion controller-based virtual reality games. The training was done 1 day per week for 30min. The participants hand function was evaluated using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test JTHFT while grip strength was evaluated with a Jamar Hand Dynamometer and Pinchmeter. After 8 weeks the ErgoActive and control groups had significantly different JTHFT Jamar and Pinchmeter results P<0.05. When leap motion controller-based virtual reality applications are used healthy subjects have increased manual skills and grip strength in their non-dominant hand. These virtual reality games are an effective and fun way of improving patients hand functions." Video game-based therapy for the non-dominant hand improves manual skills and grip strength.
