Biomedical researchers regularly discover new interactions between chemical compounds/drugs and genes/proteins and report them in research literature. Having knowledge about these interactions is crucially important in many research areas such as precision medicine and drug discovery. The BioCreative VI Task 5 CHEMPROT challenge promotes the development and evaluation of computer systems that can automatically recognize and extract statements of such interactions from biomedical literature. We participated in this challenge with a Support Vector Machine SVM system and a deep learning-based system ST-ANN and achieved an F-score of 60.99 for the task. After the shared task we have significantly improved the performance of the ST-ANN system. Additionally we have developed a new deep learning-based system I-ANN that considerably outperforms the ST-ANN system. Both ST-ANN and I-ANN systems are centered around training an ensemble of artificial neural networks and utilizing different bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory LSTM chains for representing the shortest dependency path and/or the full sentence. By combining the predictions of the SVM and the I-ANN systems we achieved an F-score of 63.10 for the task improving our previous F-score by 2.11 percentage points. Our systems are fully open-source and publicly available. We highlight that the systems we present in this study are not applicable only to the BioCreative VI Task 5 but can be effortlessly re-trained to extract any types of relations of interest with no modifications of the source code required if a manually annotated corpus is provided as training data in a specific file format. Potent pairing: ensemble of long short-term memory networks and support vector machine for chemical-protein relation extraction.
