Temporal lobe epilepsy TLE is considered a brain activity disorder that is likely related to allomnesia and conscious disturbance. In rodents TLE epileptiform discharges can be triggered by systemic administration of a dose of pilocarpine. However how these pilocarpine-induced epileptiform discharges generate and propagate through the whole brain has not been well studied. In this study we sought to assess alterations of activity and information flow in the default mode network DMN during TLE epileptiform discharges in pilocarpine-induced TLE rats. We identified that in resting state the rat DMN could be divided into three subnetworks that constituted a frequency-specific information flow loop. This frequency-specific loop converted into frequency-independent flow patterns during the generation and propagation of epileptiform discharges. Moreover the activity of the theta 4-8\u202fHz and alpha 8-13\u202fHz bands in each DMN subnetwork exhibited completely different alterations during epileptiform discharges. Overall our results demonstrated frequency-dependent alterations of both activity and information flow patterns within the DMN during epileptiform discharge. These results suggest that the independence and cooperation of different frequency bands may serve as an underlying mechanism for the generation and propagation of epileptiform discharges in the brain during SE in pilocarpine-treated rats.
