"Steady-state visual-evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have generated significant interest due to their high information transfer rate ITR. Due to the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the SSVEP the flickering frequency of an SSVEP-based BCI is typically lower than 20\u2009 Hz to achieve a high SNR. However a visual flicker with a flashing frequency below the critical flicker-fusion frequency often makes subjects feel flicker jerky and causes visual discomfort. This study presents a novel technique using high duty-cycle visual flicker to decrease users visual discomfort. The proposed design uses LEDs flashing at 13.16 \u2009Hz driven by flickering sequences consisting of repetitive stimulus cycles with a duration T T = 76 ms. Each stimulus cycle included an ON state with a duration TON and an OFF state with a duration TOFF T = TON + TOFF and the duty cycle defined as TON/T varied from 10.5% to 89.5%. This study also includes a questionnaire survey and analyzes the SSVEPs induced by different duty-cycle flickers. An 89.5% duty-cycle flicker reported as a comfortable flicker was adopted in a phase-tagged SSVEP system. Six subjects were asked to sequentially input a sequence of cursor commands with the 25.08-bits/min ITR." An SSVEP-based BCI using high duty-cycle visual flicker.
