The branching patterns of pulmonary arteries and veins vary greatly in the pulmonary hilar region and are very complicated. We attempted to reconstruct anatomically correct images using a freeware program. After uploading the images to a personal computer bronchi pulmonary arteries and veins were traced by moving up and down in the images and the location and thickness of the bronchi and pulmonary vasculture were indicated as different-sized cylinders. Next based on the resulting numerical data a 3D image was reconstructed using Metasequoia shareware. The reconstructed images can be manipulated by virtual surgical procedures such as reshaping cutting and moving. These system would be very helpful in complicated video-assisted thoracic surgery such as lung segmentectomy. Virtual reality in video-assisted thoracoscopic lung segmentectomy.
