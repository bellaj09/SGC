When attempting to implement evidence-based medicine such as through clinical guidelines we often rely on passive educational tactics for example didactic lectures and bulletins. These methods involve the recipient in relatively superficial processing of information and any consequent attitude changes can be expected to be short-lived. However active methods such as practice-based discussion should involve recipients in deep processing with more enduring attitude changes. In this experiment the aim was to assess the efficacy of an active strategy at promoting deep processing and its effectiveness relative to a typical passive method at changing attitudes between groups of GPs over 12 months across an English Health District. Changing attitudes to infection management in primary care: a controlled trial of active versus passive guideline implementation strategies.
