"Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex DLPFC has been associated with goal encoding in primates. Thus far the majority of research involving DLPFC including all electrophysiology studies has been performed in non-human primates. In this paper we explore the possibility of utilizing the cortical activity in DLPFC in humans for use in Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs. Electrocorticographic signals were recorded from seven patients with intractable epilepsy who had electrode coverage over DLPFC. These subjects performed a visuomotor target-based task to assess DLPFCs involvement in planning execution and accomplishment of the simple motor task. These findings demonstrate that there is a distinct high-frequency spectral component in DLPFC associated with accomplishment of the task. It is envisioned that these signals could potentially provide a novel verification of task accomplishment for a BCI."
