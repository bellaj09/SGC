"To drive safely among human drivers cyclists and pedestrians autonomous vehicles will need to mimic or ideally improve upon humanlike driving. Yet driving presents us with difficult problems of joint action: negotiating with other users over shared road space. We argue that autonomous driving provides a test case for computational theories of social interaction with fundamental implications for the development of autonomous vehicles."
