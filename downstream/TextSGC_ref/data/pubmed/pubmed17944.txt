"Within image-guided surgery hybrid guidance technologies have been used to integrate the complementary features of radioactive guidance and fluorescence guidance. Here we explore how the generation of a novel freehand fluorescence fhFluo imaging approach complements freehand SPECT fhSPECT in a hybrid setup. Near-infrared optical tracking was used to register the position and the orientation of a hybrid opto-nuclear detection probe while recording its readings. Dedicated look-up table models were used for 3D reconstruction. In phantom and excised tissue settings i.e. flat-surface human skin explants fhSPECT and fhFluo were investigated for image resolution and in-tissue signal penetration. Finally the combined potential of these freehand technologies was evaluated on prostate and lymph node specimens of prostate cancer patients receiving prostatectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection tracers: indocyanine green ICG +99m Tc-nanocolloid or ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid. After hardware and software integration the hybrid setup created 3D nuclear and fluorescence tomography scans. The imaging resolution of fhFluo 1 mm was superior to that of fhSPECT 6 mm. Fluorescence modalities were confined to a maximum depth of 0.5 cm while nuclear modalities were usable at all evaluated depths <2 cm. Both fhSPECT and fhFluo enabled augmented- and virtual-reality navigation toward segmented image hotspots including relative hotspot quantification with an accuracy of 3.9% and 4.1%. Imaging in surgical specimens confirmed these trends fhSPECT: in-depth detectability low resolution and fhFluo: superior resolution superficial detectability. Overall when radioactive and fluorescent tracer signatures are used fhFluo has complementary value to fhSPECT. Combined the freehand technologies render a unique hybrid imaging and navigation modality." Extending the Hybrid Surgical Guidance Concept With Freehand Fluorescence Tomography.
