Longitudinal measurement of glioma burden with MRI is the basis for treatment response assessment. In this study we developed a deep learning algorithm that automatically segments abnormal fluid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR hyperintensity and contrast-enhancing tumor quantitating tumor volumes as well as the product of maximum bidimensional diameters according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology RANO criteria AutoRANO. Automatic assessment of glioma burden: a deep learning algorithm for fully automated volumetric and bidimensional measurement.
