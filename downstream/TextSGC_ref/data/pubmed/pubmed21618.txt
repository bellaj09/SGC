Simulation has been proposed to improve learning curves in carotid artery stenting CAS but previous studies have only evaluated CAS simulation in a single type of arch usually either type I or type II. The aim of our study is to define the use of virtual reality for CAS training in type I and type III aortic arches for novice operators. The use of virtual reality for carotid artery stenting CAS training in type I and type III aortic arches.
