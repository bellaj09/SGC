At the end of December 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan city China. As of April 15 2020 >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide including >120000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average ARIMA models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy Spain and France the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA 021 ARIMA 120 and ARIMA 021 models with the lowest MAPE values 4.7520 5.8486 and 5.6335 were selected as the best models for Italy Spain and France respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy Spain and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries. Estimation of COVID-19 prevalence in Italy Spain and France.
