Non-blind image deconvolution is an ill-posed problem. The presence of noise and band-limited blur kernels makes the solution of this problem non-unique. Existing deconvolution techniques produce a residual between the sharp image and the estimation that is highly correlated with the sharp image the kernel and the noise. In most cases different restoration models must be constructed for different blur kernels and different levels of noise resulting in low computational efficiency or highly redundant model parameters. Here we aim to develop a single model that handles different types of kernels and different levels of noise: general non-blind deconvolution. Specifically we propose a very deep convolutional neural network that predicts the residual between a pre-deconvolved image and the sharp image rather than the sharp image. The residual learning strategy makes it easier to train a single model for different kernels and different levels of noise encouraging high effectiveness and efficiency. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed model for different blur kernels. The model also shows state-of-the-art performance on synthesized blurry images.
