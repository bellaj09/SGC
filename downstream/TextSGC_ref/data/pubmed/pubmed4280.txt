"Background and Purpose- The ability to model long-term functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke represents a major clinical challenge. One approach to potentially improve prediction modeling involves the analysis of connectomics. The field of connectomics represents the brains connectivity as a graph whose topological properties have helped uncover underlying mechanisms of brain function in health and disease. Specifically we assessed the impact of stroke lesions on rich club organization a high capacity backbone system of brain function. Methods- In a hospital-based cohort of 41 acute ischemic stroke patients we investigated the effect of acute infarcts on the brains prestroke rich club backbone and poststroke functional connectomes with respect to poststroke outcome. Functional connectomes were created using 3 anatomic atlases and characteristic path-length L was calculated for each connectome. The number of rich club regions affected were manually determined using each patients diffusion weighted image. We investigated differences in L with respect to outcome modified Rankin Scale score; 90 days and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS; early: 2-5 days; late: 90-day follow-up. Furthermore we assessed the effect of including number of rich club regions and L in outcome models using linear regression and assessing the explained variance R2. Results- Of 41 patients mean age range: 70 45-89 years 61% were male. Lower L was generally associated with better outcome. Including number of rich club regions in the backward selection models of outcome R2 increased between 1.3- and 2.6-fold beyond that of traditional markers age and acute lesion volume for NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale score. Conclusions- In this proof-of-concept study we showed that information on network topology can be leveraged to improve modeling of poststroke functional outcome. Future studies are warranted to validate this approach in larger prospective studies of outcome prediction in stroke."
