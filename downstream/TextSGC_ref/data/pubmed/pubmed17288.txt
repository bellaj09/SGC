The "mediated sense of presence" is a technology-induced illusion of being present in one simulated place when one is actually present in another physical place. Typically experienced in virtual worlds mediated presence is generated by different technological cognitive and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Specifically we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context influence the users\ sense of presence providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students randomly divided into four groups were asked to find a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users\ sense of presence. Results showed a significant effect of narrative F8 73\u2009=\u200930.346 p\u2009<\u20090.001 and level of immersion F 8 73\u2009=\u200910.913 p\u2009<\u20090.001 and a significant interaction between narrative and immersion F8 73\u2009=\u20092.062 p\u2009=\u20090.05 both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover considering the factors immersion I and narrative N together we found that the I-N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects\ sense of inner presence. The role of immersion and narrative in mediated presence: the virtual hospital experience.
