Short-term traffic state prediction has become an integral component of an advanced traveler information system ATIS in intelligent transportation systems ITS. Accurate modeling and short-term traffic prediction are quite challenging due to its intricate characteristics stochastic and dynamic traffic processes. Existing works in this area follow different modeling approaches that are focused to fit speed density or the volume data. However the accuracy of such modeling approaches has been frequently questioned thereby traffic state prediction over the short-term from such methods inflicts an overfitting issue. We address this issue to accurately model short-term future traffic state prediction using state-of-the-art models via hyperparameter optimization. To do so we focused on different machine learning classifiers such as local deep support vector machine LD-SVM decision jungles multi-layers perceptron MLP and CN2 rule induction. Moreover traffic states are evaluated using traffic attributes such as level of service LOS horizons and simple if-then rules at different time intervals. Our findings show that hyperparameter optimization via random sweep yielded superior results. The overall prediction performances obtained an average improvement by over 95% such that the decision jungle and LD-SVM achieved an accuracy of 0.982 and 0.975 respectively. The experimental results show the robustness and superior performances of decision jungles DJ over other methods. Short Term Traffic State Prediction via Hyperparameter Optimization Based Classifiers.
