Models for predicting preterm birth generally have focused on very preterm 28-32\u202fweeks and moderate to late preterm 32-37\u202fweeks settings. However extreme preterm birth EPB before the 28th week of gestational age accounts for the majority of newborn deaths. We investigated the extent to which deep learning models that consider temporal relations documented in electronic health records EHRs can predict EPB. Deep learning predicts extreme preterm birth from electronic health records.
