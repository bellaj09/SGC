Mechanical thrombectomy MT has transformed the treatment of ischemic stroke. However patient access to MT may be limited due to a shortage of doctors specifically trained to perform MT. The studies reported here were done to 1 develop operationally define and seek consensus from procedure experts on the metrics which best characterize a reference procedure for the performance of an MT for ischemic stroke and 2 evaluate their construct validity when implemented in a virtual reality VR simulation. Validation studies of virtual reality simulation performance metrics for mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke.
