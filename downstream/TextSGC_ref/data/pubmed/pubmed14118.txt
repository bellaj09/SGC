"MircroRNAs miRNAs regulate target genes and are responsible for lethal diseases such as cancers. Accurately recognizing and identifying miRNA and gene pairs could be helpful in deciphering the mechanism by which miRNA affects and regulates the development of cancers. Embedding methods and deep learning methods have shown their excellent performance in traditional classification tasks in many scenarios. But not so many attempts have adapted and merged these two methods into miRNA-gene relationship prediction. Hence we proposed a novel computational framework. We first generated representational features for miRNAs and genes using both sequence and geometrical information and then leveraged a deep learning method for the associations prediction." SG-LSTM-FRAME: a computational frame using sequence and geometrical information via LSTM to predict miRNA-gene associations.
