"We followed up a series of 23 Parkinsons disease PD patients who had performed an immersive virtual reality VR protocol eight years before. On that occasion six patients incidentally described visual hallucinations VH with occurrences of images not included in the virtual environment. Curiously in the following years only these patients reported the appearance of VH later in their clinical history while the rest of the group did not. Even considering the limited sample size we may argue that VR immersive systems can induce unpleasant effects in PD patients who are predisposed to a cognitive impairment."
