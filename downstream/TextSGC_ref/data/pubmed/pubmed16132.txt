BACKGROUND The number of people using smart devices such as smartphones SPs or virtual reality head-mounted displays HMDs is rapidly increasing. This study aimed to investigate the effects of viewing smart devices including SPs and HMDs on postural balance and the development of dizziness in healthy individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-six healthy adults underwent static balance measurements at baseline and after 5 10 and 20 minutes of viewing the SP and HMD display. Measurements were taken using a force plate and Wii Balance Board WBB and included the parameters of postural sway velocity path length and postural sway area. A modified Simulator Sickness Questionnaire SSQ evaluated oculomotor function and dizziness twice for each device after 5 and 20 minutes of use. RESULTS Compared with baseline the use of smart devices for 20 minutes had significantly increased effects on balance oculomotor function and dizziness than shorter use for 10 minutes or 5 minutes in healthy adults. Postural sway velocity and path length were significantly increased after 20 minutes of use of the HMD and SP when compared 5-minute use and baseline measurements p<0.05. Postural sway area after 20-minute use of the HMD was significantly increased compared with the baseline and 5-minute and 10-minute use of the SP and 5-minute use of the HMD p<0.05. The SSQ showed that dizziness was significantly increased after 20-minute use compared with 5-minute use of the HMD and SP p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS Longer use of smart devices affected static balance oculomotor function and dizziness in healthy adults.
