Accurately recognizing rare diseases based on symptom description is an important task in patient triage early risk stratification and target therapies. However due to the very nature of rare diseases the lack of historical data poses a great challenge to machine learning-based approaches. On the other hand medical knowledge in automatically constructed knowledge graphs KGs has the potential to compensate the lack of labeled training examples. This work aims to develop a rare disease classification algorithm that makes effective use of a knowledge graph even when the graph is imperfect. Improving rare disease classification using imperfect knowledge graph.
