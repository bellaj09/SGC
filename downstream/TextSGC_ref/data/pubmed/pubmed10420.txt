Guangxi a province in southwestern China has the second highest reported number of HIV/AIDS cases in China. This study aimed to develop an accurate and effective model to describe the tendency of HIV and to predict its incidence in Guangxi. HIV incidence data of Guangxi from 2005 to 2016 were obtained from the database of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Long short-term memory LSTM neural network models autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA models generalised regression neural network GRNN models and exponential smoothing ES were used to fit the incidence data. Data from 2015 and 2016 were used to validate the most suitable models. The model performances were evaluated by evaluating metrics including mean square error MSE root mean square error mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. The LSTM model had the lowest MSE when the N value time step was 12. The most appropriate ARIMA models for incidence in 2015 and 2016 were ARIMA 1 1 2 0 1 212 and ARIMA 2 1 0 1 1 212 respectively. The accuracy of GRNN and ES models in forecasting HIV incidence in Guangxi was relatively poor. Four performance metrics of the LSTM model were all lower than the ARIMA GRNN and ES models. The LSTM model was more effective than other time-series models and is important for the monitoring and control of local HIV epidemics. Application of a long short-term memory neural network: a burgeoning method of deep learning in forecasting HIV incidence in Guangxi China.
