"Protein secondary structure PSS is critical to further predict the tertiary structure understand protein function and design drugs. However experimental techniques of PSS are time consuming and expensive and thus its very urgent to develop efficient computational approaches for predicting PSS based on sequence information alone. Moreover the feature matrix of a protein contains two dimensions: the amino-acid residue dimension and the feature vector dimension. Existing deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable performances of PSS prediction but the methods often utilize the features from the amino-acid dimension. Thus there is still room to improve computational methods of PSS prediction." DeepACLSTM: deep asymmetric convolutional long short-term memory neural models for protein secondary structure prediction.
