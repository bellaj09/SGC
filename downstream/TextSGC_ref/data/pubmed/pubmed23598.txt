The disownership of body parts that most frequently occurs on the left side of the body contralateral to right-hemispheric lesions is an infrequent disorder as usually assessed by interviews asking for dichotomic "yes/no" responses. This observational study in right-brain-damaged stroke patients investigated the efficacy of a continuous Visual Analog Scale VAS to detect body disownership after right brain damage compared to dichotomic questions. Thirty-two right-handed right-brain-damaged stroke patients were given a Standardized Interview SI asking "Whose hand/arm/leg is this?" followed by a VAS asking patients to mark on a vertical line their agreement with the statement that a body part belonged to them. The neural correlates of this disorder and measures of extra-personal and personal spatial neglect were also assessed. Control data were recorded from 18 neurologically unimpaired right-handed participants. During the interview no patient showed disownership of body parts. Conversely on the VAS eight out of 32 25% patients\ scores but none of the controls\ scores indicated a judgement of disownership for left body parts with a left-right difference larger than that of control participants. VAS-detected disownership was not systematically associated with extra-personal and personal unilateral spatial neglect. Lesion sites associated with disownership of left body parts included the caudate nucleus and the anterior part of the internal capsule. To conclude the VAS task compared to the interview is a novel tool to detect disownership of left body parts in right brain-damaged patients. A revised classification of body-ownership disorders is proposed. The present variant assessed and detected by the VAS task is termed Covert disownership and distinguished from the Overt disownership assessed by a SI.
