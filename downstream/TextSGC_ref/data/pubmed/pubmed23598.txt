Colorimetric detection with smartphones is ideal for point-of-care measurements because the signal reader is easily available. Densitometric detection schemes enable semiquantitative measurements but require a lightproof box to control photographic conditions and/or extensive data treatment to extract information. Approaches based on pattern recognition are not so sensitive to light artifacts but can only yield a yes/no type of answer when the signal is above or below a certain threshold. Here we introduce a new method for detecting different concentrations of proteins as well as light artifacts with origami immunosensors and digital logic. The origami design consists of a folded piece of paper with three identical biorecognition sites so that one drop of sample generates three colorimetric signals simultaneously. The three colorimetric signals are then evaluated with an augmented reality app that generates a virtual semaphore that sequentially turns on its green yellow and red lights depending on the concentration of analyte. These three Boolean variables pass through "and" and "not" logic gates in a 3-to-8 decoder that enables the semiquantitative detection of proteins and adds a failsafe against erroneous results. The proposed method can detect the model analyte mouse IgG with a limit of detection and sensitivity comparable to densitometry performed under light-controlled conditions. It can also detect the sepsis biomarker procalcitonin at clinically relevant concentrations. With our approach the detection is performed in real time and signal processing is not required which makes it suitable for rapid analyses by nonspecialists at the point of need.
