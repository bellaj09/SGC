Assess the efficacy of deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs in detection of critical enteric feeding tube malpositions on radiographs. 5475 de-identified HIPAA compliant frontal view chest and abdominal radiographs were obtained consisting of 174 x-rays of bronchial insertions and 5301 non-critical radiographs including normal course normal chest and normal abdominal x-rays. The ground-truth classification for enteric feeding tube placement was performed by two board-certified radiologists. Untrained and pretrained deep convolutional neural network models for Inception V3 ResNet50 and DenseNet 121 were each employed. The radiographs were fed into each deep convolutional neural network which included untrained and pretrained models. The Tensorflow framework was used for Inception V3 ResNet50 and DenseNet. Images were split into training 4745 validation 630 and test 100. Both real-time and preprocessing image augmentation strategies were performed. Receiver operating characteristic ROC and area under the curve AUC on the test data were used to assess the models. Statistical differences among the AUCs were obtained. p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. The pretrained Inception V3 which had an AUC of 0.87 95 CI; 0.80-0.94 performed statistically significantly better p\u2009<\u2009.001 than the untrained Inception V3 with an AUC of 0.60 95 CI; 0.52-0.68. The pretrained Inception V3 also had the highest AUC overall as compared with ResNet50 and DenseNet121 with AUC values ranging from 0.82 to 0.85. Each pretrained network outperformed its untrained counterpart. p\u2009<\u20090.05. Deep learning demonstrates promise in differentiating critical vs. non-critical placement with an AUC of 0.87. Pretrained networks outperformed untrained ones in all cases. DCNNs may allow for more rapid identification and communication of critical feeding tube malpositions.
