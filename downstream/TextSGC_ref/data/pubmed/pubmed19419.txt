Objective: The goal of this contribution is to develop a classifier able to determine if cybersickness CS has occurred after immersion in a virtual reality VR scenario based on a combination of biosignals and game parameters. Methods: We collected electrocardiographic electrooculographic respiratory and skin conductivity data from a total of 66 participants. In addition we also captured relevant game parameters such as avatar linear and angular speed as well as acceleration head movements and on-screen collisions. The data were collected while the participants were in a 10-minute VR experience which was developed in Unity. The experience forced rotation and lateral movements upon the participants to provoke CS. A baseline was captured during a first simple scenario. The data were then split in per-level per-60-second and per-30-second windows. Furthermore participants filled a pre- and postimmersion simulator sickness questionnaire. Simulator sickness scores were then used as a reference for binary CS vs. no CS and ternary no CS-mild CS-severe CS classification patterns. Several classification methods support vector machines K-nearest neighbors and neural networks were tested. Results: A maximum classification accuracy of 82% was achieved for binary classification and 56% for ternary classification. Conclusion: Given the sample size and the variety of movement patterns presented in the demonstration we conclude that a combination of biosignals and game parameters suffice to determine the occurrence of CS. However substantial further research is required to improve binary classification accuracy to adequate values for real-life scenarios and to determine better approaches to classify its severity.
