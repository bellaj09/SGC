Sound propagation encompasses various acoustic phenomena including reverberation. Current virtual acoustic methods ranging from parametric filters to physically accurate solvers can simulate reverberation with varying degrees of fidelity. The effects of reverberant sounds generated using different propagation algorithms on acoustic distance perception are investigated. In particular two classes of methods for real time sound propagation in dynamic scenes based on parametric filters and ray tracing are evaluated. The study shows that ray tracing enables more distance accuracy as compared to the approximate filter-based method. This suggests that accurate reverberation in virtual reality results in better reproduction of acoustic distances. Effects of virtual acoustics on dynamic auditory distance perception.
