Simulation training can prepare trainees for clinical practice in laparoscopic surgery. Training on box trainers allows for simulation training at home which studies have shown to be a feasible method of training. However little research has been conducted into how to make it a more efficient method of training. Our aim was to investigate how box trainers are used in take-home training to help guide the design of take-home training courses. Take-home training in a simulation-based laparoscopy course.
