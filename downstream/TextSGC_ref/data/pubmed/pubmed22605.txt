Information and communications technology ICT is a universal term describing the use of technology and media to disseminate and share knowledge and information. Educational media provide a means by which information can be communicated between teacher and learner. In this context the aim of this digest is to summarise and describe the spectrum of tools available. All technologies used in education have their strengths and weaknesses. Variety needs to be balanced by economy. However it must be remembered that technology is not the overriding issue. The design of the learning environment and the learning experience itself are far more important. Technologies are generally flexible and can be used in a variety of ways. Knowledge of these technologies will help guide appropriate selection. The following tools are described: 1. Telecommunications services; 2. Communications tools social software including email newsgroups weblogs and wikis; 3. Richmedia in interactive training and learning; 4. Compact discs CDs and digital video discs DVDs; 5. Virtual learning environments VLE; 6. Sophisticated communications - videoconferencing webcasting and podcasts; 7. Interactive television; and 8. Virtual reality.
