Most of electroencephalogramEEGacquired by multi-channels is difficult to be applied to the singlechannel brain-computer interfaceBCIin the EEG analysis method based on left and right hand motor imagery.The present research applied an improved independent component analysisICAmethod to realize pretreatment of the EEG effectively.Firstlydata drift was removed through linear drift correction.Secondlythe number of virtual channels were increased by applying delayed window data and some EEG artifacts which are namely electrooculogramEOGand electrocardiogramECGwere removed by ICA.Finallythe average instantaneous energy characteristics were calculated and classified through the instantaneous amplitude which was solved by applying Hilbert-Huang transformHHT.The experiment proves that the method completes the EEG pretreatment and improves classification ratio of single-channel EEGand lays a foundation of single-channel and portable BCI.
