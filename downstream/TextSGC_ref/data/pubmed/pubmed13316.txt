In this article we present a dataset containing word embeddings and document topic distribution vectors generated from MOOCs video lecture transcripts. Transcripts of 12032 video lectures from 200 courses were collected from Coursera learning platform. This large corpus of transcripts was used as input to two well-known NLP techniques namely Word2Vec and Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA to generate word embeddings and topic vectors respectively. We used Word2Vec and LDA implementation in the Gensim package in Python. The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Integrating word embeddings and document topics with deep learning in a video classification framework" 1. The dataset is hosted in the Mendeley Data repository 2. WET: Word embedding-topic distribution vectors for MOOC video lectures dataset.
