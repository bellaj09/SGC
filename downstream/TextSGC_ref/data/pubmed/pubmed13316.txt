Artificial intelligence AI has influenced all aspects of human life and neurology is no exception to this growing trend. The aim of this paper is to guide medical practitioners on the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence i.e. machine learning and deep learning to review the development of technological advancement equipped with AI and to elucidate how machine learning can revolutionize the management of neurological diseases. This review focuses on unsupervised aspects of machine learning and how these aspects could be applied to precision neurology to improve patient outcomes. We have mentioned various forms of available AI prior research outcomes benefits and limitations of AI effective accessibility and future of AI keeping the current burden of neurological disorders in mind. Artificial intelligence as an emerging technology in the current care of neurological disorders.
