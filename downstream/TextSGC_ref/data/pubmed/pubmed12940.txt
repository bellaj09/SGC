Transcription factors bind regulatory DNA sequences in a combinatorial manner to modulate gene expression. Deep neural networks DNNs can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features nucleotides or motifs in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models. Discovering epistatic feature interactions from neural network models of regulatory DNA sequences.
