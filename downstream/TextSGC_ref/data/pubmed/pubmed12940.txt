Sleep and ongoing cycling of sleep states are required for neurosensory processing learning and brain plasticity. Many aspects of neonatal intensive care environments such as handling for routine and invasive procedures bright lighting and noise can create stress disrupt behavior and interfere with sleep in prematurely born infants. The study empirically investigated whether a 30-minute observation of infant sleep states and behavior could differentiate an intervention to promote sleep in premature infants with feeding difficulties relative to conventional care standard positioning standard crib mattress SP. We included an intervention to determine the ability of the method to discriminate treatments and generate a benchmark for future improvements. The intervention a conformational positioner CP is contoured around the infant to provide customized containment and boundaries. To more fully verify the 30-minute observational sleep results standard polysomnography was conducted simultaneously and sleep outcomes for the 2 modalities were compared. Behavioral observation differentiates the effects of an intervention to promote sleep in premature infants: a pilot study.
