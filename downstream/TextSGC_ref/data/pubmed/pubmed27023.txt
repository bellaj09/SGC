"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are desirable for people to express their thoughts especially those with profound disabilities in communication. The classification of brain patterns for each different subject requires an extensively time-consuming learning stage specific to that person in order to reach satisfactory accuracy performance. The training session could also be infeasible for disabled patients as they may not fully understand the training instructions. In this paper we propose a unified classification scheme based on ensemble classifier dynamic stopping and adaptive learning. We apply this scheme on the P300-based BCI with the subject-independent manner where no learning session is required for new experimental users. According to our theoretical analysis and empirical results the harmonized integration of these three methods can significantly boost up the average accuracy from 75.00% to 91.26% while at the same time reduce the average spelling time from 12.62 to 6.78 iterations approximately to two-fold faster. The experiments were conducted on a large public dataset which had been used in other related studies. Direct comparisons between our work with the others are also reported in details."
