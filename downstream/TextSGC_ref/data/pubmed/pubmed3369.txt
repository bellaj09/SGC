Innate defensive responses are essential for animal survival and are conserved across species. The ventral tegmental area VTA plays important roles in learned appetitive and aversive behaviors but whether it plays a role in mediating or modulating innate defensive responses is currently unknown. We report that VTAGABA+ neurons respond to a looming stimulus. Inhibition of VTAGABA+ neurons reduced looming-evoked defensive flight behavior and photoactivation of these neurons resulted in defense-like flight behavior. Using viral tracing and electrophysiological recordings we show that VTAGABA+ neurons receive direct excitatory inputs from the superior colliculus SC. Furthermore we show that glutamatergic SC-VTA projections synapse onto VTAGABA+ neurons that project to the central nucleus of the amygdala CeA and that the CeA is involved in mediating the defensive behavior. Our findings demonstrate that aerial threat-related visual information is relayed to VTAGABA+ neurons mediating innate behavioral responses suggesting a more general role of the VTA.
