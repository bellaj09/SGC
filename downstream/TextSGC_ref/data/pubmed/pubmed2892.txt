Generalized anxiety disorder GAD is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about everyday life. Prior neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that GAD is associated with disruptions in specific brain regions; however little is known about the global functional connectivity maps in adolescents with GAD. Here first-episode medication-naive adolescent GAD patients N = 36 and healthy controls N = 28 HCs underwent resting-state functional MRI R-fMRI and completed a package of questionnaires to assess clinical symptoms. Functional connectivity strength and seed-based functional connectivity were employed to investigate the functional connectivity architecture. GAD patients showed reduced functional connectivity strength in right supramarginal gyrus SMG and right superior parietal gyrus SPG compared with HCs. Further seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed that GAD patients displayed decreased functional connectivity between right SMG and left fusiform gyrus inferior temporal gyrus parahippocampal gyrus bilateral precuneus and cuneus and between right SPG and bilateral supplementary motor area and middle cingulate gyrus as well as between the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network. Moreover the disrupted intra-network connectivity i.e. the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network and inter-network connectivity between the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network accounted for 25.5% variance of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI and 39.5% variance of the trait subscale of STAI. Our findings highlight the abnormal functional architecture in the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network in GAD providing novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of this disorder.
