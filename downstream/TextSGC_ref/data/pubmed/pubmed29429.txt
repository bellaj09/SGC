A novel augmented complex-valued common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is introduced in order to cater for general complex signals with noncircular probability distributions. This is a typical case in multichannel electroencephalogram EEG due to the power difference or correlation between the data channels yet current methods only cater for a very restrictive class of circular data. The proposed complex-valued CSP algorithms account for the generality of complex noncircular data by virtue of the use of augmented complex statistics and the strong-uncorrelating transform SUT. Depending on the degree of power difference of complex signals the analysis and simulations show that the SUT based algorithm maximizes the inter-class difference between two motor imagery tasks. Simulations on both synthetic noncircular sources and motor imagery experiments using real-world EEG support the approach.
