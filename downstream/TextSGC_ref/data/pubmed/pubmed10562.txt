Drug discovery which is the process of discovering new candidate medications is very important for pharmaceutical industries. At its current stage discovering new drugs is still a very expensive and time-consuming process requiring Phases I II and III for clinical trials. Recently machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence AI especially the deep learning techniques which allow a computational model to generate multiple layers have been widely applied and achieved state-of-the-art performance in different fields such as speech recognition image classification bioinformatics etc. One very important application of these AI techniques is in the field of drug discovery.
