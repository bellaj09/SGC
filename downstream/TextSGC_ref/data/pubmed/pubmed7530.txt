Alternative splicing generates multiple isoforms from a single gene greatly increasing the functional diversity of a genome. Although gene functions have been well studied little is known about the specific functions of isoforms making accurate prediction of isoform functions highly desirable. However the existing approaches to predicting isoform functions are far from satisfactory due to at least two reasons: i unlike genes isoform-level functional annotations are scarce. ii The information of isoform functions is concealed in various types of data including isoform sequences co-expression relationship among isoforms etc. DIFFUSE: predicting isoform functions from sequences and expression profiles via deep learning.
