This paper introduces a new signal processing method called Spatio-Temporal Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition ST-MEMD. It is a new variation of Empirical Mode Decomposition EMD that takes spatial and temporal information into account simultaneously rather than processing each signal source in isolation. The original and new methods were tested on single-trial electroencephalogram data with a two-class problem in this case data using the Motor Imagery paradigm in brain-computer interfacing. However whilst ST-MEMD retained the increase in sensitivity and specificity from adding spatial data the new temporal data made no meaningful difference in terms of performance. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition with Spatio-Temporal dynamics to classify single-trial Motor Imagery in BCI.
