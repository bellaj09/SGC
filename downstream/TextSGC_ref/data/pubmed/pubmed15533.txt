Two experiments examined reliance on schematic knowledge in source monitoring. Based on a probability-matching account of source guessing a schema bias will only emerge if participants do not have a representation of the source-item contingency in the study list or if the perceived contingency is consistent with schematic expectations. Thus the account predicts that encoding conditions that affect contingency detection also affect schema bias. In Experiment 1 the schema bias commonly found when schematic information about the sources is not provided before encoding was diminished by an intentional source-memory instruction. In Experiment 2 the depth of processing of schema-consistent and schema-inconsistent source-item pairings was manipulated. Participants consequently overestimated the occurrence of the pairing type they processed in a deep manner and their source guessing reflected this biased contingency perception. Results support the probability-matching account of source guessing. Schema bias in source monitoring varies with encoding conditions: support for a probability-matching account.
