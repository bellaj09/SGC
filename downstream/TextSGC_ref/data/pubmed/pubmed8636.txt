Just like many other topics in computer vision image classification has achieved significant progress recently by using deep learning neural networks especially the Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs. Most of the existing works focused on classifying very clear natural images evidenced by the widely used image databases such as Caltech-256 PASCAL VOCs and ImageNet. However in many real applications the acquired images may contain certain degradations that lead to various kinds of blurring noise and distortions. One important and interesting problem is the effect of such degradations to the performance of CNN-based image classification and whether degradation removal helps CNN-based image classification. More specifically we wonder whether image classification performance drops with each kind of degradation whether this drop can be avoided by including degraded images into training and whether existing computer vision algorithms that attempt to remove such degradations can help improve the image classification performance. In this paper we empirically study those problems for nine kinds of degraded images - hazy images motion-blurred images fish-eye images underwater images low resolution images salt-and-peppered images images with white Gaussian noise Gaussian-blurred images and out-of-focus images. We expect this work can draw more interests from the community to study the classification of degraded images. Effects of Image Degradation and Degradation Removal to CNN-based Image Classification.
