Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The incidence of AF increases with age causing high risks of stroke and increased morbidity and mortality. Efficient and accurate diagnosis of AF based on the ECG is valuable in clinical settings and remains challenging. In this paper we proposed a novel method with high reliability and accuracy for AF detection via deep learning. Detecting atrial fibrillation by deep convolutional neural networks.
