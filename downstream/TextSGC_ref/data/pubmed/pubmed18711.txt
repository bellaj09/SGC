People with intellectual disabilities have poor access to health care which may be further compromised by a lack of accessible health information. To be effective health information must be easily understood and remembered. People with intellectual disabilities learn better from multimodal information sources and virtual reality offers a 3-dimensional 3D computer-generated environment that can be used for providing information and learning. To date research into virtual reality experiences for people with intellectual disabilities has been limited to skill-based training and leisure opportunities within the young to mid age ranges. Using virtual reality to provide health care information to people with intellectual disabilities: acceptability usability and potential utility.
