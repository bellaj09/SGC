"Starting with the excellent collective work done by the European Community EC-funded Virtual Reality Environments for Psycho-Neuro-physiological Assessment and Rehabilitation VREPAR projects I try to indicate some possible pathways that would allow a better integration of this advanced technology into the reality of Latin American psychology. I myself use analyses that I did in my masters degree in the PUCSP-Catholic University in So Paulo Brazil. I also include a brief description of the CD-ROM Clinical Psychology Uses of Virtual Reality CPUVR that accompanies my thesis. I point out the importance of collaboration between psychology and other disciplines including computer science. I explain the method that I used to work with digital information important for the formation of a critical mass of people thinking in Portuguese and Spanish to accelerate a technological jump."
