The aim of this study was to evaluate motor control activity active vs. passive condition with regards to wayfinding and spatial learning difficulties in large-scale spaces for older adults. We compared virtual reality VR-based wayfinding and spatial memory survey and route knowledge performances between 30 younger and 30 older adults. A significant effect of age was obtained on the wayfinding performances but not on the spatial memory performances. Specifically the active condition deteriorated the survey measure in all of the participants and increased the age-related differences in the wayfinding performances. Importantly the age-related differences in the wayfinding performances after an active condition were further mediated by the executive measures. All of the results relative to a detrimental effect of motor activity are discussed in terms of a dual task effect as well as executive decline associated with aging. Age-related wayfinding differences in real large-scale environments: detrimental motor control effects during spatial learning are mediated by executive decline?
