"Virtual reality VR navigation is usually constrained by plausible simulator sickness SS and intuitive user interaction. The paper reports on the use of four different degrees of body motion induced navigational VR controllers a TiltChair omni-directional treadmill a manual wheelchair joystick VRNChair and a joystick in relation to a participants SS occurrence and a controllers intuitive utilization. Twenty young adult participants utilized all controllers to navigate through the same VR task environment in separate sessions. Throughout the sessions SS occurrence was measured from a severity score by a standard SS questionnaire and from body sway by a center of pressure path length with eyes opened and closed. SS occurrence did not significantly differ among the controllers. However time spent in VR significantly contributed to SS occurrence; hence a few breaks to minimize SS should be interjected throughout a VR task. For all task trials we recorded the participants travel trajectories to investigate each controllers intuitive utilization from a computed traversed distance. Shorter traversed distances indicated that participants intuitively utilized the TiltChair with a slower speed; while longer traversed distances indicated participants struggled to utilize the omni-directional treadmill with a unnaturalistic stimulation of gait. Therefore VR navigation should use technologies best suited for the intended age group that minimizes SS and produces intuitive interactions for the participants."
