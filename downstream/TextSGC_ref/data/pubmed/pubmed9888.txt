During the past decade with the significant progress of computational power as well as ever-rising data availability deep learning techniques became increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank PDB has increased more than 15-fold since 1999 which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence however is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents EnzyNet a novel 3D convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined as complementary information. The two-layer architecture was investigated on a large dataset of 63558 enzymes from the PDB and achieved an accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein shape.
