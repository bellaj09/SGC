Carotid intima-media thickness cIMT and carotid plaque CP currently act as risk predictors for CVD/Stroke risk assessment. Over 2000 articles have been published that cover either use cIMT/CP or alterations of cIMT/CP and additional image-based phenotypes to associate cIMT related markers with CVD/Stroke risk. These articles have shown variable results which likely reflect a lack of standardization in the tools for measurement risk stratification and risk assessment. Guidelines for cIMT/CP measurement are influenced by major factors like the atherosclerosis disease itself conventional risk factors 10-year measurement tools types of CVD/Stroke risk calculators incomplete validation of measurement tools and the fast pace of computer technology advancements. This review discusses the following major points: 1 the American Society of Echocardiography and Mannheim guidelines for cIMT/CP measurements; 2 forces that influence the guidelines; and 3 calculators for risk stratification and assessment under the influence of advanced intelligence methods. The review also presents the knowledge-based learning strategies such as machine and deep learning which may play a future role in CVD/stroke risk assessment. We conclude that both machine learning and non-machine learning strategies will flourish for current and 10-year CVD/Stroke risk prediction as long as they integrate image-based phenotypes with conventional risk factors. Global perspective on carotid intima-media thickness and plaque: should the current measurement guidelines be revisited?
