"As the need for sensors increases with the inception of virtual reality augmented reality and mixed reality the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the suitability of the two Kinect devices and the Leap Motion Controller. When evaluating the suitability the authors focus was on the state of the art device comparison accuracy precision existing gesture recognition algorithms and on the price of the devices. The aim of this study is to give an insight whether these devices could substitute more expensive sensors in the industry or on the market. While in general the answer is yes it is not as easy as it seems: There are significant differences between the devices even between the two Kinects such as different measurement ranges error distributions on each axis and changing depth precision relative to distance."
