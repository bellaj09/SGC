Identifying residue-residue contacts in protein-protein interactions or complex is crucial for understanding protein and cell functions. DCA direct-coupling analysis methods shed some light on this but they need many sequence homologs to yield accurate prediction. Inspired by the success of our deep-learning method for intraprotein contact prediction we have developed RaptorX-ComplexContact a web server for interprotein residue-residue contact prediction. Given a pair of interacting protein sequences RaptorX-ComplexContact first searches for their sequence homologs and builds two paired multiple sequence alignments MSA based on genomic distance and phylogeny information respectively. Then RaptorX-ComplexContact uses two deep convolutional residual neural networks ResNet to predict interprotein contacts from sequential features and coevolution information of paired MSAs. RaptorX-ComplexContact shall be useful for protein docking protein-protein interaction prediction and protein interaction network construction.
