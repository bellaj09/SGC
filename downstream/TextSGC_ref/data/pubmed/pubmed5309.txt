"Seizures are events that spread through the brains network of connections and create pathological activity. To understand what is occurring in the brain during seizure we investigated the time progression of the brains state from seizure onset to seizure suppression. Knowledge of a seizures dynamics and the associated spatial structure is important for localizing the seizure foci and determining the optimal location and timing of electrical stimulation to mitigate seizure development. In this study we analyzed intracranial EEG data recorded in 2 human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery using network analyses. Specifically we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from iEEG intracranial electroencephalography recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in the band of frequencies with the strongest modulation during seizure. The connectivity matrices structure was analyzed using an eigen-decomposition. The leading eigenvector was used to estimate each electrodes time dependent centrality importance to the networks connectivity. The electrode centralities were clustered over the course of each seizure and the cluster centroids were compared across seizures. We found for each patient there was a consistent set of centroids that occurred during each seizure. Further the brain reliably evolved through the same progression of states across multiple seizures including characteristic onset and suppression states."
