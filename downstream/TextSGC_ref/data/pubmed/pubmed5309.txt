The neuroscience research landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. Specifically an impressive array of new tools and technologies have been generated including but not limited to: brain gene expression atlases genetically encoded proteins to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity and new methods for imaging and mapping circuits. However despite these technological advances several significant challenges must be overcome to enable a better understanding of brain function and to develop cell type-targeted therapeutics to treat brain disorders. This review provides an overview of some of the tools and technologies currently being used to advance the field of molecular neuroanatomy and also discusses emerging technologies that may enable neuroscientists to address these crucial scientific challenges over the coming decade. Molecular neuroanatomy: a generation of progress.
