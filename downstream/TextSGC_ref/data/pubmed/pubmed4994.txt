Prefrontal cortical areas mediate flexible adaptive control of behavior but the specific contributions of individual areas and the circuit mechanisms through which they interact to modulate learning have remained poorly understood. Using viral tracing and pharmacogenetic techniques we show that prelimbic PreL and infralimbic cortex IL exhibit reciprocal PreLIL layer 5/6 connectivity. In set-shifting tasks and in fear/extinction learning activity in PreL is required during new learning to apply previously learned associations whereas activity in IL is required to learn associations alternative to previous ones. ILPreL connectivity is specifically required during IL-dependent learning whereas reciprocal PreLIL connectivity is required during a time window of 12-14\u2009h after association learning to set up the role of IL in subsequent learning. Our results define specific and opposing roles of PreL and IL to together flexibly support new learning and provide circuit evidence that IL-mediated learning of alternative associations depends on direct reciprocal PreLIL connectivity. Infralimbic cortex is required for learning alternatives to prelimbic promoted associations through reciprocal connectivity.
