"Human memory is thought to depend on a circuit of connected brain regions but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We derive a human memory circuit using 53 case reports of strokes causing amnesia and a map of the human connectome n\u2009=\u20091000. This circuit is reproducible across discovery n\u2009=\u200927 and replication n\u2009=\u200926 cohorts and specific to lesions causing amnesia. Its hub is at the junction of the presubiculum and retrosplenial cortex. Connectivity with this single location defines a human brain circuit that incorporates\u2009>\u200995% of lesions causing amnesia. Lesion intersection with this circuit predicts memory scores in two independent datasets N1\u2009=\u200997 N2\u2009=\u2009176. This network aligns with neuroimaging correlates of episodic memory abnormalities in Alzheimers disease and brain stimulation sites reported to enhance memory in humans."
