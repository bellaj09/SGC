Obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD is characterized by the presence of distressing recurrent and intrusive thoughts impulses or doubts as well as behavioral or mental rituals. OCD has various subtypes including the fear of contamination in which individuals fear bacteria germs disease or bodily secretions and engage in clinically significant cleaning and avoidance rituals. Cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT is an effective treatment for OCD and involves among other therapeutic strategies exposing patients to feared stimuli while preventing them to engage in compulsive behaviors. In recent years virtual reality VR has shown the potential of in virtuo exposure with people suffering from anxiety disorders and OCD. The objective of this pilot study is to examine the effectiveness of a CBT program where exposure in conducted in virtuo. Three adults suffering from OCD with a dominant subtype of contamination were enrolled in a single-case design with multiple baselines across participants. The presence and intensity of obsessions and compulsions were assessed daily during baselines of 3- 4- or 5-week and a 12-session treatment. Follow-up information was gathered after 4 and 8\u2009months. Treatment outcome is assessed with visual inspection of the graphs and ARMA time-series analyses. Clinical information self-reports and details of the treatment are provided for each patient. Statistical analyses for the time-series data revealed a statistically significant improvement in all three participants but global improvement is considered positive for only two. This study innovates in proving preliminary support for the usefulness of VR in the CBT of OCD with contamination features.
