The present study adopted a human-centred approach to explore the potential of audio-video Virtual Reality VR to evaluate indoor noise protection by building characteristics. Different background speech conditions convolved with sound insulation filters of adjacent office rooms were presented in a VR office environment and the effects on cognitive performances and subjective ratings were measured. The found effect patterns were the same as those obtained in a real laboratory setting reported by Schlittmeier Hellbrck Thaden and Vorlnder. 2008. Ergonomics 51 719-736. This exemplary study promises various options for research on noise effects by the use of virtual built environments which are of high plausibility and unlimited variability.
