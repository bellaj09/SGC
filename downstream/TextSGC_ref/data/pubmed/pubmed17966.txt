Redirected Touching is a technique in which virtual space is warped to map many virtual objects onto one real object that serves as a passive haptic prop. Recent work suggests that this mapping can often be predictably unnoticeable and have little effect on task performance. We investigated training and adaptation on a rapid aiming task in a real environment an unwarped virtual environment and a warped virtual environment. Participants who experienced a warped virtual space reported an initial strange sensation but adapted to the warped space after short repeated exposure. Our data indicate that all the virtual training was less effective than real-world training but after adaptation participants trained as well in a warped virtual space as in an unwarped one.
