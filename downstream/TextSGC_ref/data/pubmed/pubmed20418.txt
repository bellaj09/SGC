"Chronic pain such as low-back pain can be a highly disabling condition degrading peoples quality of life QoL. Not every patient responds to pharmacological therapies thus alternative treatments have to be developed. The chronicity of pain can lead to a somatic dysperception meaning a mismatch between patients own body perception and its actual physical state. Since clinical evaluation of pain relies on patients subjective reports a body image disruption can be associated with an incorrect pain rating inducing incorrect treatment and a possible risk of drug abuse. Our aim was to reduce chronic low-back pain through a multimodal neurorehabilitative strategy using innovative technologies to help patients regain a correct body image."
