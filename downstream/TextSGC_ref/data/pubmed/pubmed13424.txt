Feature selection has aroused considerable research interests during the last few decades. Traditional learning-based feature selection methods separate embedding learning and feature ranking. In this paper we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework termed as the joint embedding learning and sparse regression JELSR in which the embedding learning and sparse regression are jointly performed. Specifically the proposed JELSR joins embedding learning with sparse regression to perform feature selection. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework we also provide a method using the weight via local linear approximation and adding the l21 -norm regularization and design an effective algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Furthermore we also conduct some insightful discussion on the proposed feature selection approach including the convergence analysis computational complexity and parameter determination. In all the proposed framework not only provides a new perspective to view traditional methods but also evokes some other deep researches for feature selection. Compared with traditional unsupervised feature selection methods our approach could integrate the merits of embedding learning and sparse regression. Promising experimental results on different kinds of data sets including image voice data and biological data have validated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
