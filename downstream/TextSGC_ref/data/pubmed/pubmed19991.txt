"The ultrasound machine was originally devised as a diagnostic tool to help evaluate heart structure and function. With recent advances in ultrasound including live 3D ultrasound its potential to guide interventions within the heart has increasingly been recognized. Cardiologists have adapted this technology and have now published guidelines on the use of ultrasound to guide interventional procedures. Anesthesiologists have also used ultrasound with much success in cardiac operating rooms ORs to guide cannula placement and to a limited extent interventions. The focus of this article is a review of the authors work on ultrasound and virtual reality-guided cardiac interventions both in the research laboratory and in the OR." The use of ultrasound to guide interventions: from bench to bedside and back again.
