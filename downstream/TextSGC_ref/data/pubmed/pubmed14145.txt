Postdevelopmental neurogenesis occurs in the olfactory bulb OB to which new interneurons are continuously recruited. However only a subset of the adult-generated interneurons survives as many undergo programmed cell death. As part of homeostatic processes the removal of new neurons is required alongside the addition of new ones to ensure a stable neuron number. In addition to a critical role in tissue maintenance it is still unclear whether this neuronal elimination affects the functioning of adult circuits. Using focal drug delivery restricted to the OB we investigated the significance of programmed cell death in the adult OB circuits. Cell death was effectively blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-AspOMe-fluoromethylketone zVAD. The zVAD effect differed with newborn interneuron location either in the superficial periglomerular cells or in the deep granule cells OB layers. Furthermore whereas sensory experience potentiated the effect of zVAD on the survival of new granule cells it had no additional effect on the survival of new periglomerular cells. Thus distinct mechanisms control the survival/elimination decision of newborn interneuron subtypes. However zVAD had no effect on the olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the bulb. Remarkably psychophysical analyzes revealed that a normal rate of new neuron elimination was essential for optimal odorant exploration and discrimination. This study highlights the importance of cell elimination for adjusting olfactory performance. We conclude that adult-generated OB interneurons are continually turned over rather than simply added and the precise balance between new and mature interneurons set through active selection/elimination processes is essential for optimizing olfaction. Turnover of newborn olfactory bulb neurons optimizes olfaction.
