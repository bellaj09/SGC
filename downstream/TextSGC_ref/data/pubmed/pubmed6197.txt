Understanding the organizational architecture of human brain function and its alteration patterns in diseased brains such as Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD patients are of great interests. In-vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI offers a unique window to investigate the mechanism of brain function and to identify functional network components of the human brain. Previously we have shown that multiple concurrent functional networks can be derived from fMRI signals using whole-brain sparse representation. Yet it is still an open question to derive group-wise consistent networks featured in ASD patients and controls. Here we proposed an effective volumetric network descriptor named connectivity map to compactly describe spatial patterns of brain network maps and implemented a fast framework in Apache Spark environment that can effectively identify group-wise consistent networks in big fMRI dataset. Our experiment results identified 144 group-wisely common intrinsic connectivity networks ICNs shared between ASD patients and healthy control subjects where some ICNs are substantially different between the two groups. Moreover further analysis on the functional connectivity and spatial overlap between these 144 common ICNs reveals connectomics signatures characterizing ASD patients and controls. In particular the computing time of our Spark-enabled functional connectomics framework is significantly reduced from 240\xa0hours C\xa0++ code single core to 20\xa0hours exhibiting a great potential to handle fMRI big data in the future.
