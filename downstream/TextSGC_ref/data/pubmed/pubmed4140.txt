Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD has frequently been associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity and decreased white matter WM integrity. In the current study we investigated functional connectivity within Default Mode and frontal control resting-state networks RSNs in children with and without ADHD. We hypothesized the RSNs of interest would show a pattern of impaired functional integration and segregation and corresponding changes in WM structure. Structural and functional connectivity in children and adolescents with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
