It is significant to identify rock-mineral microscopic images in geological engineering. The task of microscopic mineral image identification which is often conducted in the lab is tedious and time-consuming. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks CNNs provide a method to analyze mineral microscopic images efficiently and smartly. In this research the transfer learning model of mineral microscopic images is established based on Inception-v3 architecture. The four mineral image features including K-feldspar Kf perthite Pe plagioclase Pl and quartz Qz or Q are extracted using Inception-v3. Based on the features the machine learning methods logistic regression LR support vector machine SVM random forest RF k-nearest neighbors KNN multilayer perceptron MLP and gaussian naive Bayes GNB are adopted to establish the identification models. The results are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. LR SVM and MLP have a significant performance among all the models with accuracy of about 90.0%. The evaluation result shows LR SVM and MLP are the outstanding single models in high-dimensional feature analysis. The three models are also selected as the base models in model stacking. The LR model is also set as the meta classifier in the final prediction. The stacking model can achieve 90.9% accuracy which is higher than all the single models. The result also shows that model stacking effectively improves model performance. Intelligent Identification for Rock-Mineral Microscopic Images Using Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms.
