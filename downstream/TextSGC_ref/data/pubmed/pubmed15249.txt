"The concept of augmenting error in interactive reaching training has shown promise but the possibility of doing this robot-free with only visual feedback has not been tested. Here we present very early results from a visual distortion environment that shifts the subjects cursor in the direction of instantaneous error as if it is being pushed by a robot. This clinical test asked chronic stroke survivors to visit the laboratory three times a week for three weeks as they practiced a bimanual virtual reality task for approximately 40 minutes. Results show that both treatment and control patients improved from the practice Fugyl Meyer average increase of 4.2 and a slight advantage is seen at this point in the treatment group. These vision-only results may prove compelling because removing the robot reduces expenses intimidation complexity confounding effects and failure modes."
