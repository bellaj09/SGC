New electroencephalography EEG devices more portable and cheaper are appearing on the market. Studying the reliability of these EEG devices for emotional studies would be interesting as these devices could be more economical and compatible with Virtual Reality VR settings. Therefore the aim in this work was to validate a low-cost EEG device Emotiv Epoc to monitor brain activity during a positive emotional induction procedure. Emotional pictures IAPS were used to induce a positive mood in sixteen participants. Changes in the brain activity of subjects were compared between positive induction and neutral conditions. Obtained results were in accordance with previous scientific literature regarding frontal EEG asymmetry which supports the possibility of using this low-cost EEG device in future mood induction studies combined with VR. Validation of a low-cost EEG device for mood induction studies.
