Artificial intelligence is upending many of our assumptions about the ability of computers to detect and diagnose diseases on medical images. Deep learning a recent innovation in artificial intelligence has shown the ability to interpret medical images with sensitivities and specificities at or near that of skilled clinicians for some applications. In this review we summarize the history of artificial intelligence present some recent research advances and speculate about the potential revolutionary clinical impact of the latest computer techniques for bone and muscle imaging.  2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
