A virtual-reality surgical simulator aimed at neurosurgery is presented. The simulator utilises boundary element BE technology to develop real-time realistic deformable models of the brain. The simulator incorporates the simulation of surgical prodding pulling and cutting. Advanced features include the separation the cut surfaces by retractors and post-cutting deformations. The experience of virtual surgery is enhanced by implementing 3D stereo-vision and the use of two hand-held force-feedback devices.
