The subject of this paper is a highly interactive medical training system for arthroscopic surgery; this is based on computer graphics and virtual reality VR techniques and offers an alternative to conventional training methods. To provide the virtual environment a realistic 3D representation of the knee joint is derived from 2D medical image data. The use of tracking techniques guarantees an intuitive handling of the surgical instruments. The system allows navigation via a virtual camera and interaction with the virtual anatomical structures. First approaches for the simulation of tissue deformation caused by collisions with the instruments are implemented. One important advantage over conventional training systems is the possibility of verifying the training progress. Work is in progress on the realization of tactile feedback with the aim of providing a higher degree of interactive realism. VRATS--Virtual Reality Arthroscopy Training Simulator.
