Noise commonly encountered on computed tomography CT images can impact diagnostic accuracy. To reduce the image noise we developed a deep-learning reconstruction DLR method that integrates deep convolutional neural networks into image reconstruction. In this phantom study we compared the image noise characteristics spatial resolution and task-based detectability on DLR images and images reconstructed with other state-of-the art techniques.
