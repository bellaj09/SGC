Much attention has been given to automatic sleep staging algorithms in past years but the detection of discrete events in sleep studies is also crucial for precise characterization of sleep patterns and possible diagnosis of sleep disorders. We propose here a deep learning model for automatic detection and annotation of arousals and leg movements. Both of these are commonly seen during normal sleep while an excessive amount of either is linked to disrupted sleep patterns excessive daytime sleepiness impacting quality of life and various sleep disorders. Our model was trained on 1485 subjects and tested on 1000 separate recordings of sleep. We tested two different experimental setups and found optimal arousal detection was attained by including a recurrent neural network module in our default model with a dynamic default event window F1 = 0.75 while optimal leg movement detection was attained using a static event window F1 = 0.65. Our work show promise while still allowing for improvements. Specifically future research will explore the proposed model as a general-purpose sleep analysis model.
