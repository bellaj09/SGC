The human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2 is a commonly used in-vitro test that predicts the absorption potential of orally administered drugs. In-silico prediction methods based on the Caco-2 assay data may increase the effectiveness of the high-throughput screening of new drug candidates. However previously developed in-silico models that predict the Caco-2 cellular permeability of chemical compounds use handcrafted features that may be dataset-specific and induce over-fitting problems. Deep Neural Network DNN generates high-level features based on non-linear transformations for raw features which provides high discriminant power and therefore creates a good generalized model. We present a DNN-based binary Caco-2 permeability classifier. Our model was constructed based on 663 chemical compounds with in-vitro Caco-2 apparent permeability data. Two hundred nine molecular descriptors are used for generating the high-level features during DNN model generation. Dropout regularization is applied to solve the over-fitting problem and the non-linear activation. The Rectified Linear Unit ReLU is adopted to reduce the vanishing gradient problem. The results demonstrate that the high-level features generated by the DNN are more robust than handcrafted features for predicting the cellular permeability of structurally diverse chemical compounds in Caco-2 cell lines.
