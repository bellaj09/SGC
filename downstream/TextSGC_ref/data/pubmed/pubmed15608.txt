Objective: Sleep is a natural activity of humans that affects physical and mental health; therefore sleep disturbance may lead to fatigue and lower productivity. This study examined 1 million samples included in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database NHIRD in order to predict sleep disorder in an asthma cohort from 2002-2010.Methods: The disease histories of the asthma patients were transferred to sequences and matrices for the prediction of sleep disorder by applying machine learning ML algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors KNN Support Vector Machine SVM and Random Forest RF and deep learning DL models including Recurrent Neural Network RNN Long Short-Term Memory LSTM Gated Recurrent Units GRU and Convolution Neural Network CNN.Results: Among 14818 new asthma subjects in 2002 there were 4469 sleep disorder subjects from 2002 to 2010. The KNN SVM and RF algorithms were demonstrated to be successful sleep disorder prediction models with accuracies of 0.798 0.793 and 0.813 respectively AUC: 0.737 0.690 and 0.719 respectively. The results of the DL models showed the accuracies of the RNN LSTM GRU and CNN to be 0.744 0.815 0.782 and 0.951 respectively AUC: 0.658 0.750 0.732 and 0.934 respectively.Conclusions: The results showed that the CNN model had the best performance for sleep disorder prediction in the asthma cohort. Deep learning approaches for sleep disorder prediction in an asthma cohort.
