Shape completion is an important task in the field of image processing. An alternative method is to capture the shape information and finish the completion by a generative model such as Deep Boltzmann Machine. With its powerful ability to deal with the distribution of the shapes it is quite easy to acquire the result by sampling from the model. In this paper we make use of the hidden activation of the DBM and incorporate it with the convolutional shape features to fit a regression model. We compare the output of the regression model with the incomplete shape feature in order to set a proper and compact mask for sampling from the DBM. The experiment shows that our method can obtain realistic results without any prior information about the incomplete object shape. Shape Completion Using Deep Boltzmann Machine.
