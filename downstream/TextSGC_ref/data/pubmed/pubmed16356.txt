This paper proposes a convolutional neural network CNN-based method that learns traffic as images and predicts large-scale network-wide traffic speed with a high accuracy. Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are converted to images describing the time and space relations of traffic flow via a two-dimensional time-space matrix. A CNN is applied to the image following two consecutive steps: abstract traffic feature extraction and network-wide traffic speed prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by taking two real-world transportation networks the second ring road and north-east transportation network in Beijing as examples and comparing the method with four prevailing algorithms namely ordinary least squares k-nearest neighbors artificial neural network and random forest and three deep learning architectures namely stacked autoencoder recurrent neural network and long-short-term memory network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms by an average accuracy improvement of 42.91% within an acceptable execution time. The CNN can train the model in a reasonable time and thus is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.
