"Sensorimotor rhythms SMRs are 8-30 Hz oscillations in the electroencephalogram EEG recorded from the scalp over sensorimotor cortex that change with movement and/or movement imagery. Many brain-computer interface BCI studies have shown that people can learn to control SMR amplitudes and can use that control to move cursors and other objects in one two or three dimensions. At the same time if SMR-based BCIs are to be useful for people with neuromuscular disabilities their accuracy and reliability must be improved substantially. These BCIs often use spatial filtering methods such as common average reference CAR Laplacian LAP filter or common spatial pattern CSP filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG. Here we test the hypothesis that a new filter design called an adaptive Laplacian ALAP filter can provide better performance for SMR-based BCIs."
