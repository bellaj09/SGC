Since the discovery of the giant magnetoresistive GMR effect GMR sensors have gained much attention in last decades due to their high sensitivity small size and low cost. The full Wheatstone-bridge-based GMR sensor is most useful in terms of the application point of view. However its manufacturing process is usually complex. In this paper we present an efficient and concise approach to fabricate a full Wheatstone-bridge-based angular GMR sensor by depositing one GMR film stack utilizing simple patterned processes and a concise post-annealing procedure based on a special layout. The angular GMR sensor is of good linear performance and achieves a sensitivity of 0.112 mV/V/Oe at the annealing temperature of 260 C in the magnetic field range from -50 to +50 Oe. This work provides a design and method for GMR-sensor manufacturing that is easy for implementation and suitable for mass production.
