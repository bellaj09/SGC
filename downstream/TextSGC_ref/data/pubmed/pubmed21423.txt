"In this paper we present a vehicle active safety model for vehicle speed control based on driver vigilance detection using low-cost comfortable wearable electroencephalographic EEG sensors and sparse representation. The proposed system consists of three main steps namely wireless wearable EEG collection driver vigilance detection and vehicle speed control strategy. First of all a homemade low-cost comfortable wearable brain-computer interface BCI system with eight channels is designed for collecting the drivers EEG signal. Second wavelet de-noising and down-sample algorithms are utilized to enhance the quality of EEG data and Fast Fourier Transformation FFT is adopted to extract the EEG power spectrum density PSD. In this step sparse representation classification combined with k-singular value decomposition KSVD is firstly introduced in PSD to estimate the drivers vigilance level. Finally a novel safety strategy of vehicle speed control which controls the electronic throttle opening and automatic braking after driver fatigue detection using the above method is presented to avoid serious collisions and traffic accidents. The simulation and practical testing results demonstrate the feasibility of the vehicle active safety model."
