To improve the fault diagnosis performance for rotating machinery an efficient noise-resistant end-to-end deep learning DL algorithm is proposed based on the advantages of the wavelet packet transform in vibration signal processing the capability to extract multiscale information and more spectral distribution features and deep convolutional neural networks good classification performance data-driven design and high transfer-learning ability. First a vibration signal is subjected to pyramid wavelet packet decomposition and each sub-band coefficient is used as the input for each channel of a deep convolutional network DCN. Then based on the lightweight modeling requirements and techniques a new DCN structure is designed for the fault diagnosis. The proposed algorithm is compared with the support vector machine algorithm and the published DL algorithms based on a bearing dataset produced by Case Western Reserve University. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing algorithms in terms of accuracy memory space computational complexity noise resistance and transfer performance producing good results.
