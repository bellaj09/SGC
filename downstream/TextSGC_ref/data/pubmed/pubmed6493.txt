Diffusion tensor imaging DTI is a powerful MRI technique that can be used to estimate both the microstructural integrity and the trajectories of white matter pathways throughout the central nervous system. This fiber tracking aka "tractography" approach is often carried out using anatomically-defined seed points to identify white matter tracts that pass through one or more structures but can also be performed using functionally-defined regions of interest ROIs that have been determined using functional MRI fMRI or other methods. In this study we performed fMRI-guided DTI tractography between all of the previously defined nodes within each of six common resting-state brain networks including the: dorsal Default Mode Network dDMN ventral Default Mode Network vDMN left Executive Control Network lECN right Executive Control Network rECN anterior Salience Network aSN and posterior Salience Network pSN. By normalizing the data from 32 healthy control subjects to a standard template-using high-dimensional non-linear warping methods-we were able to create probabilistic white matter atlases for each tract in stereotaxic coordinates. By investigating all 198 ROI-to-ROI combinations within the aforementioned resting-state networks for a total of 6336 independent DTI tractography analyses the resulting probabilistic atlases represent a comprehensive cohort of functionally-defined white matter regions that can be used in future brain imaging studies to: 1 ascribe DTI or other white matter changes to particular functional brain networks and 2 compliment resting state fMRI or other functional connectivity analyses.
