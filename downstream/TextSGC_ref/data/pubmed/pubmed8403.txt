"Visual saliency models have recently begun to incorporate deep learning to achieve predictive capacity much greater than previous unsupervised methods. However most existing models predict saliency without explicit knowledge of global scene semantic information. We propose a model MxSalNet that incorporates global scene semantic information in addition to local information gathered by a convolutional neural network. Our model is formulated as a mixture of experts. Each expert network is trained to predict saliency for a set of closely related images. The final saliency map is computed as a weighted mixture of the expert networks output with weights determined by a separate gating network. This gating network is guided by global scene information to predict weights. The expert networks and the gating network are trained simultaneously in an end-toend manner. We show that our mixture formulation leads to improvement in performance over an otherwise identical nonmixture model that does not incorporate global scene information. Additionally we show that our model achieves better performance than several other visual saliency models." Visual Saliency Prediction Using a Mixture of Deep Neural Networks.
