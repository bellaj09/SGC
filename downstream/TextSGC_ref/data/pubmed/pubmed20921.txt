"Burn patients often suffer excruciating pain during clinical procedures even with analgesia. Virtual Reality VR as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy has proved promising in the management of burn pain. More evidence is needed regarding specific forms of VR. This mixed-method study examined the impact of active and passive VR scenarios in experimental conditions gathering data relating to user experience acceptability and effectiveness in managing pain. Four scenarios were developed or selected following a consultative workshop with burn survivors and clinicians. Each was trialed using a cold pressor test with 15 University students. Data were gathered regarding pain threshold and tolerance at baseline and during each exposure. Short interviews were conducted afterwards. The two active scenarios were ranked highest and significantly extended participants pain threshold and tolerance times compared to passive and baseline conditions. Passive scenarios offered little distraction and relief from pain. Active scenarios were perceived to be engaging challenging distracting and immersive. They reduced subjective awareness of pain though suggestions were made for further improvements. Results suggested that active VR was acceptable and enjoyable as a means of helping to control experimental pain. Following suggested improvements scenarios should now be tested in the clinical environment."
