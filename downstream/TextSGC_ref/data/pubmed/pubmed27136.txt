"State of the art brain-computer interface BCI research focuses on improving individual components such as the application or the decoder that converts the users brain activity to control signals. In this study we investigate the interaction between these components in the P300 speller a BCI for communication. We introduce a synergistic approach in which the stimulus presentation sequence is modified to enhance the machine learning decoding. In this way we aim for an improved overall BCI performance." Towards a symbiotic brain-computer interface: exploring the application-decoder interaction.
