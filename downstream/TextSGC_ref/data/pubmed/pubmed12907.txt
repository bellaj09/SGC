Abstract Background: For health-care professionals particularly nurses the need to work productively and efficiently in small groups is a crucial skill required to meet the challenges of the contemporary health-care environment. Small group work is an educational technique that is used extensively in nurse education. The advantage of group work includes facilitation of deep active and collaborative learning. However small group work can be problematic and present challenges for students. Many of the challenges occur because group work necessitates the coming together of collections of individuals each with their own personalities and sets of experiences.
