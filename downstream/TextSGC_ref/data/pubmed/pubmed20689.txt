"A wearable electroencephalogram EEG is a small mobile device used for long-term brain monitoring systems. Applications of these systems include fatigue monitoring mental/emotional monitoring and brain-computer interfaces. However the usage of wireless wearable EEG systems is limited due to the risks posed by the wireless RF communication radiation in a long-term exposure to the human brain. A novel microwave radiation-free system was developed by integrating visible light communication technology into a wearable EEG device. In this work we investigated the systems performance in transmitting EEG data at different illuminance level and proposed an algorithm that functions at low illuminance levels for increased transmission distance. Using a 30 Hz smartphone camera the proposed system was able to transmit 2.4 kbps of error-free EEG data up to 4 meter which is equal to ~300 lux using an aspheric focus lens."
