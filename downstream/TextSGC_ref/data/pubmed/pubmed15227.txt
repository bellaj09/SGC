Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging DCE-MRI plays an important role in diagnosis and grading of brain tumors. Although manual DCE biomarker extraction algorithms boost the diagnostic yield of DCE-MRI by providing quantitative information on tumor prognosis and prediction they are time-consuming and prone to human errors. In this paper we propose a fully-automated end-to-end system for DCE-MRI analysis of brain tumors. Our deep learning-powered technique does not require any user interaction it yields reproducible results and it is rigorously validated against benchmark and clinical data. Also we introduce a cubic model of the vascular input function used for pharmacokinetic modeling which significantly decreases the fitting error when compared with the state of the art alongside a real-time algorithm for determination of the vascular input region. An extensive experimental study backed up with statistical tests showed that our system delivers state-of-the-art results while requiring less than 3\u202fmin to process an entire input DCE-MRI study using a single GPU.
