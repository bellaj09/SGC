"We combined virtual reality and multisensory bodily illusion with the aim to characterize and reduce the perceptual body overestimation and the cognitive-emotional body dissatisfaction components of body image distortion BID in anorexia nervosa AN. For each participant 20 anorexics 20 healthy controls we built personalized avatars that reproduced their own body size shape and verisimilar increases and losses of their original weight. Body overestimation and dissatisfaction were measured by asking participants to choose the avatar that best resembled their real and ideal body. Results show higher body dissatisfaction in AN caused by the desire of a thinner body and no body-size overestimation. Interpersonal multisensory stimulation IMS was then applied on the avatar reproducing participants perceived body and on the two avatars which reproduced increases and losses of 15% of it all presented with a first-person perspective 1PP. Embodiment was stronger after synchronous IMS in both groups but did not reduce BID in participants with AN. Interestingly anorexics reported more negative emotions after embodying the fattest avatar which scaled with symptoms severity. Overall our findings suggest that the cognitive-emotional more than the perceptual component of BID is severely altered in AN and that perspective 1PP vs. 3PP from which a body is evaluated may play a crucial role. Future research and clinical trials might take advantage of virtual reality to reduce the emotional distress related to body dissatisfaction."
