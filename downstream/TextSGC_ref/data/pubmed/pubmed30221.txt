"The cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors. However recent work supports the view that it also influences non-motor behaviors. The contribution of the cerebellum towards different brain functions is underscored by its involvement in a diverse and increasing number of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions including ataxia dystonia essential tremor Parkinsons disease PD epilepsy stroke multiple sclerosis autism spectrum disorders dyslexia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and schizophrenia. Although there are no cures for these conditions cerebellar stimulation is quickly gaining attention for symptomatic alleviation as cerebellar circuitry has arisen as a promising target for invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation. This consensus paper brings together experts from the fields of neurophysiology neurology and neurosurgery to discuss recent efforts in using the cerebellum as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most advanced techniques for manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans and animal models and define key hurdles and questions for moving forward."
