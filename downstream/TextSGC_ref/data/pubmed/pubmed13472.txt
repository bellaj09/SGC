Recently the demand for human activity recognition has become more and more urgent. It is widely used in indoor positioning medical monitoring safe driving etc. Existing activity recognition approaches require either the location information of the sensors or the specific domain knowledge which are expensive intrusive and inconvenient for pervasive implementation. In this paper a human activity recognition algorithm based on SDAE Stacking Denoising Autoencoder and LightGBM LGB is proposed. The SDAE is adopted to sanitize the noise in raw sensor data and extract the most effective characteristic expression with unsupervised learning. The LGB reveals the inherent feature dependencies among categories for accurate human activity recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets of distinct sensor combinations collected by different devices in three typical application scenarios which are human moving modes current static and dynamic behaviors of users. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 95.99% outperforming other comparative algorithms using XGBoost CNN Convolutional Neural Network CNN + Statistical features or single SDAE.
