Deep learning DL-based super-resolution SR reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging MRI has recently been receiving attention due to the significant improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional SR techniques. Challenges hindering the widespread implementation of these approaches remain however. Low-resolution LR MRIs captured in the clinic exhibit complex tissue structures obfuscated by noise that are difficult for a simple DL framework to handle. Moreover training a robust network for a SR task requires abundant perfectly matched pairs of LR and high-resolution HR images that are often unavailable or difficult to collect. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel SR technique for MRI based on the concept of cascaded DL that allows for the reconstruction of high-quality SR images in the presence of insufficient training data an unknown translation model and noise. MRI super-resolution reconstruction for MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy using cascaded deep learning: In the presence of limited training data and unknown translation model.
