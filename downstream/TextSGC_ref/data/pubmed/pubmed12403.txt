"Assessing the viability of a blastosyst is still empirical and non-reproducible nowadays. We developed an algorithm based on artificial vision and machine learning and other classifiers that predicts pregnancy using the beta human chorionic gonadotropin b-hCG test from both the morphology of an embryo and the age of the patients. We employed two high-quality databases with known pregnancy outcomes n\xa0=\xa0221. We created a system consisting of different classifiers that is feed with novel morphometric features extracted from the digital micrographs along with other non-morphometric data to predict pregnancy. It was evaluated using five different classifiers: probabilistic bayesian Support Vector Machines SVM deep neural network decision tree and Random Forest RF using a k-fold cross validation to assess the models generalization capabilities. In the database A the SVM classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.74 and AUC of 0.77. In the database B the RF classifier obtained a F1 score of 0.71 and AUC of 0.75. Our results suggest that the system is able to predict a positive pregnancy test from a single digital image offering a novel approach with the advantages of using a small database being highly adaptable to different laboratory settings and easy integration into clinical practice."
