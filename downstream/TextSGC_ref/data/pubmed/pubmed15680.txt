This paper reviews the move from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy ARET. Unlike virtual reality VR which entails a complete virtual environment VE augmented reality AR limits itself to producing certain virtual elements to then merge them into the view of the physical world. Although the general public may only have become aware of AR in the last few years AR type applications have been around since beginning of the twentieth century. Since then technological developments have enabled an ever increasing level of seamless integration of virtual and physical elements into one view. Like VR AR allows the exposure to stimuli which due to various reasons may not be suitable for real-life scenarios. As such AR has proven itself to be a medium through which individuals suffering from specific phobia can be exposed "safely" to the objects of their fear without the costs associated with programing complete VEs. Thus ARET can offer an efficacious alternative to some less advantageous exposure-based therapies. Above and beyond presenting what has been accomplished in ARET this paper covers some less well-known aspects of the history of AR raises some ARET related issues and proposes potential avenues to be followed. These include the type of measures to be used to qualify the user\s experience in an augmented reality environment the exclusion of certain AR-type functionalities from the definition of AR as well as the potential use of ARET to treat non-small animal phobias such as social phobia. Moving from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy: a review.
