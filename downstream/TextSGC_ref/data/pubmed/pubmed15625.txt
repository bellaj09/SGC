This research assesses the effectiveness usability and acceptability of mannequin and haptic-enabled virtual reality VR modality simulators by Army medics in a surgical cricothyroidotomy procedure. Research methods investigate through experimentation surgical task performance technology acceptance user recommendation comparative analysis and select cognitive task load results. Results indicate that the HapMed mannequin and CricSim VR simulators proved effective by meeting training task performance evaluation requirements. Both systems meet 95% user technology acceptance and 85% user recommendation levels. In conclusion at those levels either system may complement reduce or replace the use of some alternative training methods such as animals or cadavers. To raise recommendation rates future research needs to reduce barriers to blending visualization with mannequin modalities and make further refinements within the modalities. One research pathway identified blends a mannequin with stereoscopic visualization and motion parallax providing correlated partially transparent visual layers of anatomy and of various medical procedures in virtual overlay with the mannequin. Future research also needs to clarify acceptable degrees of freedom levels by task for haptics VR in light of real-world degrees of freedom requirements. Finally artificial skin may need research to achieve better replication of human skin on mannequins.
