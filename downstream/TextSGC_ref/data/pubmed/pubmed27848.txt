Near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS is a non-invasive optical technique that can be used to assess functional activity in the human brain. This work describes the set-up of a one-channel NIRS system designed for use as an optical brain-computer interface BCI and reports on first measurements of deoxyhemoglobin Hb and oxyhemoglobin HbO2 changes during mental arithmetic tasks. We found relatively stable and reproducible hemodynamic responses in a group of 13 healthy subjects. Unexpected observations of a decrease in HbO2 and increase in Hb concentrations measured over the prefrontal cortex were in contrast to the typical hemodynamic responses increase in HbO2 decrease in Hb during cortical activation previously reported. Development set-up and first results for a one-channel near-infrared spectroscopy system.
