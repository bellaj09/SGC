"Whether and how the apolipoprotein E APOE 4 genotype specifically modulates brain network connectivity in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI remain largely unknown. Here we employed resting-state task-free functional MRI and network centrality approaches to investigate local degree centrality DC and global eigenvector centrality EC functional integrity in the whole-brain connectome in 156 older adults including 66 aMCI patients 27 4-carriers and 39 non-carriers and 90 healthy controls 45 4-carriers and 45 non-carriers. We observed diagnosis-by-genotype interactions on DC in the left superior/middle frontal gyrus right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum with higher values in the 4-carriers than non-carriers in the aMCI group. We further observed diagnosis-by-genotype interactions on EC with higher values in the right middle temporal gyrus but lower values in the medial parts of default-mode network in the 4-carriers than non-carriers in the aMCI group. Notably these genotype differences in DC or EC were absent in the control group. Finally the network connectivity DC values were negatively correlated with cognitive performance in the aMCI 4-carriers. Our findings suggest that the APOE genotype selectively modulates the functional integration of brain networks in patients with aMCI thus providing important insight into the gene-connectome interaction in this disease."
