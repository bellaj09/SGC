The present study aimed to explore the association between resting-state functional connectivity and creativity ability. Toward this end the figural Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking TTCT scores were collected from 180 participants. Based on the figural TTCT measures we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data for participants with two different levels of creativity ability a high-creativity group HG n\u2009=\u200922 and a low-creativity group LG n\u2009=\u200920. For the aspect of group difference this study combined voxel-wise functional connectivity strength FCS and seed-based functional connectivity to identify brain regions with group-change functional connectivity. Furthermore the connectome properties of the identified regions and their associations with creativity were investigated using the permutation test discriminative analysis and brain-behavior correlation analysis. The results indicated that there were 4 regions with group differences in FCS and these regions were linked to 30 other regions demonstrating different functional connectivity between the groups. Together these regions form a creativity-related network and we observed higher network efficiency in the HG compared with the LG. The regions involved in the creativity network were widely distributed across the modality-specific/supramodality cerebral cortex subcortex and cerebellum. Notably properties of regions in the supramodality networks i.e. the default mode network and attention network carried creativity-level discriminative information and were significantly correlated with the creativity performance. Together these findings demonstrate a link between intrinsic brain connectivity and creative ability which should provide new insights into the neural basis of creativity.
