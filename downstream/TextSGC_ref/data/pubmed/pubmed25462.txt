Neural engineering provides promise for cell therapy by integrating the host brain with brain-machine-interface technologies in order to externally modulate functions. Long-term interfaces with the host brain remain a critical challenge due to insufficient graft cell survivability and loss of brain electrode sensitivity over time. Here integrated neuron-electrode interfaces were developed on thin flexible and transparent silk films as brain implants. Mechanical properties and surface topography of silk films were optimized to promote cell survival and alignment of primary rat cortical cells. Compartmentalized cultures of living neural circuit and co-patterned electrode arrays were incorporated on the silk films with built-in wire connections. Electrical stimulation via electrodes embedded in the films activated surrounding neurons evoked calcium responses. In mice brains the silk film implants showed conformal contact capable of modulating host brain cells with minimal inflammatory response and stable indwelling for weeks. The approach of combining cell therapy and brain electrodes could provide sustained functional brain-machine interfaces with ex vivo control of neuron-electrode interface with spatial and temporal precision.
