Functional Electrical Stimulation FES can electrically activate paretic muscles to assist movement for post-stroke neurorehabilitation. Here sensory-motor integration may be facilitated by triggering FES with residual electromyographic EMG activity. However muscle activity following stroke often suffers from delays in initiation and termination which may be alleviated with an adjuvant treatment at the central nervous system CNS level with transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS thereby facilitating re-learning and retaining of normative muscle activation patterns. Facilitating myoelectric-control with transcranial direct current stimulation: a preliminary study in healthy humans.
