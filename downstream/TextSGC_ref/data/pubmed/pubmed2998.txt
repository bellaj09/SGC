Characterization of and evaluation of strategies to mitigate the effects of sub-concussive impacts SCI on brain structure and function are crucial to understand potential long-term neurological risks associated with sports participation. In this study we applied a graph theoretical framework to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging DTI data to evaluate the efficacy of a jugular vein compression collar for preserving functional and structural measures of brain network organization in a cohort of female high school soccer players throughout a season of competitive play. Athletes were assigned to a collar N = 72 or non-collar N = 56 group before engaging in a season of play during which head impact data were recorded via accelerometer for every practice and competition. Participants completed neuroimaging sessions before and following the season. Non-collar-wearing athletes exhibited significantly increased rs-fMRI-derived global clustering coefficients p = 0.032 and DTI-derived modularity p = 0.042 compared to collar-wearing athletes. No longitudinal changes in any graph measures were observed for the collar group p > 0.05. The observed increase in graph measures in the non-collar group is congruent with previous studies of SCI and is similar to graph theoretical studies of traumatic brain injury. The absence of alterations in graph metrics in the collar group indicates a potential ameliorating effect of the collar device against network reorganization in line with previous literature. Internal jugular vein compression applied during competitive female soccer season preserves functional and structural connectome organization.
