International experience with COVID-19 suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based\xa0aerosol\xa0risk assessment. Endonasal instrumentation and aerosolization risk in the era of COVID-19: simulation literature review and proposed mitigation strategies.
