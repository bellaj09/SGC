Males in many non-monogamous species have larger ranges than females do a sex difference that has been well documented for decades and seems to be an aspect of male mating competition. Until recently parallel data for humans have been mostly anecdotal and qualitative but this is now changing as human behavioral ecologists turn their attention to matters of individual mobility. Sex differences in spatial cognition were among the first accepted psychological sex differences and like differences in ranging behavior are documented for a growing set of species. This special issue is dedicated to exploring the possible adaptive links between these cognitive and ranging traits. Multiple hypotheses at various levels of analysis are considered. At the functional ultimate level a mating-competition hypothesis suggests that range expansion may augment mating opportunities and a fertility-and-parental-care hypothesis suggests that range contraction may facilitate offspring provisioning. At a more mechanistic proximate level differences in cue availability may support or inhibit particular sex-specific navigation strategies and spatial anxiety may usefully inhibit travel that would not justify its costs. Studies in four different cultures-Twe Tsimane Yucatec Maya and Faroese-as well as an experimental study using virtual reality tools are the venue for testing these hypotheses. Our hope is to stimulate more research on the evolutionary and developmental processes responsible for this suite of linked behavioral and cognitive traits. Why Go There?
