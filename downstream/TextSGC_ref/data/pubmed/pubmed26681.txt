The event-related potentials technique is widely used in cognitive neuroscience research. The P300 waveform has been explored in many research articles because of its wide applications such as lie detection or brain-computer interfaces BCI. However very few datasets are publicly available. Therefore most researchers use only their private datasets for their analysis. This leads to minimally comparable results particularly in brain-computer research interfaces. Here we present electroencephalography/event-related potentials EEG/ERP data. The data were obtained from 20 healthy subjects and was acquired using an odd-ball hardware stimulator. The visual stimulation was based on a three-stimulus paradigm and included target non-target and distracter stimuli. The data and collected metadata are shared in the EEG/ERP Portal.
