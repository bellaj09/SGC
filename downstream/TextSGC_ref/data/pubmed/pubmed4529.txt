Impairments of social cognition are well documented in patients with schizophrenia SCZ but the neural basis remains poorly understood. In light of evidence that suggests that the "mirror neuron system" MNS and the "mentalizing network" MENT are key substrates of intersubjectivity and joint action it has been suggested that dysfunction of these neural networks may underlie social difficulties in SCZ patients. Additionally MNS and MENT might be associated differently with positive vs negative symptoms given prior social cognitive and symptom associations. We assessed resting state functional connectivity RSFC in meta-analytically defined MNS and MENT networks in this patient group. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans were obtained from 116 patients and 133 age- gender- and movement-matched healthy controls HC at 5 different MRI sites. Network connectivity was analyzed for group differences and correlations with clinical symptoms. Results demonstrated decreased connectivity within the MNS and also the MENT in patients compared to controls. Notably dysconnectivity of the MNS was related to symptom severity while no such relationship was observed for the MENT. In sum these findings demonstrate that differential patterns of dysconnectivity exist in SCZ patients which may contribute differently to the interpersonal difficulties commonly observed in the disorder.
