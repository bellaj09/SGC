Most event-related potential ERP-based brain-computer interface BCI spellers primarily use matrix layouts and generally require moderate eye movement for successful operation. The fundamental objective of this paper is to enhance the perceptibility of target characters by introducing motion stimuli to classical rapid serial visual presentation RSVP spellers that do not require any eye movement thereby applying them to paralyzed patients with oculomotor dysfunctions. To test the feasibility of the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm we implemented three RSVP spellers: 1 fixed-direction motion FM-RSVP; 2 random-direction motion RM-RSVP; and 3 the conventional non-motion stimulation NM-RSVP and evaluated the effect of the three different stimulation methods on spelling performance. The two motion-based stimulation methods FM- and RM-RSVP showed shorter P300 latency and higher P300 amplitudes i.e. 360.4-379.6 ms; 5.5867-  than the NM-RSVP i.e. 480.4 ms; . This led to higher and more stable performances for FM- and RM-RSVP spellers than NM-RSVP speller i.e. 79.066.45% for NM-RSVP 90.602.98% for RM-RSVP and 92.742.55% for FM-RSVP. In particular the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm was significantly beneficial for about half of the subjects who might not accurately perceive rapidly presented static stimuli. These results indicate that the use of proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm is more beneficial for target recognition when developing BCI applications for severely paralyzed patients with complex ocular dysfunctions.
