Muscular artifacts often contaminate electroencephalograms EEGs and deteriorate the performance of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Although many artifact reduction techniques are available most of the studies have focused on their reduction ability i.e. reconstruction errors and it has been missing to evaluate their effect on the performance of BCIs. This study aims at evaluating the performance of a state-of-the-art muscular artifact reduction technique on a scenario of a steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPsbased BCI. The performance was evaluated based on a semisimulation setting using a benchmark dataset of SSVEPs artificially contaminated by muscular artifacts acquired from the trapezius. Our results showed that combining the artifact reduction method and the classification algorithm based on the task-related component analysis gained improved classification accuracy. Interestingly the artifact reduction setting minimizing the reconstruction errors i.e. elaborately recovering the true EEG waveforms was inconsistent to the one maximizing the classification performance. The results suggest that artifact reduction methods should be tuned so as to tomaximize performance of BCIs.
