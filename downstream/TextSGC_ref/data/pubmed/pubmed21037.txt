Recent technological innovations have created new opportunities for the increased adoption of virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR applications in medicine. While medical applications of VR have historically seen greater adoption from patient-as-user applications the new era of VR/AR technology has created the conditions for wider adoption of clinician-as-user applications. Historically adoption to clinical use has been limited in part by the ability of the technology to achieve a sufficient quality of experience. This article reviews the definitions of virtual and augmented reality and briefly covers the history of their development. Currently available options for consumer-level virtual and augmented reality systems are presented along with a discussion of technical considerations for their adoption in the clinical environment. Finally a brief review of the literature of medical VR/AR applications is presented prior to introducing a comprehensive conceptual framework for the viewing and manipulation of medical images in virtual and augmented reality. Using this framework we outline considerations for placing these methods directly into a radiology-based workflow and show how it can be applied to a variety of clinical scenarios. Applying Modern Virtual and Augmented Reality Technologies to Medical Images and Models.
