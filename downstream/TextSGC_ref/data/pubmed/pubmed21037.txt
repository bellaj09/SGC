The 3-dimensionally complex interplay of soft tissue cartilaginous and bony elements makes the mastery of nasal anatomy difficult. Conventional methods of learning nasal anatomy exist but they often involve a steep learning curve. Computerized models and virtual reality applications have been used to facilitate teaching in a number of other complex anatomical regions such as the human temporal bone and pelvic floor. We present a 3-dimensional 3-D virtual reality model of the human nose. The virtual nose: a 3-dimensional virtual reality model of the human nose.
