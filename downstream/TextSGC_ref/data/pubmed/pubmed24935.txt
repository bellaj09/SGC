Event-related desynchronization ERD of the electroencephalogram EEG from the motor cortex is associated with execution observation and mental imagery of motor tasks. Generation of ERD by motor imagery MI has been widely used for brain-computer interfaces BCIs linked to neuroprosthetics and other motor assistance devices. Control of MI-based BCIs can be acquired by neurofeedback training to reliably induce MI-associated ERD. To develop more effective training conditions we investigated the effect of static and dynamic visual representations of target movements a picture of forearms or a video clip of hand grasping movements during the BCI neurofeedback training. After 4 consecutive training days the group that performed MI while viewing the video showed significant improvement in generating MI-associated ERD compared with the group that viewed the static image. This result suggests that passively observing the target movement during MI would improve the associated mental imagery and enhance MI-based BCIs skills.
