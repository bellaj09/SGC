The three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography 3D DSA technique is the current standard and is based on both mask and fill runs to enable the subtraction technique. Artificial intelligence AI-based 3D angiography 3DA was developed to reduce radiation dosage because only one contrast-enhanced run of the Carm system is required for reconstruction of DSA-like 3D volumes. The aim was the evaluation of this algorithm regarding its diagnostic information. Evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence-Based 3D-Angiography for Visualization of Cerebral Vasculature.
