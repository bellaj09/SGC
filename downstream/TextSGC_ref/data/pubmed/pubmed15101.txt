The density map is widely used for data sampling time-varying detection ensemble representation etc. The visualization of dynamic evolution is a challenging task when exploring spatiotemporal data. Many approaches have been provided to explore the variation of data patterns over time which commonly need multiple parameters and preprocessing works. Image generation is a well-known topic in deep learning and a variety of generating models have been promoted in recent years. In this paper we introduce a general pipeline called GenerativeMap to extract dynamics of density maps by generating interpolation information. First a trained generative model comprises an important part of our approach which can generate nonlinear and natural results by implementing a few parameters. Second a visual presentation is proposed to show the density change which is combined with the level of detail and blue noise sampling for a better visual effect. Third for dynamic visualization of large-scale density maps we extend this approach to show the evolution in regions of interest which costs less to overcome the drawback of the learning-based generative model. We demonstrate our method on different types of cases and we evaluate and compare the approach from multiple aspects. The results help identify the effectiveness of our approach and confirm its applicability in different scenarios.
