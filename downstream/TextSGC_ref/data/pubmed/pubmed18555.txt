In urology technologies and surgical practices are constantly evolving and virtual reality VR simulation has become a significant supplement to existing urology methods in the training curricula of urologists. However new developments in urology also require training and simulation for a wider application. In order to achieve this VR and simulation could play a central role. The purpose of this article is a review of the principal applications for VR and simulation in the field of urology education and to demonstrate the potential for the propagation of new progressive treatments. Two different cases are presented as examples: exposure therapy for paruresis and virtual cystoscopy for diagnosis and surgery of bladder cancer. The article uses research and publications listed in openly accessible directories and is organized into 3 sections: The first section covers features of VR and simulation technologies. The second one presents confirmed applications of current technologies in urology education and showcases example future applications in the domain of bladder treatment and surgery. The final section discusses the potential of the technology to improve health care quality. Virtual Reality and Simulation for Progressive Treatments in Urology.
