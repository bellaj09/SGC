A hybrid 16-channel current-mode and the 8-channel optical implantable neurostimulating system is presented. The system generates arbitrary-waveform charge-balanced current-mode electrical pulses with an amplitude ranging from 50 Formula: see text to 10 mA. An impedance monitoring feedback loop is employed to automatically adjust the supply voltage yielding a load-optimized power dissipation. The 8-channel optical stimulator drives an array of LEDs each with a maximum of 25 mA current amplitude and reuses the arbitrary-waveform generation function of the electrical stimulator. The LEDs are assembled within a custom-made 44 ECoG grid electrode array enabling precise optical stimulation of neurons with a 300 Formula: see text pitch between the LEDs and simultaneous monitoring of the neural response by the ECoG electrode at different distances of the stimulation site. The hybrid stimulation system is implemented on a mini-PCB and receives power and stimulation commands inductively through a second board and a coil stacked on top of it. The entire system is sized at 32 . 51 cm3 and weighs 7 grams. The system efficacy for electrical and optical stimulation is validated in-vivo using separate chronic and acute experiments.
