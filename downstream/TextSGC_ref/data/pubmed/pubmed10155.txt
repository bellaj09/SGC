The treatment planning process for patients with head and neck H&N cancer is regarded as one of the most complicated due to large target volume multiple prescription dose levels and many radiation-sensitive critical structures near the target. Treatment planning for this site requires a high level of human expertise and a tremendous amount of effort to produce personalized high quality plans taking as long as a week which deteriorates the chances of tumor control and patient survival. To solve this problem we propose to investigate a deep learning-based dose prediction model Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net based on two highly popular network architectures: U-net and DenseNet. We find that this new architecture is able to accurately and efficiently predict the dose distribution outperforming the other two models the Standard U-net and DenseNet in homogeneity dose conformity and dose coverage on the test data. Averaging across all organs at risk our proposed model is capable of predicting the organ-at-risk max dose within 6.3% and mean dose within 5.1% of the prescription dose on the test data. The other models the Standard U-net and DenseNet performed worse having an averaged organ-at-risk max dose prediction error of 8.2% and 9.3% respectively and averaged mean dose prediction error of 6.4% and 6.8% respectively. In addition our proposed model used 12 times less trainable parameters than the Standard U-net and predicted the patient dose 4 times faster than DenseNet. 3D radiotherapy dose prediction on head and neck cancer patients with a hierarchically densely connected U-net deep learning architecture.
