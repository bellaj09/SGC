This paper presents a deep-learning DL based approach to the design of multi-colored visible light communication VLC systems where RGB light-emitting diode LED lamps accomplish multi-dimensional color modulation under color and illuminance requirements. It is aimed to identify a pair of multi-color modulation transmitter and receiver leading to efficient symbol recovery performance. To this end an autoencoder AE an unsupervised deep learning technique is adopted to train the end-to-end symbol recovery process that includes the VLC transceiver pair and a channel layer characterizing the optical channel along with additional LED intensity control features. As a result the VLC transmitter and receiver are jointly designed and optimized. Intensive numerical results demonstrate that the learned VLC system outperforms existing techniques in terms of the average symbol error probability. This framework sheds light on the viability of DL techniques in the optical communication system design. Deep learning based transceiver design for multi-colored VLC systems.
