Protein-protein interactions PPIs play important roles in many biological processes. Conventional biological experiments for identifying PPI sites are costly and time-consuming. Thus many computational approaches have been proposed to predict PPI sites. Existing computational methods usually use local contextual features to predict PPI sites. Actually global features of protein sequences are critical for PPI site prediction. Protein-protein interaction site prediction through combining local and global features with deep neural networks.
