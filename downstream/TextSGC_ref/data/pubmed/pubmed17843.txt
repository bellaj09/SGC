The present study examined whether a culture-based virtual reality VR training program is feasible and tolerable for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI and whether it could improve cognitive function in these patients. Twenty-one outpatients with aMCI were randomized to either the VR-based training group or the control group in a 11 ratio. The VR-based training group participated in training for 30 min/day two days/week for three months 24 times. The VR-based program was designed based on Korean traditional culture and used attention processing speed executive function and memory conditions to stimulate cognitive function. The adherence to the culture-based VR training program was 91.55%  6.41% in the VR group. The only adverse events observed in the VR group were dizziness 4.2% and fatigue 8.3%. Analysis revealed that the VR-based training group exhibited no significant differences following the three-month VR program in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination K-MMSE scores working memory functions such as performance on the digit span test or in Stroop test performance and word fluency. We conclude that although the 12-week culture-based VR training program did not improve cognitive function our findings revealed that the culture-based VR training program was feasible and tolerable for participants with aMCI.
