Recent works have shown that hyper-networks derived from blood-oxygen-level-dependent BOLD fMRI where an edge called hyper-edge can be connected to more than two nodes are effective biomarkers for MCI classification. Although BOLD fMRI is a high temporal resolution fMRI approach to assess alterations in brain networks it cannot pinpoint to a single correlation of neuronal activity since BOLD signals are composite. In contrast arterial spin labeling ASL is a lower temporal resolution fMRI technique for measuring cerebral blood flow CBF that can provide quantitative direct brain network physiology measurements. This paper proposes a novel sparse regression algorithm for inference of the integrated hyper-connectivity networks from BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI. Specifically a least absolution shrinkage and selection operator LASSO algorithm which is constrained by the functional connectivity derived from ASL fMRI is employed to estimate hyper-connectivity for characterizing BOLD-fMRI-based functional interaction among multiple regions. An ASL-derived functional connectivity is constructed by using an Ultra-GroupLASSO-UOLS algorithm where the combination of ultra-least squares ULS criterion with a group LASSO GroupLASSO algorithm is applied to detect the topology of ASL-based functional connectivity networks and then an ultra-orthogonal least squares UOLS algorithm is used to estimate the connectivity strength. By combining the complementary characterization conveyed by rs-fMRI and ASL fMRI our multimodal hyper-networks demonstrated much better discriminative characteristics than either the conventional pairwise connectivity networks or the unimodal hyper-connectivity networks. Experimental results on publicly available ADNI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing single modality based sparse functional connectivity inference methods.
