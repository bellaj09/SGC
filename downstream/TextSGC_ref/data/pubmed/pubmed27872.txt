"Today the brain-computer interface BCI community lacks a standard method to evaluate an online BCIs performance. Even the most commonly used metric the information transfer rate ITR is often reported differently even incorrectly in many papers which is not conducive to BCI research. This paper aims to point out many of the existing problems and give some suggestions and methods to overcome these problems." A study of the existing problems of estimating the information transfer rate in online brain-computer interfaces.
