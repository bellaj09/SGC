The extended amygdala has been implicated as a critical region in the neurocircuitry underlying anxiety. The circuitry of the extended amygdala including the central CeA and basolateral BLA nuclei of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BNST has been well defined in nonhuman animals; however much less is known about the roles and interactions of these structures in humans given their small size. Therefore this study used high-resolution 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to define compare and contrast functional connectivity FC of these structures in 57 neurologically healthy young adults. In addition FC was investigated in relation to self-reported measures of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty a key feature of anxiety. Results of the FC analysis of each of the nuclei largely replicated previous work. Conjunction analyses showed that nuclei of the extended amygdala shared FC with hippocampal cingulate medial prefrontal and subgenual cortices. Comparison of seed-to-voxel time series correlation maps demonstrated that compared with the BNST the CeA and BLA were more strongly coupled with parahippocampal temporal fusiform and occipital gyri. Relative to the CeA and BLA the BNST was more strongly coupled with the anterior caudate and anterior cingulate cortex. Finally trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were not robustly related to FC of the extended amygdala at rest. Results of this study extend previous work to provide more clarity of the nuances of extended amygdala resting FC and its relationship with anxiety.
