Recent evidence suggests that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD is associated with a range of brain functional connectivity abnormalities with one of the most prominent being reduced inhibition of the default mode network DMN while performing a cognitive task. In this study we examine the effects of a methylphenidate dose on brain functional connectivity in boys diagnosed with ADHD while they performed a cognitive task. Dopaminergic modulation of default mode network brain functional connectivity in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
