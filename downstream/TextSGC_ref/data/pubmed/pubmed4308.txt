Blast mild traumatic brain injury mTBI is a leading cause of sustained impairment in military service members and veterans. However the mechanism of persistent disability is not fully understood. The present study investigated disturbances in brain functioning in mTBI participants using a source-imaging-based approach to analyze functional connectivity FC from resting-state magnetoencephalography rs-MEG. Study participants included 26 active-duty service members or veterans who had blast mTBI with persistent post-concussive symptoms and 22 healthy control active-duty service members or veterans. The source time courses from regions of interest ROIs were used to compute ROI to whole-brain ROI-global FC for different frequency bands using two different measures: 1 time-lagged cross-correlation and 2 phase-lock synchrony. Compared with the controls blast mTBI participants showed increased ROI-global FC in beta gamma and low-frequency bands but not in the alpha band. Sources of abnormally increased FC included the: 1 prefrontal cortex right ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmPFC right rostral anterior cingulate cortex rACC and left ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 2 medial temporal lobe bilateral parahippocampus hippocampus and amygdala; and 3 right putamen and cerebellum. In contrast the blast mTBI group also showed decreased FC of the right frontal pole. Group differences were highly consistent across the two different FC measures. FC of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex correlated with executive functioning and processing speed in mTBI participants. Altogether our findings of increased and decreased regionalpatterns of FC suggest that disturbances in intrinsic brain connectivity may be the result of multiple mechanisms and are associated with cognitive sequelae of the injury.
