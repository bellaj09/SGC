Augmented reality AR has great potential for improving image-guided neurosurgical procedures but until recently hardware was mostly custom-made and difficult to distribute. Currently commercially available low-cost AR devices offer great potential for neurosurgery but reports on technical feasibility are lacking. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a low-cost commercially available head-mounted holographic AR device the Microsoft Hololens in the operating room. The Hololens is operated by performing specific hand gestures which are recognized by the built-in camera of the device. This would allow the neurosurgeon to control the device "touch free" even while wearing a sterile surgical outfit. Feasibility of using a low-cost head-mounted augmented reality device in the operating room.
