"Deep brain stimulation DBS is a well-established treatment for essential tremor but may not be an optimal therapy as it is always on regardless of symptoms. A closed-loop CL DBS which uses a biosignal to determine when stimulation should be given may be better. Cortical activity is a promising biosignal for use in a closed-loop system because it contains features that are correlated with pathological and normal movements. However neural signals are different across individuals making it difficult to create a one size fits all closed-loop system."
