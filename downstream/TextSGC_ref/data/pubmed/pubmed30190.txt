Loss of stability is a precursor to falling and therefore represents a leading cause of injury especially in fragile people. Thus dynamic stability during activities of daily living ADLs needs to be considered to assess balance control and fall risk. The dynamic margin of stability MOS is often used as an indicator of how the body center of mass is located and moves relative to the base of support. In this work we propose a magneto-inertial measurement unit MIMU-based method to assess the MOS of a gait. Six young healthy subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at different velocities while wearing MIMUs on their lower limbs and pelvis. We then assessed the MOS by computing the lower body displacement with respect to the leading inverse kinematics approach. The results were compared with those obtained using a camera-based system in terms of root mean square deviation RMSD and correlation coefficient . We obtained a RMSD of 1.80 cm and   0.85 for each walking velocity. The findings revealed that our method is comparable to camera-based systems in terms of accuracy suggesting that it may represent a strategy to assess stability during ADLs in unstructured environments.
