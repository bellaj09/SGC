Language processing relies on a widespread network of brain regions. Univariate post-stroke lesion-behavior mapping is a particularly potent method to study brain-language relationships. However it is a concern that this method may overlook structural disconnections to seemingly spared regions and may fail to adjudicate between regions that subserve different processes but share the same vascular perfusion bed. For these reasons more refined structural brain mapping techniques may improve the accuracy of detecting brain networks supporting language. In this study we applied a predictive multivariate framework to investigate the relationship between language deficits in human participants with chronic aphasia and the topological distribution of structural brain damage defined as post-stroke necrosis or cortical disconnection. We analyzed lesion maps as well as structural connectome measures of whole-brain neural network integrity to predict clinically applicable language scores from the Western Aphasia Battery WAB. Out-of-sample prediction accuracy was comparable for both types of analyses which revealed spatially distinct albeit overlapping networks of cortical regions implicated in specific aspects of speech functioning. Importantly all WAB scores could be predicted at better-than-chance level from the connections between gray-matter regions spared by the lesion. Connectome-based analysis highlighted the role of connectivity of the temporoparietal junction as a multimodal area crucial for language tasks. Our results support that connectome-based approaches are an important complement to necrotic lesion-based approaches and should be used in combination with lesion mapping to fully elucidate whether structurally damaged or structurally disconnected regions relate to aphasic impairment and its recovery.
