Cranial radiotherapy CRT is an important part of brain tumor treatment and although highly effective survivors suffer from long-term cognitive side effects. In this study we aim to establish late-term imaging markers of CRT-induced brain injury and identify functional markers indicative of cognitive performance. Specifically we aim to identify changes in executive function brain metabolism and neuronal organization. A comprehensive preclinical assessment of late-term imaging markers of radiation-induced brain injury.
