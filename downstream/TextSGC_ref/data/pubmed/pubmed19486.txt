Generally novices are taught fiberoptic intubation on patients by attending anesthesiologists; however this approach raises patient safety concerns. Patient safety should improve if novice learners are trained for basic skills on simulators. In this educational study we assessed the time and number of attempts required to train novices in fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation on simulators. Because decay in skills is inevitable we also assessed fiberoptic bronchoscopy and fiberoptic intubation skill decay and the amount of effort required to regain fiberoptic bronchoscopy skill. Teaching basic fiberoptic intubation skills in a simulator: initial learning and skills decay.
