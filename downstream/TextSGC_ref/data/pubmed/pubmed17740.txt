Radiative communication using electro-magnetic EM fields amongst the wearable and implantable devices act as the backbone for information exchange around a human body thereby enabling prime applications in the fields of connected healthcare electroceuticals neuroscience augmented and virtual reality. However owing to such radiative nature of the traditional wireless communication EM signals propagate in all directions inadvertently allowing an eavesdropper to intercept the information. In this context the human body primarily due to its high water content has emerged as a medium for low-loss transmission termed human body communication HBC enabling energy-efficient means for wearable communication. However conventional HBC implementations suffer from significant radiation which also compromises security. In this article we present Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication EQS-HBC a method for localizing signals within the body using low-frequency carrier-less broadband transmission thereby making it extremely difficult for a nearby eavesdropper to intercept critical private data thus producing a covert communication channel i.e. the human body. This work for the first time demonstrates and analyzes the improvement in private space enabled by EQS-HBC. Detailed experiments supported by theoretical modeling and analysis reveal that the quasi-static QS leakage due to the on-body EQS-HBC transmitter-human body interface is detectable up to <0.15\u2009m whereas the human body alone leaks only up to ~0.01\u2009m compared to >5\u2009m detection range for on-body EM wireless communication highlighting the underlying advantage of EQS-HBC to enable covert communication.
