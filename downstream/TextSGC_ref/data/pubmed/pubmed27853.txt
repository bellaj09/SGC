In humans significant progress has been made to link spatial changes in electroencephalographic EEG spectral density connectivity strength and phase-amplitude modulation to neurological physiological and psychological correlates. In contrast standard rodent EEG techniques employ only few electrodes which results in poor spatial resolution. Recently a technique was developed to overcome this limitation in mice. This technique was based on a polyimide-based microelectrode PBM array applied on the mouse skull maintaining a significant number of electrodes with consistent contact electrode impedance and mechanical stability. The present study built on this technique by extending it to rats. Therefore a similar PBM array but adapted to rats was designed and fabricated. In addition this array was connected to a wireless EEG headstage allowing recording in untethered freely moving rats. The advantage of a high-density array relies on the assumption that the signal recorded from the different electrodes is generated from distinct sources i.e. not volume-conducted. Therefore the utility and validity of the array were evaluated by determining the level of synchrony between channels due to true synchrony or volume conduction during basal vigilance states and following a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Although the PBM array allowed recording with high signal quality under both drug and drug-free conditions high synchronization existed due to volume conduction between the electrodes even in the higher spectral frequency range. Discrimination existed only between frontally and centrally/distally grouped electrode pairs. Therefore caution should be used in interpreting spatial data obtained from high-density PBM arrays in rodents. Precaution for volume conduction in rodent cortical electroencephalography using high-density polyimide-based microelectrode arrays on the skull.
