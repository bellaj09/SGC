The vast majority of polymorphisms for human dermatologic diseases fall in noncoding DNA regions leading to difficulty interpreting their functional significance. Recent work using chromosome conformation capture technology in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP has provided a systematic means of linking noncoding variants in active enhancer loci to putative gene targets. Here we apply H3K27ac HiChIP high-resolution contact maps generated from primary human T-cell subsets CD4+ nave T helper type 17 and regulatory T cells to 21 dermatologic conditions associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms from 106 genome-wide association studies. This "enhancer connectome" identified 1492 HiChIP gene targets from 542 noncoding SNPs P  5.0\xa0 10-8. SNP-containing enhancers from inflammatory skin conditions were significantly enriched at the HLA locus and also targeted several key factors from the JAK-STAT signaling pathway but nonimmune conditions were not. A focused profiling of systemic lupus erythematosus HiChIP genes identified enhancer interactions with factors important for effector CD4+ T-cell differentiation and function including IRF8 and members of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger proteins. Our results show the ability of the enhancer connectome to nominate functionally relevant candidates from genome-wide association study-identified variants representing a powerful tool to guide future studies into the genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying dermatologic diseases.
