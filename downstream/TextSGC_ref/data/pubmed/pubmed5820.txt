Bariatric surgery is an effective method to rapidly induce weight loss in severely obese people however its impact on brain functional connectivity after longer periods of follow-up is yet to be assessed. We investigated changes in connectivity in 16 severely obese women one month before one month after and one year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery RYGB. 12 lean controls were also enrolled. Resting-state fMRI was acquired for all participants following an overnight fast and after a 260\u2009kcal load. Connectivity between regions involved in food-related saliency attribution and reward-driven eating behavior was stronger in presurgery patients compared to controls but progressively weakened after follow-up. At one year changes in networks related to cognitive control over eating and bodily perception also occurred. Connectivity between regions involved in emotional control and social cognition had a temporary reduction early after treatment but had increased again after one year of follow-up. Furthermore we could predict the BMI loss by presurgery connectivity in areas linked to emotional control and social interaction. RYGBP seems to reshape brain functional connectivity early affecting cognitive control over eating and these changes could be an important part of the therapeutic effect of bariatric surgery.
