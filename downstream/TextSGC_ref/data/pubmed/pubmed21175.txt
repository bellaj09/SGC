The Leonardo da Vinci training programme supports innovative transnational initiatives for promoting the knowledge aptitudes and skills necessary for successful integration into working life. Biomedical engineering is an emerging interdisciplinary field that contributes to understand define and solve problems in biomedical technology within industrial and health service contexts. Paper presents a Leonardo da Vinci pilot-project called Web-based learning and training in the field of biomedical and design engineering WEBD. This project has started on 2001. The WEBD project proposes to use advanced learning technologies to provide education in the www. Project uses interactive 3D graphics and virtual reality tools. The WEBD distance training permits users to experience and interact with a life-like model or environment in safety and at convenient times while providing a degree of control over the simulation that is usually not possible in the real-life situation. Distance learning using internet in the field of bioengineering.
