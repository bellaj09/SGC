A new integrated computer system the 3-dimensional 3D virtual reality surgical planning and simulation workbench for orthognathic surgery VRSP is presented. Five major functions are implemented in this system: post-processing and reconstruction of computed tomographic CT data transformation of 3D unique coordinate system geometry generation of 3D color facial soft tissue models virtual surgical planning and simulation and presurgical prediction of soft tissue changes. The basic mensuration functions such as linear and spatial measurements are also included. The surgical planning and simulation are based on 3D CT reconstructions whereas soft tissue prediction is based on an individualized texture-mapped color facial soft tissue model. The surgeon "enters" the virtual operatory with virtual reality equipment "holds" a virtual scalpel and "operates" on a virtual patient to accomplish actual surgical planning simulation of the surgical procedure and prediction of soft tissue changes before surgery. As a final result a quantitative osteotomy-simulated bone model and predicted color facial model with photorealistic quality can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point in a personal computer system. This system can be installed in any hospital for daily use. Three-dimensional virtual reality surgical planning and simulation workbench for orthognathic surgery.
