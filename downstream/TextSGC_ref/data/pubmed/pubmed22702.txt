"Stroke patients usually suffer from asymmetric posture due to hemi-paresis that can result in reduced postural controllability leading to a balance deficit. This deficit increases the risk of falls which often makes them dependent on caregivers for community ambulation thus deteriorating their quality of life. Conventional balance training involves rehabilitation exercises performed under physiotherapists supervision where the scarcity of trained professionals as well as the cost of clinic-based rehabilitation programs can deter stroke survivors from undergoing regular balance training. Thus researchers have been exploring technology-assisted solutions e.g. home-based virtual reality VR setup. In this paper we developed a VR-based balance training VBaT platform where VR-augmented user-interface using Nintendo Wii balance boardwas tested in a laboratory setting for its feasibility. The VBaT offered tasks of varying difficulties to the participants that adapted to individual performance capability during balance training. We performed a preliminaryusability study with 7 stroke survivors post-stroke period > 6 months. Preliminary results indicate the potential of theVBaT system to cause improvement in overall average task performance over the course of training while using the VBaT. Thus the VBaT system is proposed to be a step toward an effective balance training platform for people with balance disorder."
