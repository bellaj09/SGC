Breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The mainstay of breast cancer workup is histopathological diagnosis - which guides therapy and prognosis. However emerging knowledge about the complex nature of cancer and the availability of tailored therapies have exposed opportunities for improvements in diagnostic precision. In parallel advances in artificial intelligence AI along with the growing digitization of pathology slides for the primary diagnosis are a promising approach to meet the demand for more accurate detection classification and prediction of behaviour of breast tumours. In this article we cover the current and prospective uses of AI in digital pathology for breast cancer review the basics of digital pathology and AI and outline outstanding challenges in the field. Artificial intelligence in digital breast pathology: Techniques and applications.
